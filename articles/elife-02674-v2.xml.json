We report the structure of tetrameric HMPV M2-1. Each protomer features a N-terminal zinc finger domain and an \u03b1-helical tetramerization motif forming a rigid unit, followed by a flexible linker and an \u03b1-helical core domain. The tetramer is asymmetric, three of the protomers exhibiting a closed conformation, and one an open conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations and SAXS demonstrate a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations in solution. Structures of adenosine monophosphate- and DNA- bound M2-1 establish the role of the zinc finger domain in base-specific recognition of RNA. Binding to \u2018gene end\u2019 RNA sequences stabilized the closed conformation of M2-1 leading to a drastic shift in the conformational landscape of M2-1. We propose a model for recognition of gene end signals and discuss the implications of these findings for transcriptional regulation in pneumoviruses."

We report the structure of tetrameric HMPV M2-1. Each protomer features a N-terminal zinc finger domain and an \u03b1-helical tetramerization motif forming a rigid unit, followed by a flexible linker and an \u03b1-helical core domain. The tetramer is asymmetric, three of the protomers exhibiting a closed conformation, and one an open conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations and SAXS demonstrate a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations in solution. Structures of adenosine monophosphate- and DNA- bound M2-1 establish the role of the zinc finger domain in base-specific recognition of RNA. Binding to \u2018gene end\u2019 RNA sequences stabilized the closed conformation of M2-1 leading to a drastic shift in the conformational landscape of M2-1. We propose a model for recognition of gene end signals and discuss the implications of these findings for transcriptional regulation in pneumoviruses."

In general, the enzyme building the RNA molecule stops building when it reaches the end of a gene and encounters a termination signal. When a virus replicates, however, it needs to transcribe all the genes in its genome, so it relies on antiterminator proteins to make the enzyme building the RNA ignore the termination signal. Therefore, medicines that stop antiterminators working could stop viral infections spreading."

HMPV and the closely-related respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) constitute respectively the <i>Metapneumovirus</i> and <i>Pneumovirus</i> genera of the <i>Pneumivirinae</i> subfamily. These viruses share conserved replication strategies and similar genome organizations with other members of the <i>Mononegavirales</i> order, which includes numerous important human pathogens such as measles, rabies, and Ebola virus. The HMPV genome encodes nine proteins, three of which are necessary and sufficient for viral replication, namely the nucleoprotein (N), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and its essential cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P). The genomic RNA is encapsidated by the N protein, which acts as a template for the L protein that is responsible for both replication and transcription. The replicase is highly processive, and generates a complete, encapsidated positive-sense antigenome, which is in turn used as a template for the synthesis of genomic RNA. The transcriptase produces capped and polyadenylated monocistronic mRNAs using a sequential stop and restart mechanism in which the polymerase responds to <i>cis</i>-acting signals located in intergenic regions (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sutherland et al., 2001</a>)."

The closely-related M2-1 protein from avian metapneumovirus, which shares 85% sequence identity with HMPV M2-1, has been shown to increase minigenome expression by at least 100-fold (<a href=\"#bib42\">Naylor et al., 2004</a>). These observations are in contrast with studies of RSV M2-1, which was shown to be absolutely essential for transcription of full-length viral mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Collins et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fearns and Collins, 1999</a>). M2-1 proteins from HMPV and RSV are amongst the most conserved within the <i>Pneumivirinae</i> and share 38% overall sequence identity, suggesting similar functional roles. In addition, M2-1 shares structural and functional similarity with Ebola virus VP30 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blondot et al., 2012</a>). Recently, the crystal structure of RSV M2-1 has been solved by X-ray crystallography, revealing a tight, disk-like tetrameric assembly (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>), which contrasts with previous solution studies that suggested a non-globular, extended tetramer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Esperante et al., 2011</a>)."

The recruitment of M2-1 occurs through an interaction with the M2-1 core domain (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tran et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Blondot et al., 2012</a>), resulting in the formation of a high-affinity, non-globular complex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Esperante et al., 2012</a>), which in RSV is controlled by phosphorylation of Thr108 of the P protein (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asenjo et al., 2006</a>). Studies on RSV have shown that M2-1 functions as both an intragenic and intergenic transcription antitermination factor in <i>Pneumoviruses</i>, allowing synthesis of complete viral mRNAs and inhibiting transcription termination at the GE signal with various efficiencies, resulting in an increased proportion of polycistronic read-through mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hardy and Wertz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hardy et al., 1999</a>). Interestingly, NMR studies have shown that the RSV M2-1 core domain preferentially recognizes poly-A tails of viral mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blondot et al., 2012</a>), and this property has been confirmed with full-length protein using fluorescence anisotropy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>). On the basis of this data, it has been suggested that M2-1 likely binds nascent mRNA transcripts, thus preventing premature termination through stabilization of the transcription complex and inhibition of RNA secondary structure formation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blondot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>).

Solution small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and atomistic coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that M2-1 behaves as a dynamic, modular protein in equilibrium between open and closed forms. Crystallographic studies of M2-1 bound to nucleic acids reveal how the M2-1 zinc finger specifically recognizes RNA. Finally, SAXS and electron microscopy showed that interaction with GE signals induces the closed conformation of M2-1, a process which is coupled with concentration-dependent aggregation in solution. Our results provide a structural basis for the recognition of GE signals by M2-1, and the prevention of premature mRNA termination."

The structure reveals an asymmetric tetramer, where three monomers display a canonical globular conformation, whilst unexpectedly, the fourth protomer adopts an open conformation where the core domain has flipped away from the rest of the molecule by approximately 60 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). This open conformation is in striking contrast with the symmetrical RSV M2-1 tetramer (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>).

In contrast, the closed state displays much lower flexibility due to stabilization of the protein through intramolecular contacts between the core domain and the rest of the molecule (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

Notably, the rigid core domain can flex with respect to the zinc finger domains and tetramerization helices, consistent with observations made from the crystal structures (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which can be linked to a rather dynamic hydrogen bonding network between the core domain and the rest of the molecule (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>)."

In 1 M Gdn-HCl, 65% of the conformers are in an intermediate state with two core domains opened, while the addition of 3 M Gdn-HCl induces a shift in the equilibrium such that nearly 60% are found to be in the fully open state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Addition of Gdn-HCl was unlikely to cause unfolding of the core domain or tetramer dissociation, as evidenced by the good quality of the fit using our models (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). This was despite some discrepancies in the molecular weight estimated from the SAXS data (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), which may result from the low signal-to-noise ratio. The ability to shift the equilibrium towards open states with low concentrations of Gdn-HCl is consistent with the polar nature of the interactions between the core domain and the rest of the molecule, and suggests that these interactions are weak in solution. An additional possibility, that cannot be ruled out on the basis of the SAXS data given the low resolution of the technique, is that the disruption of the closed state by Gdn-HCl may be enhanced through destabilization of the zinc finger structure by the denaturant, as this would result in only minor changes in the scattering profile."

The analysis shows that M2-1 measured in the presence of NDSB-201 is more flexible than a theoretical ensemble of closed state models, and that this flexibility is further increased by addition of Gdn-HCl. As the dimensionless Kratky plots are normalized by the particle's R<sub>g</sub> and forward scattering intensity I<sub>0</sub>, they also enable qualitative analysis of M2-1 conformational states in conditions where a small proportion of higher order oligomers is formed such as in the absence of NDSB. Normalized Kratky plots of data measured in the presence of 600 mM, 1.15 M or 3 M NaCl were relatively similar to the plot obtained in the presence of 500 mM NDSB, indicating a comparable equilibrium between open and closed states, and suggesting that the main effect that NDSB exerts on M2-1 in solution is the disruption of soluble aggregates."

Additionally, Asn16 side chain engages in van der Waals interactions with the adenine N1/N6.

The only exception was a soaking experiment performed with the DNA sequence AGTTA, which yielded clear density for four nucleotides (AGTT) that were bound between the core domain and the exposed (open) zinc finger of two symmetry-related M2-1 molecules. The two T bases interact in the same binding pockets as the AMP molecules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), however, the second T is partially disordered and shows density only for its phosphate and part of the nucleotide ring (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), which is involved in hydrogen bonding with the M2-1 backbone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This lack of ordering likely results from the less stable stacking of the pyrimidine ring onto Tyr9, compared to the adenosine purine ring. The two T bases are preceded by a G, which does not share any atomic contacts with the zinc finger domain, and an adenosine base which interacts with Lys22 side chain through its phosphate and engages in a hydrogen bond with Ala5 backbone nitrogen."

Interestingly, addition of RNA onto the EDTA-treated samples did not result in compaction, but rather induced a small increase in flexibility. This indicates that RNA-induced closure of M2-1 results from the simultaneous binding of the core and zinc finger domains, and that impaired binding to the zinc finger inhibits this conformational change. The moderate increase in flexibility may then result from RNA binding to the core domain only, with RNA fragments remaining unbound and disordered within the complex."

The proposed binding specificity enables a detailed interpretation of RNA binding results obtained for RSV M2-1 by <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al. (2014)</a>. The authors reported an affinity of \u223c20 nM for a poly-A 13-mer, which was decreased by only twofold on using the RSV positive SH gene end sequence (5\u2032-AGUUAAUUAAAAA-3\u2032), indicating that not all adenine bases are important for high affinity. Interestingly, a much larger change was observed when comparing the affinity of M2-1 for the negative F gene end (Kd \u223c 1 \u00b5M), which contains a single adenosine in position five, and the poly U, C, or G sequences (Kd &gt;100 \u00b5M). This indicates that A5 is indeed the main determinant of M2-1 RNA binding specificity. Additional binding stability is provided by the presence of an adenine in position six (n6), consistent with a fivefold increase in affinity measured for RSV M2-1 for the positive sense SH gene end (5\u2032-AGUUAAUUAAAAA-3\u2032) over the F gene end (5\u2032-AGUUAUAUAAAAC-3\u2032) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>), which differ by the presence of an adenine at this position, and by the length of their A tract. Nucleotides in position seven and eight (n7/8) are located in between the two RNA binding sites, consistent with them being more variable. This model suggests that the length of this variable region is important for optimal recognition. Interestingly, the leader RNA sequence used in RNA titration experiments is quite similar to the portion of the gene end sequence that is recognized by M2-1, with an adenine base located four nucleotides upstream of an A<sub>6</sub> tract."

In this model, M2-1 is tightly associated to the viral phosphoprotein P, resulting in a non-globular tetramer/tetramer complex, as has been observed in RSV (<a href=\"#bib16\">Esperante et al., 2012</a>). The tetrameric P protein acts as a hub, connecting the nucleocapsid\u2013RNA complex to the viral polymerase L and the M2-1 protein, and most probably prevents M2-1 aggregation observed in vitro. In this context, nascent viral mRNAs can be accessed by M2-1 and closure of the core domain triggered upon recognition of high affinity sequences such as gene ends and polyA tails. Because the binding of M2-1 core domain to RNA and P has been shown to be competitive due to partially overlapping binding surfaces (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blondot et al., 2012</a>), the tetrameric nature of M2-1 enables specific RNA recognition, while maintaining a tight association with P."

VP30 possess a CCCH zinc finger motif (residues 72 to 90) located directly upstream of an oligomerization helix (residues 94 to 112), and followed by a core domain (residues 142 to 272) that is structurally similar to M2-1 core domain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hartlieb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Blondot et al., 2012</a>). Similar to M2-1, the oligomerization and core domains are separated by a predicted disordered region. However, VP30 was found to form dimers via its core domain and is thought to form hexamers through its oligomerization domain, which contrasts with the tetramers observed for M2-1. Interestingly, mutagenesis studies of VP30 core domain have identified sets of residues that decreases both nucleocapsid protein (NP) binding and transcription activation (R179E, K180A, and K183E), or that decrease association with NP (E197A) without impairing transcription activation, that map to opposite faces of the domain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hartlieb et al., 2007</a>). Comparisons between the functional surfaces of structurally aligned M2-1 and VP30 core domains indicate that the same face of the core domain might be involved in interaction with the zinc finger and oligomerization domains in both viruses (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In this scenario, mutation of VP30 R179, K180, and K183, on the face that is involved in interaction with the zinc finger and oligomerization domains, would prevent conformational changes in VP30 that are required for transcription activation, while mutation of E197 on the other face of the core domain would decrease binding to the NP protein without affecting VP30 conformation."

This observation reconciles conflicting earlier solution and crystallographic studies obtained for RSV, where solution characterization suggested a non-globular, extended tetramer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Esperante et al., 2011</a>) while the crystal structure indicated a compact, stable, intertwined tetrameric assembly (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, mutating RSV M2-1 zinc finger residues Leu16 and Asn17 to the corresponding residues of murine pneumovirus (Ser and Arg, respectively) has identified these residues as critical to protein function (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhou et al., 2003</a>). In the RSV M2-1 crystal structure, Leu16 is involved in extensive hydrophobic contacts with the core domain, suggesting it stabilizes the closed tetramer, while Asn17 is exposed on the zinc finger surface. These residues map in HMPV to Asn16 and Arg17 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), and our structural data indicate that Asn16 is similarly involved in stabilization of the closed state of M2-1 through hydrogen bonding to Gln104. This suggests that the stability of the closed state and the fine-tuning of M2-1 dynamics are critical to antitermination. The role of Arg17 is less clear due to its aliphatic sidechain but it seems to be involved in RNA recognition, as well as intramolecular contacts with Glu20, Asn 77, and Tyr9 in the apoprotein."

However, the nature of this involvement has remained unclear. Here, we obtained adenosine- and DNA-bound structures of the M2-1 zinc finger and have shown its homology to RNA binding eukaryotic motifs such as Nab2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brockmann et al., 2012</a>) or Tis11d (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hudson et al., 2004</a>). Using X-ray crystallography, we showed that the M2-1 zinc finger specifically recognized two adenine bases. Binding of the first adenine base in position five is stabilized in the closed state through induced folding of the disordered C-terminal of the protein onto the bound nucleotide. The interaction with the second adenine in position six was observed only in the open state, likely due to the interaction with Asn16 which is only flipped out in the open state and thus able to contact the adenosine ring. These observations reveal intricate communication between the zinc finger and core domains, leading to a modulation of RNA binding by the protein conformational state that may be important for M2-1 function. Specifically, these results suggest that binding at position six may be less stable in the closed state than in the open state, and result in increased exposure of this nucleotide to the solvent once the M2-1 core domain closes onto the zinc finger."

The model suggests that the zinc finger recognizes A5 and A6, while the core domain binds to the poly-adenosine tract (A8 to A13). Interestingly, mutagenesis studies of the gene end sequences in RSV have shown that mutations of position five and six to nucleotides other than adenosine resulted in a strong decrease in antitermination efficiency (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harmon et al., 2001</a>). This observation was surprising, given that the nucleotide in position six is not conserved within gene end sequences. However, the occurrence of an A in this position is associated in RSV with a higher affinity of the RNA for M2-1 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>), and with increased antitermination efficiency at the corresponding gene junctions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hardy et al., 1999</a>). An intriguing possibility is that differential recognition of the nucleotide in position six of the gene end sequence by the zinc finger may result in exposure of n6 in the bound state, enabling the polymerase to discriminate between different gene junctions. Nucleotides n7 and n8 are located in between the two binding sites, consistent with their lack of conservation. In particular, mutations of n7 to any of the four nucleotides were found to have a minimal effect on antitermination (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harmon et al., 2001</a>). In addition, the position of the A-tract relative to the upstream sequence element and a minimum length of five A bases has been shown to be critical for antitermination (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harmon et al., 2001</a>).Our model is entirely consistent with these findings."

This suggests that the sampling of a larger volume by M2-1 through the flexible linker may result in increased RNA scanning and binding rates. It may also allow binding to both genomic RNA and nascent mRNA transcripts, contributing to intragenic antitermination, by prevention of premature dissociation of the polymerase during transcription. When the spacing between optimally recognized RNA motifs becomes sufficiently small for M2-1 to recognize them in the closed state, the protein is locked in a closed state. This feature enables M2-1 to detect gene end sequences in its environment, and presumably also poly-adenosine sequences. Conformational changes induced by simultaneous binding may be recognised by the viral polymerase L, resulting in polyadenylation and release of the mRNA transcripts. It is currently unknown whether the signal is sensed solely through the intermediate of the P protein, or involves a direct interaction between M2-1 and L as has been suggested for VP30 in filoviruses (<a href=\"#bib22\">Groseth et al., 2009</a>)."

Negative cooperativity in binding RNA, as observed in RSV (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>), would favour this mechanism.

Closed and open forms of M2-1 were generated using structural alignments based on crystallographic protomers. Torsion angles were edited in VEGA ZZ (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pedretti et al., 2002</a>) wherever necessary to avoid steric clashes. All classical MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hess et al., 2008</a>) and the AMBER99SB-ILDN* force field (<a href=\"#bib6\">Best and Hummer, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</a>). At the beginning of each simulation, the protein was immersed in a box of SPC/E water, with a minimum distance of 1.0 nm between protein atoms and the edges of the box. 150 mM NaCl were added using genion. Long range electrostatics were treated with the particle-mesh Ewald summation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Essmann et al., 1995</a>). Bond lengths were constrained using the P-LINCS algorithm. The integration time step was 5 fs. The v-rescale thermostat and the Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat were used to maintain a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm. Each system was energy minimized using 1000 steps of steepest descent and equilibrated for 200 ps with restrained protein heavy atoms. For each system, two independent production simulations were obtained by using different initial velocities. The aggregated simulation time was \u223c150 ns for open M2-1 and \u223c650 ns for close M2-1. RMSF were calculated using GROMACS routines."

In order to build conformational landscapes, 50 models were selected per ensemble, resulting in 500 optimized models. Radius of gyration and D<sub>max</sub> values were extracted from the models and then used to calculate two-dimensional histograms (using a binning of 15 \u00d7 15). The relative populations of conformers were counted in each optimized ensemble and averaged for each experimental SAXS profile to gain insight into the mechanism of opening and closure."

The fluorophore was excited in the range of 470\u2013505 nm and fluorescence emission was measured in the range of 540\u2013700 nm every 0.5\u00b0C after a 10-s hold. The effect of nucleotides was assayed by comparing melting temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) of protein in starting buffer and in AMP, UMP, CMP, or GMP supplemented buffer.

The SAXS reveals that even though aggregation occurs, by analysing the normalized Kratky plots, we are still able to extract information on the open and closed state of M2-1 in the presence of RNA. Normalized Kratky plots represent a reliable, model-free analysis that is frequently used in polymer science but was only recently popularized for the analysis of protein flexibility (Receveur-Br\u00e9chot et al., 2012). This type of analysis thus is a facet of BioSAXS that is not commonly exploited, and data showing the formation of soluble aggregates are often discarded without further analysis. For this reason, we believe it is useful to confirm the SAXS analysis with an additional technique such as EM."

Specifically, association of M2-1 with tetrameric P is likely to prevent the formation of any atomic contacts between M2-1 tetramers and thus inhibit M2-1 aggregation. Additionally, genomic RNA is encapsidated by N and likely is not accessible to M2-1 because of steric hindrance from P and L. Consequently, only transcribed viral mRNA will be available for binding M2-1 and thus M2-1 will never exist in the presence of an excess of RNA. Thus carrying out a reverse titration of M2-1 into a solution of RNA would then also be of doubtful biological relevance since, in the context of the viral lifecycle, M2-1 will not be in excess of RNA and N,P and L are not present. We have produced a scheme illustrating how M2-1 may function in the presence of N, P and L, which has been included as a new panel in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>."

Our ensemble analysis allows us to conclude that Gdn-HCl doesn't cause tetramer dissociation, or unfolding of the tetramerization helix or core domains, as this would result in larger increases in radius of gyration, and in the case of tetramer dissociation, changes in the calculated molecular weight. For the same reason, it is likely that the zinc finger doesn't adopt completely extended conformations in the presence of moderate amounts of Gdn-HCl. However, in the case of the Zn-finger domain, the expected changes on the scattering profile would be small and thus we can't exclude this possibility. This has now been clearly stated in the text."

The analysis is in practice complicated by several factors. (1) In the case of M2-1, the equilibrium between open and closed states affects the stability of \u03b11 in the zinc finger domain, and causes unfolding of the first alpha helix of the core domain (\u03b13). This is in agreement with the crystal structures, in which higher B factors and lower quality electron density for the zinc finger are observed in the open state. Furthermore, unfolding of \u03b13 is accounted for in our MD simulations and ensemble analysis of the SAXS data. This is also consistent with the fact that in RSV M2-1, \u03b13 is present in the crystal structures reported by <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanner et al., 2014</a>, however, adopts unfolded conformations in the NMR structure of the core domain from <a href=\"#bib8\">Blondot et al., 2012</a>. These observations would make it difficult to assign any changes in the CD spectra to a particular region of the protein. (2) Measuring CD spectra of M2-1 in the presence of Gdn-HCl, NDSB-201, Tris and NaCl is challenging due to the heavy absorption of these compounds in the far UV region. This could in principle be overcome by using a shorter path length, however a very high concentration of M2-1 would be needed and this is very difficult to reach. (3) It is well known that low concentrations of Gdn-HCl can induce molten globule states which retain some degree of compactness but may have a lower secondary structure content than the native protein."

Hartlieb et al. have identified mutants located on two opposite faces of the protein, both of which affected the ability of VP30 to co-immunoprecipitate the NP protein.

Interestingly, WT RSV M2-1 was crystallized at pH 10 in the presence of 0.1 M of 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPS), and mutant RSV M2-1 (S58DS61D) crystallized at pH 8.5 and in the presence of 0.2 M trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is a well known stabilizer of protein folded states. The conformation of M2-1 may be further affected by the use of high pH, as the interface is rich in positively charged residues with a total of eight arginine or lysine residues. Most of these residues are involved in salt bridges and likely possess high pKa values, however, Lys19 and Arg38 are primarily involved in hydrogen bonds with neutral residues (Ala73 backbone oxygen and Asn40, Asn44 side chains), which may result in deprotonation at pH 10 and overstabilization of the closed state."

                    "text": "Regarding the solution structure of HMPV M2-1, our ensemble analysis shows that in the buffer conditions that we used for crystallization (150 mM NaCl and 500 mM NDSB-201), 50% of the molecules adopt a closed, symmetric conformation, 30% display dissociation of a single core domain (which is the state seen in the crystal structures), while the remaining molecules are in more open states, mostly with two core domains dissociated (15%), as can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, white histogram bars. Given this distribution, one would expect the protein to have crystallized in its closed, symmetric state rather than in the intermediately open state observed in HMPV M2-1 crystals. However, it appears that this intermediate state was able to generate a stable crystal lattice, resulting in an equilibrium shift. These observations highlight the importance of using solution techniques to assess whether protein conformations seen in crystalline states are consistent with the structure in solution."

Data was measured in the presence of 600 mM, 1.15 M or 3 M NaCl and could not be fitted by our ensembles due to the presence of a small proportion of soluble aggregates/higher order oligomers. However, we were able to use normalized Kratky plots to assess the flexibility of M2-1 in these conditions by comparing them to the Kratky plots obtained in the presence of NDSB-201, Gdn-HCl or with a theoretical closed state ensemble of models. The data shows that the conformational equilibrium of M2-1 in the presence of 600 mM to 3 M NaCl is relatively similar to that observed with 500 mM NDSB-201, showing only a slight compaction in 3 M NaCl, which likely results from an increased hydrophobic effect. This additionally suggests that the main effect of NDSB-201 on the conformational equilibrium of M2-1 may be to prevent aggregation."
