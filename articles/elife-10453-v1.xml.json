It is unknown if these signals are necessary for oviduct function in supporting fertilization and preimplantation development. Here we show that conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) in oviduct and uterine epithelial cells have impaired fertilization due to a dramatic reduction in sperm migration. In addition, all successfully fertilized eggs die before the 2-cell stage due to persistence of secreted innate immune mediators including proteases. Elevated protease activity in cKO oviducts causes premature degradation of the zona pellucida and embryo lysis, and wild-type embryos transferred into cKO oviducts fail to develop normally unless rescued by concomitant transfer of protease inhibitors. Thus, suppression of oviductal protease activity mediated by estrogen-epithelial ER\u03b1 signaling is required for fertilization and preimplantation embryo development. These findings have implications for human infertility and post-coital contraception."

It is unknown if these signals are necessary for oviduct function in supporting fertilization and preimplantation development. Here we show that conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) in oviduct and uterine epithelial cells have impaired fertilization due to a dramatic reduction in sperm migration. In addition, all successfully fertilized eggs die before the 2-cell stage due to persistence of secreted innate immune mediators including proteases. Elevated protease activity in cKO oviducts causes premature degradation of the zona pellucida and embryo lysis, and wild-type embryos transferred into cKO oviducts fail to develop normally unless rescued by concomitant transfer of protease inhibitors. Thus, suppression of oviductal protease activity mediated by estrogen-epithelial ER\u03b1 signaling is required for fertilization and preimplantation embryo development. These findings have implications for human infertility and post-coital contraception."

These mice are infertile. This is partly because most sperm become stuck in the uterus and fail to reach the eggs in the oviduct in order to fertilize them. The oviduct also becomes a hostile environment for both eggs and embryos, as reflected in damaged eggs and the complete loss of all new embryos by two days after fertilization. These embryos die, not because their development fails, but because their outer membrane becomes damaged and breaks apart. Winuthayanon et al. showed that this is due to the persistence of enzymes that form part of the immune system inside the oviduct. These enzymes can degrade proteins and damage cell membranes."

The loss of this receptor also reveals the vital role that estrogen plays in suppressing parts of the immune response to ensure the oviduct provides a supportive environment for fertilization and embryo development. These findings could also have future application in the development of new contraceptives and might also shed light on the causes of human infertility."

Oviduct tissue complexity, cellular composition, and luminal fluid components differ along the length of the oviduct and change temporally in response to alterations in steroid hormone levels that occur with the estrous/menstrual cycle (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buhi et al., 2000</a>). Estrogen levels are highest in the period immediately prior to ovulation and are decreasing when fertilization occurs in the oviductal ampulla. During the several days of preimplantation embryo development, there is a continued decrease in estrogen and an increase in progesterone. In the uterus, cyclic alterations in steroid hormone levels orchestrate the initial proliferation and then cellular differentiation of the endometrium. These changes are critical for establishment of uterine receptivity to the implanting embryo. It is unknown what role, if any, steroid hormone-mediated signals have in regulating oviductal function to support fertilization and preimplantation embryo development."

In mesenchymal cKO mice, ER\u03b1 was effectively deleted from stromal and muscle cells underlying the epithelium throughout the oviduct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Minimal ablation of ER\u03b1 in the epithelial cells was observed in some regions of the mesenchymal cKO oviduct. No gross or microscopic morphological alterations in oviduct structure were observed in either cKO mouse line. We previously showed that cKO females cycle\u00a0and mate normally, indicating that gonadotropins and sex steroid hormones are not altered in these mice (<a href=\"#bib53\">Winuthayanon et al., 2010</a>). To determine whether lack of ER\u03b1 in either epithelial or mesenchymal compartments affected fertilization, zygotes (one-cell embryos) were collected from normally cycling, mated females at 0.5 days post coitum (dpc). Despite similar numbers of spontaneously ovulated eggs found in the oviducts (typically 7\u20138), cKO mice had 58% as many zygotes as WT controls, whereas mesenchymal cKO mice had numbers similar to controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). There was also no difference in ovulation efficiency following superovulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Taken together, these findings indicate that lack of ER\u03b1 in epithelial cells, but not mesenchymal cells, reduces fertilization."

To determine if lack of epithelial cell ER\u03b1\u00a0affected sperm migration to the site of fertilization, female mice were mated and the numbers of sperm to reach the ovulated cumulus masses in the ampulla and the sperm storage reservoir in the isthmus (<a href=\"#bib49\">Suarez, 2008</a>) at 0.5 dpc were counted. Despite high numbers of sperm present in the uterine horns, there was a dramatic reduction in the numbers of sperm to reach both the ampulla and isthmus regions of the oviduct in cKO compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that effects on sperm migration explained the reduced fertilization.\u00a0Of note, we found that the mass of sperm in the upper uterine horns of cKO mice was held within a dense, partially solidified mass that retained the tubular shape of the uterine horn following release into culture medium. In contrast, sperm released into culture medium from control uterine horns rapidly dispersed into small clumps. This finding suggested that abnormalities in post-ejaculation seminal fluid processing in the uterine horn caused the failure of sperm migration into the oviduct."

Oviducts from WT females contained two-cell embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>); however, cKO oviducts had no living embryos. Instead, only remnants of non-viable eggs or embryos were recovered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), indicating that all zygotes present at 0.5 dpc died before the two-cell stage. In contrast, mesenchymal cKO oviducts contained similar numbers of embryos with an appearance comparable to controls when collected on both 1.5 dpc (two-cell embryos) and 3.5 dpc (morulae/blastocysts) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). We conclude that expression of epithelial, but not mesenchymal, ER\u03b1 in the oviduct is crucial for preimplantation embryo development. Furthermore, when zygotes were recovered from cKO oviducts \u223c6 hr after fertilization and then cultured in vitro, less than 50% cleaved to the two-cell stage, and only 14% progressed to the blastocyst stage, whereas more than 80% of the zygotes from WT oviducts developed to the blastocyst stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). However, if eggs were collected from either cKO oviducts or ovaries and then fertilized in vitro, the resulting zygotes developed to the blastocyst stage at a rate comparable to WT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). These results indicate that the zygotes\u2019 developmental potential was severely compromised even if they were exposed to the cKO oviduct environment for only a few hours after fertilization."

The most highly altered genes at 0.5 and 1.5 dpc are listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>,\u00a0respectively; representative genes were validated using real-time PCR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, we found that biological functions significantly altered at 0.5 dpc included tissue development, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and cellular growth and proliferation (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table\u00a03</a>). At 1.5 dpc, there were fewer altered biological functions than at 0.5 dpc; these functions included tissue development, inflammatory response, cellular movement, and small molecule biochemistry (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the microarray signal intensities indicated two groups of gene expression patterns, one consisting of WT 0.5 dpc, and the second including all remaining groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Note that in the cKO samples, replicates from both 0.5 and 1.5 dpc did not all cluster together, unlike WT sample replicates, which clustered together according to the day of pregnancy. Instead, the cKO 0.5 dpc samples were much more similar to both the cKO 1.5 dpc and WT 1.5 dpc samples. These findings demonstrate that estrogen signaling via epithelial ER\u03b1 has dramatic effects on oviductal gene expression at 0.5 dpc but not 1.5 dpc and are consistent with the normal pattern of estrous cycle estrogen levels that reach a peak prior to ovulation and then drop significantly by 1.5 dpc."

                                "text": "The entire female reproductive tract functions as a mucosal immune barrier and secreted antimicrobial proteins form a significant component of the local innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wira et al., 2011</a>). Biologic activity of antimicrobial proteins\u00a0is modulated by secreted proteases and protease inhibitors (PIs), both of which can also serve as antimicrobials in the female reproductive tract and at other mucosal surfaces (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shaw et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wira et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aboud et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dittmann et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0Immune suppression by steroid hormones during mid-cycle creates a window of susceptibility to infection well documented in human tissues (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wira et al., 2010</a>). Because the embryos in the cKO oviducts were dying rather than simply failing to develop, we hypothesized that estrogen signaling via epithelial ER\u03b1 is required to suppress secretion of oviduct antimicrobial molecules that can cause preimplantation embryo death. This idea is consistent with the identification of inflammatory response as a biological category significantly altered in the cKO oviduct at both 0.5 and 1.5 dpc (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Tables 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">4</a>). The\u00a0altered inflammatory response genes included proteases, PIs, defensins, chemokines (including <i>Il17, Il17rb</i>, and <i>Cxcl17</i>), and enzymes regulating prostaglandin (PG) production such as hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (<i>Hpgds</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine the PG profile of WT and cKO oviducts at 0.5 dpc. PGD<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2\u03b1</sub>\u00a0levels were significantly lower, whereas PGE<sub>2</sub> was increased in cKO compared to WT oviducts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). PGs are not normal components of embryo culture medium, so we reasoned that lack of PGD<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2\u03b1</sub> could not cause embryo death in vivo. In contrast, PGE<sub>2</sub> was elevated in the cKO oviducts and in theory could contribute to the embryo phenotype either directly by effects on the embryo or indirectly by effects on the oviduct. To determine if PGE<sub>2</sub> could directly cause embryo death, we added PGE<sub>2</sub> to the culture medium during fertilization of WT eggs and during the entire period of embryo development to the blastocyst stage. Inclusion of excess PGE<sub>2</sub> had no effect on fertilization or embryo development (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), suggesting that although epithelial ER\u03b1 regulates oviduct PG production, these lipid compounds alone are not directly responsible for causing embryo death."

The ZP is comprised of three heavily glycosylated proteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3. After fertilization, there is a physiological proteolytic cleavage of ZP2 when the eggs undergo cortical granule exocytosis and release the protease ovastacin; this change makes the ZP resistant to penetration by additional sperm (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burkart et al., 2012</a>).

The consequent release of ovastacin from the cortical granules causes a small but significant amount of ZP2 cleavage and zona hardening when ovulated eggs are cultured in vitro in the absence of serum (which contains fetuin), or in vivo in <i>Fetub<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schroeder et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dietzel et al., 2013</a>). We took advantage of ZP2 sensitivity to protease-mediated cleavage over time to determine if protease activity within the cKO oviducts was increased. Ovulated eggs were collected 16 hr after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, when they would have spent \u223c4 hr in the oviduct, and then evaluated for premature ZP2 proteolysis. Based on immunoblot analyses, ovulated eggs recovered from cKO oviducts had significantly less intact ZP2 and more cleaved ZP2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). This finding demonstrates that there is a physiologically relevant increase in protease\u00a0action on the ZP within cKO oviducts in vivo."

In contrast, zygotes from cKO oviducts had much lower ZP2 cleavage, indicating that the normal process of ovastacin-mediated cleavage of the N-terminal region of ZP2 was disrupted. This difference was not due to failure of cortical granule exocytosis because immunofluorescence analysis revealed no differences in cortical granule release or material in the perivitelline space in zygotes from WT and cKO oviducts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Consistent with the lower ZP2 conversion, the ZP of cKO zygotes dissolved twice as quickly as that of WT zygotes when the embryos were subjected to additional protease digestion in vitro\u00a0using 0.2% \u03b1-chymotrypsin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Of note, during the process of ZP dissolution in \u03b1-chymotrypsin, zygotes from cKO oviducts underwent swelling and lysis, whereas WT zygotes remained intact for up to an hour after their ZPs were completely dissolved (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>,<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>).\u00a0These findings suggested\u00a0that the cKO oviduct environment affected not only ZP structure but also zygote plasma membrane integrity."

The oocytes were imaged while 0.04% \u03b1-chymotrypsin was added to the culture medium.\u00a0EGFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane began to decline within less than 30 s after protease addition and was nearly absent after 2 min (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), indicating that \u03b1-chymotrypsin rapidly penetrates the ZP to access proteins located at the cell membrane. To determine whether presence of the ZP protects embryos from protease-induced lysis, WT ZP-intact zygotes and WT zygotes with their ZP removed by either mechanical microdissection or by brief exposure to acidic Tyrode\u2019s solution were cultured in 0.4% \u03b1-chymotrypsin, and time to cell lysis was determined.\u00a0Regardless of the ZP removal method, ZP-free embryos lysed much more rapidly than ZP-intact embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). These data show that although \u03b1-chymotrypsin is able to rapidly pass through the ZP to access the plasma membrane, the presence of the ZP slows protease-mediated embryo lysis."

Failure of sperm migration may be explained by the abnormal character of the ejaculate present in the uterine horns of cKO mice following mating. In rodents, a dense, hard copulatory plug\u00a0forms in the vagina following mating as a consequence of the protein crosslinking activity of transglutaminase IV, which is generated in the prostate gland and induces coagulation of seminal vesicle proteins\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Dean, 2013</a>).\u00a0Although the ejaculate directly enters the rodent uterus, a copulatory plug does not normally form there, so secretions within the uterine lumen must either prevent protein crosslinking or promote liquefaction of the ejaculate.\u00a0In humans, a copulatory plug does not form; instead, ejaculated semen coagulates into a gelatinous mass that then\u00a0liquefies. Liquefaction is mediated by the activity of kallikrein 3 (KLK3; better known as prostate-specific antigen), a chymotrypsin-like protease, which promotes release of sperm from the coagulum\u00a0[reviewed in\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib45\">Robert and Gagnon, 1999</a>)]. Rodents have evolved a large number of kallikrein-related proteins (<a href=\"#bib35\">Olsson and Lundwall, 2002</a>), some of which are expressed in the uterus and estrogen-regulated\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Corthorn et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rajapakse et al., 2007</a>). We detected several kallikreins in the oviduct that were highly homologous to human <i>KLK3</i>, including <i>Klk1</i> and <i>Klk1b</i>-family kallikreins, and were downregulated in cKO mice (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>).\u00a0Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that estrogen induces\u00a0<i>Klk1b5</i> expression in the uterus of WT but not cKO mice (<a href=\"#bib52\">Winuthayanon et al., 2014</a>). These findings suggest that downregulation of KLK3-like proteins in the cKO uterus causes a failure of semen liquefaction, providing a plausible explanation for the failure of sperm migration into the oviduct."

Ovastacin can also be released prior to fertilization via spontaneous cortical granule exocytosis during meiotic maturation in the ovarian follicle. Studies in the <i>Fetub<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse demonstrated that fetuin B, a cysteine PI synthesized in the liver and present in serum, limits ovastacin-mediated premature ZP2 cleavage in the ovarian follicle so that fertilization can occur\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Dietzel et al., 2013</a>). Here, we have shown that fetuin B is\u00a0also expressed locally in the oviduct in response to estrogen signaling in the epithelial cells.

Because proteases rapidly penetrate the ZP to access proteins at the plasma membrane, our data suggest that the intact ZP serves as a \u2018decoy substrate\u2019 by providing a large excess of substrate for oviductal proteases that are then less able to disrupt embryo plasma membrane integrity."

The poor but better survival of WT zygotes exposed for 3 days to cKO oviducts\u00a0in our embryo transfer experiments is likely a result of at least two factors: 1) dilutional effects of the culture medium transferred into the oviduct during the embryo transfer procedure that would partially mitigate effects of proteases and antimicrobial peptides and 2) several hours less time spent in the cKO oviduct because fertilization occurred in a WT oviduct prior to embryo collection and transfer. The critical time frame during which the PIs prevented embryo death was likely to be on the first day of pregnancy, based on the minimal differences in gene expression between cKO and WT oviducts on pregnancy day 1.5 and relatively low circulating estrogen levels on pregnancy days 1.5\u20133.5."

These findings imply that disruption of estrogen signaling, for example by endocrine disruptors or post-coital contraceptives, could prevent pregnancy by interfering with suppression of the oviductal mucosal immune response. Lastly, embryotoxic effects of abnormally elevated innate immune mediators in the Fallopian tubes may contribute to infertility in women with hydrosalpinges, endometriosis, or unexplained infertility."

For oviduct immunoblots, protein was extracted and analyzed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hewitt et al., 2003</a>). The \u03b2-actin (#SC1616-R), fetuin B (#PA5-29468), and HPGDS (#MBS601438) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology\u00a0(Dallas,\u00a0TX), Thermo Scientific, and MyBiosource (San Diego, CA), respectively, and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunohistochemical analyses of oviducts were performed as described previously for uterine tissue (<a href=\"#bib53\">Winuthayanon et al., 2010</a>). For immunohistochemical analysis, fetuin B and HPGDS antibodies were diluted at 1:200 and 1:1000, respectively. For ZP immunoblots, MII eggs from COCs were collected 16 hr after hCG injection, freed of cumulus cells using hyaluronidase, washed, and then snap frozen in 5 \u03bcL of Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific); zygotes were collected at 5:00 pm on the day of the copulatory plug.\u00a0An equal volume of reducing sample buffer was added, then the samples were denatured, separated on a 4\u201312% tris-glycine gel (Novex, Grand Island, NY) and transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Life Technologies).\u00a0Blots were blocked in tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) containing 3% bovine serum albumin\u00a0(BSA) and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution.\u00a0Primary ZP antibodies (graciously provided by Dr. Jurrien Dean, NIDDK) were as follows: ZP1, mAB M-1.4 diluted 1:500\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Rankin et al., 1999</a>); ZP2, mAB M2c.2 diluted 1:5000\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Rankin et al., 2003</a>);\u00a0ZP3, mAB IE-10 diluted 1:10,000\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">East et al., 1985</a>). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST. Chemiluminescence detection was carried out using SuperSignal West Pico (Thermo Scientific). Percentage of ZP2 protein cleavage was calculated as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ducibella et al., 1990</a>).\u00a0Immunofluorescence analysis of cortical granules was performed using <i>lens culinaris</i> agglutinin as described previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Connors et al., 1998</a>)\u00a0except that the ZPs were left intact to allow visualization of perivitelline space material."

Conditional knockout of the gene in oviductal epithelial cells but not in the mesenchyme results not only in a decrease in sperm transport to the site of fertilization but also in increased protease activity (and antimicrobial peptides) causes zona rupture and preimplantation embryo lethality. Much research on fertilization and preimplantation development has involved in vitro studies, which constitutes a very artificial environment. A major strength of this study is that it focuses on functional analysis in the oviduct where fertilization and early cleavage events actually occur. The figures and videos are of exceptional quality, and, overall, this manuscript is judged to be valuable contribution to our understanding of oviductal function in fertilization and early development."

Wild type and cKO females were superovulated and mated. The following morning, females with copulatory plugs were sacrificed and the reproductive tracts removed. The oviducts were dissected from the uteri as close to the uteri as possible, and then flushed from the ampulla toward the isthmus, beginning distal to the cumulus mass, using ~30 \u00b5L water via a 30 G needle.

We found that there were far fewer sperm in the oviductal isthmus in the cKO mice, indicating that migration from the uterus to oviduct was severely impaired.

We found that the mass of sperm in the upper uterine horns of cKO mice was held within a dense, partially solidified mass that retained the tubular shape of the uterine horn following release into culture medium. In contrast, sperm released into culture medium from control uterine horns rapidly dispersed into small clumps. This finding suggests that in response to estrogen signaling, the normal uterine epithelium secretes components that prevent solidification of the ejaculate in the uterine horn, and thus prevents changes similar to those that form the vaginal copulatory plug. The altered seminal fluid properties in the cKO uterine horns likely explain the decreased numbers of sperm in the oviductal sperm reservoir and the subsequent low numbers of sperm to reach the oviductal ampulla. These findings are now mentioned in the Results (second paragraph) and Discussion (third paragraph); the Methods section was also appropriately revised."

Application of CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting methods in larger size animals such as rats, cows or pigs, which have larger oviducts from which oviductal fluid can be reliably obtained, may allow a direct test of protease activity in oviducts lacking ER alpha in epithelial cells."

Our finding that fertilization efficiency was far lower in vitro unless the cumulus cells were removed indicated that even a short amount of time spent by the cumulus mass in the oviductal environment was detrimental. One explanation for this finding is that the rather sticky cumulus mass brings with it proteases (or other components) from the oviduct that then negatively impact on the function of sperm that were not exposed to the oviductal environment. An alternate explanation is that the oviductal environment directly affects either the hyaluronic acid matrix between the cumulus cells such that the sperm have more difficulty reaching and penetrating the zona pellucida, or causes alterations in the expression of chemoattractant molecules by the cumulus cells. Either explanation is plausible, and they are not exclusive.

SLPI and elafin are protease inhibitors that have antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities (see Lecaille et al., Biochimie 2015, doi:10.1016/j.biochi.2015.08.014). Proteases and protease inhibitors both serve as innate immune mediators in the female reproductive tract (Wira et al., J Reprod Immunol 2011, 65:196; Aboud et al., American Journal of Reproductive Immunology 2014, 71:12). One of the downregulated protease inhibitors we identified in cKO oviducts, <i>Serpine1</i>, was recently demonstrated to function as a secreted protease inhibitor that inhibits influenza A virus spreading by preventing viral surface glycoprotein maturation (Dittmann et al., Cell 2015, 160:631).

Although we did not perform microarrays on pregnancy days 2.5 or 3.5, we would predict that on these days the oviduct would have similarly small differences because estradiol levels are relatively low, and progesterone levels are high. The critical time, therefore, that the exogenous protease inhibitors are needed is on pregnancy day 0.5 when there are the most differences between the WT and cKO oviductal environments.
