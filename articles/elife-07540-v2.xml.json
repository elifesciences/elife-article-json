The presumed biogenesis of these RNAs involves a non-canonical \u2018backsplicing\u2019 event. Recent studies in mammalian cell culture posit that backsplicing is facilitated by inverted repeats flanking the circularized exon(s). Although such sequence elements are common in mammals, they are rare in lower eukaryotes, making current models insufficient to describe circularization. Through systematic splice site mutagenesis and the identification of splicing intermediates, we show that circular RNA in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> is generated through an exon-containing lariat precursor. Furthermore, we have performed high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of a circle-forming exon, which enabled us to discover a systematic effect of exon length on RNA circularization. Our results uncover a mechanism for circular RNA biogenesis that may account for circularization in genes that lack noticeable flanking intronic secondary structure."

The presumed biogenesis of these RNAs involves a non-canonical \u2018backsplicing\u2019 event. Recent studies in mammalian cell culture posit that backsplicing is facilitated by inverted repeats flanking the circularized exon(s). Although such sequence elements are common in mammals, they are rare in lower eukaryotes, making current models insufficient to describe circularization. Through systematic splice site mutagenesis and the identification of splicing intermediates, we show that circular RNA in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> is generated through an exon-containing lariat precursor. Furthermore, we have performed high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of a circle-forming exon, which enabled us to discover a systematic effect of exon length on RNA circularization. Our results uncover a mechanism for circular RNA biogenesis that may account for circularization in genes that lack noticeable flanking intronic secondary structure."

In recent years, scientists have discovered that another type of alternative splicing, which creates circular RNA molecules, is common in animal cells.

When exons are skipped during alternative splicing, a large lariat containing the skipped exon is produced. Now, Barrett et al. have used yeast cells to investigate how circular RNAs are formed. Yeast is a good model to study this process because it can be manipulated easily in the laboratory and expresses circular RNAs. The experiments show that lariat structures containing exons (as would be expected from exon-skipping) are a common intermediate step before the production of a circular RNA. However, some exon-containing lariats do not go on to form circular RNAs, suggesting that additional factors are important for the production of circular RNAs."

The ability to recapitulate the splicing of an endogenous locus is a powerful tool for studying the mechanism of circular RNA production. For this reason, we turned to <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> as our model system for studying this process. With a simple and small gene structure and relatively high expression of some circular RNAs, <i>S. pombe</i> is an ideal system for studying circular RNA biogenesis. Because the second exon of <i>mrps16</i> is the most highly expressed circular RNA in this organism (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), we have adopted <i>mrps16</i> as our model RNA for studying circular RNA production in the present work."

Furthermore, by expressing <i>mrps16</i> on a plasmid, we completely recapitulate the quantitative relationship between circular and linear RNA expression in this gene, and through systematic splice site deletions of this plasmid, we demonstrate the necessity of a lariat precursor for circular RNA biogenesis. However, lariat production is not sufficient for circularization, as demonstrated by the existence of several exon-containing lariats that do not give rise to circular RNAs, indicating an additional parameter regulating their production. Overall, circularized exons are generally much larger than these skipped, uncircularized exons. To test if the length of circularized exons directly affects their circularization efficiency (CE), we utilized high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of the <i>mrps16</i> exon, which revealed that exon size is a significant determinant of RNA circularization."

Each model predicts a distinct set of biochemical intermediates and byproducts: a Y-shaped intermediate in the case of direct backsplicing; and a lariat precursor and double lariat in the case of the lariat model. These structurally distinct species discriminate the models, and we reasoned that determining which of these products exists could provide initial evidence for one or both of these models. Before performing biochemical identification of these intermediates, we computationally predicted the structure of the <i>mrps16</i> pre-mRNA to determine if there were any base-pairing interactions across the circularized exon. We found that <i>mrps16</i> lacks any apparent base pairing between the regions flanking the circularized exon (<a href=\"#fig1s1 fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>); thus, we hypothesized that the biogenesis of this circular RNA might proceed through a lariat precursor generated by exon skipping."

Because of its high expression, there was still a significant amount of linear mRNA after each of these treatments, and treating with both <i>Dra</i>I and RNase R had an additive effect on its depletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, Lanes 1\u20134).

There are only 14 reported examples of <i>validated</i>, stable exon-skipping events in wild-type <i>S. pombe</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Awan et al., 2013</a>), which would be predicted to produce such lariats. Stable exon skipping could be sufficient for circular RNA production, but it is not required; as is the case for <i>mrps16</i>, the exon-skipped transcripts may be quite unstable yet produce exon-containing lariats competent for circle formation. We have chosen to test genes with stable exon-skipped transcripts because they are known to produce exon-containing lariats."

Based on splice site mutagenesis experiments, we find that lariat production is important for detectable production of <i>mrps16</i> circular RNA. However, a lariat precursor may not be strictly necessary, as suggested by our data and in vitro work in mammalian and yeast splicing extracts that have shown it is possible to directly backsplice a circular RNA in the absence of competing splice sites (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pasman et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Schindewolf et al., 1996</a>). Rather, it is more likely that the lariat production contributes to backsplicing catalysis by positioning splice sites. In addition to this catalytic function, lariat production may also serve to prevent competing splice sites from operating. In other words, within the context of an exon-containing lariat, the only available splice sites are those bordering the circularized exon, and the upstream branch point, now \u2018orphaned\u2019 by lariat formation, must attack the downstream splice donor. In this way, the exon-containing lariat may provide a microenvironment for the splicing of circular RNA."

Supporting the idea that factors beyond the presence of an exon-containing lariat are required for circular RNA production, we have found that, in general, uncircularized skipped exons are much smaller than the circular exons, hinting that exon size may have a direct effect on the efficiency with which an exon circularizes. Using <i>mrps16</i> as a model gene, we tested this directly with a library of exonic deletions and found a systematic decrease in circularization with a decrease in exon size. Although there is a strong effect of exon size, circularization is presumably influenced by additional factors such as topological effects due to intronic sequence and combinatorial effects of RNA-binding proteins. Indeed, we have found that intronic deletions can have a pronounced effect on RNA circularization. None of these deletions (which range from 133 to 329 bp long) affect circularization as dramatically as deleting the branch point in either intron (SB + JS, unpublished data)."

As an example, the three exon gene <i>SUS1</i> has an exon-skipped linear transcript that is rapidly decayed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Egecioglu et al., 2012</a>). Substitution of the <i>SUS1</i> gene with a linear cDNA copy results in temperature sensitivity and histone H2B deubiquitination defects (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hossain et al., 2011</a>). This was suggested to be due to a functional role of an alternatively spliced linear isoform, but could be due to a circularized isoform derived from the seemingly non-functional and rapidly-decayed exon-skipping event.

Prior to PCR, the primers were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (NEB) at 10 \u03bcM primer concentration in 1\u00d7 T4 DNA ligase buffer. After PCR, these products were pooled, digested with <i>Dpn</i>1 for 4 hr at 37\u00b0C to remove vector template, and concentrated by isopropanol precipitation. The concentrated products were then run on a 1% agarose gel for size selection. The 12 kb was visualized using blue light and extracted using a clean razor blade. The product was purified using Qiagen Gel Extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions. 50 ng of the purified products was self-ligated using 400 U T4 DNA ligase (NEB) to circularize the vectors in 20 \u03bcl at 16\u00b0C overnight. 4 \u03bcl of the reaction products were transformed into <i>Escherichia coli</i> TOP10 chemically competent cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions, and transformed cells were plated on LB + carbenicillin plates.

Although back-splicing to generate exon circles has long been described, recent studies have shown that these circles are common and often abundant gene products of largely unknown function. The authors here examine structural features that give rise to a back-spliced exon circle in <i>S. pombe</i> derived from exon 2 of the <i>mrps16</i> transcript. Previous results with metazoan exons indicated that RNA base-pairing interactions between sequences flanking an exon can enhance circle formation. However, many exons including <i>mrps16</i> exon 2 do not appear to have such an intron pairing interaction. Instead, splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 leads to a lariat intron containing exon 2 and the authors show that this serves as the precursor for circle formation. This pathway predicts that back-splicing of exon 2 within the lariat will yield a doubly branched RNA product containing the two flanking introns. Using a series of RT/PCR reactions with primers diagnostic of different RNA structures, as well as assaying the sensitivity of the products to various nucleases, they define many of the expected RNA products of the <i>mrps16</i> gene. RT/PCR around the lariat loop in a debranching deficient strain indicates that the exon-skipped lariat is produced. The Exon 1-Exon 3 spliced product is not detected, presumably due to nuclear or cytoplasmic decay (although it would be nice to show this). A final pair of primers produces a product with both branchpoint-5' splice site junctions, indicating that the doubly branched RNA lacking exon 2 is indeed produced. Mutation of the branchpoint upstream from exon 3 greatly reduces formation of the exon 2 circle indicating that formation of a lariat this site is a prerequisite of circle formation. Mutation of some of the other sites is complicated by cryptic splice site activation. Experiments with another circle derived from the <i>pub1</i> gene indicate that it is also formed from a lariat intermediate. Analysis of a debranchase deficient strain indicates increased circle formation genomewide in the absence of the debranching enzyme, including from the <i>mrps16</i> locus. However, the authors show for several other cases in <i>S. pombe</i> that exon skipping does not always lead to circle formation. They find that the skipped exons that do not produce circles are shorter than circle generating exons. A 90 nucleotide deletion within exon 2 greatly reduced circle formation. To further test the effect of exon length, they make a library of deletions within exon 2 and measure circularization relative to deletion size, finding a very rough increase in circle formation with longer exons. From these data, they conclude that both the formation of an exon-containing lariat by exon skipping, and the exon length contribute to frequency of back-splicing to form an exon circle."

The identification of a doubly branched product from exon circularization is a striking and new finding that will influence the interpretation of other studies of exon circles. These data serve as a nice counterpoint to a recent paper in Cell, reporting that base pairing interactions between flanking introns can contribute to exon circle formation. As the authors point out, the exon-containing lariat may be a relevant feature when the introns are short, and secondary structure may contribute in some cases where the introns are long. However, it is not ruled out that the base-pairing in introns leads to exon skipping and hence to a similar pathway to that described here. Neither a base pairing interaction nor an exon-containing lariat seem to be a universal requirement; There still seem to be many circles that don't have either one. The exon length data was much less convincing, with few solid conclusions. The demonstration of the exon containing lariat as the precursor to the exon circle and the identification of the double branch product after circularization are results of significant interest for RNA biology. There are a number of aspects of this study that the reviewers felt should be improved."

Moreover, there are other possible effects of these mutations that do not seem to have been explored. First, it is not clear that circularization should vary continuously with length. Perhaps there is a minimum size below which an exon cannot be circularized. In fact looking at the plot, there might be such a discontinuity as their deletion reaches 100 bp. The authors also do not control for other effects that these deletions might have. One could imagine that a deletion simply removes a specific sequence required by the splicing machinery to successfully back-splice. This possibility might be controlled for by adding back different sequences to restore the length while maintaining the loss of elements specific to exon 2. Conversely, a deletion might eliminate exon skipping altogether. If the mutant exon 2 is very efficiently spliced, there may be no substrate for back splicing. This also could be examined."

Perhaps there is a minimum size below which an exon cannot be circularized. In fact looking at the plot, there might be such a discontinuity as their deletion reaches 100 bp. The authors also do not control for other effects that these deletions might have. One could imagine that a deletion simply removes a specific sequence required by the splicing machinery to successfully back-splice. This possibility might be controlled for by adding back different sequences to restore the length while maintaining the loss of elements specific to exon 2. Conversely, a deletion might eliminate exon skipping altogether. If the mutant exon 2 is very efficiently spliced, there may be no substrate for back splicing. This also could be examined</i>."

Both our analysis of endogenous circular RNA expression in other organisms (such as human, see <a href=\"#bib27\">Salzman et al<i>.</i>, 2013</a>) and mutations in <i>mrps16</i> support the idea that exons smaller than 100nt can circularize. For example, the \u220690 nt (total exon length=91 nt) <i>mrps16</i> exon 2 isoform we analyzed by clonal analysis does form a circle, although at a much lower efficiency. Also, to address your last point, for this clone, we have analyzed the abundance of the lariat precursor production as well as splicing of the linear products exon1\u2013exon 2 and exon 2\u2013exon 3 by qPCR, which we now discuss in the manuscript."

This model would suggest that all deletions which contain deletions of a particular sequence motif (the one facilitating backsplicing) would result in attenuation of circular RNA abundance. We have specifically tested this model, and found it failed to fit the data. We included a figure that demonstrates this (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 5</a>). We have also considered impacts of sequence deletions on structural properties of the <i>mrps16</i> circular RNA, discussed in the last section of the paper.
