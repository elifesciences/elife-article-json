However, little is known about how CTFs are governed during cell cycle progression. Here, we demonstrate that the regulation of Oct4 by Aurora kinase b (Aurkb)/protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) during the cell cycle is important for resetting Oct4 to pluripotency and cell cycle genes in determining the identity of ESCs. Aurkb phosphorylates Oct4(S229) during G2/M phase, leading to the dissociation of Oct4 from chromatin, whereas PP1 binds Oct4 and dephosphorylates Oct4(S229) during M/G1 transition, which resets Oct4-driven transcription for pluripotency and the cell cycle. Aurkb phosphor-mimetic and PP1 binding-deficient mutations in Oct4 alter the cell cycle, effect the loss of pluripotency in ESCs, and decrease the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming. Our findings provide evidence that the cell cycle is linked directly to pluripotency programs in ESCs."

However, little is known about how CTFs are governed during cell cycle progression. Here, we demonstrate that the regulation of Oct4 by Aurora kinase b (Aurkb)/protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) during the cell cycle is important for resetting Oct4 to pluripotency and cell cycle genes in determining the identity of ESCs. Aurkb phosphorylates Oct4(S229) during G2/M phase, leading to the dissociation of Oct4 from chromatin, whereas PP1 binds Oct4 and dephosphorylates Oct4(S229) during M/G1 transition, which resets Oct4-driven transcription for pluripotency and the cell cycle. Aurkb phosphor-mimetic and PP1 binding-deficient mutations in Oct4 alter the cell cycle, effect the loss of pluripotency in ESCs, and decrease the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming. Our findings provide evidence that the cell cycle is linked directly to pluripotency programs in ESCs."

The duration of G1 in mouse ESCs and human ESCs determines their fate with regard to differentiation and pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coronado et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mummery et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</a>). A recent study revealed that the S and G2 phases tend to maintain the pluripotent state at early time of differentiation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gonzales et al., 2015</a>). Thus, cell cycle regulation in ESCs should be linked to pluripotency in maintaining ESC identity."

Specifically, PP1 mediates the M/G1 transition and ensures proper resetting of the subsequent G1 phase by dephosphorylating cell cycle machinery (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ceulemans and Bollen, 2004</a>). When the cell cycle resets, transcriptional programs for ESC pluripotency should be reset, because transcriptional programs are generally switched off at the onset of mitosis and subsequently reestablished during entry into the next G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delcuve et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Egli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Martinez-Balbas et al., 1995</a>).

We found that Oct4 contains a well-conserved Aurkb phosphorylation residue (S229) and PP1 binding motif (RVXF) in its homeodomain. Aurkb phosphorylates Oct4(S229) during G2/M phase and dissociates p-Oct4(S229) from chromatin, and PP1 dephosphorylates p-Oct4(S229) during the M/G1 transition, which prompts Oct4 to reset pluripotency transcription on re-entry into the following G1 phase. We found that mutating the Aurkb-phosphorylation residue S229 and the PP1-binding residue F271 of Oct4 in ESCs led to a significant loss of pluripotency and altered the cell cycle. Transduction of these mutants into MEFs significantly decreased the reprogramming efficiency."

Oct4 binding to both genes on chromatin was weakly sustained in G2/M phase and rapidly increased during the M/G1 transition (0.5\u2009hr after release into normal serum), and thereafter Oct4 binding is either saturated or declined, while induced Oct4 binding to both genes during the M/G1 transition were relatively retarded when cells were released into normal serum with treatment of OKA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Likewise, nascent RNA levels of <i>Bub1</i> and <i>Rif1</i> were downregulated when cells were arrested in G2/M phase and upregulated during the M/G1 transition, but rapid increase of nascent RNA levels of both genes during entry into G1 phase was retarded by OKA treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

In consistent with this report, when we released G2/M arrested E14 mouse embryonic stem cells, H3S10p levels retained highly through S-G2/M phase (7-10 hrs after release) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that it is hard to distinguish G2 from M phase of stem cells with a mitotic marker (H3S10p). Next, to examine weather Oct4 binding to target genes is dependent on physical condensation of chromatin as reviewer commented in question #5, we chased p-Oct4 level and binding of Oct4 to target genes throughout the S-G2/M phase, (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). As a result, binding of Oct4 to target chromatin started to decline at S-G2/M phase (7-9 hr after release) and increased at the M/G1 transition (10hr after release) in parallel with the p-Oct4(S229) level. Based on this finding, we suggest that dissociation of phosphorylated Oct4 from chromatin proceeds to mitotic chromatin condensation. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer\u2019s opinion that M phase chromatin condensation partly contributes to the ejection of Oct4 from chromatin."

In consistent with this report, when we released G2/M arrested E14 mouse embryonic stem cells, H3S10p levels retained highly through S-G2/M phase (7-10 hrs after release) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that it is hard to distinguish G2 from M phase of stem cells with a mitotic marker (H3S10p). Next, to examine weather Oct4 binding to target genes is dependent on physical condensation of chromatin as reviewer commented in question #5, we chased p-Oct4 level and binding of Oct4 to target genes throughout the S-G2/M phase, (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>\u2014figure supplement A and B). As a result, binding of Oct4 to target chromatin started to decline at S-G2/M phase (7-9 hr after release) and increased at the M/G1 transition (10hr after release) in parallel with the p-Oct4(S229) level. Based on this finding, we suggest that dissociation of phosphorylated Oct4 from chromatin proceeds to mitotic chromatin condensation. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer\u2019s opinion that M phase chromatin condensation partly contributes to the ejection of Oct4 from chromatin."

Usually, Aurkb in cancer cells is activated during G2/M phase by INCENP-hespin kinase. In addition, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Aurkb is reported to be active during S-G2/M phase (Mallm and Rippe, 2015). We also showed that Aurkb begin to phosphorylate Oct4 at S phase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, to activate Aurkb completely, Aurkb should binds and phosphorylates to INCENP (Carmena et al., 2012), implying that constitutively-active Aurkb does not exist. Therefore, we do not believe that Aurkb can be activated during G1 interphase. Thus, we showed that Oct4(S229D), a mimic of Aurkb-phosphorylating Oct4, retards the resetting at G1 phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), which hopefully answers the reviewer\u2019s question."

This effect can be explained with O-GlcNacylation of Oct4. In our previous study about significance of serine 228 O-GlcNacylation of Oct4 to maintaining pluripotency (Jang et al., 2012), we found that Oct4 (S229A) mutation led to significant reduction of Oct4-O-GlcNAcylation which is critical for Oct4 activity, thereby S229A may reduce DNA binding of Oct4 and reprogramming efficiency."
