                    "text": "Cellular senescence is a crucial tumor suppressor mechanism. We discovered a CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 repressor complex required to prevent senescence in primary cells and mouse embryos. Critical, previously unknown roles for CAPER\u03b1 in controlling cell proliferation are manifest in an obligatory interaction with TBX3 to regulate chromatin structure and repress transcription of <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> and the RB pathway. The IncRNA <i>UCA1</i> is a direct target of CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 repression whose overexpression is sufficient to induce senescence. In proliferating cells, we found that hnRNPA1 binds and destabilizes <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> mRNA whereas during senescence, <i>UCA1</i> sequesters hnRNPA1 and thus stabilizes <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup>. Thus CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 and <i>UCA1</i> constitute a coordinated, reinforcing mechanism to regulate both <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> transcription and mRNA stability. Dissociation of the CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 co-repressor during oncogenic stress activates <i>UCA1</i>, revealing a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced senescence. Our elucidation of CAPER\u03b1 and <i>UCA1</i> functions in vivo provides new insights into senescence induction, and the oncogenic and developmental properties of TBX3."

We discovered a CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 repressor complex required to prevent senescence in primary cells and mouse embryos. Critical, previously unknown roles for CAPER\u03b1 in controlling cell proliferation are manifest in an obligatory interaction with TBX3 to regulate chromatin structure and repress transcription of <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> and the RB pathway. The IncRNA <i>UCA1</i> is a direct target of CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 repression whose overexpression is sufficient to induce senescence. In proliferating cells, we found that hnRNPA1 binds and destabilizes <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> mRNA whereas during senescence, <i>UCA1</i> sequesters hnRNPA1 and thus stabilizes <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup>. Thus CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 and <i>UCA1</i> constitute a coordinated, reinforcing mechanism to regulate both <i>CDKN2A-p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> transcription and mRNA stability. Dissociation of the CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 co-repressor during oncogenic stress activates <i>UCA1</i>, revealing a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced senescence. Our elucidation of CAPER\u03b1 and <i>UCA1</i> functions in vivo provides new insights into senescence induction, and the oncogenic and developmental properties of TBX3."

One such quality control mechanism is called senescence, which stops the growth and multiplication of cells that are old, damaged or behaving in ways that may harm the organism.

We hypothesized that Tbx3 may prevent senescence of embryonic cells, and so examined murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from e13.5 wild type (WT) and <i>Tbx3</i> null (\u2212/\u2212) embryos. WT MEFs undergo \u223c10 passages with regular, 20 hr doubling times. In contrast, <i>Tbx3\u2212/\u2212</i> MEFs had increased SA-\u03b2gal activity and ceased proliferating after only four passages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2N\u2013Q</a>). Most <i>Tbx3\u2212/\u2212</i> MEFs had distorted or ruptured nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>) and lamin\u03b21 staining was already altered at passage 1 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2032</a>). <i>Caper\u03b1</i> null mutant embryos do not survive long enough to generate MEFs for complementary experiments (Emechebe and Moon, unpublished) however, Caper\u03b1 localization is markedly abnormal in <i>Tbx3\u2212/\u2212</i> MEFS after only 1 passage (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3D\u2013F\u2032</a>). These data suggest that Tbx3 is required for preservation of nuclear architecture and to tether Caper\u03b1 in its normal nuclear domains in proliferating cells."

Thus, we expected that loss of p53 would rescue senescence resulting from TBX3 or CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> KD. To test this, we transduced TBX3 and CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> KD HFFs with shRNA to p53 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Masutomi et al., 2003</a>) and assayed SA-\u03b2gal activity and growth. Surprisingly, although p53 shRNA effectively decreased p53 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), it did not rescue SA-\u03b2gal activity or growth arrest due to absence of TBX3 or CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,E,G,H</a>). In contrast, shRNA-mediated KD of either RB (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boehm et al., 2005</a>) or p16 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Haga et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) rescued these phenotypes in TBX3 and CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> KD cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F\u2013H,I\u2013N</a>).

In this study, we provide compelling evidence for critical and novel functions of CAPER\u03b1, the lncRNA <i>UCA1</i> and TBX3 in the regulation of cell proliferation and senescence. We have discovered a CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 complex that is required to prevent senescence of primary human and mouse cells in vivo and that functions as a master regulator of cell proliferation by directly repressing transcription of lncRNA <i>UCA1</i>, <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> and other tumor suppressor genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7P</a>). Overexpression of <i>UCA1</i> occurs after loss of TBX3/CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> and in OIS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Q</a>), and is itself sufficient to induce senescence at least in part, by disrupting the interaction of <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> mRNA with hnRNP A1 leading to increased <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> mRNA stability (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7P,Q</a>). Disrupting the CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 complex by decreasing the amount of either TBX3 or CAPER<i>\u03b1</i>, or by CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> mislocalization during OIS, coordinately increases activity of multiple pro-senescence targets at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in a reinforcing mechanism."

It is likely that anti- or pro- oncogenic activity of CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> is determined by cell type and the interacting protein(s) present in a given context; our results suggest that CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> has oncogenic potential in primary cells since loss of CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 induces premature senescence, a vital tumor suppressor mechanism. CAPER<i>\u03b1</i> binds to regulatory chromatin domains via TBX3 but dissociates from these domains and becomes concentrated in large intranuclear foci prior to senescence induced by loss of TBX3 or during OIS. Future efforts will define the composition of CAPER + nuclear foci and the role of this nuclear subdomain during senescence induction."

Although there has been a logarithmic increase in studies exploring lncRNA expression and activity, potential senescence-regulating activities are still largely unexplored.

In the case of <i>UCA1</i> and hnRNP A1 however, the sequestration has a very specific effect: even though <i>UCA1</i> expression stabilizes (and hnRNP A1 destabilizes) both <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> and <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup> mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), <i>UCA1</i> only disrupts the association of hnRNP A1 with <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK</i></sup> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Embryos were washed in sterile PBS in 60-mm tissue culture dish at room temperature and transferred into 15-ml sterile falcon tube containing 1 ml of 50% trypsin in DMEM medium. Embryos were minced using fine scissors followed by gentle pipetting with 1 ml pipette tips and dispersed into cell suspensions in 5 min. Suspensions were plated into 10-cm plates in 10 ml of DMEM with 5% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin and incubated for 8 hr in CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every day for 3 days. Passage 0 refers to the stage when cell suspension from the embryos was put into cell culture and subsequent passages are numbered."

They document the existence of a Caper-TBX3 complex and then show that it is required to prevent senescence. They go on to demonstrate that the Caper-Tbx3 functions to prevent senescence by repression of p16 and RB family members. Most interestingly, they show that Caper-Tbx3 targets and repress a long non-coding RNA, UCA1, and that over-expression of UCA1 is sufficient to induce senescence. They provide evidence that p16 mRNA is bound and destabilized by hnRNP A1 and that UCA1 stabilizes p16 mRNA by sequestering hnRNP A1. Activated Ras, which induces senescence in primary cells, disrupts and inactivates the Caper-TBX3 corepressor resulting in UCA1 expression and senescence induction."

We assayed whether there was a correlation between the ability to detect CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 interaction by co-IP and the type of tissue (normal breast, Invasive ductal CA, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, other carcinoma) or hormone receptor status. We did not observe any correlation however, these data are too preliminary to draw any conclusions because: 1) the sample size was small; 2) we are unable to perform immunohistochemistry on the available samples due to how they were preserved; 3) we do not have the ability to determine how heterogeneous the samples were. For these reasons, we have not included this data in the present manuscript. In the future, we hope to obtain funding for a study to examine CAPER\u03b1 and TBX3 immunostaining and interaction in a larger clinical sample in which we have more detailed clinical information, and detailed tumor and control histo- and immune- pathology for each patient."

Numerous overexpression studies have suggested a role for TBX3 in breast cancer initiation and progression (reviewed in [15, 16]) and recent papers have reported the tumorigenic and proinvasive effects of overexpressed TBX3 in melanoma cells [17, 18] which may in part result from repression of E-cadherin expression [19]. More relevant to our work on the importance of the CAPER\u03b1/TBX3 complex to prevent senescence and regulate cell proliferation are studies reporting that Tbx3 improves the pluripotency of iPS cells [20] and prevents differentiation of mouse ES cells [21]. As of this writing, we have found no other studies directed at the role of TBX3 in repressing senescence in primary cells or <i>in vivo</i> and this is one of the important contributions of our manuscript.
