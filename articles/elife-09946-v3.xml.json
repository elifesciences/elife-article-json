We have characterized how the Frizzled and Dachsous-Fat PCP systems are connected through the Spiny-legs isoform of the Prickle-Spiny-legs locus. Two different components of the Dachsous-Fat system, Dachsous and Dachs, can each independently interact with Spiny-legs and direct its localization in vivo. Through characterization of the contributions of Prickle, Spiny-legs, Dachsous, Fat, and Dachs to PCP in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing, eye, and abdomen, we define where Dachs-Spiny-legs and Dachsous-Spiny-legs interactions contribute to PCP, and provide a new understanding of the orientation of polarity and the basis of PCP phenotypes. Our results support the direct linkage of PCP systems through Sple in specific locales, while emphasizing that cells can be subject to and must ultimately resolve distinct, competing PCP signals."

We have characterized how the Frizzled and Dachsous-Fat PCP systems are connected through the Spiny-legs isoform of the Prickle-Spiny-legs locus. Two different components of the Dachsous-Fat system, Dachsous and Dachs, can each independently interact with Spiny-legs and direct its localization in vivo. Through characterization of the contributions of Prickle, Spiny-legs, Dachsous, Fat, and Dachs to PCP in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing, eye, and abdomen, we define where Dachs-Spiny-legs and Dachsous-Spiny-legs interactions contribute to PCP, and provide a new understanding of the orientation of polarity and the basis of PCP phenotypes. Our results support the direct linkage of PCP systems through Sple in specific locales, while emphasizing that cells can be subject to and must ultimately resolve distinct, competing PCP signals."

The asymmetry is established at the level of single cells when proteins are not equally spread throughout a cell, but rather asymmetrically distributed. Such cells are said to be \u2018planar polarized\u2019; and many experiments addressing this so-called planar cell polarity have been conducted in fruit flies, because they can be genetically altered easily. Previous studies have shown that two signaling pathways\u2014called Frizzled and Dachsous-Fat\u2014regulate how individual cells orient themselves within a flat sheet of cells that forms fruit fly\u2019s wing. The two pathways are not independent, but it is unclear how they are linked. In particular, there has been conflicting evidence as to whether the Dachsous-Fat pathway controls the Frizzled pathway or whether the two act in parallel."

This protein was known to be important in the Frizzled pathway, but, when it was tracked with a fluorescent tag in developing wing cells it also accumulated in areas where two proteins that make up part of the Dachsous-Fat pathway were located. Biochemical experiments showed that both of these proteins (which are called Dachs or Dachsous) could physically interact with Spiny-legs. Ambegaonkar and Irvine therefore deleted the genes for Dachs or Dachsous in fruit flies and observed that Spiny-legs no longer organized itself in the proper way, implying that Dachs and Dachsous control where Spiny-legs goes within cells."

Additionally, the Frizzled and Dachsous-Fat pathways seemed to compete for interactions with Spiny-legs. This connection between the two pathways helps to explain how cells behave when several different signals reach them. It also shows how different organs can reuse conserved components of the pathways to make different end products. Future studies should aim to work out the number of systems that polarize cells and how they are connected in different tissues."

Manifestations of PCP include the orientation of hairs, bristles, stereocilia, and ommatidia, as well as orientated cell divisions and cell movements. Two conserved molecular systems play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of PCP: the Frizzled (Fz) PCP pathway and the Dachsous (Ds)-Fat PCP pathway (<a href=\"#bib25\">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matis and Axelrod, 2013</a>). These involve distinct components, but share common features, including the polarized localization of key components within cells, and the existence of asymmetric intercellular interactions that enable this polarity to be propagated from cell to cell. Many processes are influenced by both PCP systems, but the relationship between them has been controversial."

According to this hypothesis, the Ds-Fat pathway acts as a \u2018global module\u2019 that provides long-range directional information through tissue-wide Fj and Ds gradients, whereas the Fz pathway acts as a \u2018core module\u2019 that establishes robust polarization that can propagate locally, and effects cellular polarity. This suggestion was challenged by observations that clones of cells mutant for or over-expressing <i>ds, fj</i> or <i>fat</i> in the abdomen can affect PCP non-autonomously even in the absence of Fz pathway components (<a href=\"#bib12\">Casal et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, in the abdomen, combining mutations in both Ds-Fat and Fz pathway genes can have more severe effects on PCP than single mutants, suggesting that these pathways can act in parallel (<a href=\"#bib12\">Casal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Donoughe and DiNardo, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Repiso et al., 2010</a>).

The Pk-Sple locus produces two functional isoforms: Prickle (Pk) and Spiny-legs (Sple), which share a common, LIM-domain containing C-terminus, but unique N-termini (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Gubb et al., 1999</a>). These isoforms have distinct roles: for example, mutations that only affect <i>pk</i> disrupt PCP in the wing and notum, but not in the eye and leg, whereas mutations that only affect <i>sple</i> exhibit a complementary specificity. The observations that mutations that affect both isoforms (<i>pk-sple</i>) have milder effects on PCP than isoform-specific alleles in the wing, notum, and leg, and that over-expression of Sple or Pk leads to PCP phenotypes reminiscent of loss-of-function of <i>pk</i>, or <i>sple</i>, respectively, led to the suggestion that a balance between Pk and Sple isoforms is necessary for normal PCP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gubb et al., 1999</a>). Studies of PCP establishment in the pupal wing revealed that it occurs in distinct phases, and suggested that influences of Sple are correlated with influences of the Ds-Fat pathway (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hogan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Merkel et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, examination of PCP protein localization revealed that a coupling between the polarization of components of the Ds-Fat and Fz systems could be induced by expression of Sple (<a href=\"#bib44\">Merkel et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, in the abdomen, the Fj and Ds gradients are oriented oppositely within anterior (A) versus posterior (P) compartments of each segment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Casal et al., 2002</a>). Since hairs always point posteriorly, this led to the suggestion that there could exist a \u2018rectification\u2019 mechanism, which would reverse the influence of these gradients on hair polarity. The observations that Sple over-expression reverses polarity in P compartments, and that <i>pk-sple</i> mutants reverse polarity in part of the A compartment, led to the suggestion that Pk and Sple might be involved in this rectification (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lawrence et al., 2004</a>)."

It was reported that Dachs could directly interact with Pk and Sple, and that Ds and Dachs could influence Sple localization in wing discs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al., 2014</a>). It has also been proposed that Pk-Sple could connect PCP pathways through an influence on microtubule orientation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>). Vesicles containing Fz and Dsh have been observed to move along apical non-centrosomal microtubules towards the distal side of wing cells, with the proximal-distal alignment of microtubules and consequent directional transport of Fz pathway components dependent upon the Ds-Fat pathway (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harumoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Matis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shimada et al., 2006</a>). Pk and Sple also influence the orientation of apical microtubules, such that the plus ends of microtubules are preferentially found at either the high end or the low end of the Ds gradient, depending on whether Pk or Sple, respectively, is the predominant isoform (<a href=\"#bib43\">Matis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>). Relative differences in expression of isoforms consistent with their distinct requirements have also been reported: Pk at higher levels than Sple in larval wing discs, and Sple at higher levels than Pk in eye discs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Merkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>).

We also extend understanding of the relationship between Ds-Fat and Fz PCP pathways by identifying organ and region-specific differences in their interactions, and illustrate how this relationship between pathways can explain poorly understood features of PCP mutant phenotypes. Our results establish control of Sple localization as a key mechanism by which the Ds-Fat pathway coordinates with Fz to influence PCP, and enhance our understanding of how PCP is coordinated in developing tissues."

To investigate whether this shared localization could reflect physical association, we assayed for co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins expressed in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, V5-tagged Dachs could co-immunoprecipitate Flag-tagged Sple (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lane 1). Dachs and Sple interact through the unique N-terminus of Sple, because Dachs also co-precipitated a construct comprising only the Sple N-terminus (Sple-N), but did not co-precipitate a full length Pk construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lanes 2 and 3). Interaction with Ds was investigated by expressing a construct comprising the entire intracellular domain of Ds (Ds-ICD). Both Sple and Sple-N also interacted with Ds-ICD, whereas Pk did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lanes 4\u20136). We note that <a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al. (2014)</a> similarly reported an ability of Dachs to interact with Sple, based on co-immunoprecipitation of proteins expressed in human HEK293 cells. However, our results differ in that they reported that Dachs could also interact with Pk, whereas we could not detect any interaction between Pk and Dachs above non-specific background (defined by precipitation observed using GFP:V5 instead of Dachs:V5, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>,\u00a0lane 11). Also, <a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al. (2014)</a> reported that they could detect an interaction between Sple-N and Ds-ICD, but could not detect an interaction between Ds-ICD and full length Sple, leading them to suggest a requirement for other components such as Dachs, whereas we did detect this interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lane 4). Altogether, our results establish that Dachs and Ds can each independently interact with Sple, and that they do so through its unique N-terminal region."

The observation of unpolarized GFP:Sple is consistent with the inference that Dachs can localize GFP:Sple, because Dachs is localized to all membranes in an unpolarized fashion in <i>ds</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</a>). Dachs is similarly localized to the membrane in an unpolarized fashion in <i>fat</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mao et al., 2006</a>), and we always observed unpolarized membrane localization of GFP:Sple in <i>fat</i> mutant wing discs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

This implies that the distal localization of GFP:Sple here in <i>dachs</i> mutants is Ds-dependent, and hence that Dachs and Ds each have the ability to independently localize GFP:Sple. Thus, in proximal cells, where Ds expression is higher, Dachs and Ds could provide redundant localization cues for GFP:Sple. In distal cells, by contrast, we suggest that Dachs could be required for GFP:Sple localization because Ds expression is too low. In <i>ds</i> or <i>fat</i> mutants, Dachs is mis-localized, and Ds is either absent (in <i>ds</i> mutants) or unpolarized with reduced junctional accumulation (in <i>fat</i> mutants) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ma et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</a>), and consequently GFP:Sple becomes mis-localized. Finally, in the absence of both Dachs and Ds localization cues, as in <i>fat dachs</i> or <i>ds dachs</i> mutants, GFP:Sple follows Pk localization cues. In principle this could occur either because Sple is able to respond directly to the same cues as Pk through shared motifs, or because Sple can bind to Pk. The observation that GFP:Sple localized proximally in <i>dachs pk</i> mutant wing discs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) indicates that Sple can respond to Pk localization cues even in the absence of Pk. Localization of Pk was not visibly altered within larval wing discs by <i>dachs, ds,</i> or <i>fat</i> mutations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Fz-PCP is not required for distal localization of Sple, as GFP:Sple remains preferentially distal in <i>vang</i> mutant wing discs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Cytoplasmic levels of Sple were also visibly increased in <i>vang</i> mutants, consistent with studies of the influence of Vang on Pk levels (<a href=\"#bib66\">Strutt et al., 2013</a>)."

Also, they did not report observing the difference in localization of Sple between distal and proximal regions of <i>dachs</i> mutants, which we determined reflects a Dachs-independent regulation of Sple by Ds.

The observation that Pk and Sple can localize in opposite directions, whereas wing hairs normally point in a single direction, implies that cells must ultimately choose which of these two distinct localization cues to follow. Normally, they choose the Pk cue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), presumably because the Pk isoform is more abundant than the Sple isoform in the wing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Merkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>), and hence it dictates polarization. Indeed, if Sple is over-expressed, then hair polarity is reversed even more strongly than in <i>pk</i> mutants, and can align with Ds-Fat PCP (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Doyle et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gubb et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Merkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>), and the expression of GFP:Sple in clones is sufficient to alter wing hair polarity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These observations suggest that wing hair polarity in <i>pk</i> mutants could be directed by the Ds-Fat pathway dependent polarization of Sple (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As this linkage in most of the wing depends upon <i>dachs</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>), this hypothesis predicts that the <i>pk</i> wing hair polarity phenotype should be suppressed by <i>dachs</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Indeed, when we tested this by comparing wing hair and bristle orientation in <i>pk</i> versus <i>dachs pk</i> mutants, this suppression was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013J</a>). This result can also explain the observation that over-expression of Fat could suppress the <i>pk</i> hair polarity phenotype (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hogan et al., 2011</a>), because over-expression of Fat removes Dachs from the membrane (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mao et al., 2006</a>), which, as Dachs functions at membranes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rauskolb et al., 2011</a>), is functionally equivalent to <i>dachs</i> mutation."

However, as hair polarity in the wing is normally Pk-dependent rather than Sple-dependent, and as we found that Ds-Fat PCP in the wing influences Sple localization but not Pk localization, we considered an alternative model: rather than reflecting a normal role in directing hair polarity, these phenotypes of <i>fat</i> and <i>ds</i> could stem from the inappropriate accumulation of Dachs, leading to inappropriate localization of Sple, which in some contexts could interfere with the normal Pk-dependent polarization cues (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, <i>ds</i> hair polarity phenotypes are suppressed by <i>dachs</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>), and we confirmed that <i>fat</i> wing hair polarity phenotypes (generated using wing-specific RNAi) are also suppressed by <i>dachs</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This hypothesis further predicts that <i>fat</i> PCP phenotypes could be suppressed by <i>sple</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and while we did not observe completely normal hair polarity in <i>fat sple</i> wings, we did observe a partial suppression, including restoration of normal, distally oriented polarity in two regions affected by loss of Fat: near the proximal anterior wing margin, and near the anterior cross-vein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B,K\u2013N</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, when Hippo pathway phenotypes of <i>fat</i> are rescued by Warts over-expression, wing polarity remains abnormal in the proximal wing (<a href=\"#bib23\">Feng and Irvine, 2007</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, while Sple is not required for normal wing hair polarity, it mediates a connection between Ds-Fat and Fz pathways that contributes to abnormal hair polarity in the absence of <i>fat</i>."

The eight photoreceptor cells within each ommatidia are arranged in a characteristic pattern that comes in two chiral forms. This chirality is determined by which of two neighboring photoreceptors becomes the R3 cell and which becomes R4. This decision is dependent upon Notch signaling, which is biased by Fz PCP such that the cell at the R3-R4 interface with higher Fz becomes R3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cooper and Bray, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fanto and Mlodzik, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Strutt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tomlinson and Struhl, 1999</a>). The two chiral forms are established in mirror symmetry with respect to the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary, termed the equator (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In <i>sple</i> mutants, ommatidial chirality is randomized, whereas in <i>pk</i> mutant eyes ommatidial chirality is normal (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gubb et al., 1999</a>). Ds and Fj are expressed in complementary gradients in the eye (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and experiments manipulating Ds and Fj expression have revealed that these gradients instruct normal polarity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Simon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zeidler et al., 1999</a>). However, the relationship between Fz and Ds-Fat PCP pathways in the eye and how this influences polarity has remained unclear. Also, in contrast to the wing and abdomen, where <i>dachs</i> mutation suppresses <i>fat</i> PCP phenotypes, <i>dachs</i> mutation has little effect on <i>fat</i> PCP phenotypes in the eye (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sharma and McNeill, 2013</a>). We hypothesized that the influence of Ds-Fat PCP on ommatidial polarity might be accounted for by an ability of Ds to polarize Sple independently of <i>dachs</i>, as in the proximal wing."

We analyzed GFP:Sple localization at the 5-cell precluster stage of ommatidial formation, when R3-R4 specification occurs. GFP:Sple localized to the equatorial side of cells within both R3 and R4, which places it within R4 at the R3-R4 interface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Equatorial polarization of Sple co-localizes it with Vang (<a href=\"#bib61\">Strutt, 2001</a>), and is consistent with the observation that it interacts with Ds, since Ds is also polarized to the equatorial side of cells in the eye disc (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>). This equatorial polarization of Sple was disrupted in <i>ds</i> or <i>fat</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,E</a>), but was not affected by mutation of <i>dachs</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), nor could <i>dachs</i> mutation prevent the mis-localization of Sple in <i>ds</i> or <i>fat</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,F</a>).

In such cases, equatorial polarization of Pk would not come about because it directly responds to an equatorial-polar signal like Ds, but rather because it can interact with Sple and/or Vang, which recruit it to equatorial cell junctions. In support of this, we found that in <i>sple</i> mutants, Pk localization is altered such that it becomes partially randomized, resembling Sple localization in <i>fat</i> or <i>ds</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>).

The morphogenetic furrow is a source of local signals for multiple pathways, including Notch, Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic, which might, indirectly at least, influence Fz PCP orientation in these mutant eye discs, as they have been implicated in influencing PCP in other contexts (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sagner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Struhl et al., 1997</a>).

However, the observation of a distinct localization for GFP:Pk in front of the furrow suggested that the timing of GFP:Pk expression might be important. Polarization of GFP:Pk or GFP:Sple is examined in clones induced 1 day before dissection, as it is scored in ommatidia in which these transgenes are expressed only in R3 or only in R4. These clones are induced when cells are in or behind the furrow. When we examined PCP in eye discs, using Prospero and Elav to stain ommatidia, PCP appeared unaffected by clones expressing GFP:Pk for one day (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). By contrast, within 3-day-old clones, which would have been initiated in front of the morphogenetic furrow, PCP was disturbed (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

To determine whether the abnormal polarity could be explained by mis-localization of Dachs and/or Ds, and a consequent mis-localization of Sple and/or Pk, we assessed both genetic interactions and protein localization. The disruption of polarity within A compartments in <i>fat</i> or <i>ds</i> mutants was correlated with mis-localization of Dachs throughout the A compartment (mostly uniform Dachs in <i>fat</i> mutants, and randomized Dachs in <i>ds</i> mutants, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8A,K</a>), and mis-localization of Sple everywhere except the most anterior region of the A compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8B</a>). Moreover, mutation of <i>dachs</i> suppressed the hair polarity phenotypes of <i>fat</i> and <i>ds</i> in A compartments (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9C,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">10C,G</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Mao et al., 2006</a>), and also suppressed the mis-localization of Sple (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6F,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8D</a>). These observations suggest that <i>ds</i> and <i>fat</i> polarity phenotypes in the anterior abdomen can be accounted for by a Dachs-dependent mis-localization of Sple, as we had observed in the wing. Mutation of <i>dachs</i> alone does not disrupt polarity in A compartments (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9B</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">10B</a>). It could be that in the absence of Dachs and Ds, Sple is localized by the same cues that localize Pk, as Pk localization remained normal within A compartments of <i>ft</i> or <i>ds</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F,K</a>)."

However, mutation of <i>dachs</i> alone causes a reversal of hair polarity in P compartments (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9B</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">10B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</a>). This reversal of polarity is associated with a reversal of Pk localization (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,K</a>). The P compartment of the abdomen thus differs from other regions we have examined both in that there is a strong PCP phenotype associated with mutation of <i>dachs</i>, and in the mis-localization of Pk in <i>dachs</i> mutants. One potential explanation for this could be that in the absence of Dachs, Pk localization becomes governed by Sple, which retains its normal posterior localization in <i>dachs</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6G</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8C</a>). In <i>dachs sple</i> mutants, Pk was partially randomized, but an overall posterior bias in localization was still observed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In <i>dachs sple</i> or <i>dachs pk</i> mutant abdomens, there is still some reversal of hair polarity in P compartments, although the region of reversal appears narrow than in <i>dachs</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F,H</a>). Pk localization is also disturbed in P compartments of <i>fat</i> or <i>ds</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F,K</a>), as well as in <i>fat dachs</i> or <i>ds dachs</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H,J,K</a>). Thus, while there are some similarities in control of PCP between abdominal P compartments and wings, there are also differences, hence distinct mechanisms contribute to the control PCP in each of these body regions."

We found that both Dachs and Ds can each independently bind to Sple, but not Pk, through the unique N-terminus of Sple. Dachs and Ds also each have the ability to influence Sple localization, and we identified some places where Dachs is necessary and sufficient to localize Sple (i.e. distal wing), and others where Dachs is dispensable but Ds is required (e.g. proximal wing, eye). The influence of Ds on Sple localization is essential for some manifestations of PCP, such as ommatidial polarity in the eye. Indeed, because Fz PCP can propagate from cell to cell, we propose that localization of Sple by Ds could account for the long-range influence of Ds-Fat borders on PCP in the eye (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sharma and McNeill, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2002</a>). The influence of <i>dachs</i> on PCP is generally mild, likely due to partial redundancy with Ds in localizing Sple. However, a strong influence of Dachs is revealed in the context of additional PCP mutations, as it contributes to the disturbed Sple localization and hair polarity in the wing and abdomen of <i>fat</i> and <i>ds</i> mutants, as well as the reversal of wing hair polarity in <i>pk</i> mutants."

These include physically associating with Vang, and promoting clustering, endocytosis, and/or degradation of Vang or other PCP proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bastock et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jenny et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Strutt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tree et al., 2002</a>). They have also been identified as influencing the orientation of apical non-centrosomal microtubules that can traffic components of the Fz-PCP system, including Fz and Dsh (<a href=\"#bib43\">Matis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>). The various activities ascribed to Pk-Sple are not mutually exclusive, and it could play multiple roles. However, the only unique functions clearly attributed to Sple as opposed to Pk are its interactions with Ds and Dachs, and distinct localization. Fz and Fat localize to opposite sides of cells in wings, but to the same side in eyes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Matis and Axelrod, 2013</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because Sple expression is relatively high in eye and low in wing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Merkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>), our studies are consistent with a molecular explanation for \u2018rectification\u2019 of this relationship between PCP pathways in which interaction of Sple with Dachs and Ds links PCP pathways in eyes but not in wings; coupling between pathways that depends upon physical interactions with Sple and not Pk could similarly explain the opposite relationships between hair polarity and Ds and Fj gradients in A versus P abdominal compartments. Thus, the solution our results support for the controversy over the relationship between the two PCP pathways is that in some contexts they operate in sequence, with directional information passed from Ds-Fat PCP to Fz PCP via Sple, whereas in other contexts they are uncoupled."

Even in flies, the linkage of Dachs and Ds to Sple cannot be the sole mechanism by which Ds-Fat signaling influences PCP, as some manifestations of cell polarity controlled by Ds-Fat, e.g. oriented cell divisions, do not require Sple (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baena-Lopez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gubb et al., 1999</a>). Moreover, when mis-expressed, Ds and Fat can alter PCP even in flies lacking a functional Fz PCP system (e.g. <i>fz<sup>-</sup> stan-</i> flies) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Casal et al., 2006</a>). It has also been proposed that PCP in the wing is influenced by shear forces generated by contraction of the wing hinge (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aigouy et al., 2010</a>), and disruption of these shear forces in <i>fat</i> or <i>ds</i> mutants might occur through a mechanism that depends upon <i>dachs</i> but not <i>sple</i>, due either to effects of Dachs on Hippo signaling (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cho et al., 2006</a>) or on cytoskeletal tension (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mao et al., 2011b</a>). Such additional influences of Dachs might explain why <i>fat</i> wing hair polarity phenotypes are more strongly suppressed by loss of <i>dachs</i> than by loss of <i>sple</i>."

For example, in the wing, where GFP:Sple localizes differently from GFP:Pk, cells must thus choose between competing polarity cues. Normally, they choose Pk localization cues, because Sple expression is low (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayukawa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Merkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>).

However, we suggest that their relationship is better described as a competition. In the wing disc, Pk expression is more abundant than Sple expression, hence Pk \u2018wins\u2019, and cells orient in response to cues that are unrelated to Ds-Fat PCP. When Pk is removed, then Sple can direct PCP, and hair polarity becomes governed by Ds-Fat PCP. Wild-type PCP requires Sple in some places, and Pk in others, but we know of no results that would require a balance between these two isoforms at any one place and time."

Positive feedback mechanisms, which reinforce the accumulation of co-localized proteins, together with negative feedback mechanisms, which inhibit the accumulation of oppositely localized proteins, are a staple of PCP systems, and have been widely viewed as a means of amplifying, maintaining, and propagating polarization in response to weak polarity signals. The observation that cells sometimes need to choose between competing polarity signals leads us to emphasize that feedback mechanisms could also have a distinct, fundamentally important role in PCP that has not previously been considered \u2013 they enable cells to make a discrete choice between competing polarity signals."

We take the localization of these proteins as indicators of the polarity signals that cells \u2018see\u2019 when that isoform predominates. This is not necessarily the same as their localization under endogenous expression conditions. For example, endogenous Pk localization might normally match Sple in the eye even in front of the furrow, because it is recruited to equatorial sides of cells by interactions with Sple and Vang."

However, since Ds-Fat signaling modulates Sple, but not Pk, localization, and Pk, but not Sple, is normally important for wing hair polarity, we infer that Ds-Fat PCP does not normally play a significant role in directing wing hair polarity. Instead, we propose, as also suggested by (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blair, 2014</a>), that the hair polarity phenotypes of <i>ds</i> or <i>fat</i> mutants are better understood as a de facto gain-of-function phenotype, resulting from inappropriate accumulation of Dachs on cell membranes, which then leads to inappropriate localization of Sple, and abnormal polarity. This would also explain how Ds-Fat signaling, stripped of polarizing information, could nonetheless rescue PCP phenotypes: for example, how uniform Ds expression can rescue hair polarity in <i>ds fj</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib39\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Simon, 2004</a>), and how expression of the intracellular domain of Fat can rescue hair polarity in <i>fat</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</a>), as these manipulations suppress the membrane accumulation of Dachs that would otherwise occur in mutant animals."

While disorganization of these microtubules is observed in <i>fat</i> or <i>ds</i> mutants, we suggest that the inference that Ds-Fat thus orients PCP in wing via these microtubules is incorrect. There is evidence both in imaginal discs and in axons that Pk-Sple can orient microtubules (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ehaideb et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Olofsson et al., 2014</a>). Sple is mis-localized in <i>fat</i> or <i>ds</i> mutant wing discs. Thus, we propose that the effects of <i>ds</i> and <i>fat</i> mutants on microtubules within the wing are likely a consequence of abnormal Sple localization, which disrupts microtubule orientation, but need not be interpreted as evidence for a normal role of Ds-Fat signaling in orienting microtubules or Fz PCP in the wing."

However, we also observed striking differences in the apparent influence of Ds-Fat pathway mutations on PCP between the abdomen and other organs. One possible contribution to these differences is the metamerism of the abdomen, and the local propagation of PCP. For example, the disturbance of Pk localization in P compartments even in <i>fat dachs, ds dachs</i> or <i>dachs sple</i> mutants would not be predicted based on the lack of detected physical interaction of Ds or Dachs with Pk, and lack of influence of these mutations on Pk in the wing. However, the P compartment is adjacent to two A compartments, and disturbances of polarity in these neighboring A compartments could potentially spread into the P compartment. The relatively normal polarity within A compartments of <i>fat dachs</i> or <i>ds dachs</i> mutants would also not be predicted if Sple is normally establishing polarity in response to the polarization of Ds and Dachs, and this result is not easily explained by hypothesizing propagation of normal polarity from neighboring compartments, since polarity is partially reversed in P compartments of these genotypes. Instead, we propose that in the absence of the primary PCP signal (in this case provided by the Ds-Fat pathway), cells use information from secondary signals, which appear to provide polarizing information in the A compartment that parallels that provided by the Ds-Fat pathway."

Cell lysates were precleared by incubation in 10 \u03bcl Protein-A beads for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C and later incubated with 10 \u03bcl anti-V5 beads at 4\u00b0C overnight for co-immunoprecipitation. Anti-V5 beads were washed four times with RIPA, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer at 100\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, and run on SDS-PAGE gels. Western blotting was performed using rabbit anti-V5 (1:5000, Bethyl Labs) and mouse anti-Flag (1:3000 Sigma), and fluorescentconjugated secondary antibodies (Odyssey)."

The images analyzed were projections through several confocal sections. Wing discs were examined at mid- to late third instar, eye discs were examined at late third instar, and abdomens were examined at 48\u2009h after puparium formation. Vectors of polarization were determined within scoreable cells. Scoreable cells included single cell clones, and cells within small clones, or irregular portions of larger clones, with unlabeled cells on two or three sides, and for which any GFP observed could be clearly assigned to a single cell. Vectors of polarization were drawn from the center of the cell to the strongest visible accumulation of GFP-tagged proteins. In cases where a broad region of similar intensity was observed, vectors were drawn toward the center of membrane GFP accumulation. Counterstaining with E-cadherin was employed to ensure that all junctions of scored cells were visible in the images. In wing discs, polarity was determined separately in distal, proximal and A-P boundary regions, using Wg and Hh expression as references. The proximal region was defined as cells within 5 cells of the fold at the edge of the wing pouch. The reference vector for the proximal region was a line perpendicular to the tangent of the proximal Wg ring at the point closest to the cell being scored. The A-P boundary region was defined as cells within 5 cell diameters anterior to the edge of Hh expression. The reference vector for the A-P boundary region was a line drawn parallel to the A-P boundary. The distal region was defined as cells within the wing pouch, excluding the proximal and A-P boundary regions, and also limited to the central three quarters of the D-V Wg stripe (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Cells overlapping the D-V boundary were excluded from analysis. The reference vector for the distal region was a line perpendicular the D-V boundary Wg stripe. In eye discs, the reference vector was a line parallel to the tangent of the morphogenetic furrow (the poles of the eye disc, where the morphogenetic furrow is not perpendicular to the equator, were not analyzed). In the abdomen, the reference vector was a line perpendicular to the A-P compartment boundaries. Cells in different regions were scored separately as indicated in the figure legends, based on observed regional differences in polarity in certain genotypes. In all tissues, the angle between the vector of polarization and the reference vector was calculated using ImageJ, and rose plots summarizing the distribution of angles were generated using Matlab."

Recent work by a number of groups has implicated <i>pk/sple</i> as being a key in coupling these two pathways and this current manuscript adds to this emerging story. There are several valuable insights that come from this manuscript. A key finding is that Sple can interact physically with both Dachs and Ds. The authors provide a new way to view several issues. They describe a series of genetic experiments that show that Dachs mediates the localization of Sple in wing cells and that in regions where Ds is highly expressed it can independently direct the localization of Sple. They provide evidence for an alternative model for the <i>ds/ft</i> wing hair phenotype where this is viewed as a consequence of inappropriate <i>dachs</i> localization which results in altered accumulation of Sple which can in turn interfere with Pk function. The paper also provides an explanation for several puzzling results from the literature: the \u2018rectification\u2019 of the relationship between <i>fz</i> and <i>ds/ft</i> and for the ability of the uniform Ds expression to rescue the hair polarity of <i>ds fj</i> mutants. They also describe some interesting new observations that have been missed by others (e.g. that Pk localization is not proximal in all regions of the wing) even if the significance of the observation is unclear."

The authors map the localization of Pk and Sple in the wing disc, eye disc and pupal abdomen by generating clones of fluorescently tagged Pk and Sple isoforms that are over-expressed under the control of the actin promoter. They examine how perturbations of Fat system components influence the localization of PkGFP and Sple:GFP, and correlate these with polarity phenotypes. Their data show that PkGFP and Sple:GFP clones have opposite polarity in wing discs and posterior abdomen (where Pk normally dominates), but the same polarity in eye discs posterior to the furrow and the anterior abdomen (where Sple normally dominates). This is an intriguing correlation, but the authors data do not explore or clarify why Pk and Sple localize together in some tissues and oppositely in others.

But given the feedback mechanisms that lead to polarized formation of Core PCP domains, and the fact that these proteins are overexpressed, this may not reflect the endogenous localization. What I mean is that the very small amount of Sple that is normally present in the wing disc might ordinarily be incorporated into proximal Core complexes that are oriented by the much larger amounts of Pk and the cues read by Pk. The distal localization of Sple in the wing disc (as visualized by actin promoter-driven over-expression of Sple:GFP) could result from Core PCP reversal caused by Sple over-expression. They conclude that wing cells normally have Pk on one side and Sple on the other, but this may not be true at endogenous levels."

Furthermore, in the Discussion, the authors say that Fat-Ds signaling modulates Sple but not Pk localization.

There are no identified physical interations between Pk and Fat components and why it should be oriented in this way by Fat PCP in the posterior abdomen but not the anterior abdomen or eye is puzzling.

I would be surprised if the situation were different in the clones used in this paper, and I think it is essential to check the polarity around these clones. In any case, I think it will be hard to argue that Sple would localize proximally when expressed at endogenous levels in a tissue that is dominated by Pk. The reverse isn't as much of a problem \u2013 even though PkGFP is over-expressed in clones, it still generally colocalizes with Sple in the eye and anterior abdomen where Sple dominates. This makes it a very interesting question why PkGFP expression causes polarity defects in the eye as reported by Strutt et al.

Recent work by a number of groups has implicated</i> pk<i>/</i>sple <i>as being a key in coupling these two pathways and this current manuscript adds to this emerging story. There are several valuable insights that come from this manuscript. A key finding is that Sple can interact physically with both Dachs and Ds. The authors provide a new way to view several issues. They describe a series of genetic experiments that show that Dachs mediates the localization of Sple in wing cells and that in regions where Ds is highly expressed it can independently direct the localization of Sple. They provide evidence for an alternative model for the</i> ds<i>/</i>ft <i>wing hair phenotype where this is viewed as a consequence of inappropriate</i> dachs <i>localization which results in altered accumulation of Sple which can in turn interfere with Pk function. The paper also provides an explanation for several puzzling results from the literature: the \u2018rectification\u2019 of the relationship between</i> fz <i>and</i> ds<i>/</i>ft <i>and for the ability of the uniform Ds expression to rescue the hair polarity of</i> dsfj <i>mutants.

They examine how perturbations of Fat system components influence the localization of PkGFP and Sple:GFP, and correlate these with polarity phenotypes. Their data show that PkGFP and Sple:GFP clones have opposite polarity in wing discs and posterior abdomen (where Pk normally dominates), but the same polarity in eye discs posterior to the furrow and the anterior abdomen (where Sple normally dominates). This is an intriguing correlation, but the authors data do not explore or clarify why Pk and Sple localize together in some tissues and oppositely in others. Their data generally confirm the idea that the Fat system orients Sple in the eye disc and wing disc, but the data in the abdomen are very confusing and no clear model emerges for the orientation Sple or Pk here. In general, I think some of the confusion may stem from the clones used to map Sple and Pk polarity, and from the unusual organization of the abdomen \u2013 here Sple and Pk-dependent regions are directly opposed to one another. There are several experiments the authors could do to resolve this confusion that should be possible within the time frame of a revision. Pk and Sple polarity:Throughout the, the authors map Pk and Sple polarity using flip out clones of GFP tagged Pk or Sple that are over-expressed under the control of the actin promoter. They use these constructs to deduce the localization of these proteins even in tissues where the particular isoform in question is expressed at much lower levels than the other \u2013 for example they use GFP-Sple clones to make conclusions about Sple localization in the wing disc even though endogenous levels are hardly detectable \u2013 in any case much lower than Pk. But given the feedback mechanisms that lead to polarized formation of Core PCP domains, and the fact that these proteins are overexpressed, this may not reflect the endogenous localization. What I mean is that the very small amount of Sple that is normally present in the wing disc might ordinarily be incorporated into proximal Core complexes that are oriented by the much larger amounts of Pk and the cues read by Pk. The distal localization of Sple in the wing disc (as visualized by actin promoter-driven over-expression of Sple:GFP) could result from Core PCP reversal caused by Sple over-expression. They conclude that wing cells normally have Pk on one side and Sple on the other, but this may not be true at endogenous levels.</i>"

What clones (over-)expressing GFP tagged proteins tell us then, is the cues that a particular isoform sees and responds to when it is the predominant isoform in that tissue. We revised the text to comment on this in the Discussion. We further note that antisera that specifically recognize Pk or Sple were reported by David Gubb, and we obtained some of this sera, but he told us that they are unable to recognize endogenously expressed proteins by immunostaining, they can only detect over-expressed proteins, and this was also true in our hands.

In the revised manuscript, we show that PCP phenotypes are induced in the wing by GFP:Sple-expressing clones. In the eye, in order to score PCP we needed ommatidia in which transgenes were expressed only in R3 or only in R4. This was achieved by examining eye discs only 24 hr after clone induction. We estimate that in these eye discs, GFP:Pk was expressed in or behind the furrow, i.e., when and where it co-localizes with Sple. We hypothesized that disturbance of PCP by Pk might require Pk expression in front of the furrow (where it localizes differently than Sple). To test this idea, we compared PCP in eye discs with clones of cells expressing GFP:Pk for one day, versus 3 days. Indeed, we observed normal PCP with 1 day clones, and abnormal PCP with 3 day clones. These results imply that the timing of Pk over-expression is important in determining whether or not a PCP phenotype is induced, and are included in the revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In the case of the anterior, Reviewer 3 was asking what supplied the information for normal Sple polarity in the</i> dsdachs <i>double. The manuscript opines that it could be whatever localizes Pk, presumable meaning some part of the core system, since Pk is pretty normal. Or I suppose one could invoke Pk-Sple binding. They hypothesized both to explain proximal Sple in</i> ds dachs <i>double mutant wings, so it is pretty much the same idea here. The sensitivity of Pk to</i> ds <i>or</i> dachs <i>removal in the posterior is bit more confusing, as I think they admit. What they suggest is that, in absence of Ds cues, now Pk becomes sensitive to Sple and follows mislocalized Sple. It could be explained a bit better, as the molecular interactions of Dachs and Ds are with Sple; I guess this unbound Sple is now more attractive to Pk? Or we could invoke the weak Pk-Dachs binding of Ayukawa, but it would have to be binding that mediate repulsion or destruction, to get anterior Pk and posterior Dachs. At any rate, they did not look at Pk localization in a</i> ds sple <i>or</i> dachs sple <i>double, if they are really trying to support this idea. And if we're being complete, they must know what happens to Sple in a</i> ds dachs <i>double in the posterior.
