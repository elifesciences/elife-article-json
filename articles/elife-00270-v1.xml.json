This article received substantial publicity after one of the principal authors, Nicole King, presented the work (already accepted for publication in <i>eLife</i>) at the Society for Developmental Biology meeting, and then posted the accepted article on her own lab website.

And to complete this collection of four articles, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7445/eLife.00065\">a significant advance in aging research</a> is provided by researchers who show that a hormone involved in the response to starvation dramatically increases the lifespan of mice in which it is overexpressed.
