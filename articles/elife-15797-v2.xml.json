Although the basic cellular machinery generating mechanical tension appears largely conserved, tensions propagate in unique ways within each tissue. Here we use the vertebrate eye as a paradigm to investigate how tensions are generated and transmitted during the folding of a neuroepithelial layer. We record membrane pulsatile behavior and actomyosin dynamics during zebrafish optic cup morphogenesis by live imaging. We show that retinal neuroblasts undergo fast oscillations and that myosin condensation correlates with episodic contractions that progressively reduce basal feet area. Interference with <i>lamc1</i> function impairs basal contractility and optic cup folding. Mapping of tensile forces by laser cutting uncover a developmental window in which local ablations trigger the displacement of the entire tissue. Our work shows that optic cup morphogenesis is driven by a constriction mechanism and indicates that supra-cellular transmission of mechanical tension depends on ECM attachment."

Although the basic cellular machinery generating mechanical tension appears largely conserved, tensions propagate in unique ways within each tissue. Here we use the vertebrate eye as a paradigm to investigate how tensions are generated and transmitted during the folding of a neuroepithelial layer. We record membrane pulsatile behavior and actomyosin dynamics during zebrafish optic cup morphogenesis by live imaging. We show that retinal neuroblasts undergo fast oscillations and that myosin condensation correlates with episodic contractions that progressively reduce basal feet area. Interference with <i>lamc1</i> function impairs basal contractility and optic cup folding. Mapping of tensile forces by laser cutting uncover a developmental window in which local ablations trigger the displacement of the entire tissue. Our work shows that optic cup morphogenesis is driven by a constriction mechanism and indicates that supra-cellular transmission of mechanical tension depends on ECM attachment."

Throughout development, genetic programs coordinate the behavior of single cells allowing the self-assembly of coherent tissues and tridimensional organs. Regardless of the nature of the process (i.e. either cell migration, epithelial bending or cell intercalation), mechanical tensions need to be transmitted at a supra-cellular scale for organ morphogenesis to occur. Mechanical forces, however, are generated by the contractile cytoskeleton of the constituent cells of a tissue (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mammoto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heisenberg and Bellaiche, 2013</a>). The main force generator during morphogenesis results from the molecular interaction between myosin II motors and the actin filaments at the cellular cortex (<a href=\"#bib46\">Salbreux et al., 2012</a>). This actomyosin contractile apparatus sustains cortical tension, pulling cells into shape during development and tissue homeostasis. Contractile forces are then transmitted to neighboring cells and to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through cadherin and integrin receptors, allowing individual cell contributions to be integrated into tensions at the tissue/organ level (<a href=\"#bib39\">Papusheva and Heisenberg, 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib27\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>). Regardless the morphogenetic context, actomyosin contractile forces are resisted both by cellular adhesions and by the compression of the internal cytoskeleton itself. This results in a balance of forces that stabilizes transiently cell and tissue shapes for each stage of the developmental program that builds up a given organ."

The emerging picture reveals a wide variety of cortical actomyosin behaviors and localizations depending on the tissue context. Initial reports, focused in epithelial constriction processes, revealed pulsatile myosin flows preceding the periodic contraction of the cellular cortex. This has been reported in <i>Drosophila</i> epithelia either at the apical cortex, during mesoderm invagination or germ-band extension (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Gorfinkiel and Blanchard, 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Roh-johnson et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Rauzi et al., 2010</a>), or at the basal surface during egg chamber elongation (<a href=\"#bib39\">He et al., 2010</a>). Oscillatory actomyosin flows can be coupled to the stabilization of the cells in a 'constricted' state after each pulse, thus resulting in a progressive (i.e. ratcheted) reduction of the cellular apex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Martin et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Rauzi et al., 2010</a>). Alternatively, the cell cortex may oscillate, contracting and relaxing, without a net reduction of the area over time (<a href=\"#bib39\">He et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib53\">Solon et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, actomyosin flows may direct epithelial morphogenesis operating in a continuous non-pulsatile manner, as described during zebrafish epiboly (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behrndt et al., 2012</a>). Notably, the actomyosin network localizes in circumferential (i.e. junctional) belts in the vertebrate neural tube (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nishimura et al., 2012</a>), instead of medio-apically as observed in several <i>Drosophila</i> epithelia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gorfinkiel and Blanchard, 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al., 2009</a>) and in gastrulating cells in <i>Xenopus</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim and Davidson, 2011</a>). In the context of the current study, although actomyosin distribution has been analyzed during optic cup morphogenesis in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chauhan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Martinez-morales et al., 2009</a>), its dynamics has not been examined in vivo."

The process entails first the protrusion of the eye progenitors to form the lateral optic vesicles, and subsequently the infolding of this tissue into bi-layered optic cups (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib49\">Schmitt and Dowling, 1994</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Hilfer, 1983</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib50\">Schook, 1980</a>). Live imaging followed by cell tracking of retinal progenitors in zebrafish revealed that optic vesicle bulging is driven by the rearrangement and epithelialization of individual cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib44\">Rembold et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">England et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Ivanovitch et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to teleosts, in amniotes and cartilaginous fishes optic vesicles develop by epithelial folding from an already hollow neural tube (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lowery and Sive, 2004</a>). The morphogenesis of the vertebrate optic cup has also been examined in live imaging studies, both in teleost models (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kwan et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">Martinez-morales et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib41\">Picker et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Heermann et al., 2015</a>), as well as in self-organized organs from ES-cultured cells in mammals (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nakano et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib11\">Eiraku et al., 2011</a>). Although optic cup formation seems less divergent among vertebrates than vesicles\u2019 evagination, some particularities in cell behavior have been observed and different mechanisms proposed. In mouse embryos, contractile filopodia connecting neural retina and lens epithelia have been shown to adjust the final curvature of both epithelia (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chauhan et al., 2009</a>). However, optic cup development can be recapitulated in vitro in ES cells aggregates suggesting that the morphogenetic program is to a large extent intrinsic. Using this in vitro model, it has been hypothesized that optic cup invagination is driven by the apical constriction of the neuroepithelial cells located at the rim between the presumptive retina and RPE domains (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eiraku et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2012</a>). Tracking of individual cells in zebrafish has shown that epithelial flow through this rim contributes to neural retina expansion (i.e. at the expenses of the RPE) and optic cup folding (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heermann et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Kwan et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib41\">Picker et al., 2009</a>). Whether cell involution and apical constriction at the rim are species-specific mechanisms or operate coordinately in the same organism is still an open question. Finally, we previously postulated the basal constriction of the neuroblasts as an active mechanism contributing to optic cup morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">Martinez-Morales and Wittbrodt, 2009</a>). The polarized trafficking of integrin receptors toward the basal surface of the epithelial cells plays an essential role during retinal morphogenesis in teleosts. We showed that this process is controlled by the molecular antagonism between the trans-membrane protein opo and the clathrin adaptors numb and numb-like (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bogdanovic et al., 2012</a>). In <i>opo</i> medaka mutants, basal feet appear wider and disorganized in the retina (<a href=\"#bib34\">Martinez-morales et al., 2009</a>). Although this observation suggests a progressive reduction of the neuroblasts feet, the constriction process has not been formally examined in vivo."

We explore actomyosin dynamics and show that accumulation of myosin foci in scattered cells is associated with contraction of the cellular feet. We show that interference with myosin II function or laminin-mediated basal attachment impairs cell contractility and affect retina folding. To further characterize this morphogenetic process at tissue level, we locally ablate the neuroepithelium to map mechanical tensions through development. This approach identified a narrow developmental window in which local ablation of the retina at its basal surface triggers the global displacement of the retinal epithelium. Our work shows that the myosin-dependent generation of constrictions forces in individual neuroblast and their transmission at a supra-cellular scale play an essential role during optic cup folding in zebrafish."

Retinae from the zebrafish line <i>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax)</i>, in which precursors\u2019 plasma membrane is uniformly labeled, were imaged through morphogenesis starting at 17 hpf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Tissue recordings evidenced a complete epithelial organization shortly after 17 hpf, with mitotic rounding happening apically throughout the entire folding process. In agreement with previous reports, cell involution was also observed at the rim between the RPE and neural retina, particularly from 20 hpf on and at the posterior (i.e. temporal) border of the cup (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heermann et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Kwan et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib41\">Picker et al., 2009</a>). As morphogenesis proceeds, GFP-caax signal become brighter at the basal side in the central retina, suggesting an increased membrane density in this region. Moreover, whereas the length of the apical edge of the retina increased significantly, the basal length remained invariant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). This observation, in conjunction with the previously reported increase (1.5x) in retinal cells number within this developmental window (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kwan et al., 2012</a>), suggests a progressive narrowing of the basal feet between 17 and 24 hpf. Cell elongation, a common phenomenon in many constricting epithelia (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sawyer et al., 2010</a>), does not occur during retinal folding, as the width of the tissue remained constant (\u224850 \u00b5m) through the process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013L</a>)."

The analysis of individual cells from three independent retinas showed that 76% of the apical (n\u00a0=\u00a043) and 90% of the basal (n\u00a0=\u00a046) oscillations presented no major correlation with those of their neighbors (Pearson correlation coefficient R &lt; |0.5|). Comparison of the pulsatile behavior at both epithelial planes revealed significant differences. Although both surfaces oscillate with a similar frequency of 50 \u00b1 12.5 <i>mHz</i> (\u224820 \u00b1 5 s; n\u00a0=\u00a026 cells), the peak-to-peak amplitude is considerably larger at the basal 11.1 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/min than at the apical surface 4.1 \u00b1 0.57 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/min (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, whereas a progressive reduction of cell area was apparent at the basal side, cells did not display a net constriction at the apical side over a 25-min period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

To answer this issue, we generated retinal clones by blastomere transplantation from <i>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax)</i> donor embryos into wild-type late-blastula hosts. Live-imaging analysis of singularized <i>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax)</i> neuroblasts along the apico-basal axis allowed the simultaneous recording of variations in the length of the apical and basal edges at 20 hpf (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Quantitative analysis of 10 individual cells revealed a poor correlation between the pulses at apical and basal ends (R &lt; |0.5| in all cells examined), thus indicating that these surfaces oscillate largely in an independent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). A second emerging question was whether apical cell rounding during mitosis may affect either basal constriction or apical expansion. To address this issue, the distance between the two cells flanking mitotically active neuroblasts was measured through time. Whereas quantitative analysis of distance variation showed a transient expansion of the apical domain as the cells divide, this was recovered once mitoses were resolved (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, both the apical and basal net distances at the beginning and end of the process did not change significantly (T-test; n\u00a0=\u00a010). This observation is in agreement with previous data showing that cell mitoses did not play a major role for optic cup formation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kwan et al., 2012</a>)."

To investigate this phenomenon in constricting retinal cells, we first examined actin dynamics during optic cup morphogenesis. To follow dynamic changes in cell area and F-actin simultaneously, we injected <i>utrophin-GFP</i> RNA in one-cell stage embryos of the transgenic line <i>tg(vsx2.2:lyn-tdTomato)</i> and then performed live imaging analyses at 20 hpf focusing on the basal neuroblasts surface (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). As previously reported for vertebrate neuroepithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nishimura et al., 2012</a>), actin accumulated circumferentially (i.e. junctional) rather than medially as observed in constricting <i>Drosophila</i> epithelia (<a href=\"#bib39\">He et al., 2010;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>). In addition, we observed that actin accumulated at the basal surface and oscillated with a frequency similar to membrane pulses (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). To detect whether there is a relationship between cortical actin accumulation and basal area changes, both parameters were quantified after segmentation and a cross-correlation analysis was performed. This analysis showed a positive association between actin accumulation and basal area expansion, with a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.40 \u00b1 0.16 (median 0.35), as calculated for 26 cells from three different experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). In order to evaluate the significance of our results, we compared our experimental data with simulated random and sinusoidal signals of similar statistical properties. Coefficients of simulated random data were significantly lower than our observations in vivo, indicating that the cells display a significant positive correlation between actin accumulation and basal area changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Hence, cell area expansion and actin accumulation occur simultaneously or with time lags shorter than 5 s (i.e. our sampling rate limitation). Furthermore, when we plotted cross-correlation coefficients as a function of the actin intensity, we observed higher coefficients corresponding to cells with higher actin intensity rates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that the molecular mechanism responsible for the fast oscillations in the vertebrate retina differs in important aspects from that controlling the pulsatile behavior in constricting epithelia in <i>Drosophila</i>. In retinal neuroblasts, peripheral actin accumulation is associated with basal ends\u2019 expansion, whereas in <i>Drosophila</i> cell contraction is linked to medial condensation of actin."

This is in agreement with the bending of these tissues toward their apical and basal surfaces, respectively. When examined in relation to basal membrane oscillations, as revealed by <i>lyn-tdTomato</i>, myosin dynamics showed a behavior different from that of actin. Basal myosin accumulates in scattered cortical foci, which have an average stability in the range of minutes, 4 \u00b1 0.5\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2013Q</a>).

Thus, basal membrane indentations associated to myosin foci appeared largely attenuated (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>), suggesting an inefficient mechanical coupling. In addition, when basal membrane oscillations were examined in the <i>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax)</i> line, treatment for one hour with blebbistatin abolished the pulsatile behavior and impaired basal constriction by blocking the cells in a relaxed state (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). This result indicates that although myosin levels do not oscillate with basal area changes, its activity is required to maintain the pulsatile dynamics. Finally, sustained treatment with blebbistatin for 3\u2009hr significantly delays the folding of the optic cup (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This finding, however, needs to be interpreted cautiously, as myosin inhibition may interfere with optic cup folding either by blocking basal constriction or through any other acto-myosin-dependent morphogenetic mechanism."

To specifically interfere with this process in zebrafish, we knocked down <i>lamc1</i>, a core component of laminin trimer, the mutation of which results in ocular malformations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Domogatskaya et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee and Gross, 2007</a>).

                                "text": "To examine how mechanical tensions are distributed in the folding epithelium, we performed laser ablations experiments at different stages of optic cup morphogenesis. In order to visualize membranes displacement during tension release, local ablations were carried out in <i>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax)</i> embryos, either at the apical or at the basal surfaces of the tissue. Laser-induced cuts trigger a limited expansion of the wounded area and a local relaxation of the tissue, as determined by optical flow analysis (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For most of the stages analyzed, tissue relaxation affected only neuroblasts immediately adjacent to the wounded area. However, laser ablations within a developmental window corresponding to a 125\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0 opening of the optic cup resulted in a global tissue relaxation that affected bending of the entire epithelium (<a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). At this specific stage, tension release triggered a noticeable folding of the retinal tissue toward its basal surface. To quantitatively investigate membrane displacement after laser ablation in retinal tissues, we carried out an optical flow analysis of the movies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>), which allow determining retraction speeds at different stages and locations within the tissue (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Statistical analysis of optical flow data confirmed that maximum retraction speeds are significantly higher only for retinas displaying a 125\u00ba\u2013140\u00ba bending (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F,G</a>). This observation indicates that the balance between tensile forces and tissue resistance that maintains organ shape is particularly unstable within a narrow developmental window that coincides with the acute constriction of the basal feet at 19 hpf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In contrast to the global reaction observed upon basal ablation, which triggers the displacement of the peripheral retina, apical ablation only affected the morphology of the central retina but no peripheral retraction was observed (Movie 11; <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The differential tissue response upon ablation at the apical and basal surfaces, together with our previous observations on <i>lamc1</i> requirement for basal contractility (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) prompted us to investigate tissue behavior in <i>lamc1</i> morphants. The analysis of retraction speeds in laser-ablated tissues at the critical 125\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0 stage showed that global relaxation of the optic cup is attenuated in <i>lamc1</i> knockdown retinas (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This data indicates that the laminin-mediated attachment to the ECM is essential for the transmission of mechanical tensions throughout the folding tissue."

Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that retinal neuroblasts undergo a progressive constriction of their basal surface. Previous reports have described the involution of outer layer progenitors into the presumptive neural retina domain as a mechanism driving the formation of the eye chamber (<a href=\"#bib41\">Picker et al., 2009;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Kwan et al., 2012;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Heermann et al., 2015</a>). Our observations are also consistent with these reports, thus suggesting that basal constriction and cell involution cooperate during eye morphogenesis in zebrafish. Comparative analysis of our data and previous studies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heermann et al., 2015</a>) indicate that, although both mechanisms overlap substantially, they are staggered events. Whereas basal constriction occurs mainly during the primary folding of the retinal epithelium between 18 and 20 hpf, cell involution through the rim is limited during this period and becomes more prominent at later stages between 20 and 24 hpf. It is tempting to speculate that these mechanisms might be coupled. Thus, basal constriction may generate centripetal tensions facilitating cell involution and, conversely, cell involution may relieve tissue resistance supporting a constriction-dependent optic cup folding. However, the precise cellular mechanisms driving cell involution are currently unknown, and hence exploring this possibility will require further investigation."

                        "text": "Here, we have described that retinal precursors undergo fast pulsations both at their apical and basal surfaces. We then examined both membrane and actomyosin dynamics at the basal surface, where the progressive constriction takes place. Although, in principle, the neuroblasts\u2019 periodic pulsations share some features with the oscillations observed in other constricting epithelia (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim and Davidson, 2011;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al., 2009;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Roh-johnson et al., 2012;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib53\">Solon et al., 2009</a>), there are fundamental differences. In most epithelial cells, pulsations are more regular in frequency and amplitude than in retinal precursors, and their average oscillation frequency range between 1 and\u00a05 min (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gorfinkiel and Blanchard, 2011</a>). This is in contrast to irregular fast oscillations (\u224820 s) here described in the zebrafish retina. A second fundamental difference concerns the organization of the actomyosin fibers in the shrinking surface of the tissue. In most of the constricting epithelia so far examined, contractile actomyosin fibers accumulate in a medioapical domain. From this domain, centripetal tension responsible for cell contraction is generated and transmitted to surface junctions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al., 2009;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Roh-johnson et al., 2012;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib39\">He et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, F-actin turnover is required for this medioapical localization of the actomyosin meshwork, its efficient attachment to cellular junctions, and the generation of centripetal tension (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jodoin et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, our data show that both actin and myosin fibers accumulate at the cellular cortex in the zebrafish retina. Cortical distribution of actomyosin fibers has also been described in the folding neural tube (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nishimura et al., 2012</a>), thus suggesting that it may be a common feature in elongated neuroepithelial cells regardless the tissue is bending toward its apical o basal surface."

In the light of this finding, our observation that the molecular mechanism driving fast oscillations in retinal neuroblasts differs substantially from that previously reported in constricting epithelia is not surprising. Whereas medioapical accumulations of actomyosin precede periodic cellular contractions in most epithelia analyzed, we observed that cortical actin accumulation correlates positively with basal membrane expansion in retinal precursors. Local actin assembly at the leading edge has been described as a positive force driving membrane extension in lamellipodia and axonal growth cones (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pollard and Borisy, 2003;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib29\">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Medeiros et al., 2006</a>). Our data may suggest a similar mechanism as responsible for the pulsatile behavior of the retinal precursors, but confirming this hypothesis will require further analysis."

In spite of this, our data does not allow to rule out a myosin role in the maintenance of the pulsatile state. On the contrary, blebbistatin treatment severely impaired membrane pulses, suggesting that myosin basal activity is necessary to maintain the fast oscillatory behavior. Our data also show that myosin accumulates at the basal cortex in discrete foci, which have an average stability of approximately 4 min and are distributed in scattered cells across the epithelial field. Remarkably, a large proportion of the retinal cells accumulating basal myosin foci are contracting both along the apico-basal and basal plane axes. These episodic contractions at the basal surface can be inhibited either by blocking myosin activity or by interfering with the adhesive properties of the extracellular matrix."

According to this hypothetical model, retinal precursors would experience non-ratcheted fast membrane oscillations. Pulsatile behavior without a net reduction of cell area has also been reported in several epithelial contexts (<a href=\"#bib39\">He et al., 2010;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib53\">Solon et al., 2009;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Roh-johnson et al., 2012</a>). Superimposed to these fast oscillations, the episodic accumulation of myosin at the basal surface in scattered cells would mediate their progressive (i.e. ratcheted) constriction. Then, individual contributions would add up over time to cause the constriction of the entire neuroepithelium. At a tissue level, our laser ablation experiments indicate that the global balance between mechanical tensions and tissue resistance becomes transiently unstable within a limited developmental window (19\u201320 hpf). This critical period, in which local ablations at the basal surface trigger global tissue rearrangement, coincides with the acute bending of the optic cup epithelium and the active constriction of the neuroblasts\u2019 feet. Upon <i>lamc1</i> knockdown both basal contractility and global tissue response to laser ablation are attenuated. This suggests that the ECM plays a fundamental role in the transmission of mechanical tensions generated by individual cells at the tissue level. In agreement with this concept, previous reports have shown that optic cup morphogenesis largely depends on integrin function (<a href=\"#bib34\">Martinez-morales et al., 2009;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib4\">Bogdanovic et al., 2012;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">Nakano et al., 2012</a>)."

Different plugins were used for maximum intensity projection of z-stacks, signal intensity quantification in selected regions of interest (ROIs), and measurement of angles and distances. To measure the length of the apical and basal edges of the retina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we selected a single stack at the central retina and outlined tissue borders using the Fiji tool freehand. For automatic detection of cell edges and tracking of individual cells through time we used Packing Analyzer v2.0, which is based on a watershed algorithm for cell identification (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aigouy et al., 2010</a>). Unique RGB codes were assigned to each cell by Packing Analyzer V2.0 in tracked images. Individual images were examined manually to correct for automatic segmentation mistakes.

The lamc1Mo was injected into <i>tg(vsx2.2:GFP-caax</i>) and <i>tg(actb1:myl12.1-eGFP</i>) embryos at one-cell stage at a concentration of 1 pmol per embryo. To prevent potential apoptotic effects, a p53MO (p53MO: 5\u2019-GCGCCATTGCTTTGCAAGAATTG-3\u2019), was co-injected with Lamc1Mo at a concentration of 0.5 pmoles per embryo. Control embryos were injected in parallel with p53MO alone."

Embryos were carefully oriented with the dorsal head surface contacting the coverslip and were imaged using a 40x objective. In order to be able to record time-lapse movies with sufficient time resolution (ms) for an optical flow analysis, we used a spinning disk confocal microscope (RoperScientific), achieving a time resolution of 0.5\u00a0s for all experiments in this work. Laser ablations were performed by applying a short wavelength laser (405 nm) at single cell membranes for 450\u00a0ms, either at the basal or apical surfaces of the neuroretinal tissue. Laser pulses were controlled using iLas software (Roper Scientific). For the statistical analysis of maximal ablation speeds, ablated retinas were sorted in 15\u00b0 bins."

To compare pixel intensity between frames, we employed the Lucas-Kanade method, which groups neighboring pixels together assuming similar motion for them (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barron et al., 1994</a>). The algorithm Good Features to Track was used for the pixel-wise detection of features to track (Shi and Tomasi, 1994). Both methods are available as programming functions at the computer vision open source library, OpenCV (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bradski and Kaehler, 2008</a>). Different positions at the central and distal retina and the apical and basal surfaces of the neuro-epithelium were considered for optical flow measurements. For each region, 11 points were tracked and their speed values median-averaged. Retraction speed graphs have been Gaussian smoothed. In order to allow direct comparison between different experiments, speed profiles for each retina analyzed were normalized to their median values."

However the reviewers agreed that many aspects of the quantitative analysis need to be explained in more detail before the paper would be suitable for publication. These are outlined below. One concern was that it was not clear from how many different embryos the data was derived. Of course it is important that these results are consistent over multiple embryos, and if only one has been examined for each type of experiment, then additional data needs to be provided from several others. Otherwise, no additional experiments are needed. All reviewers were unsatisfied with the use of the term \"rachet-like\" mechanism and thought the data didn't necessarily support such a specific description \u2013 this term should be removed from the title, although it would be reasonable to raise the possibility in the discussion."

They suggest that basal tension is dependent on lamc and is highest at the time that cells are contracting the most \u2013 at this time, ablation can affect the global shape of the cup. But <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, which presents this data, is very hard to understand. In particular, the direction that the cells move after laser ablation is impossible to see. The image has been color coded in a way that is said to represent \"motion vectors\", but it isn't clear whether the color represents the magnitude or the direction of the vectors. Showing a velocity flow field for the tissue would be a better way of presenting the global effects of laser ablation, and it is essential to show a higher magnification view of the cut site itself so that it is clear that tissue retracts after cutting."

In addition, how does the variance in length compare to the variance seen in the area measurements in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>? Was it not possible to acquire z-stacks to measure the 2-dimensional area of apical and basal surfaces, perhaps after 3-dimensional rendering?

It is likely that the apical actomyosin belt observed in the neural retina (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>) plays a role in maintaining this tension. In any case, we clearly observed a differential behaviour between apical and basal ablations. Whereas basal ablations resulted in a global tissue displacement affecting not only the central but also the peripheral retina, apical ablations only affected the morphology of the central retina and no peripheral displacement was observed (white arrowhead in <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>). To make this point clear we have substituted the sentence \"Tissue ablations at the apical surface did not seem to affect the global geometry of the retina\" by the more explanatory sentence \u201cIn contrast to the global reaction observed upon basal ablation, which triggers the displacement of the peripheral retina, apical ablations only affected the morphology of the central retina but no peripheral retraction was observed (<a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>).
