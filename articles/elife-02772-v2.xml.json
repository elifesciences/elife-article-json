Notwithstanding intense interest in the mechanism behind TMEM16A-CaCC calcium-dependent gating, comprehensive surveys to identify and characterize potential calcium sensors of this channel are still lacking. By aligning distantly related calcium-activated ion channels in the TMEM16 family and conducting systematic mutagenesis of all conserved acidic residues thought to be exposed to the cytoplasm, we identify four acidic amino acids as putative calcium-binding residues. Alterations of the charge, polarity, and size of amino acid side chains at these sites alter the ability of different divalent cations to activate the channel. Furthermore, TMEM16A mutant channels containing double cysteine substitutions at these residues are sensitive to the redox potential of the internal solution, providing evidence for their physical proximity and solvent accessibility."

Notwithstanding intense interest in the mechanism behind TMEM16A-CaCC calcium-dependent gating, comprehensive surveys to identify and characterize potential calcium sensors of this channel are still lacking. By aligning distantly related calcium-activated ion channels in the TMEM16 family and conducting systematic mutagenesis of all conserved acidic residues thought to be exposed to the cytoplasm, we identify four acidic amino acids as putative calcium-binding residues. Alterations of the charge, polarity, and size of amino acid side chains at these sites alter the ability of different divalent cations to activate the channel. Furthermore, TMEM16A mutant channels containing double cysteine substitutions at these residues are sensitive to the redox potential of the internal solution, providing evidence for their physical proximity and solvent accessibility."

First, with multiple lines of evidence, we confirmed that CaM is not required for TMEM16A-CaCC activation. Then, we performed a comprehensive alanine mutagenesis screen of all highly conserved acidic residues in TMEM16A that are predicted to be accessible to the cytoplasm. Based on our measurements of these mutants' apparent calcium sensitivity in inside-out excised patches, we identify four acidic residues (including two acidic residues that were recently implicated in the calcium-dependent activation of TMEM16A-CaCCs [<a href=\"#bib45\">Yu et al., 2012</a>]) that satisfy several criteria characteristic of calcium-binding sites. Substitution of each of these residues with various amino acids shifts the apparent sensitivity of TMEM16A-CaCC for different divalent cations, and cysteine residues at these sites can be cross-linked by oxidizing intracellular solutions. Our results thus demonstrate that direct binding of calcium to TMEM16A triggers channel activation independently of calmodulin, identify novel interaction sites between calcium ions and TMEM16A, and lay the groundwork for future studies examining the mechanism of calcium-dependent TMEM16 channel activation."

Reasoning that apparent calcium sensitivity is the most direct measurement of TMEM16A function, we recorded CaCC currents from GFP-tagged TMEM16A channels at fixed test potentials using an inside-out excised patch configuration. CaCC current amplitudes increased in a calcium-dependent manner until channels reach maximum open probability in our recordings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). By fitting the dose\u2013response curve to the Hill equation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), apparent calcium sensitivity was derived as the half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of calcium required for channel activation. With rapid application of internal solutions, this patch clamp protocol effectively minimized the effect of channel desensitization on our analysis of TMEM16A-CaCC apparent calcium sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition, deriving the apparent calcium sensitivity from individual inside-out patches allowed us to control for variations in protein expression that complicate the interpretation of data derived from other electrophysiology configurations such as whole-cell patch clamp."

First, we tried to sequester endogenous CaM molecules by directly applying anti-CaM antibodies to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out patches from <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. In contrast to its potent inhibitory effect on CaM-dependent TRPV1 tachyphylaxis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lishko et al., 2007</a>), the CaM-antibody had no effect on TMEM16A-CaCC currents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Second, we treated endogenous <i>Xenopus</i> TMEM16A channels with W7, a potent CaM antagonist that can prevent CaM from binding to its targets. We found that neither acute nor sustained applications of this drug disrupted the calcium sensitivity of TMEM16A channels (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Third, consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib41\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ni et al., 2014</a>), we found that barium, a divalent cation that cannot bind to CaM (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chao et al., 1984</a>), can still potently activate TMEM16A channels in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Fourth, mutating three residues (V310, Y314, and L319) that were recently reported to be necessary for CaM-TMEM16A interactions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vocke et al., 2013</a>) did not reduce the apparent calcium sensitivity of the mouse TMEM16A channel expressed in HEK 293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

For a comprehensive survey of putative calcium binding residues in TMEM16A, we identified 38 acidic residues (including E698 and E701) that are conserved in all known calcium-activated ion channels in the TMEM16 family (including a <i>Drosophila</i> calcium-activated chloride channel [<a href=\"#bib37\">Wong et al., 2013</a>]) and that are hypothesized to be solvent accessible from the intracellular compartment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We then systematically replaced each of these residues in the mouse TMEM16A channel with alanine and measured their apparent calcium sensitivity using inside-out patches excised from HEK 293 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We found that alanine substitutions at E698 and E701 greatly reduced the apparent calcium affinity of TMEM16A-CaCC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), similar to the effects of glutamine substitutions at these residues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Moreover, our screen identified three additional acidic residues (E650, E730, and D734) that were critical for the calcium sensitivity of TMEM16A channels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Similar to E698A and E701A, alanine mutations of these three acidic residues resulted in at least a 10-fold reduction of apparent calcium sensitivity.

Compared to wildtype (WT) channels (EC<sub>50</sub>: 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM), the EC<sub>50</sub>s of E698R and E701R were increased by several thousand-fold to 5.0 \u00b1 0.3 mM and 3.3 \u00b1 0.5 mM, respectively, while the effects of E730R were milder, increasing EC<sub>50</sub> to 0.6 \u00b1 0.3 mM. The most substantial changes were caused by the D734R mutation, which elevated EC<sub>50</sub> to such a great extent that 10 mM intracellular calcium, the highest concentration of calcium used in this study, was unable to activate the mutant channel. The lack of CaCC current in D734R mutants was not due to defects in protein expression or folding because cadmium ions could still robustly activate the channel (see below). In contrast, the arginine substitution in E650R mutants only produced a small reduction in calcium sensitivity (EC<sub>50</sub>: 6.5 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5M), suggesting that the side chain at position 650 may not be directly involved in calcium coordination."

Although we were not able to accurately estimate the true EC<sub>50</sub> of any D734 mutants because channel activity was too low to properly normalize current amplitude even at 10 mM strontium, it appears that charge-preserving glutamate mutants are more sensitive to strontium ions than alanine, cysteine, and arginine mutants, which were not activated by strontium at all (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). The loss of channel activity in these constructs are not due to improper protein folding or export since these mutants can still be robustly activated by intracellular cadmium (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). Consistent with our recordings of D734 mutant channels activated by calcium ions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), it appears that although glutamate is able to partially substitute for aspartate at this site, the side chain length as well as the charge of D734 is important for channel activation by hard divalent cations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>"

Because the effects of each mutation are contingent on the divalent cation species used to activate the channel, it is likely that these sites directly alter the metal ion-binding pocket.

Studying how calcium activates the newly discovered TMEM16A-CaCC channel will help us understand its physiological functions. Thus far, the molecular nature of the TMEM16A calcium sensor has been under extensive debate. One theory asserts that a ubiquitous calcium sensing protein, calmodulin (CaM), is responsible for calcium activation of the CaCC (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Vocke et al., 2013</a>), resembling the mechanism of the small-conductance K<sub>Ca</sub> (SK) channels. A competing theory asserts that calcium ions can directly bind to the channel itself without the involvement of CaM (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yu et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Terashima et al., 2013</a>), analogous to the mechanism of the large-conductance K<sub>Ca</sub> (BK) channels. To settle this debate and to advance the molecular understanding of how calcium activates TMEM16A, we performed a comprehensive screen of evolutionarily conserved intracellular acidic residues in the TMEM16A protein and mapped its calcium sensor to a region between transmembrane segments 5 and 7. By manipulating the charge, size, and reactivity of these side chains, we characterized the mutant channels' sensitivity and selectivity for different divalent cations and showed that four critical acidic residues (E698, E701, E730, and D734) in this region are situated at a solvent-accessible site that likely interacts with calcium in the cytoplasm during channel activation."

By using inside-out patch recordings to accurately assess channel sensitivity to divalent cations and exploiting differences in the coordination chemistry of hard and soft ligands to deduce the functional role of individual acidic residues, our study based on a mutagenesis screen of acidic residues provides a comprehensive survey of the potential high affinity calcium binding sites within the TMEM16A protein."

Furthermore, the differences in the way these mutations affect channel sensitivity to the hard calcium and strontium ions and the softer cadmium ions suggest that these mutations directly impact channel\u2013ion interactions rather than acting via an allosteric mechanism.

Micromolar calcium and strontium ions can activate the channel through both the calcium bowl and the RCK1 high affinity sites but not through the low affinity site. Micromolar cadmium only activates the channel via the RCK1 high affinity site; even 300 \u03bcM cadmium cannot act on the calcium bowl site to activate the channel. In contrast, 200 \u03bcM barium has no effect on the RCK1 site (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). Instead, barium ions activate the channel through the calcium bowl site with five times lower affinity than calcium. On the other hand, millimolar concentrations of all these divalent cations can activate the channel through the low affinity metal ion binding site (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zeng et al., 2005</a>)."

However, the TMEM16A channel is much less sensitive to barium (EC<sub>50</sub>: 330 \u00b1 30 \u03bcM) and cadmium (EC<sub>50</sub>: 940 \u00b1 80 \u03bcM) than BK channels, which responds to 10 \u03bcM barium and cadmium via the calcium bowl and the RCK1 high affinity site, respectively. This difference suggests that the high affinity calcium binding site(s) in the TMEM16A channel might be less effective in binding barium and cadmium ions due to their less optimal coordination chemistry. Alternatively, barium and/or cadmium might activate the TMEM16A channel via an unknown low affinity cation binding site, which remains latent under physiological conditions. This scenario seems plausible as none of our high affinity site mutations abolishes cadmium activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). The identity of this putative low affinity, nonselective cation binding site and its potential involvement in TMEM16A channel activation require further study."

After these candidate acidic residues were positively identified, conservative mutations preserving either the negative charge (glutamate to aspartate or vice versa) or the approximate side chain volume (glutamate to glutamine, or aspartate to asparagine) were expected to have relatively minor effects on calcium coordination in actual binding sites, considering that either the electrostatic or steric side chain properties would be preserved under those conditions. Conversely, introduction of positively charged arginine side chain would have been expected to produce much more drastic effects. Indeed, this pattern was observed for four of the five acidic residues identified in the mutagenesis screen. The calcium sensitivity of E698, E701 and D734 was drastically reduced by arginine substitutions, in contrast to the milder effects caused by conservative substitutions. Mutations of E730 followed the same pattern consistent with a divalent ion binding site, though with generally less drastic effects. The E650R mutant, on the other hand, retained the highest sensitivity to calcium of all substitutions at that site, whereas conservative substitutions greatly impacted calcium sensitivity. These results suggest that E650 is unlikely to interact directly with a calcium ion, at least not in the same manner as those of the other four, and we have thus excluded it from our proposed model of the primary calcium interaction site (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Given the possibility that E650 may be involved in the transduction of conformational changes associated with calcium binding to trigger the channel's gating machinery, it will be important to further scrutinize its functional role in future studies."

Strontium is a divalent ion with chemical properties similar to calcium, as it has two electrons in its outer valence shell and is considered a \u2018hard\u2019 ligand (<a href=\"#bib22\">Rubin, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dudev and Lim, 2003</a>). Although strontium has a slightly larger ionic radius than calcium, it has been shown previously to robustly activate TMEM16A channels (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>). The effects of side chain substitutions at those four sites on calcium and strontium sensitivity showed similar trends. In contrast, E650 mutants were generally insensitive to strontium activation, and the mutant displaying the highest sensitivity was again E650R, in keeping with our findings regarding calcium activation."

Cadmium is among the transition metals and acts as a \u2018soft\u2019 ligand, but has an ionic radius nearly identical to that of calcium (<a href=\"#bib32\">S\u00f3v\u00e1g\u00f3 and V\u00e1rnagy, 2013</a>). Here, we found that while the wildtype channel was far less sensitive to cadmium ions than calcium ions, the apparent cadmium sensitivities of the mutant channels were insensitive to the side chain manipulations and remain in the submillimolar to millimolar range. In our view, there are at least two plausible explanations for this phenomenon. Firstly, as cadmium ions can be adequately coordinated by fewer negatively charged groups, alterations of just one of the interacting acidic residues may have less drastic effects on cadmium coordination. Alternately, as mentioned previously, it is possible that a second, lower affinity and/or less calcium-selective binding site may exist in the channel that can more readily bind cadmium following mutation in the higher affinity site identified in this study. At present, our results do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities, particularly as structural and functional studies of TMEM16A gating are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, the identification of residues forming a high affinity binding site, and our finding that cadmium can activate TMEM16A mutants rendered insensitive to calcium, provide key tools for the future study of channel gating processes downstream of TMEM16A\u2019s high affinity binding of divalent cations."

This is consistent with recent findings (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Scudieri et al., 2013</a>) that the third intracellular loop (between TM6\u2032 and TM7, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, Model B) is important for the calcium sensitivity of the TMEM16A and TMEM16B CaCC channels. Previous studies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yu et al., 2012</a>) have proposed two different models of membrane topology for TMEM16A. The earlier model (Model A in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) includes a long extracellular or reentrant loop between TM5 and TM6\u2033 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yang et al., 2008b</a>), while a subsequent model (Model B in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) proposes that the peptide between TM5 and TM6\u2033 in Model A actually includes one transmembrane segment (TM6\u2032) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yu et al., 2012</a>). Our current study provides new insight into the membrane topology of this region by showing that residues 701 and 730 are accessible to the intracellular solvent and are in close proximity such that a disulfide bridge can form between E701C and E730C to impact calcium activation of the channel. This functional study implies that the hydrophobic region spanning 28 residues (including the putative TM6\u2033) between E701 and E730 likely forms a short reentrant loop (Model C in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), bringing together these four acidic residues at both ends of this loop to coordinate calcium ions. Further structural information is needed to validate this model."

Interestingly, these putative calcium binding acidic residues are highly conserved among proteins in the TMEM16 family, some of which have been shown to be important in cellular processes ranging from mucus secretion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Huang et al., 2012b</a>) to blood coagulation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Suzuki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yang et al., 2012</a>) in mammals and host defense in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wong et al., 2013</a>).

First, results in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> extend previous work suggesting that CaM does not mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation. Second, the present results confirm the role of E698 and E701 as potential Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing residues. However, particularly in regard to the importance of E698 and E701 (along with other residues), the present results are more extensive and rigorous, since the use of excised inside out patches allows definition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of activation in both WT and mutated constructs."

The authors exclude E650 as a potential residue in the divalent cation binding pocket, while suggesting E730 and E734 to be in direct contact with the activating divalent cations. The patterns of the mutation effects in various E730 and E734 mutants, like that of the E650 mutations, are not straightforward for making such a conclusion. A comparison of the strontium and cadmium activations in E650 mutants with those of E730 and E734 mutants may help strengthen the conclusion that E730 and E734 are in the cation-binding pocket while E650 is not."

Based on <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, it appears that the oxidation and reduction effects are instantaneous, or at least as fast as the current activation by 300 micromolar calcium. If the redox modulation, as suggested by the authors involves a disulfide bond, such fast oxidation and reduction rates seem unusual. Further evidence to strengthen that this redox modulation indeed involves a disulfide bond but is not simply an effect due to oxidation/reduction of both cysteines would be helpful. This clarification is important for the argument that E701 and E730 are spatially clustered."

Although Hill coefficients are really only an empirical descriptor that relates to actual molecular events in only complicated ways, they can help guide thinking. In the present case, the concentration-responses exhibit features that seem rather surprising. First, some mutations, particularly those causing partial shifts in affinity, also change the apparent slope (i.e., Hill coefficient). Second, the mutations that cause the greatest loss of affinity seem to have apparent slopes more similar to WT. Third, except for the D734R construct, none of the mutations seem to completely abolish the activation effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (or Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>)."

One explanation might be that there are really multiple distinct divalent sensitive sites, and only when the higher-affinity site is weakened, does the second site become revealed. Of course, that would require that the net effect of both sites working together is not additive, in the WT construct. Might the similarity of the concentration-response curves for all of the most severe mutations (except E730?) suggest that some low affinity site unrelated to any of the sites examined is still present? For other potential Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site residues in other channels (MthK, BK) or even in CaM, is it the case that when key residues are mutated, Ca<sup>2+</sup> can still be bound, but only at weaker affinity? It would seem important that these issues be raised and discussed and the results here be contrasted to some of these other cases."

In fact, E650R is the only mutant at this site that conducts appreciable current with strontium activation. This is consistent with our observation with calcium ions. These experiments thus further support our conclusion that E650 does not directly bind calcium, but rather is critical for gating transduction upon divalent cation binding.

In this scenario, each monomer may contain such a low affinity site to give the Hill coefficient of around 2.
