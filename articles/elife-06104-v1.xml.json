                    "text": "HGF/Met signaling has recently been associated with basal-type breast cancers, which are thought to originate from progenitor cells residing in the luminal compartment of the mammary epithelium. We found that ICAM-1 efficiently marks mammary luminal progenitors comprising hormone receptor-positive and receptor-negative cells, presumably ductal and alveolar progenitors. Both cell populations strongly express Met, while HGF is produced by stromal and basal myoepithelial cells. We show that persistent HGF treatment stimulates the clonogenic activity of ICAM1-positive luminal progenitors, controlling their survival and proliferation, and leads to the expression of basal cell characteristics, including stem cell potential. This is accompanied by the induction of <i>Snai1</i> and <i>Snai2</i>, two major transcription factors triggering epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, the repression of the luminal-regulatory genes <i>Elf5</i> and <i>Hey1</i>, and claudin down-regulation. Our data strongly indicate that paracrine Met signaling can control the function of luminal progenitors and modulate their fate during mammary development and tumorigenesis."

We found that ICAM-1 efficiently marks mammary luminal progenitors comprising hormone receptor-positive and receptor-negative cells, presumably ductal and alveolar progenitors. Both cell populations strongly express Met, while HGF is produced by stromal and basal myoepithelial cells. We show that persistent HGF treatment stimulates the clonogenic activity of ICAM1-positive luminal progenitors, controlling their survival and proliferation, and leads to the expression of basal cell characteristics, including stem cell potential. This is accompanied by the induction of <i>Snai1</i> and <i>Snai2</i>, two major transcription factors triggering epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, the repression of the luminal-regulatory genes <i>Elf5</i> and <i>Hey1</i>, and claudin down-regulation. Our data strongly indicate that paracrine Met signaling can control the function of luminal progenitors and modulate their fate during mammary development and tumorigenesis."

Luminal cells line the inside of branch-like structures throughout the mammary gland and are responsible for producing milk. When the mammary gland grows, new luminal cells develop from a kind of cell called luminal progenitor cells. However, these progenitor cells are also thought to be the source of certain types of breast cancer."

When Met and \u2018co-receptor\u2019 proteins bind to a molecule called HGF, this triggers a cascade of signals that can cause certain cells to change their properties. This is known as the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. Although this transition is important for new tissues to develop, it can also result in cancerous tumors forming if it is not correctly controlled. Luminal cells do not produce HGF themselves, which suggests that Met signaling in these cells is triggered by the HGF released from neighboring cells. However, neither the mechanisms behind this signaling nor the effects of signaling on the luminal progenitor cells are well understood."

This revealed that one of the co-receptors\u2014called ICAM-1\u2014can be used as a marker to identify certain types of luminal progenitor cell. Di-Cicco et al. found that these progenitor cells display Met on their surface, and other types of mammary cell\u2014called stromal cells and myoepithelial cells\u2014produce HGF."

These findings suggest that myoepithelial and stromal cells regulate luminal progenitor cells by producing HGF to activate Met signaling in these cells. Such interactions could be of great importance during mammary development and tumorigenesis. The next big challenge will be to determine the circumstances under which luminal progenitor cells stimulated by HGF can give rise to breast cancers. This work will allow us to better define the cell population that should be targeted by anti-cancer drugs."

The luminal cell layer contains clonogenic cells, the luminal progenitors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asselin-Labat et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sleeman et al., 2007</a>). This population is heterogeneous, consisting of hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative clonogenic cells that are considered to be functionally distinct ductal and alveolar progenitors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beleut et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Regan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shehata et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Considerable interest has recently focused on luminal progenitors. According to lineage-tracing studies, these cells are able to drive the expansion of the luminal cell population in mammary ducts and alveoli during postnatal development (<a href=\"#bib64\">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rios et al., 2014</a>).

Of note, ectopic expression of Snail2 endows luminal progenitors with basal cell features (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guo et al., 2012</a>), supporting an important role of EMT in the regulation of luminal progenitor plasticity."

Met signaling has been implicated in mammary development and tumorigenesis. Although not investigated in detail yet, Met-deficient mammary glands of adult MMTV-Cre:Met<sup>f/f</sup> mice showed defects in branching morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garner et al., 2011</a>). Aberrant Met activation occurs in breast cancers, in particular in the triple-negative, basal-like subtype (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gastaldi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ponzo and Park, 2010</a>). Expression of activated Met or over-expression of HGF in mouse mammary gland induce tumors, including those of the basal-like subtype (<a href=\"#bib22\">Graveel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ponzo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Holland et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Knight et al., 2013</a>). Several in vitro studies performed with mammary organoids or immortalized cell lines have implicated HGF/Met signaling in the regulation of mammary epithelial cell growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Soriano et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Haslam et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2011</a>). One recent work indicated that luminal progenitors express Met and that, when forced to express HGF, display an enhanced in vivo regenerative potential, a property attributed to basal-type stem cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gastaldi et al., 2013</a>). However, in situ, mammary luminal cells do not express HGF, suggesting that Met signaling in mammary epithelial cells is activated in a paracrine manner. HGF-mediated paracrine and autocrine Met stimulation can trigger distinct biological responses in epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mai et al., 2014</a>). How Met-expressing luminal progenitors respond to the physiological paracrine action of HGF has not yet been investigated at the cellular and molecular levels."

In this study, we investigated the expression of ICAM-1, CD44v6, HGF, and Met in the mouse mammary epithelium. We found that ICAM-1 is a useful marker for obtaining highly enriched preparations of clonogenic luminal progenitors that express <i>Met</i>, and that HGF is produced by both stromal and myoepithelial cells. Using ICAM-1 as a surface marker, we further characterized Met-expressing luminal progenitors and analyzed their cellular and molecular responses to HGF. Our data suggest that HGF can act as a paracrine regulator of luminal progenitor function and fate during mammary development and tumorigenesis."

Consistently, immunofluorescence stainings revealed that, like untreated control cultures, secondary mammospheres deprived of HGF contained less than 1% K5-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). HGF-treated secondary mammospheres contained twice more K5-positive cells than HGF-treated primary spheres. Many K5-positive cells co-expressed K8, as in primary spheres, (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Experiments performed with mammary luminal progenitors purified from BlgCre; R26 mice confirmed that, in HGF-treated secondary mammospheres, K5-expressing cells were derived from LacZ-positive luminal cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

Untreated cells isolated from primary spheres failed to repopulate the fat pad or gave rise to very limited outgrowths. In contrast, HGF-treated cultures formed ductal-type outgrowths in seven of the eight transplanted fat pads (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Serial passages of luminal progenitor-derived mammospheres stimulated by HGF led to an important enrichment in K5-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>); we therefore compared the regenerative potential of secondary spheres from untreated and HGF-stimulated cultures. Strikingly, these transplantation assays showed that only HGF-treated spheres were able to form outgrowths (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). 6-week-old outgrowths were composed of well-organized ducts and growing buds comprising K8-positive luminal cells and basally located \u03b1-SMA-expressing myoepithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>)."

Subsequently, the combined use of Sca-1 and c-kit or CD49b revealed that the luminal progenitors in the mature virgin gland belong to two distinct populations, one consisting essentially of HR-positive cells and the other mostly of HR-negative cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Regan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shehata et al., 2012</a>). We found that in virgin glands and during early pregnancy, combined ICAM-1 and Sca-1 expression discriminated these two major luminal clonogenic cell subsets. ICAM-1 clearly appeared more efficient than Sca-1 for separating non-clonogenic and clonogenic luminal populations. Importantly, ICAM-1 marked the luminal progenitor population in different mouse strains, including C57Bl6/J, and in mixed backgrounds, such as that of BlgCre; R26 mice, whereas neither CD61 nor c-kit can be used for luminal progenitor enrichment from C57Bl6/J mouse mammary glands (<a href=\"#bib66\">Visvader and Stingl, 2014</a>). Furthermore, differential ICAM-1 expression within the Sca-1-negative luminal cell population separated a poorly clonogenic ICAM1-negative subset enriched in HR-positive cells (Lu3) from a major clonogenic cell fraction positive for ICAM-1 and lacking HR expression (Lu4). Such separation was not possible with CD49b, the most recently described marker for characterizing luminal cell subsets (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shehata et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Silva et al., 2015</a>)."

Thus, the two major clonogenic populations of luminal progenitors, enriched in HR-negative and HR-positive cells, are potential targets of HGF/Met signaling.

Our data thus highlight the phenotypic diversity of Met-expressing cells in the luminal population.

Our data showed that loss of ICAM-1 did not severely affect mammary development, HGF/Met signaling, and basal cell differentiation process in luminal progenitors. This suggests that CD44v6 rather than ICAM-1 serve as main co-receptor for Met in the mouse mammary epithelium and that identical compensation mechanisms may be involved in Met activation in liver and mammary gland. Distribution of Met and its co-receptors in the human mammary gland remains poorly defined; however, strong expression of Met, ICAM-1, and CD44v6 has been associated with triple-negative breast cancers and correlated with poor prognosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Charpin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gastaldi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ponzo and Park, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schroder et al., 2011</a>).

It is worth mentioning that in the postnatal mammary epithelium, ductal luminal cells are in direct contact with myoepithelial rather than stromal cells. In alveoli, the myoepithelial cell layer is discontinuous, so luminal cells may also come into contact with the basement membrane (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moumen et al., 2011</a>). HGF produced by both myoepithelial and stromal cells may therefore contribute to the control of the luminal progenitor activity, favoring either their normal expansion during development or aberrant amplification in cancers.
