Although \u03c3 factors are generally classified as initiation factors, \u03c3 can also remain associated with, and modulate the behavior of, RNAP during elongation. Here we establish that the primary \u03c3 factor in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, can function as an elongation factor in vivo by loading directly onto the transcription elongation complex (TEC) <i>in trans</i>. We demonstrate that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> can bind <i>in trans</i> to TECs that emanate from either a \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter or a promoter that is controlled by an alternative \u03c3 factor. We further demonstrate that binding of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> to the TEC <i>in trans</i> can have a particularly large impact on the dynamics of transcription elongation during stationary phase. Our findings establish a mechanism whereby the primary \u03c3 factor can exert direct effects on the composition of the entire transcriptome, not just that portion that is produced under the control of \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters."

Although \u03c3 factors are generally classified as initiation factors, \u03c3 can also remain associated with, and modulate the behavior of, RNAP during elongation. Here we establish that the primary \u03c3 factor in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, can function as an elongation factor in vivo by loading directly onto the transcription elongation complex (TEC) <i>in trans</i>. We demonstrate that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> can bind <i>in trans</i> to TECs that emanate from either a \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter or a promoter that is controlled by an alternative \u03c3 factor. We further demonstrate that binding of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> to the TEC <i>in trans</i> can have a particularly large impact on the dynamics of transcription elongation during stationary phase. Our findings establish a mechanism whereby the primary \u03c3 factor can exert direct effects on the composition of the entire transcriptome, not just that portion that is produced under the control of \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters."

In the first step of protein production, an enzyme called RNA polymerase uses the gene as a template to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This process\u2014known as transcription\u2014starts when RNA polymerase binds to a site at the start of a gene. The enzyme then moves along the DNA, assembling the mRNA as it goes. This stage of transcription is known as elongation and continues until the RNA polymerase reaches the end of the gene."

In the well studied bacterium known as <i>E. coli</i>, the primary sigma factor that is required for transcription initiation on most genes is called sigma 70. Recent research has shown that sigma 70 also influences the activity of RNA polymerase during elongation. During this stage, the RNA polymerase and several other proteins interact to form a complex called the transcription elongation complex (or TEC for short). However, it is not clear how sigma 70 gains access to this complex: does it simply remain with RNA polymerase after transcription starts, or is it freshly incorporated into the TEC during elongation?"

Sigma 70 can even incorporate into TECs on genes where transcription was initiated by a different sigma factor. These findings indicate that sigma 70 can directly influence the transcription of all genes, not just the genes with start sites that are recognized by this sigma factor."

This implies that the growth status of the cells modulates the pausing of RNA polymerase during transcription. In the future, it will be important to understand how much influence the primary sigma factor has on RNA polymerase during elongation in <i>E. coli</i> and other bacteria."

All bacteria contain a primary \u03c3 factor that directs transcription from the major class of bacterial promoters; in addition, most bacteria contain multiple alternative \u03c3 factors that direct transcription from specialized promoters in response to stress or alterations in growth state (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gruber and Gross, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Osterberg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guo and Gross, 2014</a>). Among the best-studied primary \u03c3 factors is <i>Escherichia coli</i> \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, which recognizes promoters that are defined by two conserved hexameric DNA sequence elements termed the \u221210 and the \u221235 elements (consensus sequences: TATAAT and TTGACA, respectively). Members of the \u03c3<sup>70</sup> family share a conserved 4-domain architecture, with domain 2 contacting the \u221210 element and domain 4 contacting the \u221235 element (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gross et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Paget and Helmann, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Feklistov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Paget, 2015</a>). <i>E. coli</i> also has six alternative \u03c3 factors, five of which are members of the \u03c3<sup>70</sup> family and recognize similarly positioned promoter elements using the counterparts of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> domains 2 and 4. Most alternative \u03c3 factors exhibit highly restricted promoter specificity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Koo et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rhodius et al., 2013</a>). Thus, genes that are responsive to disparate physiological inputs often carry two or more promoters that are recognized by distinct \u03c3 factors (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wade et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gama-Castro et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cho et al., 2014</a>)."

In particular, multiple studies have shown that the release of \u03c3 from the transcription complex is not required for entry into the elongation phase of transcription (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib27\">Mooney et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</a>). Furthermore, the functional properties of a transcription elongation complex (TEC) containing \u03c3 differ from the properties of a TEC that does not contain \u03c3. For example, TEC-associated \u03c3<sup>70</sup> can induce transcription pausing by engaging promoter \u221210-like sequence elements within transcribed regions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ring et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brodolin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nickels et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hatoum and Roberts, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deighan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</a>), a phenomenon that was first uncovered in the context of the bacteriophage \u03bb late gene promoter (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib48\">Roberts et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</a>). This pausing occurs due to an interaction between the \u221210-like element and domain 2 of TEC-associated \u03c3<sup>70</sup> (the same domain of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> that binds the promoter \u221210 element during transcription initiation). In addition, the presence or absence of \u03c3 can alter the accessibility of the TEC to elongation factors, including the \u03bb Q protein and RfaH (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roberts et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nickels et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sevostyanova et al., 2008</a>), and can influence the ability of RNAP to reinitiate transcription at certain promoters (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bar-Nahum and Nudler, 2001</a>)."

In prior work, we showed that such promoter-proximal \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent pause elements also function to inhibit \u03c3<sup>70</sup> loss during the earliest stages of elongation, increasing the \u03c3<sup>70</sup> content of downstream TECs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deighan et al., 2011</a>). This effect can be detected using a template that carries a second pause element positioned downstream of a promoter-proximal pause element; specifically, the presence of the promoter-proximal pause element facilitates the retention of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> in the TEC and thus substantially enhances the extent of pausing induced by the downstream pause element both in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deighan et al., 2011</a>)."

Thus, it has been shown that the efficiency of pausing induced by transcribed region \u221210-like elements can be increased in vitro by increasing the concentration of free \u03c3<sup>70</sup> in the transcription reactions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mooney and Landick, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sevostyanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deighan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sevostyanova et al., 2011</a>). A key question that emerges from these in vitro findings is whether or not cellular conditions permit \u03c3<sup>70</sup> to gain access to the TEC through this <i>\u2018trans</i>-acting pathway\u2019 in vivo. Here we address this question by employing an assay that enables us to measure the extent of TEC pausing induced by a \u221210-like element within a transcribed region in vivo. We find that the extent of pausing induced by a transcribed-region \u221210-like element is sensitive to the intracellular concentration of \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, indicating that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> can gain access to the TEC <i>in trans</i>. We further establish that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> can gain access to the TEC <i>in trans</i> and engage \u221210-like elements within transcribed regions that are expressed under the control of either a \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter or a promoter that is recognized by an alternative \u03c3 factor. In addition, we show that the extent of TEC pausing mediated by \u03c3<sup>70</sup> <i>trans</i> loading varies as a function of growth-phase. Our findings imply that distinct \u03c3 factors can control initiation and elongation on the same transcription unit in vivo, and that the functional consequences of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> <i>trans</i> loading vary as a function of growth state."

We therefore sought to determine whether or not the efficiency of pausing induced by a transcribed-region \u221210-like element was sensitive to the concentration of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> present in vivo.

This \u03c3<sup>28</sup> dependent promoter (P<i>tar</i>) was fused to the same transcribed region sequences that are present on the \u03bbP<sub>R\u2032</sub> template shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> starting at position +6 (including the \u221210-like element; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We first performed in vitro transcription experiments to determine whether or not \u03c3<sup>70</sup> could access the TEC and induce pausing on this template. We formed open complexes on P<i>tar</i> using RNAP holoenzyme containing \u03c3<sup>28</sup> and then allowed a single round of transcription to occur in the absence or presence of excess \u03c3<sup>70</sup>. We monitored the RNA content of each reaction at three time points after the initiation of transcription. Addition of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> to the transcription reactions resulted in the appearance of a cluster of RNAs \u223c35-nt in length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, compare lanes 4\u20136 with lanes 1\u20133). These RNAs were not observed when reactions were performed using a control template carrying disruptive base-pair substitutions within the transcribed-region \u221210-like element (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lanes 7\u201312). A set of reactions performed in the presence of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> but in the absence of \u03c3<sup>28</sup> confirmed that appearance of the cluster of \u223c35-nt RNAs is strictly dependent on transcription that initiates from P<i>tar</i> under the control of \u03c3<sup>28</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lanes 13\u201315).

The reactions were performed as a time course with samples taken at 1, 6 and 18 min after transcription was initiated; these reactions were performed in the absence of transcript cleavage factors GreA and GreB, resulting in a characteristic pattern of long-lived pause species (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deighan et al., 2011</a>). Where indicated, excess \u03c3<sup>70</sup> (1 \u03bcM) was added with the \u2018start mix\u2019 after open complex formation. RNAs associated with paused transcription elongation complexes (TECs) (pause) and terminated transcripts (full length) are labeled. The asterisk (*) indicates a shorter terminated transcript that is the result of transcription initiating under the control of the transcribed-region \u221210 element when the \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-containing holoenzyme is present in the reaction."

The <i>cis</i>-acting pathway depends on retention in the TEC of the \u03c3<sup>70</sup> that was used during initiation, with the extent of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> retention being modulated by the sequence of the initial transcribed region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deighan et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the <i>cis</i>-acting (retention) pathway is necessarily restricted to transcription units controlled by \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters. In contrast, the <i>trans</i>-acting pathway identified in this study, which can be functionally defined by its sensitivity to the intracellular concentration of \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, is potentially operative on all transcription units (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Moreover, the two pathways can function in concert. Thus, we found that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> <i>trans</i> loading can increase the \u03c3<sup>70</sup> content of TECs generated under the control of a \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter even in the presence of an initial-transcribed-region \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent pause element that augments \u03c3<sup>70</sup> retention."

In particular, pausing mediated by chromosomally encoded <i>trans</i>-loaded \u03c3<sup>70</sup> was detectable during the exponential phase of growth and this pausing became more prominent during stationary phase. Our experiments revealed that this increase in the relative abundance of the pause species during stationary phase was explained at least in part by an increase in pause half-life in stationary phase cells as compared to exponentially growing cells. We speculate that this increase in pause half-life might be due to a drop in the intracellular NTP concentrations as nutrients are depleted and the cells enter stationary phase (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buckstein et al., 2008</a>)."

Our findings illustrate another mechanism whereby the combined input of multiple \u03c3 factors can modulate gene expression. Specifically, we show that distinct \u03c3 factors can direct initiation and modulate elongation on the same transcription unit. Such \u2018\u03c3 cross regulation\u2019 might enable the cell to integrate signals transmitted via \u03c3<sup>70</sup> and an alternative \u03c3 factor to modulate gene expression within a single transcription unit under the control of a non \u03c3<sup>70</sup>\u2013dependent promoter. In principle there are several ways that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> <i>trans</i> loading might modulate gene expression. First, as shown here, \u03c3<sup>70</sup> <i>trans</i> loading can cause the TEC to pause, which is expected to influence transcription output directly in a manner that depends on pause half-life (and, as suggested by our results shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, may become particularly relevant in stationary phase). \u03c3<sup>70</sup>\u2013dependent pausing might also influence gene expression indirectly, by facilitating engagement of regulatory factors, influencing formation of RNA secondary structures, or influencing translation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roberts et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wickiser et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Landick, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pan and Sosnick, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lemay et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Perdrizet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Larson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nechooshtan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</a>). Second, \u03c3<sup>70</sup> <i>trans</i> loading might impede the accessibility of the TEC to other elongation factors such as NusG or RfaH, which share the same primary binding site on RNAP (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sevostyanova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mooney et al., 2009</a>)."

In this regard, the application of sequencing-based methodologies such as native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Larson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</a>) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Myers et al., 2015</a>) should enable the identification of transcription units that manifest growth phase-dependent pausing attributable to <i>trans</i> loaded \u03c3<sup>70</sup>. Nevertheless, our findings add to a growing body of evidence that the functions of \u03c3 are not limited to the initiation phase of transcription. Furthermore, they establish a mechanism whereby the primary \u03c3 factor can extend its reach by exerting direct effects on the composition of the entire transcriptome, not just that portion that is produced under the control of \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters."

The authors demonstrate that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> loads in <i>trans</i> at a \u221210-like element downstream of the \u03bbP<sub>R</sub> promoter in vivo, that it increases pausing at this site, that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> can load downstream even when the transcript is initiated at a promoter directed by an alternative holoenzyme (Es28; thus establishing that \u03c3<sup>70</sup> really is loading in trans), that the level of the resulting pause increases in a \u03c3<sup>70</sup> concentration-dependent manner (further evidence that the effect is exerted in trans), and that the total fraction of transcripts that pause is additive with the effect in <i>cis</i> of a \u03c3 binding site in the initial transcribed region. The effects are small at natural concentrations of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> but quite strong when \u03c3<sup>70</sup> is overproduced. The experiments are well-designed, the results are clear, and the description is precise. These are important findings, building on a proposal from the Landick lab about 10 years ago from experiments with a \u03c3 factor fused to core RNAP. The potential that specific operons are regulated by either free \u03c3<sup>70</sup> or other \u03c3 factors at entry sites within the coding regions of operons is enticing. A few ideas for improvements in presentation are listed below, but otherwise the paper is ready to go."

This should be acknowledged in a more forthright manner, but some potential conditions when such a phenomenon might influence transcription might be expanded on. For example, most of the alternative \u03c3 factors are induced naturally, some to quite high levels, and one could imagine that binding sites for these \u03c3s at strategic positions in the transcribed region might transiently influence elongation in <i>trans</i>."

Apart from the promoter-proximal \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing, no convincing data exists pointing to the larger role of initiation factor during the elongation phase of transcription.

These offer no new insights into the \u03c3<sup>70</sup>-dependent pausing per se, while the trans-loading onto early elongation complexes formed by \u03c328-containing holoenzymes is a fairly trivial observation. The significance of the manuscript's \u201cfindings\u201d is dramatically overstated: e.g. the \u201ccontrol\u201d of elongation by \u03c3<sup>70</sup> in vitro is not quantified in terms of elongation rate, pausing efficiency or pause half-life, instead the reader is presented with a (phosphor)image (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) s/he can only eyeball. Based on such eyeballing this reviewer concludes that the \u03c3<sup>70</sup> effects on elongation are minimal (judging by the apparent \u201camount\u201d of full-length product) and limited to the induction of promoter-proximal arrest or termination in a small fraction of complexes. These complexes are labeled as \u201cpause\u201d on <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> without any merit: there is no apparent time-decay (escape from the pause site), and no discernable escape from these \u201cpauses\u201d for up to 18 min (lanes 6 and 18). Moreover, it was not determined whether or not the shorter transcripts were still associated with RNA polymerase (which would distinguish paused/arrested complexes from terminated ones). As such, all that can be asserted from these experiments is the changes in RNA length. The same applies to the in vivo experiments reported by Goldman et al. Physical loading of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> onto elongation complexes has not been demonstrated either in vivo or in vitro which in turn means that Goldman et al. should limit their conclusions to a simple correlation between the concentration of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> and the abundance of the short transcripts produced from a handful of artificial templates."

In single-round transcription assays, rifampicin is routinely added after the elongation complex is stalled (by selective NTP deprivation) in proximity to the promoter (and is no longer sensitive to it) to prevent re-initiation. As described by Goldman et al. the single-round assay would be a no-round one and the transcripts depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> could not have been obtained as described in the Materials and methods."

This nucleotide is later removed (e.g. by gel-filtration) or diluted to negligible levels by the excess of the unlabeled one in the chase/extension mix. This way the amount of radioactivity in RNA is practically length-independent, enabling quantitative kinetic analysis of pausing, termination, etc. In contrast, in experiments described by Goldman et al. both labeled and un-labeled UTP are present in the reaction mix together from the start and no measure is mentioned that was taken to remove/dilute P32-labeled one. This makes the amount of radioactivity in the transcript dependent on its length and sequence (more radioactivity is incorporated as the transcript grows) rendering any quantitative interpretation of the data impractical."

We now show that the effect of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> <i>trans</i> loading on transcription pausing becomes highly significant in the absence of ectopically produced \u03c3<sup>70</sup> when the cells are in stationary phase. In particular, we observe an \u221210-fold increase in the abundance of the pause species in stationary-phase cells as compared to exponential-phase cells (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> of the revised manuscript). The use of a \u03c3<sup>28</sup>-dependent transcription unit to demonstrate this growth phase- dependent effect of \u03c3<sup>70</sup> on transcription pausing establishes unequivocally that the effect is due to <i>trans</i>-loaded \u03c3<sup>70</sup> and not \u03c3<sup>70</sup> that has been retained following the transition from initiation to elongation.
