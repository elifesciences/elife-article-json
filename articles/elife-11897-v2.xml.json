During import, translocation through the channel in the inner membrane is coupled to the ATP-dependent action of an Hsp70-based import motor at the matrix face. How these two processes are coordinated remained unclear. We show here that the two domain structure of Tim44 plays a central role in this process. The N-terminal domain of Tim44 interacts with the components of the import motor, whereas its C-terminal domain interacts with the translocation channel and is in contact with translocating proteins. Our data suggest that the translocation channel and the import motor of the TIM23 complex communicate through rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44 that are stimulated by translocating proteins."

During import, translocation through the channel in the inner membrane is coupled to the ATP-dependent action of an Hsp70-based import motor at the matrix face. How these two processes are coordinated remained unclear. We show here that the two domain structure of Tim44 plays a central role in this process. The N-terminal domain of Tim44 interacts with the components of the import motor, whereas its C-terminal domain interacts with the translocation channel and is in contact with translocating proteins. Our data suggest that the translocation channel and the import motor of the TIM23 complex communicate through rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44 that are stimulated by translocating proteins."

However, it is not clear how the channel and import motor are coupled together. There is some evidence that a protein within the TIM23 complex called Tim44 \u2013 which is made of two sections called the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain \u2013 is responsible for this coupling. It has been suggested that mainly the N-terminal domain of Tim44 is required for this role."

It is thus not very surprising that disturbances in mitochondrial function are associated with a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and various forms of cancer (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Quir\u00f3s et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</a>). An essential prerequisite for correctly functioning mitochondria is import of about 1000 different proteins synthesized as precursor proteins in the cytosol. Recent studies revealed that mitochondrial protein import machineries are sensitive indicators of functionality of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib12\">Harbauer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nargund et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yano et al., 2014</a>), demonstrating that a deep understanding of mitochondrial protein import pathways and their regulation will be essential for understanding the role mitochondria have under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Over half of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized with cleavable, N-terminal extensions called presequences. Import of such precursor proteins requires a coordinated action of the TOM complex in the outer membrane and the TIM23 complex in the inner membrane and is driven by membrane potential across the inner membrane and ATP in the matrix (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dolezal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Endo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Koehler, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mokranjac and Neupert, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schulz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stojanovski et al., 2012</a>)."

The latter process requires the presence of an additional, lateral insertion signal.

At the matrix-face of the inner membrane, precursor proteins are captured by the components of the import motor of the TIM23 complex, also referred to as PAM (presequence translocase-associated motor). Its central component is mtHsp70 whose ATP hydrolysis-driven action fuels translocation of precursor proteins into the matrix (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Los Rios et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Neupert and Brunner, 2002</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Schulz and Rehling, 2014</a>).\u00a0Multiple cycles of mtHsp70 binding to and release from translocating proteins are required for complete translocation across the inner membrane. The ATP hydrolysis-driven cycling of mtHsp70 and thereby its binding to proteins is regulated by the J- and J-like proteins Tim14(Pam18) and Tim16(Pam16) as well as by the nucleotide-exchange factor Mge1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">D'Silva et al., 2003</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Kozany et al., 2004</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Mapa et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib24\">Mokranjac et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib23\">2003b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Truscott et al., 2003</a>).

Like other components of the TIM23 complex, Tim44 is a highly evolutionary conserved protein and is encoded by an essential gene. In mammals, Tim44 has been implicated in diabetes-associated metabolic and cellular abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wada and Kanwar, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). A novel therapeutic approach using gene delivery of Tim44 has recently shown promising results in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). In addition, mutations in Tim44 were identified that predispose carriers to oncocytic thyroid carcinoma (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonora et al., 2006</a>). Understanding the function of Tim44 and its interactions within the TIM23 complex will therefore be essential for understanding how the energy of ATP hydrolysis is converted into unidirectional transport of proteins into mitochondria and may provide clues for therapeutic treatment of human diseases."

Tim44 also binds to mtHsp70, recruiting it to the translocation channel. The interaction between Tim44 and mtHsp70 is regulated both by nucleotides bound to mtHsp70 as well as by translocating proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">D'Silva et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Slutsky-Leiderman et al., 2007</a>).

Recent studies suggested that the N-terminal domain is responsible for the majority of known functions of Tim44. Segments of the N-terminal domain were identified that are important for interaction of Tim44 with Tim16 and with mtHsp70 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schilke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schiller et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, using site-specific crosslinking, residues in the N-terminal domain were crosslinked to the matrix-exposed loop of Tim23 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ting et al., 2014</a>). However, the C-terminal domain of Tim44 shows higher evolutionary conservation. Still, the only function that has so far been attributed to the C-terminal domain is its role in recruitment of Tim44 to cardiolipin-containing membranes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Weiss et al., 1999</a>). Based on the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain, a surface-exposed hydrophobic cavity was initially suggested to be important for membrane recruitment (<a href=\"#bib13\">Josyula et al., 2006</a>). However, subsequent biochemical studies combined with molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrated that the helices A1 and A2 (residues 235\u2013262 in yeast Tim44), present in the beginning of the C-terminal domain, are important for membrane recruitment (<a href=\"#bib21\">Marom et al., 2009</a>). Deletion of helices A1 and A2 abolished membrane association of the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, attachment of helices A1 and A2 to a soluble protein was sufficient to recruit it to a model membrane (<a href=\"#bib21\">Marom et al., 2009</a>)."

We thus compared the crosslinking patterns of TIM23 subunits in N+C mitochondria to those in FL.

Furthermore, they suggest that the C-terminal domain has an essential function within the TIM23 complex, beyond mere membrane recruitment. So, what is the function of the C-terminal domain of Tim44? We first searched for binding partners of the individual domains. To that end, we recombinantly expressed and purified full-length Tim44 as well as its two domains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To look for interaction partners of the core domains, both domains now lacked the segment containing A1 and A2 helices. Purified proteins were covalently coupled to the Sepharose beads and were subsequently incubated with mitochondrial lysates. Mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100 that, unlike digitonin, dissociates the TIM23 complex into its individual subunits (except for the Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex that remains stable). In this way, direct protein-protein interactions can be analyzed. We observed prominent, specific binding of mtHsp70, Tim16, Tim14 and Tim17, and to a far lesser degree of Tim23 and Tim50, to full-length Tim44 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). None of the proteins bound to empty beads. Also, we observed no binding of two abundant mitochondrial proteins, porin, and F1\u03b2\u00df, demonstrating the specificity of observed interactions. mtHsp70, Tim16 and Tim14 also efficiently bound to the N-terminal domain of Tim44, in agreement with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schilke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schiller et al., 2008</a>), and far less efficiently to the C-terminal domain. Since the Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex remains stable in Triton X-100, it is not possible by this method to distinguish which of the two subunits, or maybe even both, directly interacts with the N-terminal domain of Tim44. Binding of Tim17 to the N-terminal domain of Tim44 was drastically lower compared to its binding to the full-length protein. Instead, a strong binding of Tim17 to the C-terminal domain of Tim44 was observed."

To answer this question, we first affinity-purified antibodies that specifically recognize cores of the individual domains of Tim44 using the above described Sepharose beads. The antibodies, affinity purified using beads with coupled full-length Tim44, recognized full-length Tim44 as well as both of its domains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In contrast, antibodies that were affinity purified using beads with coupled individual domains recognized only the respective domain and the full-length protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This demonstrates that we indeed purified antibodies specific for individual domains of Tim44. Next, we accumulated <sup>35</sup>S-labelled precursor protein pcyt<i>b</i><sub>2</sub>(1\u2013167)\u25b3DHFR as a TOM-TIM23-spanning intermediate. Briefly, this precursor protein consists of the first 167 residues of yeast cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>2</sub>, with a 19 residue deletion in its lateral insertion signal, fused to the passenger protein dihydrofolate reductase. In the presence of methotrexate, that stabilizes folded DHFR, the <i>b</i><sub>2</sub> part reaches the matrix, whereas the DHFR moiety remains on the mitochondrial surface resulting in an intermediate that spans both TOM and TIM23 complexes. The association of Tim44 and its domains with the arrested precursor protein was analyzed by chemical crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to full-length Tim44 and its individual domains. In wild-type mitochondria, all three antibodies precipitated a crosslinking adduct of Tim44 to the arrested precursor protein, demonstrating that they are all able to immunoprecipitate the respective antigens (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In contrast, with N+C mitochondria, a faster migrating crosslinking adduct of a Tim44 domain to the arrested precursor protein was immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against the C-terminal domain and against the full-length protein but not with the antibodies against the N-terminal domain. This demonstrates that the C-terminal domain of Tim44 is in close vicinity of the translocating protein."

We show here that the two domains of Tim44 have different interaction partners within the TIM23 complex. In this way, Tim44 holds the TIM23 complex together. Our data revealed a direct, previously unexpected interaction between the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with the channel component Tim17. This result not only assigned a novel function to the C-terminal domain of Tim44 but also shed new light on Tim17, the component of the TIM23 complex that has been notoriously difficult to analyze. Recent mutational analysis of the matrix exposed loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 of Tim17 revealed no interaction site for Tim44 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ting et al., 2014</a>), suggesting its presence in another segment of the protein. Our data also confirmed the previously observed interactions of the N-terminal domain of Tim44 with the components of the import motor (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schilke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schiller et al., 2008</a>). We did, however, not observe any direct interaction between Tim23 and the N-terminal domain of Tim44 that has previously been seen by crosslinking in intact mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ting et al., 2014</a>). It is possible that this crosslinking requires a specific conformation of Tim23 only adopted when Tim23 is bound to Tim17 in the inner membrane. This notion is supported by our previous observation that the stable binding of Tim44 to the translocation channel requires assembled Tim17-Tim23 core of the TIM23 complex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mokranjac et al., 2003b</a>). We observed a direct Tim17-Tim44 interaction here probably because of a high local concentration of the C-terminal domain when bound to the beads."

This central segment connects the two domains of Tim44. Intriguingly, the two currently available crystal structures of the C-terminal domains of yeast and human Tim44s showed different orientations of the two helices relative to the core domains (<a href=\"#bib11\">Handa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Josyula et al., 2006</a>). The conformational change was likely induced upon PEG binding to this region of human Tim44 during crystallization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Handa et al., 2007</a>). It is tempting to speculate that the same conformational change takes place during translocation of proteins in the\u00a0mitochondria. Such a conformational change would not only reorient the two helices in respect to the core of the C-domain but also change the relative orientation of N- and C-terminal domains. Since the two domains have different interaction partners within the TIM23 complex, such a change could rearrange the entire complex. The importance of this proposed conformational change in Tim44 is supported by the data presented here. The function of the full-length Tim44 could be reconstituted from its individual domains only very poorly. Also, there is obviously a very strong evolutionary pressure to keep the two domains of Tim44 within one polypeptide chain. N+C strain had to be kept at all times on the selective medium - even after only an overnight incubation on a nonselective medium the full-length protein reappeared (our unpublished observation), likely due to a recombination event between two plasmids."

The corresponding mutation in yeast, Pro282Gln, destabilized the protein but produced no obvious growth phenotype or an <i>in vivo</i> import defect (our unpublished observations), suggesting that the yeast system is more robust. This observation is in agreement with the notion that mutations that would severely affect the function of the TIM23 complex would likely be embryonically lethal in humans. Still, the disease caused by a mutation in the C-terminal domain of human Tim44 speaks for an important role of this domain in the function of the entire TIM23 complex. Furthermore, the mutation maps to the short loop between A3 and A4 helices in the C-terminal domain of Tim44. Based on the crystal structure of Tim44, it was previously suggested that the mutation could affect the conformational flexibility of the A1 and A2 helices (<a href=\"#bib11\">Handa et al., 2007</a>), intriguingly providing further support for the above postulated conformational changes of Tim44."

Tim44 plays a central role in this model. We envisage that two domains of Tim44 are connected by the central segment that contains membrane-recruitment helices, like two cherries on the stalks (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> insert). This central segment of Tim44 recruits the protein to the cardiolipin-containing membranes. There, through direct protein\u2013protein interactions, the C-terminal domain of Tim44 binds to Tim17 and the N-terminal domain to mtHsp70 and to Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex (1). In this way, Tim44 functions as a central platform that connects the translocation channel in the inner membrane with the import motor at the matrix face. Additional interactions likely stabilize the complex, in particular that between the N-terminal domain of Tim44 and Tim23 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ting et al., 2014</a>) as well as the one between Tim17 and the IMS-exposed segment of Tim14 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chacinska et al., 2005</a>). In the resting state, the translocation channel is closed to maintain the permeability barrier of the inner membrane. During translocation of proteins (2), the translocation channel in the inner membrane has to open to allow passage of proteins. Opening of the channel will likely change the conformation of Tim17 that could be further conveyed to the C-terminal domain Tim44. It is tempting to speculate that this conformational change is transduced to the N-terminal domain of Tim44 through the central, membrane-bound segment of Tim44, leading to relative rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44. This change would now allow Tim14-Tim16 complex to stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 leading to stable binding of the translocating protein to mtHsp70. mtHsp70, with bound polypeptide, will then move into the matrix, opening a binding site on Tim44 for another molecule of mtHsp70 (3). We speculate that the release of mtHsp70 with bound polypeptide from the N-terminal domain of Tim44 will send a signal back to the C-terminal domain of Tim44 and further to the translocation channel. Multiple cycles of mtHsp70 are required to translocate the entire polypeptide chain into the matrix. Once the entire polypeptide has been translocated, the translocation channel will revert to its resting, closed state, bringing also Tim44 back to its resting conformation (1). Thus, the translocation channel in the inner membrane and the mtHsp70 system at the matrix face communicate with each other through rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44 that are stimulated by translocating polypeptide chain."

The beads were used for purification of domain-specific antibodies from the serum raised in rabbits against recombinantly expressed full-length Tim44. For direct binding analysis, mitochondria isolated from wild-type yeast cells were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mM KCl, 10% glycerol at 1 mg/mL and incubated with Tim44 constructs coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads for 30\u2009min at 4<sup>o</sup>C. After three washing steps, specifically bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE and immunoblotting."

The manuscript by Banerjee et al. investigates the structure function relation of Tim44, an essential subunit of the mitochondrial import motor. To dissect the N- and C-terminal domains functionally, the authors expressed these domains in trans and find that they suffice to confer viability to yeast cells lacking TIM44. Their analyses reveal that mitochondria with \"split\" Tim44 display transport defects along the presequence import route. Their analyses suggest that the N- and C-terminal domains engage with different modules of the presequence translocase. In comparison to full length Tim44, the split protein causes reorganization within the presequence translocase, implicating Tim44 in translocase/motor communication."

Using purified Tim44 domains and mitochondria lysed with detergent, the authors confirmed the interaction of the N-terminal domain with motor components, however, not with Tim23. They speculate that crosslinking of the N-terminal Tim44 domain to Tim23 requires a specific conformation of Tim23 only adopted when Tim23 is bound to Tim17 in the inner membrane (i.e. in intact mitochondria). Since the authors demonstrate the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 by using the purified domains and lysed mitochondria, but use crosslinking in intact mitochondria for showing the interaction with precursor proteins, the two approaches should be compared more directly. A suitable approach would be to analyze the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 in intact mitochondria by crosslinking. They may use radiolabeled Tim17 imported into mitochondria and their domain-specific Tim44 antibodies to address this topic."

                    "text": "We would not agree that the import defects of TIM23 substrates we observed in N+C mitochondria are in general surprising. Tim44 has been identified over twenty years ago as an essential component of the TIM23 complex required for transport of presequence-containing precursors into mitochondria. Over the years, several temperature-sensitive mutants of Tim44 have been identified that specifically affected transport along the TIM23 pathway. We would thus rather argue that it would be surprising if in N+C mitochondria, which contain only a split version of this protein, no import defect was observed. We were certainly surprised to see that the N+C cells are viable at all. The point that we observed no difference between sorted and matrix targeted precursors may potentially be seen as surprising. However, it should also be said that the role of Tim44 in the differential sorting of proteins by the TIM23 complex has not been carefully analyzed, at least to the best of our knowledge, in contrast to mtHsp70 and the J proteins Tim14/Pam18 and Tim16/Pam16. While the latter proteins are very likely directly involved in the ATP-dependent steps of protein transport, the exact role of Tim44 is far less clear. Indeed the data presented in this manuscript would suggest a role of Tim44 also at an earlier stage of protein transport, which could affect both sorted as well as matrix-targeted precursors. Also, we have previously seen that Tim44 can be crosslinked to laterally sorted precursors (Popov-Celeketic et al., EMBO Reports, 2011), even when their transport does not depend on the ATPase activity of the import motor. However, as differential sorting of precursors by the TIM23 complex is not a focus of this manuscript, we removed this point from the text to simplify it for non-specialists."

In this respect, it is also worth noting that even in glucose medium at either 24\u00b0C or 30\u00b0C, N+C cells grow about three times slower than FL. In addition, rather than analyzing import of AAC by another method, we analyzed import of another TIM23-independent substrate, Tim23 itself. Like with AAC, we also observed no major difference in its import efficiency in FL and N+C mitochondria. These data are now included in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and in the Results section."

Using purified Tim44 domains and mitochondria lysed with detergent, the authors confirmed the interaction of the N-terminal domain with motor components, however, not with Tim23. They speculate that crosslinking of the N-terminal Tim44 domain to Tim23 requires a specific conformation of Tim23 only adopted when Tim23 is bound to Tim17 in the inner membrane (i.e. in intact mitochondria). Since the authors demonstrate the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 by using the purified domains and lysed mitochondria, but use crosslinking in intact mitochondria for showing the interaction with precursor proteins, the two approaches should be compared more directly. A suitable approach would be to analyze the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 in intact mitochondria by crosslinking. They may use radiolabeled Tim17 imported into mitochondria and their domain-specific Tim44 antibodies to address this topic.</i> "

However, to the best of our knowledge, no crosslinks of Tim17 to any other component of the TIM23 complex have ever been seen in wild type mitochondria, radiolabeled or not, not even to Tim23, even though their interaction was demonstrated by several different assays. The only crosslinks to Tim17 observed so far were upon a very comprehensive cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of Tim23 followed by cysteine-specific crosslinking (Alder et al., MBC, 2008) and the above mentioned paper by Ting et al. that used site-specific UV crosslinking to demonstrate an interaction between Tim17 and Pam17. Since the surfaces of either Tim17 or Tim44 involved in this interaction remain currently unknown, we feel that undertaking such a comprehensive site-specific approach would be beyond the scope of this manuscript."

We would also like to note that the Tim44 signal in FL is expected to be stronger as antibodies to both domains recognize the full-length protein whereas the individual domains are recognized only by certain antibodies. We think that from the new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> it is clear that there is no less Tim44 bound to TIM23 in N+C than in FL. We would also like to add that it was previously shown that, upon depletion of Tim44 from cells, both Tim17-Tim23 and Tim14-Tim16 subcomplexes remain intact but they are completely dissociated from each other (Kozany et al., NSMB, 2004). In our opinion, it is clear from the presented coimmunoprecipitations experiment that the two subcomplexes remain associated in N+C mitochondria, unlike in cells depleted of Tim44."

Both these observations are in agreement with the relatively mild effect seen in the affected patients (as discussed in the text, mutations that would dramatically reduce the activity of the TIM23 complex would likely be embryonically lethal in humans). We did however observe that the mutation partially destabilizes the protein and we feel that this is an important observation as it may provide a clue as to what goes wrong in the affected patients and may stimulate studies with patient cell lines, which are clearly beyond the scope of this manuscript.
