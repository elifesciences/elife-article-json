How specific mutations cause arrhythmia is largely unknown and there are no approved I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators for treatment of these arrhythmias. We find that several Long QT syndrome-associated I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations shift channel voltage dependence and accelerate channel closing. Voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments and kinetic modeling suggest that similar mutation-induced alterations in I<sub>Ks</sub> channel currents may be caused by different molecular mechanisms. Finally, we find that the fatty acid analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine restores channel gating of many different mutant channels, even though the mutations are in different domains of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel and affect the channel by different molecular mechanisms. N-arachidonoyl taurine is therefore an interesting prototype compound that may inspire development of future I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators to treat Long QT syndrome caused by diverse I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations."
