New insights into the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic point of intervention, therefore are greatly needed. Here we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup>/\u03b2-catenin regulation axis: FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice and in human colorectal cancer tissues, functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> to reinforce pathway output\u2014\u03b2-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. We previously showed that Wnt-induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation requires Wnt-induced GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-TrCP interaction; the current study revealed that phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> was a molecular determinant of GSK3\u03b2 recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppressed adenoma formation in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice accompanied with reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> and \u03b2-catenin, indicating that FAK/PYK2/GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in APC driven intestinal tumorigenesis."

New insights into the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic point of intervention, therefore are greatly needed. Here we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup>/\u03b2-catenin regulation axis: FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice and in human colorectal cancer tissues, functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> to reinforce pathway output\u2014\u03b2-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. We previously showed that Wnt-induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation requires Wnt-induced GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-TrCP interaction; the current study revealed that phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> was a molecular determinant of GSK3\u03b2 recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppressed adenoma formation in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice accompanied with reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> and \u03b2-catenin, indicating that FAK/PYK2/GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in APC driven intestinal tumorigenesis."

The loss of functional APC results in less efficient GSK3 (two isoforms in mammals, GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2)-mediated phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin, leading to reduced degradation of \u03b2-catenin, thus mimicking Wnt stimulation. Although <i>APC</i> mutation is believed to activate Wnt signaling constitutively, histopathological studies show that only about 50% colon carcinoma cells display homogeneous nuclear \u03b2-catenin staining (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chung et al., 2001</a>), a surrogate for Wnt signaling activity, indicating that <i>APC</i> mutation alone is not sufficient to cause persistent or full activation of the Wnt pathway in CRC cells, therefore Wnt signaling is regulatable in <i>APC</i>-mutated CRCs. But how Wnt signaling is regulated in intestinal tumorigenesis remains largely undefined."

In Wnt-off state, the cytosolic level of \u03b2-catenin is kept low by its continuous degradation: \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3 on serine 33 and 37 and threonine 41, phosphorylation then triggers \u03b2-catenin recruitment of ubiquitin E3 \u03b2-TrCP (\u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins), causing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wu and Pan, 2010</a>). In Wnt-on state, Wnt ligand forms a complex with the cell-surface receptor Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wu and Pan, 2010</a>), and initiates a series of molecular events ultimately causing stabilization of \u03b2-catenin by suppressing phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2013</a>) as well as \u03b2-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2012</a>).

We previously found that Wnt simulation induces monoubiquitination of GSK3\u03b2 by \u03b2-TrCP, which is required for Wnt-induced inhibition of \u03b2-catenin recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP and subsequent stabilization of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gao et al., 2014</a>). This study addressed important questions left unanswered: What are the molecular determinants of GSK3\u03b2 recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP? \u03b2-TrCP is the substrate recruitment module of the SCF<sup>\u03b2-TrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase supercomplex, recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP to its substrate, for example \u03b2-catenin, generally requires substrate phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cardozo and Pagano, 2004</a>). If this is also true in GSK3\u03b2's case, what is the involved phosphorylation site(s)? What are the kinases responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation? Is this phosphorylation involved in intestinal tumorigenesis? Our results indicate that phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> by FAK and PYK2 is a molecular determinant of GSK3\u03b2 recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP, and is required for the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and crucial for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis."

GSK3\u03b2 is known to be phosphorylated at serine 9, threonine 43, tyrosine 216 and threonine 390 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gao et al., 2014</a>). To determine which of these sites is involved in GSK3\u03b2 recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP, we generated single point mutations at these residues and compared the interactions between the mutants and \u03b2-TrCP. We found that mutation of S9 to alanine (A) moderately inhibited GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-TrCP interaction, whereas mutation of T43 and T390 to alanine had no impact on GSK3\u03b2 affinity for \u03b2-TrCP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In contrast, mutation of Y216 to phenylalanine (F) almost completely abrogated GSK3\u03b2 binding to \u03b2-TrCP. Mimicking GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation by mutation Y216 to glutamic acid (E) restored the interaction, suggesting that it was phosphorylation that determines the recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP to GSK3\u03b2."

GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 are functionally redundant in Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doble et al., 2007</a>), to avoid compensation from GSK3\u03b1, we generated GSK3\u03b2 KO/GSK3\u03b1 KD MEF cell line. Loss of both GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 increased the basal level of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, comparing lanes 1 and 5), presumably due to the lack of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin<sup>S33/S37/T41</sup> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doble et al., 2007</a>). Reconstitution of the GSK3\u03b2 KO/GSK3\u03b1 KD MEFs with WT HA-GSK3\u03b2 reduced the basal level of \u03b2-catenin to the level comparable to WT MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, comparing lanes 1, 5 and 7), likely due to the restoration of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin. Reconstitution these MEFs with WT HA-GSK3\u03b2 and its phosphorylation mimetic mutant (HA-GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216E</sup>), but not GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216F</sup> mutant, also restored Wnt-induced accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, thus validating the positive role of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation in Wnt signaling. The fact that GSK3\u03b2<sup>KKKK15/27/32/36RRRR/Y216E</sup> mutant failed to restore Wnt-induced \u03b2-catenin stabilization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lanes 13 and 14) functionally confirmed that Y216 phosphorylation occurs prior to ubiquitination.

In line with a prior report that GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> can be phosphorylated by PYK2 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sayas et al., 2006</a>), we found that treatment of HEK293T cells with PF-562271, a dual inhibitor of FAK/PYK2, inhibited GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> and GSK3\u03b1<sup>Y279</sup> phosphorylation in the presence and absence of Wnt3a (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). FAK and PYK2 are closely related non-receptor tyrosine kinases, participating in diverse signaling pathways and control a number of cellular processes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mitra et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schaller, 2010</a>). Unlike ubiquitously expressed FAK, PYK2 has a more restricted tissue expression and is highly enriched in the brain and hematopoietic cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Avraham et al., 2000</a>). Our IB results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) showed that while HEK293T and HT-29 cells predominantly expressed FAK, SW480 cells primarily expressed PYK2. Both FAK and PYK2 were expressed in DLD-1 cells. In HEK293T cells, KD of FAK abrogated GSK3\u03b1<sup>Y279</sup> and GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation and Wnt-induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In CRC cells predominantly expressing either FAK (HT-29 cells) or PYK2 (SW480 cells), KD of FAK or PYK2 alone was sufficient to reduce the levels of phosphorylated GSK3\u03b1<sup>Y279</sup> and GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> and total \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). However, in DLD-1 cells expressing FAK and PYK2, simultaneous KD of both kinases were required to inhibit GSK3<sup>Y279/Y216</sup> phosphorylation and to reduce the level of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), strongly suggesting that FAK and PYK2 function redundantly to phosphorylate GSK3<sup>Y279/Y216</sup> to promote Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. To further confirm that GSK3 is a phosphorylation substrate of FAK/PYK2, we examined whether FAK/PYK2 binds to GSK3\u03b2 and FAK/PYK2's ability to phosphorylate GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> in vitro. In line with prior findings that GSK3\u03b2 interacts with FAK and PYK2 in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sayas et al., 2006</a>), our co-IP results showed that GSK3\u03b2 interacted with PYK2 in SW480 cells and with FAK in HT-29 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). However, whether they bind directly or indirectly is not known. The result of in vitro kinase assay confirmed that FAK and PYK2 were able to directly phosphorylate GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Together, these results reveal that FAK and PYK2 mediate GSK3<sup>Y279/Y216</sup> phosphorylation in CRC cells."

The results confirmed that treatment with PF-562271 caused sequential inhibition of PYK2 kinase activity represented as phosphorylated PYK2<sup>Y402</sup> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Park et al., 2004</a>), GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation and \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). To ultimately validate that it is the kinase activity that mediates FAK/PYK2 regulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, we examined GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation-dependent activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in FAK kinase-deficient MEFs (FAK<sup>R454/R454</sup> knockin MEFs). A knock-in point mutation of lysine 454 to arginine within the catalytic domain inactivates FAK kinases activity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lim et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, represented by abolished phosphorylation of FAK<sup>Y397</sup>) but leaves FAK's scaffolding activity intact (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lim et al., 2008</a>). Consistent with our finding that FAK and PYK2 function redundantly in phosphorylating GSK3, despite of suppressed FAK activity in FAK<sup>R454/R454</sup> MEFs, KD of PYK2 was required to inhibit GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation. shRNA KD of PYK2 also abrogated Wnt3a-induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation; whereas overexpression of GSK\u03b2<sup>Y216E</sup> restored Wnt3a-indcued \u03b2-catenin stabilization in the FAK<sup>R454/R454</sup>/PYK2 KD MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), implying that FAK/PYK2 stabilize \u03b2-catenin through phosphorylating GSK\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup>. We further found that \u03b2-TrCP recruitment to and ubiquitination of the phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin<sup>S33/S37/T41</sup> were greatly increased in FAK<sup>R454/R454</sup>/PYK2 KD MEFs, ectopic expression of GSK\u03b2<sup>Y216E</sup> exerted the opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Together, these results indicated that FAK/PYK2 stabilizes \u03b2-catenin through FAK/PYK2 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of GSK\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup>. In line with the observation that elevated p-GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> was significantly higher in 5FU treatment-resistant CRC patients than in 5FU-responsive patients (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grassilli et al., 2013</a>), we also found that overexpression of GSK\u03b2<sup>Y216E</sup> substantially prevented PF-562271 treatment-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation in SW480 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

But the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To determine whether FAK is involved in APC-driven tumorigenesis through its catalytic activity, we examined the anti-tumorigenic effects of dual FAK/PYK2 kinase inhibitor PF-562271 in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice, a genetic model predisposed to the formation of intestinal adenomas due to aberrant activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.

Our results has uncovered a previously unrealized role of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation: it triggers GSK3\u03b2 recruitment of \u03b2-TrCP and subsequent GSK3\u03b2 monoubiquitination by \u03b2-TrCP, an event required for Wnt-induced inhibition of \u03b2-catenin degradation, thus identifying phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> as an \u2018activator\u2019 of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway."

The reason for the discrepancy is not clear, but it might be explained by the fact that different substrates were used in these studies.

The kinase activity per se of GSK3 plays a dual role in Wnt signaling: GSK3 phosphorylation of Wnt coreceptor LRP6 on its PPPSP motifs is required for the activation of the pathway (positive role), whereas phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin by GSK3 triggers its degradation (negative role) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wu and Pan, 2010</a>). The kinase-mediated double role feature makes targeting GSK3 catalytic activity potentially problematic since it suppresses GSK3-mediated degradation of \u03b2-catenin, thus activating Wnt signaling therefore being potentially oncogenic. Indeed, 60 days of lithium treatment resulted in overall modest but significant increase in the tumor size in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gould et al., 2003</a>), implying that GSK3 kinase inhibitor does pose an oncogenic risk, at least in the context of Wnt-driven carcinogenesis. The current study suggests a novel way of GSK3 inhibition: targeting GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2<sup>Y279/Y216</sup> phosphorylation, which opens a new avenue for the design and development of GSK3 inhibitors."

However, if so, why was intestine-specific deletion of FAK alone sufficient to cause complete abrogation of adenoma formation in APC-mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ashton et al., 2010</a>)?

Lentiviruses encoding the shRNA against target genes were produced in HEK293T cells by transfection of the lentiviral vector expressing shRNA against target gene with the third generation packaging systems (Addgene). The media containing viral particles were filtered through syringe filters and subsequently used to infect target cells. Cell lines stably expressing shRNA were established by selection. To generate FAK/PYK2 double KD cell line, DLD-1 cells were first infected with lentivirus particles encoding the shRNA against PYK2. PYK2 KD DLD-1 cell line was established by puromycin selection and used for second round infection with lentivirus particles encoding the FAK shRNA. Double KD cell line was obtained by puromycin and blasticidin selection. For retrovirus infection, the retroviral vectors expressing shRNA-resistant GSK3\u03b2 or its mutants were transiently transfected into a potent retrovirus packaging cell line named platinum-A (Plat-A). 48 hr post transfection infectious retrovirus were collected and used to infect SW480 cells. The stable cell lines were established by blasticidin selection and used for cell proliferation assays. The cell lines overexpressing GSK3 shRNA-resistant GSK3\u03b2 or its mutants were subjected to GSK3 KD by lentivirus-mediated RNA silencing. The resulting cell lines were used for anchorage-independent growth assays and xenograft experiments. The same strategy was used to generate SW480 cells expressing shRNA-resistant GSK3\u03b1 or its mutants with endogenous GSK3 knocked down for xenograft experiments. HT-29 cells stably expressing FLAG-\u03b2-catenin<sup>Y142E</sup> were also generated by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer."

Polyp number and polyp size were counted under a dissecting microscope. For the collection of mice intestine tissue (n = 3 for vehicle- or PF-562271-treated group, n = 2 for control C57BL/6J group), the mucosal layer of intestine (only freshly isolated intestines, not those already used for polyp counting) was harvested by gentle scraping with a glass slide and all procedures were performed on ice. After harvesting, the tissues were collected into tubes and immediately placed on dry ice. The tissue samples were kept a liquid nitrogen tank before processing for western blotting or IP analysis. For these analyses, the tissues were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (Thermo) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo), protease inhibitor (Thermo) and 20 mM NEM (Sigma).

The de-identified human colon tissue samples from a sporadic-colon-cancer patient and a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patient, archived at the University Of Pittsburgh School Of Medicine, Department of Pathology, were obtained in compliance with a University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) tissue banking protocol (UPCI 97-130). The immunohistochemical analysis was performed in compliance with the UPCI Institutional Review Board protocol, UPCI 08-026. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 4-micron formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from either tissue microarray or colon cancer resection. Briefly, 4 \u00b5m paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene solutions and rehydrated in graded alcohol solutions followed by washes in distilled water. Antigen retrieval was performed in the pressure cooker for 15 min in 20 mmole/l Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0). The sections were allowed to cool to room temperature and then incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at room temperature with indicated antibodies. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with HRP-labeled polymer anti-mouse or anti-rabbit second antibody (DAKO Envision+ system, Carpinteria, CA), depending on the host which individual antibody was prepared. Color visualization was performed with liquid DAB chromogen in imidazole-HCI buffer (pH 7.5) containing hydrogen peroxide until the brown color fully developed. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslippped with permanent mounting media. The intensity of TMA staining was score as 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate) and 3+ (strong). The following antibodies were used for immunohistochemical staining: anti-FAK (Millipore, Cat# 05-537, 1:100 dilution), anti-PYK2 (Bioworld, Cat# BS1420, 1:50 dilution), anti-GSK3\u03b2 (Cell Signaling, Cat# 9315, 1:100 dilution), anti-phosphor-GSK3\u03b2 (Tyr216) (Gene Tex, Cat# GTX38564, 1:100 dilution) and anti-\u03b2-catenin (Zymed, Cat# 18-0226, 1:200 dilution)."

Here they find that phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> stimulates monoubiquitination and binding of \u03b2-TrCP. The 216F mutant shows that lack of pY216 and/or lack of ubiquitin increases \u03b2-catenin turnover in presence or absence of Wnt, causing low \u03b2-catenin levels. The 216E mutant is constitutive. They show that FAK and PYK2 can phosphorylate Y216 (normally thought of as an autophosphorylation site), and knockdown of FAK reduces \u03b2-catenin level. FAK inhibitor (PF) inhibits tumor formation when GSK3 is wildtype, but only partly inhibits GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216E</sup> mutant tumors. However, the authors do not distinguish effects of pY216 from effects of ubiquitin by use of their KKKK mutant used in their JBC paper. Therefore, the observations could be due to reduced GSK3 auto or trans phosphorylation rather than ubiquitin. It is also remarkable that the low stoichiometry of ubiquitination has a measurable effect, because the non-ubiquitinated molecules should remain active. However, the results would be understandable if the subset of GSK3 that is ubiquitinated is in the destruction complex. Another surprising finding is that GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup> is not needed to stimulate \u03b2-catenin degradation by \u03b2-TrCP, which is presumably requires phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin by GSK3 \u2013 but they didn't measure phospho-\u03b2-catenin with the 216F mutant."

Their paper provides data in support of a mechanism in which increased FAK/PYK2 activity in CRCs leads to increased GSK3\u03b2<sup>Y216</sup>, increases GSK3 ubiquitination, inhibits \u03b2-catenin turnover by bTrCP, and raises nuclear \u03b2-catenin levels. This predicts that nuclear \u03b2-catenin would be detected in CRCs that lack <i>APC</i> mutations, rather than the converse. It isn't clear how many human CRCs have increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin but lack <i>APC</i> mutations. Putting that aside, the tumor growth studies with 216F mutant GSK3 support the importance of this site, and the cancer studies with the PF inhibitor and the pathology supports the importance of FAK/PYK2 in CRC. However, the inhibition of tumors by PF does not exclude GSK3-independent effects of FAK."

Although the authors claim that use of a dual PYK2/FAK inhibitor might be superior to monospecific inhibitors to block emergent resistance in patients, the relevance of their in vitro experiments to an in vivo setting remain an open question, not addressed in experiments presented. In the absence of in vivo validation, the conclusions drawn remain fairly preliminary</i>."

The fact that PYK2 activity towards GSK3 phosphorylation was intact in FAK<sup>R454/R454</sup> knockin MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) indeed excluded FAK as direct upstream of PYK2 activity in vitro. We also recognized that it was not an accurate statement that \u201cPYK2 and FAK function redundantly in intestinal tumorigenesis.\u201d In the revised manuscript, we propose a new scenario to explain why intestine-specific deletion of FAK alone was sufficient to block tumor development in <i>APC</i> mutated mice."

FAK induction, although further enhanced in tumors, however, is triggered by <i>APC</i> mutation \u2013 the initiating event for tumorigenesis in the <i>APC</i>-mutant mice, through activated Wnt pathway target c-Myc (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ashton et al., 2010</a>). Therefore FAK induction by <i>APC</i> mutation should occur earlier than PYK2 elevation. If so, it explains why inhibition of FAK by intestinal deletion of FAK was sufficient to suppress tumor development. It also explains why PF562271 treatment inhibited PYK2 elevation in <i>APC</i><sup>min/+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, left panel). By phosphorylating GSK3 to promote the Wnt pathway, elevated PYK2 in tumors further enhances Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis \u2013 a positive feedback loop that reinforces the tumor development process (as suggested in <a href=\"#bib9\">Carothers et al., 2006</a>). In the revised manuscript, corresponding changes have been made to the Discussion."

The current study indicates that effective inhibition of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in CRC cells expressing FAK and PYK2 will only be achieved by simultaneously targeting both kinases, which provides a solid mechanistic justification for clinical use of FAK/PYK2 dual inhibitor instead of FAK-specific inhibitor for better clinical outcomes in CRC patients."
