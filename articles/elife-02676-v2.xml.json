Conversely, duplication or triplication of Xq28 causes an equally wide-ranging progressive neurological disorder, <i>MECP2</i> duplication syndrome, whose features overlap somewhat with RTT. To understand which MeCP2 functions cause toxicity in the duplication syndrome, we generated mouse models expressing endogenous <i>Mecp2</i> along with a RTT-causing mutation in either the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) or the transcriptional repression domain (TRD). We determined that both the MBD and TRD must function for doubling MeCP2 to be toxic. Mutating the MBD reproduces the null phenotype and expressing the TRD mutant produces milder RTT phenotypes, yet both mutations are harmless when expressed with endogenous <i>Mecp2</i>. Surprisingly, mutating the TRD is more detrimental than deleting the entire C-terminus, indicating a dominant-negative effect on MeCP2 function, likely due to the disruption of a basic cluster."

Conversely, duplication or triplication of Xq28 causes an equally wide-ranging progressive neurological disorder, <i>MECP2</i> duplication syndrome, whose features overlap somewhat with RTT. To understand which MeCP2 functions cause toxicity in the duplication syndrome, we generated mouse models expressing endogenous <i>Mecp2</i> along with a RTT-causing mutation in either the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) or the transcriptional repression domain (TRD). We determined that both the MBD and TRD must function for doubling MeCP2 to be toxic. Mutating the MBD reproduces the null phenotype and expressing the TRD mutant produces milder RTT phenotypes, yet both mutations are harmless when expressed with endogenous <i>Mecp2</i>. Surprisingly, mutating the TRD is more detrimental than deleting the entire C-terminus, indicating a dominant-negative effect on MeCP2 function, likely due to the disruption of a basic cluster."

After a 6- to 18-month period of normal development, head growth slows and affected girls lose acquired speech, dexterity, and social skills; they then develop characteristic hand stereotypies, respiratory dysrhythmias, seizures, and autistic-like features (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hagberg et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lam et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Klauck et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carney et al., 2003</a>). Interestingly, duplications and triplications spanning the <i>MECP2</i> region on Xq28 cause a similarly progressive neurological disorder called <i>MECP2</i> duplication syndrome, which has some features that overlap with RTT. Children with the duplication syndrome present with infantile hypotonia and develop severe intellectual disability, autistic-like features, recurrent respiratory infections, spasticity, seizures, and premature lethality (<a href=\"#bib10\">del Gaudio et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Friez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lugtenberg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Meins et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Van Esch et al., 2005</a>)."

It binds DNA directly through its N-terminal methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD), whereas its C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (TRD) allows it to interact with corepressors such as Sin3a, HDAC1, and HDAC2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nan et al., 1998</a>). More recent work has revealed that MeCP2 is expressed at higher levels than expected for classical site-specific transcriptional repressors: it binds as abundantly and widely throughout the genome as histone H1, which suggests MeCP2 might have additional functions in chromatin biology (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Skene et al., 2010</a>). Further complicating the picture of MeCP2 function are transcriptional studies in mouse brains as well as human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, which have shown that most genes are actually downregulated in RTT models that lack MeCP2 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chahrour et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Shachar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2013</a>). One proposal to explain this is that MeCP2 acts as a \u2018transcriptional noise dampener\u2019, such that loss of MeCP2 function results in the diversion of basal transcriptional machinery to repetitive elements, indirectly leading to global transcriptional downregulation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Skene et al., 2010</a>). Additional transcriptional studies present a challenge for this hypothesis, however, as the same genes that are downregulated in the RTT models are upregulated in <i>MECP2</i> duplication syndrome mouse models with double the MeCP2 expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chahrour et al., 2008</a>). How might doubling MeCP2 levels lead to the upregulation of the very same genes? It may be that, given the abundance of MeCP2 in the normal state, doubling the protein levels, as in the duplication syndrome, exhausts the supply of normal binding partners, thus diverting them from their normal functions, but this possibility has not been formally tested."

R111 is critical for methyl-CpG binding in vitro: when it is mutated (R111G), it completely abolishes binding to methyl-CpGs in vitro without affecting the structure of the MBD or the rest of the protein (<a href=\"#bib12\">Free et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kudo et al., 2003</a>).

This PAC clone was used to create the <i>MECP2</i> duplication mouse model and predict the human disease, and on a <i>Mecp2</i> null background it rescues loss-of-function phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2004</a>). We used recombineering to modify the locus to carry either the R111G or the R306C mutation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Warming et al., 2005</a>). This PAC has reliably produced founders with protein levels and expression pattern similar to that of endogenous MeCP2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2004</a>). We further modified the PAC to tag MeCP2 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the C-terminus to better identify interactors through immunoprecipitation (IP) and visualize their localization using immunofluorescence (IF) without disrupting MeCP2 function. Arginine 111 (R111) is located in the middle of the MBD, whereas arginine 306 (R306) is in a cluster of basic amino acids at the end of the TRD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). After establishing transgenic lines for each mutation, we characterized the protein levels of two independent lines for each mutation by western blot and found that they expressed transgenic MeCP2 at levels similar to those of endogenous MeCP2, thus doubling the total MeCP2 level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Because doubling MeCP2 consistently causes phenotypes similar to the human syndrome, we chose one line (Line 1) of each mutant for further characterization (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2004</a>). Immunofluorescence using anti-MeCP2 and anti-GFP antibodies on midsagittal sections of the whole brain shows that the distribution pattern of transgenic MeCP2 parallels that of endogenous MeCP2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, upper panel).

Older mice expressing two functional copies of MeCP2 exhibit mild phenotypes, such as hypoactivity, reduced anxiety, and improved learning (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Na et al., 2012</a>), so we aged the WT and R111G Tg mice to 9 months before starting our battery of behavioral tests. We examined overall activity and anxiety using distance traveled in the open field assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), the center-to-total ratio in the open field assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and time spent in the dark in the light/dark assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We also assayed motor coordination by their ability to stay on a rotating rod in the rotarod assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), footslips per distance traveled in parallel rod footslip (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), and nest building after 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We assessed learning and memory with the contextual and cued conditioned fear test (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013I</a>). We found no difference between WT and R111G Tg mice in any of these behaviors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013I</a>), indicating that an intact MBD is necessary to elicit the toxicity seen in the duplication syndrome model. These data also show that the phenotypes of the R111G mice (when the only MeCP2 allele is mutated) are exclusively caused by the mutation, and not insertional effects of the transgene, as the presence of a WT MeCP2 allele (in the R111G Tg mice) displays no phenotypes."

This had never been shown in vivo, however, so we used immunofluorescence (IF) and DAPI staining to visualize the localization of MeCP2 to heterochromatic foci, which are regions of highly compacted chromatin. The localization of a protein to these sites can serve as a proxy for methyl-CpG binding, and WT MeCP2 usually localizes there (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, upper panel). We found that MeCP2-R111G was unable to localize to heterochromatic foci (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, lower panel), suggesting it is unable to bind methyl-CpGs in vivo. To verify that abolishing methyl-CpG binding has no effect on the ability of MeCP2 to interact with binding partners, we performed in vivo immunoprecipitation (IP) to determine whether MeCP2-R111G can interact with the Sin3a, HDAC1, and HDAC2 of the Sin3a corepressor complex and HDAC3 and Tbl1 of the NCoR corepressor complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Stancheva et al., 2003</a>). As expected, MeCP2-R111G retained the ability to interact with both corepressor complexes to the same degree as MeCP2-EGFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This demonstrates that the R111G mutation does not affect the ability of MeCP2 to bind corepressors, despite the fact that it disrupts binding to methyl-CpGs."

Thus, we focused on the C-terminus of the protein and generated N-terminally GST-tagged C-terminal fragments of MeCP2 (amino acids 274\u2013340) with and without the R306C mutation, which allowed us to uncover more subtle differences without the overwhelming DNA binding of the MBD. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to determine whether the C-terminal basic cluster flanking R306 binds DNA and further test whether the R306C mutation alters this binding. The WT MeCP2 fragment binds to the double-stranded DNA probe with increasing amount of protein, but the R306C mutation completely abolished the ability of the fragment to bind DNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, two left panels). We further confirmed the importance of the basic cluster flanking R306 by performing EMSAs with two other RTT-causing point mutations: arginine to histidine at residue 306 (R306H) and lysine to glutamic acid at residue 304 (K304E), both of which remove a basic charge from the cluster (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christodoulou et al., 2003</a>). These two mutations also abolish the ability of the fragment to bind DNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, two right panels), thus emphasizing the importance of the basic cluster in C-terminal DNA binding. While these experiments were performed using a truncated MeCP2 peptide lacking the MBD (amino acids 274\u2013340), we believe that the loss of this DNA binding is critical. In vivo ChIP analysis supports this notion, as despite the presence of the MBD and two functional AT-hooks in both MeCP2-G273X and MeCP2-R306C, the disruption of the basic cluster in MeCP2-R306C reduces binding to DNA even more than the complete absence of the cluster in MeCP2-G273X (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). R306 therefore has an influence on DNA binding itself in addition to its role in NCoR complex binding, and having a defective C-terminus (R306C) is worse than having no C-terminus at all."

Since previous NMR studies demonstrated that this mutation abolishes binding to methyl-CpGs without affecting the structure of the MBD or the rest of the protein (<a href=\"#bib12\">Free et al., 2001</a>), we used this mutation to assess the necessity of methyl-CpG binding in both RTT and <i>MECP2</i> duplication syndrome. If excessive MeCP2 disrupts neuronal function by diverting corepressors away from loci they normally repress, then abolishing methyl-CpG binding in an extra copy of MeCP2 that is still capable of interacting with corepressors (as we show in this study) would still produce the duplication phenotype in mice. Instead, the R111G Tg mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Therefore, overabundant MeCP2 does not exert toxic effects because it diverts corepressors away from their normal binding sites: rather, trouble arises when more abundant MeCP2 occupies more methyl-CpGs. The centrality of methyl-CpG binding to MeCP2 function was underscored by the R111G mice, which phenocopied the early lethality of the <i>Mecp2</i> null mice. All of this is consistent with studies asserting that lack of methyl-CpG binding leads to RTT (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kudo et al., 2003</a>)."

This is reminiscent of a study documenting loss-of-function mutations in <i>SOB3</i>, a gene encoding an AT-hook-containing protein.

Rotarod was performed on a new cohort of animals. Briefly, in the open field assay the movements of the mice in a 40 cm \u00d7 40 cm box, with 25 cm \u00d7 25 cm defined as the center, were tracked for 30 min and analyzed for total distance traveled and duration and distance traveled in the center using AccuScan Fusion software (Omnitech, Columbus, OH). In the light/dark assay, the movements of the mice in a 40 cm \u00d7 20 cm box (1/3 dark, 2/3 light) were tracked for 10 min and the time spent in the dark was analyzed using the AccuScan Fusion software. For nesting, mice were singly housed with a nestlet, and their ability to build a nest was assessed after 24 hr on a scale of 0\u20133 (0 = completely untouched, 3 = completely built nest). For parallel rod footslip, mice were placed in a 20 cm \u00d7 20 cm box and tracked for 10 min as they attempted to walk on a series of parallel rods. Footslips were detected by ANY-maze system (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL), and footslips per centimeter traveled were analyzed. Conditioned fear was performed over 2 days using the Actimetrics chamber and FreezeFrame 3 system (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT): the mice received two 1 mA shocks accompanied by \u223c85 dB white noise on the first training day, and contextual fear was tested on the second day by placement in the same box with no white noise or shock. After a rest period of at least an hour, cued fear was tested by white noise with no shock in the same box altered by different visual and olfactory cues. FreezeFrame 3 was used to analyze percent freezing during the white noise. For rotarod, mice were placed on an accelerating rotating rod (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) for four trials a day for four consecutive days for 10 min per trial, during which the rod accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm in the first 5 min. The time until the mouse fell (or rode around the rod twice in a row) was recorded and averaged for each day. Data were analyzed by an ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Results were plotted as the mean \u00b1 the standard error of the mean (SEM)."

They have characterized the mouse models using behavioral and biochemical techniques and the basic findings include the following: (i) MeCP2-R111G behaves similar to null mice and does not bind methyl-CpGs in vivo, although interaction with Sin3a/NCoR corepressor complexes remains unaffected; (ii) R306C mice show milder phenotypes than MeCP2 null mice and retains ability to bind Methyl-CpG, Sin3A, HDAC1 and HDAC2 but displays reduced interaction with HDAC3 and TbI1 of NCoR corepressor complex; (iii) the C-terminus basic cluster (amino acids 274-340) might have an additional role in DNA binding since R306C reduces binding to DNA in vivo, also indicating a dominant-negative effect on MeCP2 function. The experiments are well done and contribute to our understanding of MeCP2 function in MECP2 duplication syndrome.\u00a0Generally, the behavioral characterization and various biochemical techniques used in the paper help support the findings and confirm previous studies and provide important insights in the differential disease phenotype of Rett patients with mutations in Mecp2."

We chose to pursue two particularly interesting RTT-causing mutations within the basic cluster: arginine to histidine at residue 306 (R306H) and lysine to glutamic acid at residue 304 (K304E). Both of these mutations change a positively charged amino acid to a relatively uncharged one (histidine) or negatively charged one (glutamic acid), whereas the other mutations in the cluster retain the positive charge. Additionally, within the cluster, R306H is the second most common RTT-causing missense mutation after R306C, indicating that this residue could be of particular importance. Using the same 274-340 amino acid fragment of MeCP2, we found that neither R306H nor K304E bind DNA, thus supporting our argument that the basic cluster flanking R306 is important for DNA binding.

The MeCP2 antibodies are not efficient, hence the reason we added an EGFP tag to our mutant protein. To pull down both WT and mutant MeCP2, it would be necessary to combine the MeCP2-EGFP allele with either the MeCP2-R111G or the MeCP2-R306C allele, on the <i>Mecp2</i> null background in one mouse.

For example, MeCP2-R111G interacts with both corepressor complexes similarly to WT MeCP2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), so we would expect the two versions of the protein to interact with corepressors to the same extent in the duplication context. Yet we already know that duplication mice present with phenotypes whereas the R111G Tg mice do not.

To prove the latter point one has to use a fragment (amino acids 274-340 of MeCP2, thus lacking the MBD) in the <i>in vitro</i> EMSA assay. In contrast, the immunofluorescence in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> depicts full-length MeCP2-R306C localizing to heterochromatin <i>in vivo</i>. We chose to use the C-terminal fragment for the EMSA assay to uncover more subtle binding differences which would otherwise be obscured by the strong MBD binding. The <i>in vivo</i> ChIP assay, which is more quantitative than IF, shows that, on the whole, R306C binds a little less than WT protein in spite of its intact MBD, consistent with our conclusion that the basic cluster contributes some binding. We have clarified the discussion of these data in the text."
