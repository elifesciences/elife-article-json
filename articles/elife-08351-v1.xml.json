We used available sunitinib preclinical studies to evaluate relationships between study design and experimental tumor volume effect sizes. We identified published animal efficacy experiments where sunitinib monotherapy was tested for effects on tumor volume. Effect sizes were extracted alongside experimental design elements addressing threats to valid clinical inference. Reported use of practices to address internal validity threats was limited, with no experiments using blinded outcome assessment. Most malignancies were tested in one model only, raising concerns about external validity. We calculate a 45% overestimate of effect size across all malignancies due to potential publication bias. Pooled effect sizes for specific malignancies did not show apparent relationships with effect sizes in clinical trials, and we were unable to detect dose\u2013response relationships. Design and reporting standards represent an opportunity for improving clinical inference."

We used available sunitinib preclinical studies to evaluate relationships between study design and experimental tumor volume effect sizes. We identified published animal efficacy experiments where sunitinib monotherapy was tested for effects on tumor volume. Effect sizes were extracted alongside experimental design elements addressing threats to valid clinical inference. Reported use of practices to address internal validity threats was limited, with no experiments using blinded outcome assessment. Most malignancies were tested in one model only, raising concerns about external validity. We calculate a 45% overestimate of effect size across all malignancies due to potential publication bias. Pooled effect sizes for specific malignancies did not show apparent relationships with effect sizes in clinical trials, and we were unable to detect dose\u2013response relationships. Design and reporting standards represent an opportunity for improving clinical inference."

Furthermore, most tumors were tested in only one model system, namely, mice that had been injected with specific human cancer cells. This makes it difficult to rule out that any anti-cancer activity was in fact unique to that single model."

Only 6% of experiments investigated a dose\u2013response relationship (3 or more doses). Concealment of allocation or blinded outcome assessment was never reported in studies that advanced to meta-analysis. It is worth noting that one research group employed concealed allocation and blinded assessment for the many experiments it described (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maris et al., 2008</a>). However, statistics were reported in a way that did not align with those we needed to calculate SMD. We found that 58.8% of experiments included active drug comparators, thus, facilitating interpretation of sunitinib activity (however, we note that in some of the experiments, sunitinib was an active comparator in a test of a different drug or drug combination). Construct validity practices can only be meaningfully evaluated against a particular, matched clinical trial. Nevertheless, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> shows that experiments predominantly relied on juvenile, female, immunocompromised mouse models, and very few animal efficacy experiments used genetically engineered cancer models (n = 4) or spontaneously arising tumors (n = 0).

Indeed, 98 experiments (30% of qualitative sample) could not be quantitatively analyzed because sample sizes or measures of dispersion were not provided. Experimenters only sporadically addressed major internal validity threats and tended not to test indication-activity in more than one model and species. This finding is consistent with what others have observed in experimental stroke and other research areas (<a href=\"#bib33\">Macleod et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">van der Worp et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kilkenny et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Glasziou et al., 2014</a>). Some teams have shown a relationship between failure to address internal validity threats and exaggerated effect size (<a href=\"#bib11\">Crossley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rooke et al., 2011</a>); we did not observe a clear relationship. Consistent with what has been reported in stroke (<a href=\"#bib40\">O'Collins et al., 2006</a>), our findings suggest that testing in more models tends to produce smaller effect sizes. However, since a larger sample of studies will provide a more precise estimate of effect, we cannot rule out that the trends observed for external validity reflect a regression to the mean."

Others have reported that far more animal studies report statistical significance than would be expected (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wallace et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tsilidis et al., 2013</a>), and our observations that two thirds of individual studies showed significance extends these observations."

Although a full analysis correlating trial and preclinical effect sizes will be needed, we did not observe obvious relationships between the two. We also did not detect a dose\u2013response effect over three orders of magnitude even within an indication\u2014RCC\u2014known to respond to sunitinib and even when different time points were used. It is possible that heterogeneity in cell lines or strains may have obscured the effects of dose. For example, experimenters may have delivered higher doses to xenografts known to show slow tumor growth. However, RCC patients\u2014each of whom harbors genetically distinct tumors\u2014show dose\u2013response effects in trials (<a href=\"#bib16\">Faivre et al., 2006</a>) and between trials in a meta-analysis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Houk et al., 2010</a>). It is also possible that the toxicity of sunitinib may have limited the ability to demonstrate dose response, though this contradicts demonstration of dose response within studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrams et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ko et al., 2010</a>). Finally, the tendency for preclinical efficacy studies to report drug dose, but rarely drug exposure (i.e., serum measurement of active drug), further limits the construct validity of these studies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Peterson and Houghton, 2004</a>)."

This is a possibility that contradicts other reports (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kerbel, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Voskoglou-Nomikos et al., 2003</a>). We disfavor this explanation in light of the suggestion of publication bias; also, xenografts should show a dose\u2013response regardless of whether they are useful clinical models. A second explanation is that experimental methods are so varied as to mask real effects. However, we note that the observed patterns on experimental design are based purely on what was reported in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section. Third, experiments assessing changes in tumor volume might only be interpretable in the context of other experiments within a preclinical report, such as with mechanistic and pharmacokinetic studies. This explanation is consistent with our observation that studies testing effect along a causal pathway tended to produce smaller effect sizes. A fourth possible explanation for our findings is that the predictive value of a small number of preclinical studies was obscured by inclusion of poorly designed and executed preclinical studies in our meta-analysis. Quantitative analysis of preclinical design factors that confer greater clinical generalizability awaits side-by-side comparison with pooled effects in clinical trials. Finally, it may be that design and reporting practices are so poor in preclinical cancer research as to make interpretation of tumor volume curves useless. Or, non-reporting may be so rampant as to render meta-analysis of preclinical research impossible. If so, this raises very troubling questions for the publication economy of cancer biology: even well-designed and reported studies may be difficult to interpret if their results cannot be compared to and synthesized with other studies."

It is possible certain experimental practices, like randomization, were used but not reported in methods. Further to this, we relied only on published reports, and restriction of searches to the English language may have excluded some articles. In February of 2012, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for additional preclinical data submitted in support of sunitinib's licensure; nearly 4 years later, the request has not been honored. Second, effect sizes were calculated using graph digitizer software from tumor volume curves: minor distortion of effect sizes may have occurred but were likely non-differential between groups. Third, subtle experimental design features\u2014not apparent in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 sections\u2014may explain our failure to detect a dose\u2013response effect. For instance, few reports provide detailed animal housing and testing conditions, perhaps leading to important inter-laboratory differences in tumor growth. It should also be emphasized that our study was exploratory in nature; findings like ours will need to be confirmed using prespecified protocols. Fourth, our study represents analysis of a single drug, and it may be our findings do not extend beyond receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or sunitinib. However, many of our findings are consistent with those observed in other systematic reviews of preclinical cancer interventions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amarasingh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sugar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hirst et al., 2013</a>). Fifth, our analysis does not directly address many design elements\u2014like duration of experiment or choice of tissue xenograft\u2014that are likely to bear on study validity. Finally, we acknowledge that there may be funding constraints that limit implementation of validity practices described above. We note, nevertheless, that other realms, in particular, neurology, have found ways to make such methods a mainstay."

In one report, only 11% preclinical cancer studies submitted to a major biotechnology company withstood in-house replication (<a href=\"#bib5\">Begley and Ellis, 2012</a>). The Center for Open Science and Science Exchange has initiated a project that will attempt to reproduce 50 of the highest impact papers in cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Morrison, 2014</a>). In a recent commentary, Smith et al. fault many researchers for performing in vitro preclinical tests using drug levels that are clinically unachievable due to toxicity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Smith and Houghton, 2013</a>). Unaddressed preclinical validity threats like this\u2014and the ones documented in our study\u2014encourage futile clinical development trajectories. Many research areas, like stroke, epilepsy, and cardiology, have devised design guidelines aimed at improving the clinical generalizability of preclinical studies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fisher et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Galanopoulou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Curtis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pusztai et al., 2013</a>); and the ARRIVE guidelines (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kilkenny et al., 2010</a>) for reporting animal experiments have been taken up by numerous journals and funding bodies. Our findings provide further impetus for developing and implementing guidelines for the design, reporting, and synthesis of preclinical studies in cancer."

Since the units of tumor volume were not always consistent between experiments, we extracted those experiments for which a reasonable proxy of tumor volume could be obtained. These included physical caliper measurements (often reported in mm<sup>3</sup> or cm<sup>3</sup>), tumor weights (often reported in mg), optical measurements made from luminescent tumor cell lines (often reported in photons/second), and fold differences in tumor volumes between the control and treatment arms. We extracted experiments of both primary and metastatic tumors, but not experiments where tumor incidence was reported. To account for these different measures of tumor volume, SMDs were calculated using Hedges' g. Hedges' g is a widely accepted standardized measure of effect in meta-analyses where units are not always identical. For experiments where more than one dose of sunitinib was tested against the same control arm, we created a pooled SMD to adjust appropriately for the multiple use of the same control group. Data were extracted at baseline (Day 0 and defined as the first day of drug administration), Day 14 (the closest measured data point to 14 days following first dose), and the last common time point (LCT) between the control group and the treatment group. The LCT was variable between experiments and the last time point for which we could calculate SMD and often represented the point at which the greatest difference was observed between the arms. Data presented graphically were extracted using the graph digitizer software GraphClick (Arizona Software). Extraction was performed by four independent and trained coders (VCH, ND, AH, and NM) using DistillerSR. There was a 12% double-coding overlap to minimize inter-rater heterogeneity and prevent coder drift. Discrepancies in double coding were reconciled through discussion, and if necessary, by a third coder. The gross agreement rate before reconciliation for all double-coded studies was 83%."

The systematic review has collected the data from animal research but I cannot see where the clinical outcome data comes from. In fact I do not see any clinical data. Is the assumption that the clinical data does show a dose response? I find the lack of a dose response rather curious in that presumably individual studies did report an effect but somehow there is heterogeneity between the studies and hence this reduces to a random scatter? There appear to be a lot of points in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> but I cannot easily see how many studies were eligible for the dose-response. I also do not understand the statistical analysis going along with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. What sort of curve/line is being fitted? What role does the two-group <i>t</i>-test have in a dose response analysis? The line drawn on the figure appears to be a straight line. I think this section needs to be more clearly written."

It is common for preclinical studies to report the intended drug dose, but without reference to the actual levels of drug attained. Assessment of drug levels confirms (i) that drug was actually administered and (ii) to the intended cohort. Moreover, it is frequently the case that when levels rather than dose are examined, it is evident that the levels achieved in rodents are not tolerated in humans. This has specifically been recognized for sunitinib and is an additional explanation for the disconnection between preclinical versus clinical effectiveness."

There, the dose-response analysis was not meant to compare our preclinical results directly with sunitinib clinical data (although a dose-response relationship in GIST and mRCC has been demonstrated by others \u2013 see below). Our premise was that preclinical studies should demonstrate a dose-response relationship in the absence of overwhelming inter-experimental heterogeneity and publication bias. This premise was based on the known dose response in human beings, and the fact that dose-response was shown within individual preclinical experiments. The reviewers have interpreted our point correctly: our inability to show a clear dose-response after pooling all results raises some concerns about the predictive value of studies included in our meta-analysis."

It is worth reiterating that the number of data points possible in our dose-response analysis for all malignancies was 183.

Now that we have integrated sample sizes into our figures more clearly, readers can perhaps make their own judgments."

We now report I<sup>2</sup> statistics but we must note that we (and others \u2013 e.g. Paul SR, Donner A., Small sample performance of tests of homogeneity of odds ratios in k 2\u00d72 tables., Stat Med 1992; 11: 159-65; Hardy RJ, Thompson SG., Detecting and describing heterogeneity in meta-analysis., Stat Med 1998; 17: 841-56) are somewhat skeptical about the value of heterogeneity statistics due to their extreme sensitivity in the presence of a small number of studies. As the referees will see, heterogeneity statistics, as expected, within each malignancy was generally high (see <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2013source data 1B</a>), with some notable exceptions (e.g. high-grade glioma, prostate cancer). By design, our study sheds light on possible sources of methodological heterogeneity (i.e. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and we have incorporated such observations in our interpretation and conclusions."
