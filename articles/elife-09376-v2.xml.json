However, little is known about mechanisms by which cells regulate cytosolic properties and intracellular diffusion rates. Here, we demonstrate that the intracellular environment of budding yeast undertakes a startling transition upon glucose starvation in which macromolecular mobility is dramatically restricted, reducing the movement of both chromatin in the nucleus and mRNPs in the cytoplasm. This confinement cannot be explained by an ATP decrease or the physiological drop in intracellular pH. Rather, our results suggest that the regulation of diffusional mobility is induced by a reduction in cell volume and subsequent increase in molecular crowding which severely alters the biophysical properties of the intracellular environment. A similar response can be observed in fission yeast and bacteria. This reveals a novel mechanism by which cells globally alter their properties to establish a unique homeostasis during starvation."

However, little is known about mechanisms by which cells regulate cytosolic properties and intracellular diffusion rates. Here, we demonstrate that the intracellular environment of budding yeast undertakes a startling transition upon glucose starvation in which macromolecular mobility is dramatically restricted, reducing the movement of both chromatin in the nucleus and mRNPs in the cytoplasm. This confinement cannot be explained by an ATP decrease or the physiological drop in intracellular pH. Rather, our results suggest that the regulation of diffusional mobility is induced by a reduction in cell volume and subsequent increase in molecular crowding which severely alters the biophysical properties of the intracellular environment. A similar response can be observed in fission yeast and bacteria. This reveals a novel mechanism by which cells globally alter their properties to establish a unique homeostasis during starvation."

Chromatin is found in a cell compartment known as the nucleus, while mRNPs are found in the cytoplasm. The experiments show that during starvation, both molecules are less able to move around in their respective areas of the cell. This appears to be due to water loss from the cells, which causes the cells to become smaller and leads to the interior of the cell becoming more crowded. Joyner et al. also observed a similar response in bacteria. Furthermore, Joyner et al. suggest that the changes in physical properties are critical for cells to survive the stress caused by starvation."

Together, the findings of the studies suggest that the interior of cells can undergo a transition from a fluid-like to a more solid-like state to protect the cells from damage when energy is in short supply. The next challenge is to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause the physical properties of the cells to change under different conditions."

This includes the active enrichment of macromolecules into organelles, which in turn allows for the separation of biochemical pathways and enhances their efficiency by increasing local concentrations of enzymes and metabolites. Similarly, active transport by motor proteins on the cytoskeleton enables large eukaryotic cells to overcome the limits of Brownian motion in which the diffusion time scales with the square of the distance. Nevertheless, many cellular pathways and biochemical interactions are dependent on Brownian diffusion. Much research has therefore been performed to characterize diffusional processes that occur within eukaryotic cells. These studies have revealed that the very complex and extremely crowded cytosol of eukaryotic cells cannot be viewed as an ideal liquid but, instead, can be modeled as a polymer gel (<a href=\"#bib28\">Luby-Phelps, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Clegg, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Knull and Minton, 1996</a>) or soft colloidal glass (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fabry et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mandadapu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luby-Phelps, 2000</a>). Still, a comprehensive understanding of the biophysical properties of eukaryotic cells is lacking, and it remains poorly understood how these characteristics influence macromolecular movement. Furthermore, little is known about the biological determinants of intracellular diffusion including whether cells functionally regulate their diffusional properties in response to changes in growth conditions or the environment."

Various groups have analyzed chromatin mobility, but a coherent mechanistic understanding of this process has yet to emerge (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib21\">H\u00fcbner and Spector, 2010</a>). For example, it was shown that chromosomes wiggle in a manner consistent with constrained diffusion and it was proposed that chromosome movement results from Brownian motion rather than from active motility (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marshall et al., 1997</a>). In contrast, other studies have suggested that chromatin movement is ATP dependent (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heun et al., 2001</a>), and it was hypothesized that chromatin movement is driven by a multitude of ATP-dependent processes along the length of the chromosome (<a href=\"#bib35\">Neumann et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, the role of the cytoskeleton in chromatin movement has remained controversial. For example, both microtubule-dependent and -independent movement was reported (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heun et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">Marshall et al., 1997</a>), and several recent studies have also implicated the actin cytoskeleton in chromatin mobility (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chuang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Koszul et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Spagnol and Dahl, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Spichal et al., 2016</a>)."

Our results demonstrate that cells dramatically change their biophysical properties in response to glucose starvation, which causes a confinement of macromolecules and affects the mechanical properties of the cell. This effect cannot be explained by changes in ATP levels or pH but can be induced by a loss of cell volume without any change in cell mass. This response seems to be conserved as bacteria similarly restrict macromolecular mobility in response to starvation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Parry et al., 2014</a>), and we show here that starvation also induces a volume loss in bacterial cells and severely affects the rigidity of fission yeast cells. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which cells regulate their biophysical properties in order to adapt to environmental stress."

LacO repeats were integrated at the <i>POA1</i> locus on chromosome II, the <i>URA3</i> locus on chromosome V, and on a centromeric plasmid (pLacO). Co-expression of LacI-GFP allowed us to visualize these three loci and track their mobility over minute-long sequences. Whereas several changes in growth conditions, including growth in different carbon sources or nitrogen starvation, had no obvious effect on chromatin mobility (data not shown), acute glucose starvation induced a dramatic cessation of chromatin movement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This suggests that chromatin mobility is regulated by the presence of glucose."

These plots express the magnitude of diffusion for a given particle, quantifying the average displacement per unit time and are used to compute their effective diffusion coefficients (<a href=\"#bib42\">Qian et al., 1991</a>). We find that the confinement of chromatin upon glucose starvation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) leads to an approximately three-fold reduction of the apparent diffusion coefficient (K): for instance, K<i><sub>POA1</sub></i> decreased from 5.7 x 10<sup>\u20133</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s to 2.3 x 10<sup>\u20133</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s upon starvation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Cumulative track projections revealed substantially higher mobility for mRNPs than chromosomal loci in glucose, which is expected given the significantly smaller size of mRNPs compared to chromosome fibers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thompson et al. 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zarnack and Feldbr\u00fcgge, 2007</a>). Yet, upon glucose starvation, <i>GFA1</i> and <i>FBA1</i> mRNPs also exhibited a dramatic reduction in their mobility (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Removal of glucose led to a three- to four-fold decrease in the diffusion coefficient of both <i>GFA1</i> (K<i><sub>GFA1</sub></i>reduced from 4.2 x 10<sup>\u20132</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s to 1.3 x 10<sup>\u20132</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s) and <i>FBA1</i> (K<i><sub>FBA1</sub></i>reduced from 5.0 x 10<sup>\u20132</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s to 1.4 x 10<sup>-2</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s) mRNPs without affecting the anomalous exponent (\u03b1). These values are similar to the relative change that we observed in the diffusion of chromatin (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Depletion of glucose by growth into quiescence also confined the mobility of mRNPs; therefore, the effects we observe are not a consequence of our cell washes (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B and C</a>). The decrease in mobility of both chromosomal loci and mRNP particles suggests that glucose starvation causes a confinement of macromolecules in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm."

In eukaryotes, the movement of many macromolecules is directly influenced by the dynamics of the cytoskeleton. For instance, mRNPs can be actively transported by motor proteins along the cytoskeleton and both the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules were reported to influence chromatin dynamics (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thompson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Koszul et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Spagnol and Dahl, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Spichal et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, actin filaments were also shown to rapidly depolymerize upon starvation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Uesono et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sagot et al., 2006</a>). We therefore wanted to explore whether the starvation-induced confinement of macromolecular mobility resulted from changes in cytoskeletal dynamics. Indeed, our starvation condition lead to ablation of actin filaments in nearly all cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and a nearly four-fold reduction of microtubule elongation events in G1 cells as visualized by Tub1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

Concurrent treatments with LatA and nocodazole reduced chromatin mobility in an additive manner to substantially reduce chromatin mobility (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, log-log MSD plots indicate that the effect of inhibiting the cytoskeleton is most apparent at longer time intervals and may augment the anomalous behavior of chromatin motion (\u03b1<i><sub>POA1</sub></i><sub>-DMSO</sub> = 0.56 versus \u03b1<i><sub>POA1</sub></i><sub>-Noc+LatA</sub> = 0.48; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

To differentiate between these two possibilities, we tracked the distance between two labelled chromosomal loci (<i>POA1</i>, chromosome II and <i>PES4</i>, chromosome VI) over time (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This approach allows for the exclusive quantification of intranuclear movements because translational changes in the positioning of the nucleus affect both loci identically and thus, do not influence intranuclear distance measurements (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marshall et al., 1997</a>). This two-locus analysis confirmed the LatA and nocodazole-induced reduction in chromatin mobility as the interchromosomal distance between the two loci still decreased considerably with simultaneous drug treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, however, this result cannot differentiate between cytoplasmic or nuclear cytoskeletal dynamics in modulating chromatin mobility (e.g. via deformations of the nucleus). In conclusion, actin and microtubule dynamics independently contribute to the mobility of yeast chromatin."

The acute withdrawal of glucose in fermenting yeast cells is expected to have dramatic consequences on cellular physiology. For example, the cellular ATP concentration drops (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ashe et al., 2000</a>) and the intracellular pH decreases in starved cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Orij et al., 2009</a>).

Upon glucose starvation, the ATP concentration rapidly decreased by ~70%. Remarkably, after this initial drop, ATP levels were relatively stable at ~30% of the initial concentration for the remainder of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Of note, the maintenance of this reduced ATP level required oxidative phosphorylation as the cellular ATP concentration quickly dropped to nearly undetectable levels when cells deficient in mitochondrial function were starved (<i>cbp2</i>\u2206; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shaw and Lewin, 1997</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, when cells washed in sugar-free medium were back-diluted into media containing glucose, ATP levels recovered to the initial concentration within 30.

The intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) of budding yeast was reported to decrease from pH ~7.3 to pH ~6.4 in a time frame consistent with the observed confinement of macromolecular mobility upon glucose deprivation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Orij et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Young et al., 2010</a>).

We then manipulated intracellular proton concentrations by the addition of the weak acid potassium sorbate (K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate). K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate traverses the plasma membrane, releases a proton, and reduces pH<sub>i</sub> in a concentration-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bracey et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Piper et al., 2001</a>). Varying the extracellular concentration of K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate from 0\u2009mM to 8 mM enabled us to titrate pH<sub>i</sub> from pH 7.4 to pH 5.9, thus covering more than the pH<sub>i</sub> range observed in cells grown either in (+) glucose or (\u2013) glucose conditions, with little effect on intracellular ATP levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>).

Indeed, the median cell volume decreased from 101.6 fL (<i>\u03c3</i> = 54.6) in glucose to 86.1 fL (<i>\u03c3</i> = 45.6) in starved cells, corresponding to a volume reduction of ~15% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

If the hypothesis was correct that a decrease of cell volume was the singular response that confines macromolecular mobility, two predictions could be made: (1) lowering the pH<sub>i</sub> by the addition of K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate might induce a decrease in cellular volume since high concentrations of potassium sorbate can replicate the confinement of both chromatin and mRNPs during starvation, and (2) manipulation of cellular volumes, for example, by changes in osmolarity should recapitulate the effects of glucose starvation on cytoskeleton-independent mobility (mRNPs) and on mobility influenced by the cytoskeleton (chromatin)."

In the very densely packed environment of the cell, a reduction in the volume accessible to diffusing molecules can alter protein-protein interactions and induce complex phase changes such as liquid-to-gel-like or liquid-to-glass-like transitions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doliwa and Heurer, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Weeks et al., 2000</a>). To test whether glucose starvation causes an increase in molecular crowding, we examined whether the observed volume loss is compensated by a reduction in the total biomass of the cell. We performed lyophilization mass measurement experiments in which starved and non-starved yeast cells were freeze-dried to remove their water content, and their masses were measured and normalized against the total number of cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We saw no significant difference between the non-starved and starved samples (11.5 \u00b1 0.5 pg/cell and 11.9 \u00b1 0.4 pg/cell, respectively; mean \u00b1 standard deviation for three independent experiments). Importantly, yeast cells grown continuously in raffinose, which are known to be smaller than cells grown on glucose (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tyson et al., 1979</a>) and thus served as a positive control, showed a 23% reduction in cell mass (8.9 pg/cell) compared to cells grown in glucose. Thus, acute glucose starvation does not induce a decrease in cell mass despite a significant reduction in the accessible cellular volume. This increase in mass density suggests that the intracellular environment experiences increased molecular crowding conditions, which may lead to broad changes in the material properties of the cell."

Our setup used wedged AFM cantilevers for parallel plate compression to characterize yeast cell morphology. These live-cell micro-compression experiments provide measurements of cellular viscoelasticity and cell stiffness under various conditions (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stewart et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ramanathan et al., 2015</a>). After removal of the cell wall, glucose-starved and non-starved yeast spheroplasts were subjected to AFM measurements. Force-response curves were recorded while compressing single cells and analysis showed that glucose starvation induced a change in the cells\u2019 mechanical properties increasing their mean stiffness from 18 to 22 nN\u00b7\u00b5m<sup>\u20131</sup> as well as increasing the cell-to-cell variability in stiffness (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Consistent with the cell size measurements described above (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), these AFM experiments also suggest that starved yeast cells are smaller than the corresponding control cells and that there appears to be a negative correlation between cell size and stiffness (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Without an intact cell wall, the cytoplasmic turgor pressure causes the yeast spheroplast to \u2018ball up\u2019 into a sphere. Since budding yeast cells are naturally round to begin with, we treated cells with the mating pheromone \u03b1-factor to generate shmoos, mating projections that cause the cell to become substantially elongated. Spheroplasted shmooed cells which were not starved of glucose behaved as expected and formed spherical spheroplasts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Intriguingly, starved shmooed spheroplasts remained predominantly in an elongated form (~four-fold less spherical spheroplasts in starved versus non-starved conditions) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This resistance to the internal turgor pressure suggests that the starved yeast cytoplasm is significantly more rigid than that of non-starved yeast, consistent with our AFM measurements. Furthermore, this stiffening is reversible as re-addition of glucose to the starved spheroplasts returned them to a spherical form (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), suggesting that sensory feedback pathways may exist to actively regulate this stiffening mechanism. Taken together our results demonstrate that budding yeast cells undergo dramatic biophysical changes upon acute glucose starvation affecting their viscoelastic properties in addition to their intracellular macromolecular diffusion."

Since <i>S. pombe</i> is naturally rod-shaped, we performed analogous spheroplasting experiments as described in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>. Upon digestion of the cell wall, <i>S. pombe</i> cells round up and become spherical (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Conversely, glucose-starved cells maintain their rod-shape, reminiscent of the shmooed budding yeast cells, again demonstrating that glucose-withdrawal leads to a remarkable stiffening of the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). As for budding yeast, the stiffening is also reversible as addition of glucose to starved <i>S. pombe</i> spheroplasts returns them to a spherical shape (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

This condition results in confinement of macromolecules and disproportionally affects large particles above ~30 nm (<a href=\"#bib39\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). The underlying mechanism for this cytoplasmic transition into a solid-like state in bacteria remains unexplored, but <a href=\"#bib39\">Parry et al. (2014)</a> suggested that metabolic activity is needed to keep the bacterial cytoplasm fluid. Although the cytoplasmic organization of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have dramatic differences, the similarity between these observations in bacteria and our findings in yeast prompted us to test whether there is a common underlying mechanism and whether bacteria also use a reduction in cell volume to increase crowding and confine macromolecular mobility. Strikingly, a 30\u2009min treatment of <i>E.coli</i> with 2\u2009mM DNP caused a significant reduction in the volume of <i>E.coli</i>, inducing a ~9.5% modal volume contraction (SD = \u00b1 4.1%) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). It should be noted, however, that the treatment utilized here, for technical reasons, is longer than the DNP-incubation time reported by <a href=\"#bib39\">Parry et al. (2014)</a>. Nevertheless, this result suggests that the reported liquid-to-solid like phase transition of the bacterial cytoplasm may also be triggered by cellular volume loss and suggests that the starvation-induced reduction of cell size could be a deeply conserved starvation response."

The dramatic macromolecular confinement observed upon starvation of budding yeast cannot be explained by a reduction of intracellular ATP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), by a drop in pH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) or inhibition of global metabolism, as respiration persists upon glucose depletion (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Instead, we propose that increased macromolecular crowding induced by an acute volume loss fundamentally alters the mechanically properties of cells leading to macromolecular confinement. Our results further suggest that both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells regulate the level of crowding in order to control intracellular diffusion and macromolecular interactions. In this context, it is intriguing that metazoan cells also seem to regulate their cellular volume as it was recently reported that tissue culture cells rapidly swell during cell division, which might aid with the mitotic separation of large chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Son et al., 2015</a>)."

Upon acute glucose starvation, budding yeast cells undergo a notable cytosolic acidification lowering their intracellular pH to ~6.4, presumably by the rapid inhibition of the major plasma membrane proton pump Pma1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Orij et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Young et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dechant et al., 2010</a>). Whereas this acidification might contribute to macromolecular confinement and enhance changes of biophysical properties within cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fels et al., 2009</a>), pH drop alone is neither necessary nor sufficient to recapitulate the macromolecular confinement, and the volume loss observed in glucose starved cells can occur in the absence of acidification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). An increase of the intracellular proton concentration below 6 by the addition of increasing concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>Sorbate is able to induce a complete confinement of macromolecules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>) but also significantly reduces the available cytoplasmic volume. Interestingly, inhibition of cellular metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose and antimycin also provokes an enhanced drop of intracellular pHto 5.5, which in turn triggers macromolecular confinement and leads to profound changes in the mechanical properties of the cell consistent with a sol to gel-like transition of the cytoplasm (Munder <i>et al.</i>, personal communication)."

Precedence for such a mechanism is evidenced by previous work describing similar microtubule-dependent motion and reported interactions between microtubules, spindle pole bodies, and centromeres throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tanaka and Tanaka, 2009</a>). Moreover, the actin cytoskeleton is known to propel the movement of meiotic chromosomes and to influence the diffusion of other large macromolecules, suggesting a central function throughout the life cycle of yeast (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koszul et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brangwynne et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). The long-range directional movement of chromosomal loci is also reported to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chuang et al., 2006</a>). This is consistent with our data, as the cytoskeletal inhibitors latrunculin-A and nocodozale appeared to more strongly affect the mobility of chromatin at longer timescales and have minor effects at shorter ones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, recent work detailing the existence of actin filaments in the nucleus substantiates the possibility of a network of nuclear actin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baarlink et al., 2013</a>). However, because latrunculin A depolymerizes all actin, our work cannot currently differentiate between the effects of cytoplasmic and nuclear actin in modulating chromatin mobility."

By tracking both chromatin and mRNPs in conditions that closely replicated the perceived differences in the two published protocols (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marshall et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heun et al., 2001</a>), we were indeed able to duplicate the distinct results (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, however, we also observed that azide treatment lowered pH<sub>i</sub> and that the distinct treatments reduced intracellular pH to dramatically different extents (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, a pleiotropic effect of azide treatment on pH<sub>i</sub> might be sufficient to reconcile the observed differences in the confinement of macromolecules. These results also show that the azide treatment used here (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> (wash); <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) replicates both the decrease in intracellular ATP concentrations and the drop in pH<sub>i</sub> in glucose-starved cells.

Interestingly, while glucose starvation dramatically decreases the diffusivity of the tracked objects, it does not change the anomaly of the diffusion. Anomalous subdiffusion is usually considered to be a transient phenomenon that occurs in complex, disordered media such as the intracellular environment (<a href=\"#bib20\">H\u00f6fling and Franosch, 2013</a>). At short timescales, objects explore a pure viscous environment thus displaying normal Brownian motion. Yet, at intermediate timescales, the motion of the objects is hindered by static structures, leading to anomalous subdiffusion. Finally, at long timescales, that\u00a0is, when the traveled distances are much larger than the sizes of the structures that impede movement, diffusion is again pure Brownian motion. The fact that glucose deprivation affects diffusivity but not anomaly suggests that starvation induces a dramatic increase of the 'microscopic' viscosity without affecting the higher\u00a0order cellular structures that impede macromolecule motion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Huet et al., 2014</a>). Based on our results and according to the classical molecular crowding theory (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zimmerman and Minton, 1993</a>) this change of microscopic viscosity is probably the consequence of an increase in crowding upon cell size contraction."

Our observations are reminiscent of recently published observations in bacteria describing a glassy liquid-to-solid transition upon glucose starvation or DNP treatment (<a href=\"#bib39\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that bacteria also undergo a volume loss similar to starved yeast (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

As described for bacteria (<a href=\"#bib39\">Parry et al., 2014</a>), we envision glucose starvation as a dormant state which might hold cells in stasis until provisions in the environment improve. Consequently, we propose that cells functionally regulate intracellular diffusion in order to establish a cellular organization that is restrictive to some molecular interactions, perhaps thereby conserving energy, while simultaneously permissive to essential biochemistry."

                        "text": "The conservation of cell contraction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes strongly suggests a vital function during starvation. On the one hand, the reduction in macromolecular mobility may allow for the rapid inhibition of excessive energy expenditure by diminishing unnecessary molecular interactions. This is consistent with previous observations describing the rapid inhibition of principal ATP consumers upon starvation. For example, Pma1p, required for regulation of intracellular pH and thought to use upwards of 20% of cellular ATP, is immediately inhibited upon glucose starvation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bracey et al., 1998</a>). Ribosomes also disengage from mRNA, resulting in a global collapse of polysome profiles (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ashe et al., 2000</a>). Additionally, we found that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton may function, in part, to conserve ATP, as treatment with latrunculin A rapidly increases intracellular ATP concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Because osmotic shock promptly inhibits translation initiation and depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton, it is conceivable that the starvation-induced cytoskeletal breakdown and collapse of polysome profiles, as well as other starvation-associated phenotypes, could be partly driven by molecular crowding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chowdhury et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ueseono et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ashe et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Uesono and Toh-EA, 2002</a>). Therefore, the confinement of intracellular diffusion through molecular crowding may prove vital for economical biochemistry and represent a very upstream event upon carbon starvation."

                        "text": "On the other hand, molecular crowding-enhanced aggregation and confined macromolecular mobility may promote sustained interactions between complexes during starvation. In agreement with this hypothesis, starvation is known to induce the formation of compartmentalized biochemistry and potential pockets of liquid-liquid unmixing (<a href=\"#bib34\">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brangwynne et al., 2009b</a>). For example, P-bodies, macromolecular complexes composed of mRNPs and mRNA decay machinery, form in the absence of glucose and potentially aggregate through unstructured regions of the component proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ramachandran et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, stationary phase induces the formation of foci and filaments for large numbers of proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</a>). This aggregation was hypothesized to enhance interactions between members of the same pathway and promote more efficient biochemistry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</a>) but was more recently also shown to cause enzymatic inactivation in some instances (<a href=\"#bib41\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>). As a consequence, prolonged starvation and confinement of macromolecular mobility may also pose unique challenges to cells, as complexes with elongated stretches of unstructured regions may prove more prone to extensive aggregation. It will now be interesting to explore whether other cell types, including metazoan cells, respond similarly to starvation or growth factor depletion and if limited diffusion indeed stimulates aberrant protein aggregation, a process which has been implicated in a wide variety of human diseases (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ross and Poirier, 2004</a>)."

Luminescence was then measured using a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro microplatereader (Tecan Group Ltd., M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) which was set for a 10\u2009s integration time and no attenuation. Sample aliquots were taken at 0, 10, 30 and 60\u2009min and standardized to a pre-treatment control. ATP concentrations were also corrected for OD<sub>600</sub> at the beginning and end of each time course. ATP standards were used to generate a standard curve to insure linearity and estimate intracellular ATP concentrations."

However, there are technical concerns with these experiments. The reported evidence is unconvincing, as explained below. In fact, a comparison between the data here and those in the Alberti paper argue against crowding being the primary cause for the observed particle confinement. In addition, the concern about the bacterial work was not addressed, and the generalization to bacteria remains unwarranted."

However, there are technical concerns with these experiments. The reported evidence is unconvincing, as explained below.
