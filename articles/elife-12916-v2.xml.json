Previously, using cell-type-specific anatomical projection mapping, it was shown that multimodal pathways converge onto individual cerebellar granule cells (Huang et al., 2013). Here we directly measure synaptic currents using in vivo patch-clamp recordings and confirm that a subset of single granule cells receive convergent functional multimodal (somatosensory, auditory, and visual) inputs via separate mossy fibers. Furthermore, we show that the integration of multimodal signals by granule cells can enhance action potential output. These recordings directly demonstrate functional convergence of multimodal signals onto single granule cells."

The midbrain and cerebral association cortex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Stein and Stanford, 2008</a>), and the cerebellum receive and process sensory signals of various modalities (<a href=\"#bib20\">Snider and Stowell, 1944</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Azizi and Woodward, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Sobel et al., 1998</a>). Although it is well known that each granule cell in the mammalian cerebellum receives excitatory synaptic inputs from on average four mossy fibers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eccles et al., 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Jakab and Hamori, 1988</a>), it is important to determine whether multisensory integration takes place already on the level of the granule cells, which form the input layer, or only in the downstream neurons, including Purkinje cells. A recent study using projection mapping has shown that some granule cells receive mossy fibers from two areas in the brainstem (the basilar pontine nucleus and the external cuneate nucleus), providing morphological evidence of multimodal convergence in single granule cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib4\">Chabrol et al., 2015</a>). However, in vivo single cerebellar granule cells in cats have been shown to only respond to stimulation of a single modality (<a href=\"#bib11\">J\u00f6rntell and Ekerot, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Spanne and J\u00f6rntell, 2015</a>). Therefore, to determine whether functional multimodal convergence is common we made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo from single granule cells and directly tested responsiveness to sensory stimulation of different modalities."

We selected crus I and II and the dorsal paraflocculus of the cerebellum because previous studies suggested that these areas might receive multisensory inputs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Azizi and Woodward, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Huang et al., 2013</a>). The high quality of voltage clamp recordings in granule cells in vivo enabled detection of individual sensory-evoked EPSCs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chadderton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Rancz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arenz et al., 2008</a>), thus providing exquisite sensitivity for detection of responses to a sensory stimulus. 45% of granule cells (60/133 cells) in crus I and II and 10% of those (3/30 cells) in the dorsal paraflocculus responded to somatosensory stimulation with a burst of EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a> left column and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>), as described previously (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chadderton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Rancz et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, auditory stimulation (white noise, 81\u201391 dB SPL, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a> middle column) evoked EPSCs in 25% of granule cells in crus I and II (33/133 cells) and 10% (3/30 cells) of granule cells in the dorsal paraflocculus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). When different sound levels were systematically tested, the number of evoked EPSC events increased with increasing sound levels (from 75 dB to 94 dB), while the mean amplitude of evoked EPSCs remained constant (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, visual stimulation (binocular LED flash; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a> right column) evoked EPSCs in 87% of granule cells (26/30 cells) in the dorsal paraflocculus, while visual responses in crus I and II were rare (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). When visual stimulation was delivered monocularly, ipsilateral stimulation evoked the predominant response (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In summary, auditory and visual stimulation evoked bursts of EPSCs in granule cells that were comparable to those evoked by somatosensory stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

When comparing EPSC amplitudes, we focused on the first EPSC of a sensory-evoked burst because the second and subsequent events are likely to be affected by synaptic facilitation and depression. In the cell shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013F</a>, the amplitude of auditory-evoked EPSCs (16.6 \u00b1 0.8 pA, n = 23 sweeps) was significantly larger than that of somatosensory-evoked EPSCs (8.6 \u00b1 1.2 pA, n = 23, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), indicating that those two groups of EPSCs originate from different synapses, i.e. the signals are conveyed by different mossy fibers (Figure 4A).

Therefore, it has been speculated that the other three mossy fibers (on average) could conduct signals of other sensory modalities. This conjecture has been supported by the recent anatomical (<a href=\"#bib9\">Huang et al., 2013</a>) and in vitro electrophysiological (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chabrol et al., 2015</a>) demonstration that single granule cells can receive mossy fibers of different origins (see also <a href=\"#bib18\">[Sawtell, 2010</a>]). Our findings in vivo provide a direct functional demonstration that single granule cells can receive inputs from up to three separate sensory modalities. Furthermore, we show that combined stimulation of two sensory modalities can produce enhanced spike output from granule cells, indicating that the result of multisensory integration can be transmitted to downstream neurons in the cerebellar network."

Under the excellent voltage-clamp conditions that exist in granule cells, inputs from different synapses are expected to summate linearly. Thus, the observed sublinear summation of synaptic currents is likely to be due to inhibitory interactions between the two sensory pathways upstream from the granule cell (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Such interactions could occur at any point in upstream sensory pathways, including the brainstem, the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, particularly given that the relatively long latency (&gt; 10\u00a0ms) of sensory responses in our recordings suggests that these sensory signals are mediated via the corticocerebellar pathway rather than direct projections from primary sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Morissette and Bower, 1996</a>). Further studies are required to understand the mechanism and significance of such inhibitory interactions."

It is likely that granule cells represent a diverse population with respect to functional multisensory input (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), with some granule cells appearing to be unimodal, some with multisensory input delivered by separate mossy fibers, and some with multisensory input delivered by a single mossy fiber."

(2013)</a> and demonstrated directly here, is likely to be a crucial feature of cerebellar signal processing. Indeed, influential theories of cerebellar computation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Marr, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albus, 1971</a>) have proposed that granule cells are not merely relaying signals but \u201crecoding\u201d multiple types of incoming signals. Our present study provides important in vivo functional evidence supporting this \u201crecoding\u201d hypothesis in the mammalian cerebellum. Moreover, it was hypothesized (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albus, 1971</a>) that such \u201crecoding\u201d would expand the representation of population patterns because granule cells outnumber mossy fibers by a factor of 100 (due to the extensive branching of mossy fibers). Our observation that the linearity of summation (both in synaptic inputs and in spike outputs) varies across cells may reflect the diversity of coding patterns required for the computational role of the granule cell in expansion recoding. In future studies, it will be important to reveal how synaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse (<a href=\"#bib17\">Roggeri et al., 2008</a>) may affect the representation of multiple sensory inputs at the level of a single granule cell."

A recent study (Chabrol <span class=\"underline\">et al.</span>) provides clear evidence for multimodal integration in cerebellar granule cells using both anatomy and in vitro electrophysiology. Multimodal integration has also been shown in vivo in granule cells in a cerebellum-like structure in electric fish.

These different anatomical and functional arrangements are illustrated schematically in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>.\" I am not convinced that the authors have provided strong support for these claims. Some granule cells may be unimodal but the authors tested only a tiny fraction of the possible stimuli that could engage granule cells, so the appearance of unimodality does not count for much in my opinion. In the Results the authors say that for cases in which EPSCs don't differ significantly \"it is not possible to determine if multimodal input arises from a single mossy fiber or from two mossy fibers that have indistinguishable characteristics.\" If this is true what is the support for the claim that some granule cells receive multisensory input delivered by a single mossy fiber?

By doing so, they demonstrate conclusively that a subset of granule neurons can respond to two or more types of sensory stimulation (most frequently, auditory and somatosensory; 20% in the paraflocculus and14% in crus I &amp; II). While this multisensory sensitivity is predicted from the anatomy, conflicting in vitro electrophysiological data make it important to demonstrate physiologically in an in vivo preparation. In fact, the result that the majority of cells were sensitive to just one modality (at least with the stimulus parameters tested) yet a significant minority were multisensory goes a long way toward resolving the discrepancy in the literature, although the authors (surprisingly?) don't emphasize this aspect of the work. The authors go on to show that in these multimodal cells, the EPSCs evoked by the two sensory stimuli applied together sum slightly sublinearly in voltage clamp, and evidence and reasoning are presented to suggest that this is indicative of upstream interactions in the two sensory pathways. The authors also demonstrate in current clamp that the sublinear EPSC summation can result in either more or fewer spikes than elicited by stimulation through a single modality, which is a useful additional piece of information, since it shows that multiple factors determine the nature of spike integration. The data are of high quality, and the manuscript is for the most part clearly written. It is hard not to wish for more manipulations, but given the technical difficulty of the recordings, it is not surprising that the work stops where it does. The manuscript seems well suited to <i>eLife</i>'s description of a Research Advance, since the paper by Hantman and colleagues that precedes this study was anatomical, and the present work offers a (much needed) physiological confirmation. All my comments are stylistic."

These different anatomical and functional arrangements are illustrated schematically in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>.\" I am not convinced that the authors have provided strong support for these claims. Some granule cells may be unimodal but the authors tested only a tiny fraction of the possible stimuli that could engage granule cells, so the appearance of unimodality does not count for much in my opinion. In the Results the authors say that for cases in which EPSCs don't differ significantly \"it is not possible to determine if multimodal input arises from a single mossy fiber or from two mossy fibers that have indistinguishable characteristics.\" If this is true what is the support for the claim that some granule cells receive multisensory input delivered by a single mossy fiber?
