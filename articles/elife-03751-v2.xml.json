In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), catalytically inactive AKT (K179M) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma (G161V) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer."

In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), catalytically inactive AKT (K179M) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma (G161V) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer."

AKT is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, usually due to mutations in upstream components of the Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway. AKT signaling is required for tumor maintenance in certain genetic contexts, as has been shown for some cancer cell lines harboring PI3K mutations or amplification of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (<a href=\"#bib21\">She et al., 2008</a>). Encouraged by these results, several ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors have been identified (<a href=\"#bib8\">Engelman, 2009</a>), but optimal strategies for the clinical development of these agents are currently unknown."

Each of these AKT inhibitors dose dependently inhibited AKT kinase activity in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line EBC1 as determined by phosphorylation of three AKT substrates (PRAS40, GSK3\u03b2, and BAD) in whole-cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib17\">Okuzumi et al., 2009</a>), the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors induced hyper-phosphorylation of AKT at the two regulatory phosphorylation sites threonine 308 and serine 473. When we compared the ability of the AKT inhibitors to induce cell death using a trypan blue exclusion assay, we observed significantly greater cell death induction by the allosteric inhibitor MK2206 compared to the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1B\u2014source data 1</a>) and GDC0068 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1C\u2014source data 1</a>) despite less complete inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation at these drug concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

In the absence of growth factors, AKT is inactive because intermolecular interactions between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain (KD) keep the kinase in a closed conformation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Calleja et al., 2009</a>). Following growth factor stimulation, AKT shifts to an open conformation and becomes accessible to phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473, a process that requires localization of AKT to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the phospholipid products of PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>], and PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>. Using a PI pull-down assay, we observed that MK2206 markedly impaired phosphoinositide binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This result is consistent with findings from structural studies that allosteric AKT inhibitors lock AKT in a closed conformation with its phospholipid binding site blocked by the kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). In contrast to our findings with MK2206, incubation with the ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK690693 increased binding of AKT to PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and this was associated with increased localization of AKT to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

Consistent with a loss of membrane localization, the R86A/K179M double mutant showed loss of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 when expressed in HCT116 cells that express no endogenous AKT (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ericson et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) and it did not protect from MK2206-induced dephosphorylation in cells which do express endogenous AKT (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Abrogation of phosphoinositide binding by the R86A substitution did not impair the pro-survival function of kinase-defective AKT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). We observed a similar result with a second mutation (R25C) known to abolish phosphoinositide binding (<a href=\"#bib23\">Thomas et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>)."

It also suggests that hyper-phosphorylation of AKT in response to ATP-competitive inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib17\">Okuzumi et al., 2009</a>) may not only be due to impaired phosphatase access (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chan et al., 2011</a>) but also due to increased phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, given that the loss of phosphoinositide binding does not completely abolish the pro-survival function of kinase-deficient AKT, we suspect that the PH-domain promotes cell survival through regulation of interacting protein partners, and that perturbations in the kinase domain can influence PH-domain function by altering the ability of AKT to reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment (likely those richest in PI(4,5)P2) and/or interact with specific effector proteins. Further studies are required to identify the effectors of catalytically inactive AKT and define its contribution to other AKT-regulated cellular processes."

Here, we show that cancer cells with aberrant AKT activation by common PI3K pathway lesions (HER2, PIK3CA, MET) show the opposite drug sensitivity profile with reduced sensitivity to ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. The inability of ATP-competitive inhibitors to suppress non-catalytic AKT functions in certain genetic contexts may represent a liability compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors.

Viral particles were collected after 36 and 60 hr following transfection and target cells were infected for 18 hr with the respective virus. Stable expressors were derived through antibiotic selection. To immortalize human epidermal melanocytes (iHEM), primary melanocytes (ScienCell) were retrovirally infected with amphotropic pbabe-hTERT + p53DD virus using the above transduction protocol. For lentiviral transduction of Tet-inducible shRNAs targeting AKT1 and AKT2, viral particles were produced by co-transfection of shRNA constructs (listed above) with two packaging plasmids (pMD2G and pPAX2) into 293T cells. Five different viruses were generated (2 AKT1 hairpins and 3 AKT2 hairpins). Viral particles were collected at 36 and 60 hr after transfection. All five viruses were mixed, and infection of EBC1 cells was carried out for 8 hr after each virus collection. 36 hours after the last infection, cells were selected with 10 \u00b5M puromycin to derive stable expressors. Following selection, cells were also transduced with pLNCX-HA-mAKT1-K179M retrovirus and selected with 1 mg/ml G148 to generate cells with a hairpin-resistant AKT1-K179M allele."

Coverslips were then incubated in blocking solution (10% donkey serum, 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 1 hr, followed by incubation with a primary antibody (anti-HA) in blocking solution for 1 hr. Alexa-488 anti-mouse antibodies were used for detection. Coverslips were then incubated with Phalloidin 546 for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 3 min. Coverslips were then mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent and images were acquired with a 40\u00d7 magnification lens in a Leica TCS-SP5 (WLL) multiphoton confocal microscope."
