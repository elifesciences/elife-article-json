Little is known about how cell fate diversification is linked to synaptic target choices. Here we investigate how presynaptic neurons select one type of muscles, vm2, as a synaptic target and form synapses on its dendritic spine-like muscle arms. We found that the Notch-Delta pathway was required to distinguish target from non-target muscles. APX-1/Delta acts in surrounding cells including the non-target vm1 to activate LIN-12/Notch in the target vm2. LIN-12 functions cell-autonomously to up-regulate the expression of UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2 in vm2, which in turn function together to promote muscle arm formation and guidance. Ectopic expression of UNC-40/DCC in non-target vm1 muscle is sufficient to induce muscle arm extension from these cells. Therefore, the LIN-12/Notch signaling specifies target selection by selectively up-regulating guidance molecules and forming muscle arms in target cells."

Little is known about how cell fate diversification is linked to synaptic target choices. Here we investigate how presynaptic neurons select one type of muscles, vm2, as a synaptic target and form synapses on its dendritic spine-like muscle arms. We found that the Notch-Delta pathway was required to distinguish target from non-target muscles. APX-1/Delta acts in surrounding cells including the non-target vm1 to activate LIN-12/Notch in the target vm2. LIN-12 functions cell-autonomously to up-regulate the expression of UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2 in vm2, which in turn function together to promote muscle arm formation and guidance. Ectopic expression of UNC-40/DCC in non-target vm1 muscle is sufficient to induce muscle arm extension from these cells. Therefore, the LIN-12/Notch signaling specifies target selection by selectively up-regulating guidance molecules and forming muscle arms in target cells."

                        "text": "Functional neural circuits are generated through coordinated events during the development of the nervous system including cell type specification, neuronal process formation and synaptogenesis. Many studies have demonstrated that stereotyped wiring exists between different cell types. Insights from studies in spinal cord and neocortex development strongly suggest that a combinatorial code of transcription factors mediates cell specification and defines cellular identities among different cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Jessell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</a>). An emerging literature indicates that precise synaptic connections are specified by diverse molecular mechanisms. Both positive and negative regulators of synapse formation can specify local synaptic connectivity (<a href=\"#bib87\">Williams et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Maeder and Shen, 2011</a>). Homotypic and heterotypic adhesion molecules can determine the synaptic lamina formation and even synaptic partner choice (<a href=\"#bib90\">Yamagata et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">de Wit et al., 2011</a>). For example, in <i>Drosophila</i>, many transmembrane molecules, including semaphorin, capricious and teneurins, have been suggested to guide synaptic target selection between olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) and projection neurons (PN) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Komiyama et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hong et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2012</a>). In vertebrate spinal cord, a semaphorin-plexin pathway regulates the connection specificity in the sensory motor circuit (<a href=\"#bib63\">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2009</a>). In vertebrate retina, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) form synapses with retinal interneurons in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), generating several synaptic laminae (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</a>). This laminar specificity is directed by both the homophilic interactions of several immunoglobin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, including Sidekicks and Dscam, as well as the inhibitory action of semaphorins (<a href=\"#bib91\">Yamagata et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Matsuoka et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, in <i>C. elegans</i>, the heterophilic interaction of two IgSF proteins, SYG-1 and SYG-2, guides the localization of the en passant synapse formation of HSN neurons (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shen et al., 2004</a>). Another IgSF protein UNC-40/DCC, the receptor of UNC-6/Netrin, has been shown to regulate axon guidance toward ventral UNC-6 as well as locally promote presynaptic assembly in the <i>C. elegans</i> interneuron AIY (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hedgecock et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Colon-Ramos et al., 2007</a>). In addition, UNC-40 plays critical roles in the formation of dendritic spine-like postsynaptic muscle arms of the body wall muscles in worms (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dixon and Roy, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alexander et al., 2009</a>). Intriguingly, this function appears to be independent of UNC-6."

In one such example, the even-skipped transcription factor impacts long-range axon guidance choices through regulating a Netrin receptor, UNC-5 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Labrador et al., 2005</a>). However, it is largely unknown how cell fate decisions affect local synaptic development and target choices."

                        "text": "One of the conserved developmental pathways to generate cellular diversity is through the lateral signaling system involving the Notch receptor and its ligands. Through contact-dependent, reciprocal feedback loops, Notch and its ligand Delta can generate different cell fates among identical neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Greenwald, 2012</a>). In <i>C. elegans, lin-12</i> encodes one of the two homologs of Notch receptor (<a href=\"#bib34\">Greenwald et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Greenwald, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wharton et al., 1985</a>). Extensive literature showed that <i>lin-12</i> is required for at least two cell fate decisions: the AC/VU decision and the vulval precursor cell (VPC) specification (<a href=\"#bib32\">Greenwald, 2005</a>). In both cases, <i>lin-12</i> and its ligands, including <i>lag-2</i>, <i>apx-1</i> and <i>dsl-1</i>, are required to specify alternative cell fates (<a href=\"#bib34\">Greenwald et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Seydoux and Greenwald, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Wilkinson et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Shaye and Greenwald, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Greenwald, 2004</a>). Notch signaling has also been implicated in the development of the nervous system. For example, the mammalian Notch 1 protein is asymmetrically inherited by one daughter cell of an active cortical progenitor during mitosis, which inhibits the neural differentiation but allows this daughter to retain the progenitor fate (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ishibashi et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</a>)."

Besides functioning in mature nervous system to regulate synaptic specificity in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib17\">de Bivort et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alberi et al., 2011</a>), Notch has also been found to act in the post-mitotic neurons in multiple developmental contexts. Both the canonical Notch pathway and a cytosolic pathway have been shown to play important roles in axonal guidance (<a href=\"#bib28\">Giniger, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Endo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Song and Giniger, 2011</a>). In the cytoplasmic pathway, Notch functions by regulating the activity of abl, enable and Rac GTPases (<a href=\"#bib28\">Giniger, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Song et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Song and Giniger, 2011</a>). Studies in <i>Drosophila</i> indicate that activation of Notch signaling lead to promotion or sometimes inhibition of axonal growth. In cultured primary <i>Drosophila</i> neurons, Notch is localized in developing axons and growth cones and interacts with an axonal abl tyrosine kinase to promote axon extension (<a href=\"#bib28\">Giniger, 1998</a>). An opposite example is the dorsal cluster neurons (DCN) of the <i>Drosophila</i> brain (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hassan et al., 2000</a>). Reduction of Notch activity results in overbranching of DCN axons. Interestingly, the overbranching phenotype cannot be rescued by expressing wild-type Notch in DCN, indicating its non-autonomous requirement. Similarly, dendritic branching is also sensitive to the level of Notch signaling. Several observations indicate a Notch-mediated, contact-dependent inhibition of dendritic branching (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berezovska et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sestan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Redmond et al., 2000</a>). In mammalian brain, significant nuclear localization of Notch 1 was observed in differentiated neurons. Perturbation of Notch 1 activity leads to increased dendritic length and decreased number of branches (<a href=\"#bib66\">Redmond et al., 2000</a>). Other in vitro studies further indicated that the intercellular receptor\u2013ligand interaction and the canonical Notch signaling pathway are required for the Notch-dependent dendritic branching inhibition (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berezovska et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sestan et al., 1999</a>). It is generally assumed that the canonical pathway regulates post-mitotic phenotypes by controlling the expression of guidance molecules. However, the molecular targets of this pathway have not been identified."

In the egg-laying circuit, the presynaptic neurons, HSNs and VC4/5, form synapses exclusively with type 2 vulval muscles (vm2) but not type 1 vulval muscles (vm1) (<a href=\"#bib85\">White et al., 1986</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These synapses are not formed on the cell bodies of the muscles but instead onto the dendritic spine-like postsynaptic membrane protrusions called muscle arms (<a href=\"#bib85\">White et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Leung et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Collins and Koelle, 2012</a>). The HSN presynaptic development occurs before vm2 muscle arm formation and is independent of vulval muscles. Instead, surrounding guidepost cells instruct local HSN presynapse formation with heterophilic interaction of SYG-1 and SYG-2 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shen et al., 2004</a>). SYG-2 is expressed in the primary epithelial cells and recruits HSN-expressed SYG-1 to the future presynaptic domain. The development of postsynaptic specializations on the vulval muscles has not been studied. Both the vm1 and vm2 muscle cells are generated from a pair of sex myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib26\">Foehr and Liu, 2008</a>). While the lineage, cell morphology and positions of both muscle types are very similar, only vm2 cells, not the vm1 cells, generate muscle arms and serve as the direct postsynaptic target of the HSN and VC neurons. vm1 is connected to vm2 through gap junctions (<a href=\"#bib85\">White et al., 1986</a>)."

We found that postsynaptic muscle arm development in egg-laying circuit is mediated by LIN-12/Notch-dependent cell specification. The canonical LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway is specifically activated in the target vm2 cells by the ligand APX-1/DSL expressed in two adjacent cell types, the secondary vulval epithelial cells and the non-target vm1 cells. <i>lin-12</i> functions cell-autonomously to up-regulate the activity of the guidance molecules UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2, which in turn generates and guides the development of vm2 postsynaptic muscle arms. The ectopic expression of UNC-40 in vm1 cells that normally do not form muscle arms is sufficient to induce the extension of muscle arm-like membrane structures from vm1, suggesting a deterministic role of LIN-12/Notch and UNC-40/DCC in postsynaptic target selection."

                                "text": "The <i>C. elegans</i> egg-laying circuit consists four type 1 vulval muscle cells (vm1) and four type 2 vulval muscle cells (vm2), which form two X-shaped structures near the vulval opening (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). While vm1 and vm2 are from a common lineage, are physically adjacent and share many molecular components, the egg-laying motoneurons HSN and VC4/5 form serotoninergic and cholinergic chemical synapses exclusively on vm2 (<a href=\"#bib85\">White et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Waggoner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Duerr et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kim et al., 2001</a>). vm1 is mainly controlled by vm2 via gap junctions (<a href=\"#bib85\">White et al., 1986</a>). Besides forming major synaptic connection on HSN and VC4/5, vm2 also receive some additional synapses with the ventral nerve cord (Personal communication with Michael Koelle, November 2012). To understand how vm2 is differentiated as the postsynaptic target and specifies the synaptic specializations, we first developed tools to visualize the egg-laying synapses. We fused presynaptic protein RAB-3 with mCherry (<i>mCherry::rab-3</i>) to label presynaptic vesicles in HSN or VC neurons, receptively (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baumeister et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lickteig et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</a>). On the postsynaptic side, we expressed <i>ser-1b::gfp</i> or <i>unc-103e::gfp</i>, a GFP tagged serotonin receptor or a voltage-gated potassium channel, in both vm1 and vm2 to visualize the postsynaptic specializations as well as the muscle cell morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Consistent with EM reconstruction, we found that the HSN presynaptic specializations were closely juxtaposed against the dendritic spine-like membrane protrusions (muscle arms) from the vm2 cell bodies when viewed from both the lateral and ventral sides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The muscle arms always extend from stereotyped subcellular locations, medially towards the center of the vulva. The muscle arms from the anterior and posterior vm2 cells often contact each other and form a \u2018bridge-like\u2019 structure that is best visualized from the ventral view (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, top row). Similar apposition was also observed between VC4/5 presynaptic specializations and the vm2 muscle arms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). While high level of UNC-103E::GFP expression labels both the muscle arms and the vm cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), low level of transgenic expression of UNC-103E::GFP with an integrated single-copy transgene showed that UNC-103E was dramatically enriched on vm2 muscle arms (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, middle), indicating that the muscle arms represent functional postsynaptic specializations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Collins and Koelle, 2012</a>)."

Developmental studies showed that HSN axon guidance and presynaptic formation preceded both axon growth of VC neurons and vulval muscle differentiation (data not shown). We therefore asked whether the HSN neurons are required for vm2 specification and muscle arm development by examining the vm2 morphology in the <i>egl-1(n986)</i> mutant, in which the HSN neurons undergo programmed cell death in embryonic stage (<a href=\"#bib16\">Conradt and Horvitz, 1998</a>). Surprisingly, in all of the examined animals, the morphology and position of vm2 muscle arms were indistinguishable from the wild type counterparts (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Several results further suggested that neither HSN nor VC neurons contributed to the vm2 muscle arm position. First, in a portion of the <i>egl-1(n986);lin-39(n709)</i> double mutant animals which lacked both HSN and VC neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 1993</a>), the vm2 muscle arms still existed (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Furthermore, the single-copy insertion of the transgene UNC-103E::GFP potassium channel which specifically labels the vm2 muscle arms, as well as the artificial membrane marker mCD8::mCherry that delineates the entire outline of vulval muscles, was also completely absent in the muscle arm areas, suggestive of a complete loss of the muscle arm structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

We considered the possibility that the absence of muscle arms in vm2 could be due to the change of vm2 cell fate to a different cell. We therefore examined several cell-type-specific markers for each differentiation stage: the <i>hlh-8::gfp</i> that is specifically expressed in undifferentiated cells of M lineage (<a href=\"#bib37\">Harfe et al., 1998b</a>) and an <i>egl-15::gfp</i> reporter which is exclusively expressed in vm1 cells in egg-laying system (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harfe et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Huang and Stern, 2004</a>). We also examined <i>rgs-2::gfp</i> that labeled uterine muscles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dong et al., 2000</a>). In <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutants, all three markers exhibits wild type pattern, suggesting that many molecular signatures of the M lineage are intact in the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutants, while the development of the postsynaptic specializations completely fails (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C,E,F</a>). Furthermore, since both vm2 and vm1 adopt complex cell morphology and stereotyped positions, we reasoned that the morphology and position of these muscles must reflect the execution of cell-specific developmental programs. We therefore quantitatively analyzed the morphology and relative position of vm1 and vm2 (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In both wild type and <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant, the position where vm1 is linked to the body wall is always on the dorsal side of the connection between vm2 and body wall. No significant difference was found on the intersection angle between the vulval muscle and the vulval slit, as well as the relative size of vm2 to vm1 (S<sub>vm2</sub>/S<sub>vm1</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). In summary, all these observations supports the notion that the muscle defects in <i>lin-12</i> mutants appear to be restricted to the postsynaptic development in the vm2 cells."

Smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (magnitude &lt; 150% \u0394R/R) drive small vulval muscle twitching contractions that do not result in release of eggs. Such twitch transients are sometimes \u2018single\u2019 transients, limited to either the anterior or posterior muscles, or smaller magnitude double transients.

However, double Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were often asynchronous, with significant delays between anterior and posterior vulval muscle transients that resulted in uncoordinated vulval muscle contractions that were not able to release eggs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In the ratiometric traces, these \u2018delayed double\u2019 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients could be resolved into two or more peaks instead of one large peak as in the wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>). As a result, <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> and <i>apx-1(wy755)</i> mutants had a twofold increase in the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). We also found that <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> and <i>apx-1(wy755)</i> mutants had significantly fewer synchronous double transients compared to the wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). In the rare instances when strong single transients or asynchronously initiated anterior/posterior Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> and <i>apx-1(wy755)</i> mutants led to opening of the vulva, egg-laying would still occur, indicating that their egg-laying defect was not caused by structural problems in the vulva itself (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>)."

Together, these results show that the vm2 muscle arms lacking in <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> and <i>apx-1(wy755)</i> mutants are not necessary for excitation of the vulval muscles, but suggest they are required for the synchronous excitation of anterior and posterior vulval muscles needed to successfully execute egg-laying behavior."

First, trans-heterozygotes between <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> and a canonical loss-of-function allele <i>lin-12(n676n930)</i> presented similar muscle arm defects (data not shown). Second, a <i>lin-12</i> genomic fragment including 5 kb of upstream regulatory sequence and the entire coding region of <i>lin-12</i> strongly rescued the muscle arm phenotype of <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Since strong loss-of-function alleles of <i>lin-12, apx-1</i> and <i>sel-12</i> cause lethality, dramatic vulval morphogenesis or general muscle morphology phenotypes, which are all absent in <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant animals, it is likely that the missense mutation we isolated represents a partial loss-of-function allele. Three <i>apx-1</i> mutant alleles independently identified from the screen also contain missense mutations in the extracellular domain. One early-stop mutation in the <i>sel-12</i> coding region leads to additional pleiotropic effects on both vulval muscle patterning and vulval morphogenesis, while the other missense mutation of <i>sel-12</i> causes specific muscle arm defect (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Together, these data suggest that partial loss of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity spares vulval morphogenesis but specifically impairs vm2 specification and muscle arm development, and that muscle arm development might require a higher level of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity compared with earlier developmental events (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

Based on the cell-autonomous function of <i>lin-12</i> in vm2, we made two predictions. First, the ligand(s) of LIN-12 should be localized in the surrounding cells that directly contact vm2 to activate LIN-12/Notch pathway. Second, downstream components of LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway should also function in vm2 cells to regulate vm2 specification and muscle arm development. APX-1/Dsl is a good candidate as the relevant ligand because <i>apx-1(wy755)</i>, but not other known LIN-12 ligand mutants including <i>dsl-1</i> and <i>lag-2</i>, showed the muscle arm phenotype similar to that of <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and data not shown). A <i>lin-12(wy750); apx-1(wy755)</i> double mutant did not show an enhanced muscle arm defect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) or more severe egg-laying phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), further suggesting that <i>apx-1</i> and <i>lin-12</i> function in the same pathway. To further understand where <i>apx-1</i> functioned, we examined the expression pattern of <i>apx-1</i> with an integrated transgenic expression construct (Personal communication with Iva Greenwald, June 2012). We observed the expression of <i>apx-1</i> in both secondary vulval epithelial cells and vm1 muscle cells during the L4 stage, when LIN-12/Notch signaling was activated to promote vm2 muscle arm development (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Both secondary vulval epithelial cells and vm1 cells contact vm2 muscle cells from early L4 stage when vulval muscles are generated (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, data not shown, and personal communication with Kelly Liu, July 2012). In fact, we observed that the vm2 muscle arms consistently tracked the cell junctions between the primary and secondary vulval epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and data not shown). To further understand the cellular requirement of <i>apx-1</i>, we created two constructs in which the <i>apx-1</i> cDNA was cloned after two different promoters. The <i>egl-15</i> promoter supports expression specifically in the vm1 cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harfe et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eimer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Huang and Stern, 2004</a>), while the <i>egl-17</i> promoter drives expression in the secondary vulval epithelial cells from early-L4 stage (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shaye and Greenwald, 2002</a>).

NICD is then transported into cell nucleus where it serves as a transcription factor together with LAG-1/CSL to promote gene expression (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christensen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Andersson et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To understand where <i>sel-12</i> was required, we performed cell-specific rescue experiments. We found that expression of <i>sel-12</i> in vulval muscle cells completely rescued the vm2 muscle arm phenotype of <i>sel-12(wy760)</i>, consistent with the cell-autonomous requirement of LIN-12/Notch signaling in vm2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Additionally, specific expression of a dominant-negative <i>lag-1</i> construct (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kato et al., 1997</a>) in the vulval muscles phenocopied the muscle arm defects observed in <i>lin-12(wy750)</i>, <i>apx-1(wy750)</i> and <i>sel-12(wy760)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), suggesting that the canonical LIN-12/Notch pathway is likely involved by controlling the transcription of downstream genes. Moreover, the expression of a <i>hlh-29</i> transcription reporter (<i>hlh-29::gfp</i>), a known target gene of the canonical LIN-12/Notch pathway in vm2, was also dramatically down-regulated in <i>lin-12(wy750)</i>, <i>apx-1(wy755)</i> and <i>sel-12(wy760)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fischer and Gessler, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">McMiller et al., 2007</a>). Together, these results strongly support the model that APX-1 expressed in the secondary vulval epithelial cells and vm1 cells activates the canonical LIN-12/Notch pathway in vm2 to promote the formation of the postsynaptic muscle arms. The specific activation of the LIN-12/Notch pathway in vm2 but not in vm1 thus appears to dictate the choice of the synaptic target."

A reciprocal inhibition mechanism as well as a lateral signaling inducing the differentiation of a Notch cell and a Delta cell, mediates the AC/VU decision and VPC specification, respectively (<a href=\"#bib34\">Greenwald et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sternberg, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Seydoux and Greenwald, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Wilkinson et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Sundaram, 2004</a>). We wondered whether a similar mechanism is also used in specifying vm2 identity and regulating the muscle arm development. We first examined the <i>lin-12</i> expression pattern in an <i>apx-1(wy755)</i> mutant. Compared with wild-type animals, <i>apx-1(wy755)</i> mutant animals showed significantly reduced expression of <i>lin-12</i> in vm2 cells, whereas the <i>lin-12</i> expression in vulval epithelial cells was not affected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). On the other hand, we did not observe any change of <i>apx-1</i> expression in the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results argue that <i>apx-1</i> unilaterally promotes <i>lin-12</i> expression and activates the LIN-12/Notch pathway in vm2."

To understand if this positive feedback loop is important for vm2 muscle arm formation, we searched for mutations in the <i>lin-12</i> promoter region. One <i>lin-12</i> loss-of-function allele, <i>e2621</i>, was previously known to have egg-laying defects without vulval morphogenesis phenotype (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wu et al., 1998</a>). We sequenced the <i>lin-12</i> promoter in this allele and found a 541-bp deletion in the promoter region leading to the deletion of two of the three LAG-1 binding sites (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, top). Interestingly, the muscle arm development was similarly affected in <i>lin-12(e2621)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, bottom), suggesting that the muscle arm development might require the positive transcriptional feedback of the LIN-12/Notch pathway."

UNC-40, which is a homolog of Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (DCC) and neogenin in vertebrates serving as a receptor for the UNC-6/Netrin ligand (<a href=\"#bib69\">Serafini et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</a>), was reported to play a role in muscle arm formation in the body wall muscles (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dixon and Roy, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alexander et al., 2009</a>). More recently, MADD-2, a C1-TRIM protein encoding a homolog of human MID1, was shown to directly bind and function together with UNC-40 to regulate body wall muscle arm extension as well as axon branching and patterning (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alexander et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Morikawa et al., 2011</a>). We therefore examined the vm2 muscle arms in these two mutants. Interestingly, both <i>unc-40(n324)</i> and <i>madd-2(ok2226)</i> null mutants showed specific vulval muscle arm defects with largely normal vulval muscle morphology (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). A significant proportion of the mutant animals completely lacked the vm2 muscle arms, while some other animals showed abnormal muscle arms that extended from incorrect positions or flimsy muscle arms that were thinner and dimmer than the wild-type muscle arms (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These defects were strongly rescued by expressing <i>unc-40</i> or <i>madd-2</i> specifically in vulval muscles in respective mutants, suggesting that both <i>unc-40</i> and <i>madd-2</i> function cell-autonomously in vm2 to promote and guide muscle arm growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Consistent with this notion, we found that the expression of both <i>unc-40</i> and <i>madd-2</i> could be robustly detected in the vm2 cells but not in vm1 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Moreover, UNC-40::GFP is enriched on the muscle arms, further suggesting that it might function locally to promote muscle arm growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results indicate that the levels of UNC-40 and MADD-2 critically determine the capacity of vulval muscles to grow muscle arms and be selected as the postsynaptic target by the egg-laying motoneurons."

For these analyses, we used two types of expression constructs: translational reporters and transcriptional reporters. The translational reporters contain the promoter, coding and 3\u2032UTR sequences in which the GFP is inserted in frame with the coding sequences. The fluorescence signal from this type of reporter reflects transcriptional activity, translational regulation and protein stability. The transcriptional reporters only contain the promoter regions and report the transcriptional activity. In wild-type animals, both UNC-40 and MADD-2 translational reporters were preferentially expressed in vm2 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). UNC-40::GFP showed membrane-associated pattern and was enriched on vm2 muscle arms. MADD-2 was distributed diffusely in vm2 cells. The expression of both UNC-40 and MADD-2 in vm2 was significantly down-regulated in the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), supporting the idea that <i>lin-12</i> was required for the expression of <i>unc-40</i> and <i>madd-2</i> in vm2."

However, only vm2 receives synaptic connections from the egg-laying neurons HSN and VC4/5. Based on the data presented above, we speculated that the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway elevates the level of UNC-40 and MADD-2 in vm2, which in turn are directly involved in generating muscle arms. To test the sufficiency of UNC-40 and MADD-2 in conferring postsynaptic specificity, we created transgenic animals that expressed UNC-40 ectopically in the vm1 cells. We found that misexpression of UNC-40 was sufficient to induce the dendritic spine-like membrane extensions from vm1 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). To circumvent the occasional silencing of the UNC-40 transgene, we achieved UNC-40 expression in vm1 by single-copy insertion and observed the similar ectopic muscle arm-like structure (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although the ectopic membrane extension from vm1 was usually thinner than the wild-type vm2 muscle arm, the vm1 muscle arms always formed from the medial surface of vm1, the identical location as for the normal vm2 muscle arms, suggesting that UNC-40 responds to specific environmental cues to guide the formation of muscle arms."

Since both <i>unc-40</i> and <i>madd-2</i> mutants showed muscle arm phenotypes, we investigated whether they functioned in the same or parallel pathways. We generated an <i>unc-40(n324); madd-2(ok2226)</i> double mutant and found slightly enhanced muscle arm defects in the double mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We also found that the overexpression of <i>madd-2</i> partially rescued the muscle arm defects of <i>unc-40(n324)</i> null mutant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Conversely, overexpression of <i>unc-40</i> largely rescued the muscle arm defects of <i>madd-2(ok2226)</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>madd-2</i> likely functioned synergistically with <i>unc-40</i> to promote muscle arm formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

We conclude that the postsynaptic development and synaptic target selection in the egg-laying circuit are mediated by the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway. The secondary vulval epithelial cells and non-target vm1 cells express APX-1/Dsl, which activates its receptor LIN-12/Notch in the vm2 synaptic target cells. The LIN-12/Notch pathway promotes the expression of UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2, which cooperates with each other to generate postsynaptic muscle arms."

Canonical <i>lin-12</i> loss-of-function alleles show defective vulval morphogenesis.

From our study, we definitively showed that the egg-laying defects in <i>lin-12</i>, <i>apx-1</i>, <i>sel-12</i> weak loss-of-function alleles were due to the absence of vm2 muscle arm, which caused asynchronous activation of the anterior and posterior vulval muscles and inefficient egg-laying."

                                "text": "The vm2 muscle arm phenotype in the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> weak allele could be caused directly by the reduction of LIN-12/Notch activity, or indirectly by the disruption of other signaling(s) due to slight alternations of LIN-12/Notch-dependent vulval morphogenesis or other LIN-12/Notch-dependent events during early development. Using a temperature sensitive allele, we showed that disruption of <i>lin-12</i> activity at a very late developmental stage caused vm2 muscle arm defects along with egg-laying defects. We never observed the loss or alternation of vulval muscles in these new weak alleles by examining several cell-type-specific markers (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C,E,F</a>), indicating that the function of LIN-12/Notch signaling in specifying the sex myoblasts, the sex muscle precursor cells, is intact (<a href=\"#bib34\">Greenwald et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Foehr and Liu, 2008</a>). This developmental timing matches the relatively late window of vulval muscle specification and muscle arm formation. Furthermore, activation of LIN-12/Notch signaling in vm2 is necessary and sufficient to rescue the vm2 muscle arm development, indicating that LIN-12/Notch signaling is directly required in vm2. These results suggest a novel role of LIN-12/Notch signaling in regulating vm2 postsynaptic muscle arm formation and target selection. Therefore, we conclude that LIN-12/Notch signal instructs both vulval organogenesis and synaptic development of the egg-laying circuit by regulating at least three sequential but independent developmental processes: the AC/VU decision, in which LIN-12/Notch signaling promotes the differentiation of AC and VU cells; VPC specification, in which it determines the vulval precursor cell fates; and vm2 postsynaptic specification, in which it specifies the postsynaptic target cell and further regulates the muscle arm development."

Hence, the muscle arm phenotype shown in <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant is not likely the consequence of a complete cell-fate conversion. Even in the muscle lineage, several cell-type specific reporters displayed wild type patterns in <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), supporting the notion that many aspects of the vm2 differentiation remain intact while only a subset of genes that determines specific postsynaptic development are affected. We can envision two hypotheses to explain the specificity of these alleles. First, vm2 muscle arm development requires a high level of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity, while vulval morphogenesis and overall muscle development require low activity of LIN-12. The new alleles represent partial loss-of-function mutants that specifically disrupt muscle arm development. Alternatively, LIN-12 could execute two different downstream pathways, one required for vulval morphogenesis and the other required for muscle arm development. Since the lesions in almost all the new alleles are point mutations, they might specifically disable the muscle arm development pathway."

First, the new mutations in <i>lin-12</i> and <i>apx-1</i> were found in the extracellular domains, but not in the signal transducing cytosolic domain of LIN-12. In addition, a nonsense mutation in <i>sel-12(wy756, W184stop)</i> caused strong vulval phenotypes, while a missense mutation in <i>sel-12(wy760, G373D)</i> showed specific vm2 muscle arm phenotype, further arguing for the difference in the dosage requirement for these developmental events. Along the same line, a <i>lag-1</i> dominant negative construct expressed in the vulval muscles led to muscle arm defects, suggesting that the same canonical LIN-12/Notch signaling pathways is required for the muscle arm development. Second, the <i>lin-12(e2621)</i> allele, showed muscle arm defects (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) with intact vulval morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wu et al., 1998</a>). Sequencing of the <i>lin-12</i> locus of this mutant revealed a 541-bp deletion in the promoter region with no mutation in the coding sequence. The deleted sequence in the promoter region contains two LAG-1 consensus binding sites and therefore is likely to disrupt the positive feedback loop, which could in turn reduce the level of LIN-12/Notch signaling. In fact, the expression of the <i>hlh-29</i> transcription reporter was down-regulated in <i>lin-12(e2621)</i> (data not shown). Together, these data strongly argue that vulval morphogenesis requires a low level of LIN-12/Notch signaling activation, while vm2 postsynaptic specification requires a relatively high level of LIN-12/Notch activity. Consistent with this model, <i>mir-61::gfp</i>, another transcription reporter expressed in VPCs during its specification process, does not change in the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant (data not shown), suggesting that the alternation of LIN-12/Notch signaling activity in <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> has little or no effect in VPC specification."

The putative ligand provided by vulval epithelial cells could be either a short-range cue that is associated on membrane or locally secreted, or a globally diffusive cue. We favor the former prediction based on the observation that the relative distance between the vulval muscles and the vulval opening is crucial. SM migration is affected in <i>egl-15(n484)</i> mutant, which causes posteriorly displaced vulval muscles descended from an SM that stops prematurely during the migration (<a href=\"#bib92\">Goodman et al., 2003</a>). Different phenotypes were observed, which appeared to correlate with the location of the vulval muscles. The muscle arms that were located far away from the vulva displayed severe morphogenesis defects, whereas when the vulval muscles did not reach but were still closed to the correct places, we observed muscle arms growing with longer shafts to reach the correct locations defined by HSN presynaptic regions (data not shown).

Although many in vitro studies suggest that direct interactions between pre- and postsynaptic cells trigger the mutual differentiation processes leading to synaptogenesis, our experiments revealed a significantly different picture. First, the formation of pre- and postsynaptic specializations can occur at different times. The HSN presynaptic specializations form at the early L4 stage, significantly before the maturation of the postsynaptic targets. The extension of the postsynaptic muscle arms takes place 5\u20136 hr later. Second, the development of the pre- and postsynaptic specializations appears to be independent of each other. Eliminating the postsynaptic cells does not affect the timing and location of synaptic vesicle accumulation in HSN neurons (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</a>). Similarly, ablation of the presynaptic neurons has no obvious effect on the timing and direction of the muscle arm growth (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Third, pre- and postsynaptic differentiations are guided by two different but related guidepost cells. Through genetic analysis, we previously found that the primary vulval epithelial cells serve as guidepost cells for the HSN presynaptic development (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shen et al., 2004</a>). These primary cells express a transmembrane IgSF protein SYG-2, which clusters and activates a related molecule, SYG-1 on the HSN axon. The intercellular interaction between SYG-1 and SYG-2 defines the location of HSN synapses and initiates the presynaptic formation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shen and Bargmann, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shen et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, postsynaptic differentiation is likely guided by the secondary vulval epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). APX-1/DSL expressed in the secondary vulval epithelial cells and the non-target vm1 cells activates the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway in the vm2 cells. Subsequently, UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2 are up-regulated leading to the selective muscle arm formation in vm2. The muscle arms appear to grow along the interface between the primary and the secondary vulval epithelial cells through possibly an UNC-40-dependent mechanism, which ensures that the pre- and postsynaptic compartments will contact each other. The epithelial cells not only function as the channel for egg-laying but also play organizational roles for the development of the entire vulval organ, coordinating multiple events including vulval muscle migration, axon guidance of HSN, VC axon branching and synapse formation. Our discoveries reveal that many of the principles of synaptic organization in vivo might involve cells other than the pre- and postsynaptic neurons."

Single worms aged 24 hr after the L4 stage were picked with a small amount of OP50 bacteria to an unseeded NGM plate. From this plate, a \u223c20 \u00d7 20-mm chunk was placed worms-side down onto a 24 \u00d7 60 mm #1 coverslip and overlaid with a 22 \u00d7 22 mm #1 coverslip. The worms were allowed to recover for 1\u20132 hr in a humidified chamber at 20\u00b0C before imaging. Two-channel confocal slices (18-\u00b5m-thick, 256 \u00d7 256 pixel, 16-bit) were collected for 6 min at 20 Hz through a 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat objective (0.8NA) using the LIVE detector of an inverted Zeiss 710 Duo confocal microscope. The stage and focus were adjusted manually to keep the egg-laying system in view and focused during recording periods. Ratiometric analysis was performed in Volocity (version 5.4; Perkin Elmer). Briefly, separate GCaMP3/mCherry ratio and intensity-modulated ratio channels were calculated. Voxels with mCherry fluorescence intensities 2 standard deviations above background were selected as objects for measurement (typically \u223c500 voxels per time point). The average ratio of these voxels were smoothened using a 150 ms (three time points) rolling average, and the lowest 10% of the GCaMP3/mCherry ratio values were averaged to establish a \u0394R/R (change in GCaMP3/mCherry fluorescence ratio/absolute ratio) baseline. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were identified by visual inspection of intensity-modulated ratio movies and ratio traces, and \u0394R/R peaks above 15% were analyzed. Transients were classified as single when the transient was evidently confined to the anterior or posterior vulval muscle and double when both anterior and posterior muscles had obvious transients. Double transients that resolved to a single peak in the ratiometric trace were defined as having no delay (0 s, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). When two or more transients within a single body bend were separable both spatially and temporally in the intensity-modulated ratio movies and had independent peaks separated by \u0394250 ms in the ratiometric trace, the delay between the anterior and posterior peaks was determined."

We started the project with a forward genetic screen on a marker that labeled the postsynaptic specializations on the muscle arms. In the partial loss-of-function mutant alleles of the Notch pathway that we isolated in this synaptic morphology screen, many aspects of the muscle differentiation remain intact, suggesting that high level of the Notch signaling activity is specifically required for the postsynaptic development. In other words, the vm2 cells absolutely require high level of Notch signaling to become the postsynaptic target of the presynaptic HSN neurons."

Furthermore, LIN-12 acts cell-autonomously to activate the expression of UNC-40/DCC and MADD-2 in vm2. These two molecules in turn are required for vm2 muscle arm formation and targeting. Most importantly, to demonstrate that the LIN-12/Notch-controlled molecular program is directly involved in target selection during neural circuit assembly, we showed that UNC-40 is sufficient to induce muscle arm-like membrane protrusions when misexpressed in vm1. Taken together, these data suggest that the high-level activity of LIN-12 distinguishes vm2 from vm1 in the process of forming muscle arms and becoming the postsynaptic targets in the egg-laying circuit."

In the revised manuscript, besides the vm1 specific marker <i>egl-15::gfp</i> (Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 4C), we have included analyses of two additional cell-type specific markers (<i>hlh-8::gfp</i> and <i>rgs-2::gfp)</i> (Figure 1\u2013 figure supplement 4E and 4F). <i>hlh-8::gfp</i> labels the M lineage, which include vm1, vm2, and the uterine muscles. This marker is only present in differentiating muscles and is absent in mature muscles. <i>rgs-2::gfp</i> is a specific marker for the uterine muscle. In the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant animals, the expression of <i>hlh-8::gfp</i> is found in all three classes of muscles only during L3-L4, indistinguishable from the wild type controls. Similarly, in the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant animals, the expression of <i>rgs-2::gfp</i> is found only in the uterine muscles, indistinguishable from the wild type controls. Together, we have examined three differentiation markers for the vm2 and related muscle lineage. We found no obvious gross cell fate changes in the <i>lin-12(wy750)</i> mutant. We want to remind the reviewers that this <i>lin-12</i> allele is a partial loss-of-function allele, which showed no vulval morphogenesis phenotypes (another cell fate phenotype). We think the lack of cell fate phenotype is likely due to the remaining LIN-12/Notch activity in this strain."
