                    "text": "The presynaptic active zone proteins UNC-13/Munc13s are essential for synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis by directly interacting with SV fusion apparatus. An open question is how their association with active zones, hence their position to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites, regulates SV release. The N-termini of major UNC-13/Munc13 isoforms contain a non-calcium binding C<sub>2</sub>A domain that mediates protein homo- or hetero-meric interactions. Here, we show that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> UNC-13 regulates release probability of evoked release and its precise active zone localization. Kinetics analysis of SV release supports that the proximity of UNC-13 to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites, mediated by the C<sub>2</sub>A-domain containing N-terminus, is critical for accelerating neurotransmitter release. Additionally, the C<sub>2</sub>A domain is specifically required for spontaneous release. These data reveal multiple roles of UNC-13 C<sub>2</sub>A domain, and suggest that spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may involve a common pool of SVs at the active zone."

An open question is how their association with active zones, hence their position to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites, regulates SV release. The N-termini of major UNC-13/Munc13 isoforms contain a non-calcium binding C<sub>2</sub>A domain that mediates protein homo- or hetero-meric interactions. Here, we show that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> UNC-13 regulates release probability of evoked release and its precise active zone localization. Kinetics analysis of SV release supports that the proximity of UNC-13 to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites, mediated by the C<sub>2</sub>A-domain containing N-terminus, is critical for accelerating neurotransmitter release. Additionally, the C<sub>2</sub>A domain is specifically required for spontaneous release. These data reveal multiple roles of UNC-13 C<sub>2</sub>A domain, and suggest that spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may involve a common pool of SVs at the active zone."

First it was shown that the precise position of UNC-13 in the active zone depended on a domain within the protein called the C<sub>2</sub>A domain. Next it was shown that the distance between the UNC-13 protein and the calcium ion channels strongly influences the quick mode of vesicle release. Finally, Zhou et al. showed that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain also had a significant influence on the spontaneous release of vesicles, which suggests that a common fleet of vesicles might be used for both the quick and the spontaneous modes of vesicle release. Zhou et al. also generated mutant worms that mimicked a neurological disease, epileptic seizure, and showed that eliminating the C<sub>2</sub>A domain can relieve some of the symptoms associated with the disease."

In most synapses, SV release evoked by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx consists of a fast synchronous phase that occurs on a millisecond timescale and a slow asynchronous phase that occurs with some delay and persists for tens or hundreds of milliseconds. Additionally, all synapses manifest spontaneous release, corresponding to stochastic fusion of individual SVs. The key proteins mediating SV release include soluble Nethylmaleimide\u2013sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, UNC-13/Munc13s, synaptotagmins and complexins (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wojcik and Brose, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>)."

The mechanisms for why some SVs release rapidly and others slowly in response to membrane depolarization have been primarily attributed to the heterogeneity in their intrinsic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivities, such that a low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor promotes the fast phase, while a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor supports the slow phase (<a href=\"#bib67\">S\u00fcdhof, 2012a</a>). Yet, numerous studies have suggested that the distance between SVs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites is also a critical determinant for release kinetics and release probability (<a href=\"#bib51\">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hoppa et al., 2012</a>). For example, in the calyx of Held, a giant synapse in the brainstem, it was shown that SVs involved in the slow phase of evoked release triggered by prolonged depolarization are as sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> as those in the fast phase, and can undergo rapid release upon uniform elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wadel et al., 2007</a>). A recent study also showed that presynaptic over-expression of an auxiliary \u03b12\u03b4 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) led to a dramatic increase in release probability even though the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was reduced. It was suggested that the \u03b12\u03b4 subunit may promote a closer spatial correlation between sites of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and vesicle release (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hoppa et al., 2012</a>). Nonetheless, the mechanism for distance mediated regulation of SV release remains poorly understood."

UNC-13/Munc13 proteins contain multiple protein interaction domains, and have been linked to nearly all aspects of presynaptic release. Common to all protein isoforms are a diacylglycerol-binding C<sub>1</sub> domain followed by a MUN domain including the MHD (Munc13 homology domain) flanked by a C<sub>2</sub>B and a C<sub>2</sub>C domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The MUN domain is structurally similar to the vesicle tethering factors of the CATCHR (Complex Associated with Tethering Containing Helical rods) family (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2011</a>), and is necessary for vesicle priming (<a href=\"#bib6\">Basu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Madison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Stevens et al., 2005</a>) through binding to SNARE and Munc18 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Betz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ma et al., 2011</a>). The N-terminal regions of UNC-13/Munc13 isoforms are divergent in amino acid sequences, and have been hypothesized to contribute to the distinct properties of SV exocytosis in different types of synapses (<a href=\"#bib4\">Augustin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rosenmund et al., 2002</a>). Of direct relevance, a non-calcium binding C<sub>2</sub>A domain resides at the N-terminus of the major isoforms, which include Munc13\u20131, ubMunc13\u20132 and <i>C. elegans</i> UNC-13 long isoform. This C<sub>2</sub>A domain can homodimerize (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lu et al., 2006</a>), and heterodimerize with the zinc finger domain of the active zone protein RIM (<a href=\"#bib9\">Betz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dulubova et al., 2005</a>). RIM can tether presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to the active zone, and lack of RIM reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at active zones (<a href=\"#bib26\">Han et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kaeser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Muller et al., 2012</a>). Recently, an elegant study has demonstrated a mechanism in which homodimerization by the C<sub>2</sub>A domain keeps ubMunc13\u20132 under priming-inhibitory state, while heteromeric binding between the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of ubMunc13\u20132 and the zinc finger of RIM relieves the inhibition to promote SV priming (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deng et al., 2011</a>). However, a direct test for C<sub>2</sub>A domain\u2019s function in vivo is not yet shown."

The abundant long isoform UNC-13L closely resembles Munc13\u20131 and ubMunc13\u20132. Previous studies using genetic mutations that eliminate function of all isoforms or UNC-13L demonstrate an essential role of UNC-13L in neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib57\">Richmond et al., 1999</a>). A recent study reveals that UNC-13L is involved in both fast and slow release of SVs, while the short isoform UNC-13S is required for the slow release (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). Here, we identified a unique <i>unc-13</i> mutant that specifically deletes the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of UNC-13L. Exploiting this mutant, we show that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain regulates the release probability of SVs, likely through positioning UNC-13L to the active zone. The C<sub>2</sub>A domain also has a specific role in spontaneous release. Loss of the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of UNC-13L blocks the enhanced spontaneous release caused by loss of complexin. Furthermore, using the genetically encoded photosensitizer miniSOG (mini singlet oxygen generator), we find that acute ablation of the active-zone specific UNC-13L results in a strong inhibition of spontaneous release and of the fast phase of evoked release, while ablation of a non-active-zone variant of UNC-13L alters primarily the slow phase of evoked release. These observations support an idea that spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may use a common pool of SVs. We also show that reducing SV release by eliminating the function of UNC-13L C<sub>2</sub>A domain ameliorates behavioral deficits in a <i>C. elegans</i> model for epileptic seizure. Together, these data demonstrate that the distance between UNC-13/Munc13 to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry site plays a critical role in SV release probability and release kinetics."

A classic assay to analyze SV priming is by the application of hypertonic sucrose solution to induce vesicle exocytosis in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner, which is often used to assess readily releasable pool (RRP) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</a>).

Because the preparation for <i>C. elegans</i> NMJ recording cannot endure multiple stimulations, it is not feasible to record reliable responses for multiple stimulations to compare the charge transfers during eEPSC and sucrose application in the same animal. We therefore calculated the ratio of mean charge transfers during eEPSC and sucrose application for a given genotype.

The ultrastructural appearance of the presynaptic dense projection was grossly normal in <i>unc-13(n2609)</i>. To further test whether the recruitment of active zone proteins might be affected, we examined the localization of several active zone proteins, including the <i>C. elegans</i> RIM protein UNC-10 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koushika et al., 2001</a>), ELKS-1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deken et al., 2005</a>), and the \u03b11 subunit of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) UNC-2 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jospin et al., 2007</a>). We found that the co-localization pattern of UNC-10 with ELKS-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A1\u20134</a>) and of UNC-10 with UNC-2::GFP (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were indistinguishable between wild type and <i>unc-13(n2609)</i> animals. UNC-13L proteins, recognized by the antibodies against the N-terminus of UNC-13L, showed a punctate pattern in <i>unc-13(n2609)</i> mutants. However, UNC-13L puncta displayed significantly reduced co-localization with UNC-10/RIM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B1,B3</a>). The distance from an UNC-13L punctum to the nearest UNC-10/RIM punctum was significantly increased in <i>unc-13(n2609),</i> compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B2,B4</a>). We observed similarly altered UNC-13L and UNC-10/RIM colocalization in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> animals, comparing to <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C1\u20134</a>). As UNC-10/RIM, ELKS-1 and UNC-2/VGCC are correctly recruited to the active zone in <i>unc-13(n2609)</i> mutants, these data indicate that lacking the C<sub>2</sub>A domain causes UNC-13L to be shifted away from the active zone where Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites reside."

Supporting this idea, GFP tagged C<sub>2</sub>A domain (N1\u2013157) displayed a diffuse pattern throughout the axon (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). It has been shown that the UNC-13S isoform, which has a different N-terminal domain, is diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nurrish et al., 1999</a>). These observations imply that additional protein sequences of the N-terminus of UNC-13L may contribute to its active zone localization. Indeed, we found that the entire N-terminal region (N1\u2013607) of UNC-13L tagged with GFP showed a punctate pattern similar to the full-length UNC-13L::GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Conversely, removing the N-terminal domain, UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>, resulted in diffuse axonal localization. These data are consistent with the recent report (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>) and show that both the C<sub>2</sub>A domain and additional N-terminal sequences of UNC-13L are responsible for its precise position in the presynaptic active zone."

Among presynaptic active zone proteins, UNC-13/Munc13 is unique in that it directly interacts with the SV fusion apparatus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Betz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ma et al., 2011</a>). To address the significance of UNC-13L localization in function, we first compared the activity of UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>, UNC-13L<sup>C2A\u2212</sup>, and full-length UNC-13L driven by the same pan-neuronal promoter from the same genomic insertion locus in rescuing the paralysis of <i>unc-13(s69).</i> Quantitative analysis of locomotion speed showed a poor rescuing activity of <i>unc-13(s69)</i> paralysis by <i>Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>N\u2212</i></sup><i>),</i> compared to <i>Si(UNC-13L)</i> and <i>Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> transgenes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next investigated how altered UNC-13L localization affected SV release kinetics. We analyzed eEPSCs with 90\u201310% decay time, which mainly reflects the duration of slow phase of evoked release, as well as the cumulative charge transfer of eEPSCs by fitting with a double-exponential function (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In wild type animals, eEPSCs lasted around 50 ms and decayed close to the baseline with 90\u201310% decay time being 18.56 \u00b1 2.22 ms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>). The charge transfer during eEPSC manifested two kinetic components with the time constants for the fast and slow components differing by a factor of around ten: \u03c4<sub>fast</sub> = 5.29 \u00b1 0.20 ms, and \u03c4<sub>slow</sub> = 40.30 \u00b1 2.61 ms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The relative fraction of the fast component was 77.21 \u00b1 4.33%, indicating that the fast component of evoked release is dominant in <i>C. elegans</i> cholinergic NMJs. To assess the specific contribution of UNC-13L localization in SV release kinetics, we analyzed <i>unc-13(s69)</i> null animals expressing each UNC-13L variant. The time constants in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L)</i> were faster than those in wild type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), suggesting that other endogenous UNC-13 isoforms contribute to SV release with a slower kinetics. The time constants and the relative fraction of the fast component in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> were both significantly changed, compared to those in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>N\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> animals showed a more prolonged SV release. The time constants and the decay time of eEPSC were further affected, compared to <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i> NMJs, the decays of tonic excitatory postsynaptic current (tEPSC), which represent spontaneous release of individual SVs, are general short (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, the decay times of tEPSC are not altered in UNC-13L transgenic lines that have prolonged eEPSCs (see below, and [<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>]). Therefore, the observed changes in the evoked release kinetics are unlikely due to the kinetic change of postsynaptic ACh receptor response; and instead, the slower decay time of eEPSC reflects desynchronisation of presynaptic release. These results show that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of UNC-13L is required for the fast release kinetics of SVs, and additional N-terminal protein sequences of UNC-13L further contribute to accelerating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered evoked release."

To address what might account for this difference, we performed recordings using sucrose application. We found that <i>Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>N\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> showed significantly increased sucrose evoked SV release, comparing to <i>Si(UNC-13L)</i> and <i>Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup> shows diffused localization throughout presynaptic axons, the rescue of eEPSC amplitude by <i>Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>N\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> likely reflects recruitment of SVs located distally from active zones. Together, with the enhanced slow release in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>N\u2212</i></sup><i>),</i> these observations indicate that these SVs are competent for release, but with lower release probability and slower release kinetics. <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>N\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> animals showed significantly slower locomotion than <i>unc-13(s69)</i> expressing either full-length UNC-13L or UNC-13L<sup>C2A<i>\u2212</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that SV release probability and kinetics, rather than the total vesicle supply in RRP, are functional relevant determinants for synaptic transmission efficiency in these cholinergic neuromuscular junctions."

To analyze the effects of UNC-13L active zone localization on spontaneous release, we recorded tonic excitatory post-synaptic currents (tEPSCs) from the cholinergic motor neurons. <i>unc-13(n2609)</i> mutants showed a strong reduction in tEPSC frequency, compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The amplitude and kinetics of tEPSCs was not altered (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similarly, reduced tEPSC frequency was also observed in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup><i>),</i> comparing to <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L)</i>. Overexpression of UNC-13L<sup>C2A\u2212</sup> in <i>unc-13(s69)</i> did not fully rescue the defects of tEPSC frequency, while overexpression of UNC-13L displayed an enhanced tonic release (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We also recorded tEPSCs in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>N\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> animals, in which UNC-13 proteins are diffuse throughout the axon, and observed reduced tEPSC frequency to a level similar to that in <i>unc-13(s69); Si(UNC-13L</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup><i>)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), indicating that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain alone accounts for the specific effect of the active zone localized UNC-13L in tonic release. Since loss of the C<sub>2</sub>A domain caused UNC-13L to be shifted away from the center of the active zone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>) and SVs docked in regions distal to the active zone were competent for release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1F and 4E</a>), these results suggest that a major proportion of tonic release may occur in regions proximal to the active zone. To test this idea further, we examined double mutants of <i>unc-13(n2609)</i> and <i>cpx-1/complexin</i>. CPX-1/complexin is a key regulator of SV release by acting as a clamp on SNARE (<a href=\"#bib56\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Xue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maximov et al., 2009</a>). Loss of CPX-1 significantly enhances tEPSC frequency (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Martin et al., 2011</a>), but it is not clear where within the synapse the increased tEPSC events occur. We found that tEPSC frequency in <i>cpx-1(ok1552) unc-13(n2609)</i> double mutants was significantly reduced, compared to <i>cpx-1(ok1552)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that the enhanced spontaneous release caused by loss of complexin requires the function of the UNC-13 C<sub>2</sub>A domain. We next recorded evoked release in <i>cpx-1(ok1552) unc-13(n2609)</i> double mutants. <i>cpx-1(ok1552)</i> single mutant showed dramatically reduced eEPSCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), in part due to loss of a facilitating function of complexin on SV release (<a href=\"#bib56\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Xue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maximov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Martin et al., 2011</a>). The amplitude of eEPSC in <i>cpx-1(ok1552) unc-13(n2609)</i> double mutants was significantly reduced, compared to wild type or <i>unc-13(n2609)</i>, but was moderately increased, compared to <i>cpx-1</i> single mutants. Analysis of charge transfer further showed a noticeable increase primarily in the fast phase of release, within 20 ms after electrical stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Based on these observations, we infer that in these cholinergic synapses SV populations involved in spontaneous release may be mainly from the region proximal to the active zone, which, in <i>cpx-1(ok1552) unc-13(n2609)</i> mutants, were converted to account for the fast phase of evoked release."

This method takes advantage of the singlet oxygen production by the genetically encoded photosensitizer miniSOG (mini singlet oxygen generator) to acutely ablate tagged proteins in vivo upon blue light illumination. We constructed miniSOG tagged UNC-13L, which localizes to the active zone, and UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>, which is diffuse in axons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In <i>unc-13(s69)</i>, both UNC-13L-miniSOG and UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG rescued the paralysis to different degrees (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating miniSOG tagged UNC-13L proteins are functionally incorporated into the SV release apparatus. Upon pulsed blue-light illumination, both miniSOG transgenic animals exhibited fast paralysis to a similar degree (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating miniSOG-mediated chromophore-assisted light inactivation (CALI) can inactivate UNC-13L and UNC-13L<sup>N\u2013</sup> equally effectively. By NMJ recordings, without blue light, both UNC-13L-miniSOG and UNC-13L<sup>N-</sup>-miniSOG fully rescued the amplitude of eEPSCs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). CALI by 2\u20133 min blue light illumination resulted in a severe inhibition of eEPSCs in both transgenic animals, while the same illumination had little effect on wild type animals expressing miniSOG tagged free YFP (miniSOG-Citrine) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>)."

Our assumption is that transgenically over-expressed UNC-13L-miniSOG or UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG would interact with native protein interacting partners by competing with endogenous UNC-13. Wild type animals carrying UNC-13L-miniSOG transgenes showed rapid movement impairment upon CALI by blue light (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Notably, animals with UNC-13L-miniSOG showed much slower movement than those with UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), supporting our assumption that UNC-13L-miniSOG and UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG are incorporated into the endogenous SV release apparatus in different subsynaptic domains. We then performed NMJ recordings. Without blue light treatment, overexpression of UNC-13L-miniSOG in wild type animals caused increased eEPSC amplitude and charge transfer in the fast phase of release, compared to control animals expressing miniSOG-Citrine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a><i>)</i>. CALI of UNC-13L-miniSOG dramatically reduced the amplitude of eEPSCs, and resulted in a strong decrease in the transferred charge of the fast phase, but little effect on the slow phase of eEPSCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In contrast, overexpression of UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG in wild type animals, without blue light illumination, resulted in a large slow phase of evoked release <i>(</i><a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a><i>)</i>, which is consistent with the report that UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup> is able to induce release competent SVs with slow release kinetics (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). CALI of UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG caused a mild reduction in the amplitude and the fast phase of eEPSCs, but nearly abolished the slow phase. Importantly, inactivation of UNC-13L-miniSOG resulted in a much slower 90\u201310% decay time of eEPSCs than the control animals expressing free miniSOG-Citrine, whereas inactivation of UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG had an opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Since UNC-13L and UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup> reside in different subdomains of synapses and likely interact with the release machinery for different pools of SVs, we interpret that the differential effects of acute ablation of UNC-13 protein variants reflect the consequence of inhibiting or damaging themselves and their immediately associated protein interacting partners that are necessary for their action in situ<i>.</i> These results are consistent with the conclusion that the active zone localization of UNC-13L, hence close proximity to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry site, is critical for the fast phase of evoked release."

In <i>unc-13(s69)</i> mutants, UNC-13L-miniSOG fully rescued tEPSC frequency, while UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG partially rescued it (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Blue light illumination caused a strong inhibition on both rescued lines. In wild type background, inactivation of UNC-13L-miniSOG dramatically reduced the frequency of tEPSCs by 70% in the presence of endogenous proteins, compared to the pre-light condition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>). Inactivation of UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG had a weak effect on the frequency of tEPSCs. Together, these analyses suggest that UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG, being diffusely localized in axons, has a less role in interacting with the release apparatus for tonic release, and provide further support for the conclusion that the precise localization of UNC-13L to the active zone is crucial for spontaneous release."

Several recent studies have begun to unveil the function specificity mediated by the N-terminal domains in different Munc13 isoforms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lipstein et al., 2013</a>).

In this study, taking advantage of the <i>unc-13(n2609</i>) mutation as well as single-copy expression of UNC-13L variants in <i>unc-13</i> null mutants, we have uncovered specific roles of the C<sub>2</sub>A domain in SV release probability and spontaneous release. The precise active zone localization depends on the C<sub>2</sub>A-containing N-terminal region unique to UNC-13L, and directly contributes to SV release kinetics. Our data support a conclusion that the proximity of UNC-13/Munc13 to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry site plays a critical role in SV release probability and release kinetics, and also suggest that spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may share a common pool of synaptic vesicles at the active zone."

Here, we show that lack of C<sub>2</sub>A domain causes a delocalization of UNC-13L from UNC-10/RIM, resulting in a shift of UNC-13L from the center of the active zone. Homodimerization of the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of Munc13 is recently shown to inhibit its function in SV priming, whereas RIM binding to the C<sub>2</sub>A domain converts this priming-inhibitory state to a priming-promoting state (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deng et al., 2011</a>). A monomeric Munc13 lacking the C<sub>2</sub>A domain-containing N-terminal region can rescue the priming defects of synapses lacking majority of Munc13, but does not fully rescue evoked release (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deng et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this study, we find that SV priming is normal in synapses lacking specifically the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of UNC-13L. We further show that lack of C<sub>2</sub>A domain specifically reduces the release probability of SV release. Based on the immunostaining of UNC-13L and ultrastructural analysis of <i>unc-13(n2609),</i> we think that this effect is likely due to both mispositioning of the remaining UNC-13L in the active zone as well as a mild effect on SV docking at the proximal region to active zones."

The distance between SV release sites to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx sites also significantly influences release kinetics (<a href=\"#bib51\">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</a>). Among the core SV fusion apparatus, including SNARE and Munc18 proteins, UNC-13/Munc13 exhibits the most restricted localization at the active zone (<a href=\"#bib68\">S\u00fcdhof, 2012b</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i> the precise active zone localization of UNC-13L is regulated by the C<sub>2</sub>A domain-containing N-terminal region (this study, and [<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>]). Overexpression of a chimeric protein with only the C<sub>2</sub>A domain attached to the C-terminal common region of UNC-13 shortens the latency of SV release (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). We find that lacking the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of UNC-13L causes reduced amplitude of evoked release, which can be partially suppressed by increasing extracellular calcium, supporting that the primary defect in <i>unc-13</i><sup><i>C2A\u2212</i></sup> animals is the increased distance between UNC-13 and calcium entry site. Our results that complete loss of the N-terminus of UNC-13L dramatically alters the time constants of charge transfer are completely consistent with the recent report that the non-active zone localized UNC-13S or the N-terminus truncated UNC-13L mediate slow evoked release of SVs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). Together, our two studies demonstrate that the localization of UNC-13 at the active zone is a crucial determinant for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx accelerating SV release. The functional effect of differential localization of murine Munc13s has also been tested in the calyx of Held where Munc13-2/3 isoforms, which are much less localized in the active zone, are selectively involved in slowly releasing vesicles pool, while C<sub>2</sub>A domain-containing Munc13\u20131 is the dominant priming factor by electrophysiological recording (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

Comparing to the previously reported synapse CALI methods (<a href=\"#bib44a\">Marek and Davis, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65a\">Snellman et al., 2011</a>), the miniSOG mediated InSynC technology has the advantage to reversibly remove protein function in vivo without addition of exogenous cofactors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). The molecular basis of InSynC in wild type animals remains to be investigated, and likely involves dominant negative effects on the SV release apparatus containing miniSOG-tagged proteins. Our study here provides further evidence for the specificity and utility of this methodology. UNC-13L-miniSOG and UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG are differentially localized in presynaptic terminals. UNC-13L-miniSOG is likely to be associated with proximal SV release apparatus close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites, while UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG can interact with distal SV release apparatus. We find that inactivation of UNC-13L-miniSOG and UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>-miniSOG preferentially inhibited the fast phase and the slow phase of evoked release in wild type background, respectively. Moreover, the fact that animals can recover after CALI indicates significant level of protein turnover at synapses, suggesting possible applications of miniSOG-based optogenetic tools in investigating protein homeostasis in vivo and in situ."

Since the discovery of spontaneous release by Fatt and Katz (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fatt and Katz, 1952</a>), many studies have revealed that spontaneous release contributes to physiological processes. For example, spontaneous release regulates the initiation of action potential in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and firing rates in cerebellar interneurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carter and Regehr, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sharma and Vijayaraghavan, 2003</a>), influences dendritic spine morphology (<a href=\"#bib47\">McKinney et al., 1999</a>), inhibits local dendritic protein translation (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sutton et al., 2006</a>) and modulates homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aoto et al., 2008</a>). Several molecules such as Doc2b (<a href=\"#bib23\">Groffen et al., 2010</a>) and Vti1a (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ramirez et al., 2012</a>) appear to function preferentially in spontaneous release. However, the question of whether spontaneous release and evoked release utilize distinct SV populations remains difficult to resolve (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</a>). Studies using the similar preparations and measurements often reach different conclusions (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Groemer and Klingauf, 2007</a>). We find that removing C<sub>2</sub>A domain, as in <i>unc-13(n2609)</i> animals, specifically reduces spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release to about 50% of wild type animals, and suppresses the increased spontaneous release in <i>cpx-1(null)</i> mutants. The reduced tonic release in <i>unc-13(n2609) cpx-1(null)</i> is accompanied with a noticeably enhanced fast phase of evoked release. CALI of UNC-13L shows a strong effect of the active zone localized UNC-13L in spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release, but not slow phase. In contrast, UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup> shows diffuse distribution and accounts for an enhanced slow phase of evoked release, and rescues the spontaneous release defect of <i>unc-13(null)</i> to a similar level to that of UNC-13L<sup>C2A\u2212</sup>. These results suggest that SVs associated with diffused UNC-13L<sup>N\u2212</sup>, the majority of which may be positioned distally from the active zone, mainly undergo evoked release with slow kinetics, and may not contribute to spontaneous release. Our data are generally consistent with the idea that spontaneous release and evoked release use the same pool of SVs, and further suggest that at the <i>C. elegans</i> cholinergic NMJs SV populations involved in spontaneous release and the fast phase of evoked release may likely reside at regions proximal to the active zone (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

The diameter of illumination area is 5.8 cm to cover the entire surface of plates. The light intensity was measured to be 2.07 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> with a power sensor D10MM connected to an Optical Power Meter PM50 (Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey, US). Animals were exposed to 1 Hz pulsed blue light for 12 min to avoid high heat accumulation on plates (<a href=\"#bib54\">Qi et al., 2012</a>). The frequency of pulsed light is controlled by TTL signals provided with PASCO digital function generator PI-9587C (Roseville, California, US). Before the locomotion or convulsion measurement, worms were transferred back to normal OP50 seeded NGM plates for recovery for around 5\u201310 min after blue light treatment."

Then frozen worms were freeze substituted in the Leica EM AFS2 system with 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone for 4 days at \u221290\u00b0C and 16 hr at \u221220\u00b0C. After infiltration and embedding in Durcupan ACM resin blocks were polymerized at 60\u00b0C for 48 hr. Serial sections of 33 nm thicknesses were collected using the ultramicrotome Leica ULTRACUT UCT and stained for 5 min in 2.5% uranyl acetate in 70% methanol, followed after washing by 3 min in Reynold\u2019s lead citrate. All images of synapses with density from ventral nerve cord were obtained on a JEOL-1200 EX transmission electron microscope using Gatan 4 MP digital camera and DigitalMicrograph acquisition software. Distances from the edge of the dense projection to all docked vesicles along membrane were measured using ImageJ software. The distance from the dense projection to each docked vesicle was sorted into 33 nm bins. The number of vesicles in each bin was divided by the number of profiles to yield an average number of vesicles per profile in each bin to generate the histogram of docked vesicles. Only vesicles in profiles containing a dense projection were included. The histogram of docked synaptic vesicles was integrated and normalized to generate the accumulative fraction. Each contiguous set of serial profiles containing a dense projection was considered as a single data point, that is a synapse. The number of docked vesicles in specific regions (&lt;165 nm, &lt;231 nm, 232\u2013330 nm and &gt;330 nm) within each such set was divided by the number of profiles in the set, resulting in a number of docked vesicles per profile for that set. The mean and SEM of all data points within each genotype was determined and used to calculate p values in two-tailed Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test."

Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-UNC-10/RIM (RIM2-s from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hadwiger et al., 2010</a>) at 1:3 dilution, rabbit anti-UNC-13 Rab598 at 1:35 ratio (gift from James Rand) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kohn et al., 2000</a>), rabbit anti-ELKS-1 Rb237 at 1:200 (gift from Michael Nonet) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deken et al., 2005</a>) and rabbit anti-GFP (A11122 from Invitrogen, CA) at 1:500. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (A11001), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (A11012), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (A11005) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (A11008) from Invitrogen, and used at 1:2000 dilution. Confocal images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 510 with 488 nm and 594 nm lasers. Laser output was set to 40% and transmission was optimized for detection and minimum bleed-through. Single 0.5 \u00b5m confocal planes were captured, merged using LSM software and exported as lsm file. To compare the correlation of signals from two channels, signals in each channel were separated with MetaMorph (Sunnyvale, CA) and exported as TIFF file. After thresholds were set, pixel-by-pixel intensity correlation analysis was performed and plotted automatically by Metamorph between two channels in the same animal (paired correlation). Since some fluorescence overlapping could have arisen by chance, the images from green and red channels were shuffled to determine green-red correlations between animals (shuffled correlation). In all cases, the shuffled correlation coefficient was nearly zero, confirming that the measured paired correlation is not due to chance. To calculate the distance from the center of a punctum in one channel to the center of the nearest punctum in another channel, average fluorescence intensities in six or eight-pixel wide segment regions along a line drawn down the dorsal nerve cord (DNC) were calculated by MetaMorph and plotted against the pixel position along the scan-line in IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The peaks of each channel signal above the threshold were automatically found in IGOR, which representing the center of puncta. To determine the threshold, the lowest non-zero point of a given signal trace in the region without punctum fluorescence was identified in IGOR. The standard deviation (SD) of the signal trace within 600 nm region with the lowest non-zero point as the center was calculated. The threshold was initially set as the value of 3.5-fold of SD plus the lowest non-zero value. If needed, the threshold was then manually adjusted to include all peaks from fluorescence puncta for the analysis. For each peak of RIM signal, the nearest peak from another channel with 800 nm was identified and the distance between the two peaks along scan-line was calculated."

The extracellular calcium concentration is otherwise indicated if it is not 2 mM. Conventional whole-cell recordings from muscle cells were performed at 20\u00b0C with 2\u20133 M\u03a9 pipettes. An EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier was used together with the Patchmaster software package (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany). Tonic EPSCs were recorded at \u221260 mV. For record evoked EPSCs, a second glass pipet filled with bath solutions was put on the ventral nerve cord as stimulating electrode. The stimulating electrode gently touched the anterior region of ventral nerve cord to form loose patch configuration, which is around 1 muscle distance from recording pipets. A 0.5 ms, 85 \u03bcA square current pulse was generated by the isolated stimulator (WPI A320RC, Sarasota, FL) as stimulus to obtain the maximal responses. For RRP depletion, the 0.5 M sucrose in bath solution was applied to ventral nerve cord near the recorded muscles by Picospritzer with 8 psi for 7 s. Under this prolonged stimulation protocol, we could observe the current decay over the stimulation window. The sucrose-evoked responses have been compensated for the basal activities by subtracting basal line current level prior to sucrose application. For miniSOG mediated CALI, illumination (15 or 30 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was provided with a Sutter Instrument Lambda LS fitted with a Lamda 10\u20132 filter wheel for shuttering (Novato, CA). The excitation light was filtered with an eGFP filter set with 480 nm excitation (Chroma N41012; Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) and focused on the specimen with a 63 \u00d7 water immersion objective (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). Light intensity was measured with a calibrated photometer with an integrating sphere detector (International Light Technologies, Newburyport, MA). A glass slide with a semi-spherical lens containing a water drop was placed under the objective and was used to direct the light into the integrating sphere. The area of illumination was measured with a stage micrometer for the calculation of illumination intensity. The 2\u20133 min continuous blue light was illuminated on the prep including the ventral nerve cord and recorded muscle for miniSOG-mediated CALI. All current traces were imported to IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) for further analysis. The cumulative transferred charge of eEPSC was integrated over 50 ms after the electrical stimulation. The charge trace was fitted with a following double-exponential function to derive the time constant (\u03c4) and size (<i>A</i>) of each component:"

Specifically, they evaluate the contribution of a specific domain (C<sub>2</sub>A) of UNC-13 and test the hypothesis that the C<sub>2</sub>A domain helps localize synaptic vesicles near calcium channels at synaptic active zones. The authors show a mild change in the distribution of UNC-13 proteins that either lack the C<sub>2</sub>A domain or have an early stop in the C<sub>2</sub>A domain, and argue that an increased distance from calcium channels, and thus a lower concentration in intracellular calcium, changes release probability. This is a reasonable conclusion given the non-linear dependence of vesicle fusion on intracellular concentration of calcium, but the authors need to more firmly rule out alternative possibilities. Three reviewers agree that this work is suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i> and that the recent acceptance of related work will not preclude publication of this work at <i>eLife</i> since the two studies were independently conceived and submitted for publication in a similar time frame. The following issues should be addressed:"
