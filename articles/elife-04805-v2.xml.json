                    "text": "Plants generally respond to herbivore attack by increasing resistance and decreasing growth. This prioritization is achieved through the regulation of phytohormonal signaling networks. However, it remains unknown how this prioritization affects resistance against non-target herbivores. In this study, we identify <i>WRKY70</i> as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motifs and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>. WRKY70-dependent JA biosynthesis is required for proteinase inhibitor activation and resistance against <i>C. suppressalis</i>. In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>. Experiments with GA-deficient rice lines identify WRKY70-dependent GA signaling as the causal factor in <i>N. lugens</i> susceptibility. Our study shows that prioritizing defence over growth leads to a significant resistance trade-off with important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of plant immunity."

This prioritization is achieved through the regulation of phytohormonal signaling networks. However, it remains unknown how this prioritization affects resistance against non-target herbivores. In this study, we identify <i>WRKY70</i> as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motifs and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>. WRKY70-dependent JA biosynthesis is required for proteinase inhibitor activation and resistance against <i>C. suppressalis</i>. In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>. Experiments with GA-deficient rice lines identify WRKY70-dependent GA signaling as the causal factor in <i>N. lugens</i> susceptibility. Our study shows that prioritizing defence over growth leads to a significant resistance trade-off with important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of plant immunity."

Li et al. searched for a transcription factor in rice plants that was specifically triggered in response to an attack by the caterpillars of a moth called the rice striped stem borer. This search identified a protein called WRKY70 as a transcription factor that prioritizes defense overgrowth. WRKY70 achieves this by increasing the levels of a defensive plant hormone (called jasmonic acid) while reducing the levels of a growth hormone (called gibberellin). Further experiments show that the increase in jasmonic acid production is required to activate the enzyme inhibitors and for resistance against these caterpillars."

Further experiments revealed that this is due to the reduced levels of gibberillin. These findings show that while prioritizing defense overgrowth is effective against some insect herbivores, it comes with a cost as it makes the plants more susceptible to attack by other herbivores. This trade-off has important implications for both the evolution of plant immunity, and efforts to exploit plant immunity to help protect crops from herbivore attack."

They can specifically perceive attackers and respond to them by activating defence-related signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and hormone signaling, leading to the induction of numerous defence-related genes and defence compounds as well as plant resistance (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bonaventure et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Erb et al., 2012</a>). Jasmonic acid (JA)-, salicylic acid (SA)-, and ethylene (ET)-mediated signaling play a central role in induced resistance to herbivores (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Qi et al., 2011</a>)."

Through silencing defence-related genes, a direct negative link between defence and growth was demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zavala and Baldwin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Meldau et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that plants actively prioritize defence over growth. Defence prioritization and the associated growth trade-offs are regulated by crosstalk between plant hormones (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schwachtje et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stanton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huot et al., 2014</a>). DELLA proteins for instance, which typically suppress gibberellin (GA) signaling, can physically interact with the JA pathway repressor JAZ proteins, thereby resulting in mutual suppression (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, SA has been reported to inhibit the expression of TIR1/ABF F-box genes, thereby leading to stabilization of AUX/IAA repressor proteins and decreasing auxin signaling (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). Conversely, auxin signaling can reduce SA biosynthesis and thereby render plants more susceptible to pathogens (<a href=\"#bib33\">Robert\u2013Seilaniantz et al., 2011</a>). Compared to the impact of defence-related hormones, little is known about the impact of growth-related hormones on herbivore resistance and potential resistance trade-offs that may emanate from prioritizing defence over growth through hormonal regulation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2012</a>)."

The best-studied TFs involved in plant\u2013insect interactions are MYCs, WRKYs, MYBs, and ERFs. AtMYC2 in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, for example, was reported to act downstream of JA and to regulate JA-dependent herbivore resistance (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dombrecht et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 were shown to regulate the production of toxic glucosinolates via a direct transcriptional activation of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schweizer et al., 2013</a>). In <i>Nicotiana attenuata,</i> a R2R3-type MYB TF (<i>NaMYB8</i>) was found to modulate the accumulation of phenylpropanoid\u2013polyamine conjugates, which are essential for defence against herbivores (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaur et al., 2010</a>). In rice, an EAR-motif-containing ERF TF (<i>OsERF3</i>) functions as an early component upstream of MAPK signaling and modulates JA, SA, ET, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels as well as plant resistance to rice herbivores (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2011</a>). Also, several WRKYs, such as rice OsWRKY89, wheat TaWRKY53, <i>Arabidopsis</i> AtWRKY72, and tomato SIWRKY70 and SIWRKY72, have been directly associated with defence against herbivores (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattarai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Van Eck et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Atamian et al., 2012</a>). NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6 in <i>N. attenuata</i> have been shown to modulate elicited JA and JA-Ile/-Leu levels and thus mediate herbivory-induced defence responses (<a href=\"#bib38\">Skibbe et al., 2008</a>). Identifying and manipulating TFs that are involved in defence prioritization would make it possible to assess the biological impact of herbivore-induced growth suppression. Yet, to date, such an approach has not been taken. Consequently, our understanding of the consequences of defence prioritization for plant resistance has remained limited."

To determine the DNA-binding activity of OsWRKY70, a His-tagged protein was produced in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and its W-box binding ability was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) as described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chujo et al., 2007</a>). In the presence of the oligonucleotide probe BS65 containing two W-box sequences and a WRKY70 recombinant protein, specific protein-DNA complexes with reduced migration were present in the EMSA assays (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The DNA-binding specificity was confirmed in a competition experiment using a 250-fold excess of the unlabeled probe BS65 as a competitor, for which no binding complexes were detected. When the W-box in BS65 was mutated from TTGACC to TCCTAC (mBS65), the binding complexes also disappeared. These results indicated that the recombinant OsWRKY70 protein specifically binds to the conserved W-box in the synthesized probe. To investigate whether OsWRKY70 has transcriptional activation activity, we fused the full-length <i>OsWRKY70</i> ORF in-frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the pGBKT7 vector and transformed it into yeast. The yeast transformed with pGBKT7 or pGBKT7-OsWRKY70 was plated on SD medium (\u2212Trp) containing X-\u03b1-gal. After 12 hr at 30\u00b0C, the pGBKT7-OsWRKY70 transformant yeast colonies turned blue. In contrast, the pGBKT7 empty transformant yeast colonies remained white (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). OsWRKY70 is therefore likely functioning as a transcriptional activator in the yeast system. We found that the promoter region of WRKY70 contains four W-boxes, three reverse W-boxes (AGTCAA at \u221282 to \u221277, AGTCAA at \u221256 to \u221251, and GGTCAA at \u221249 to \u221244), and one forward W-box (TTGACC at \u221262 to \u221257), upstream of the transcription start site (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). To investigate if WRKY70 regulates its own expression, we first performed an EMSA assay by using the minimal promoter region of WRKY70 (86 bp upstream of transcription start site) as a probe. WRKY70-His can bind to this fragment, while adding 250-fold unlabeled probe resulted in no WRKY70-DNA complex (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Using WRKY70 promoter:<i>GUS</i> as a reporter and 35S: <i>WRKY70-GFP</i>, 35S:<i>GFP</i> as effectors expressed transiently in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, we found that WRKY70-GFP significantly increased the GUS activities compared to GFP alone, suggesting that WRKY70 can self-activate its transcription (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

                                "text": "MAPK proteins can specifically recognize the D domain found in some group I-type WRKYs and specifically phosphorylate the Ser residues of Group I SP clusters (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ishihama et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mao et al., 2011</a>). The D domain is a cluster of basic residues upstream of the LxL motif ([K/R]1\u20132-x2\u20136-[L/I]-x-[L/I]) and has been reported in some WRKYs to play an important role in determining the selectivity of interacting MAPKs and phosphorylation patterns (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ishihama et al., 2011</a>). OsWRKY70 has four SP clusters in the N-terminal region (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) but has no D domains. We hypothesized that the D domain-deficient OsWRKY70 may nevertheless interact with the MAPKs, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, the homologs of AtMPK3 and AtMPK6 in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and WIPK and SIPK in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, respectively, all of which are involved in plant defence responses (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2011</a>). We used a GST pull-down assay to analyse the interaction between OsWRKY70 and OsMPK3 or OsMPK6 in vitro. OsWRKY70-His was pulled down strongly by GST-MPK3 and mildly by GST-MPK6, suggesting that OsWRKY70 can interact with both OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, with the OsWRKY70\u2013OsMPK3 interaction being more efficient than the OsWRKY70\u2013OsMPK6 interaction in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In vivo, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to confirm the interaction. Fluorescence was observed when nYFP-OsWRKY70 was co-injected with OsMPK3-cYFP or OsMPK6-cYFP, and the signals were in the nuclear compartment according to 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. No fluorescence was observed when nYFP-OsWRKY70 was co-expressed with unfused cYFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 physically interact with OsWRKY70. In a next step, we investigated if OsWRKY70 is phosphorylated by OsMPK3 or OsMPK6. We used OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup>, a constitutively active form of OsMKK4, to activate recombinant OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 and then exposed them to OsWRKY70. The result showed that OsWRKY70 can be phosphorylated by both OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Moreover, an EMSA assay revealed that phosphorylation did not alter the W-box-binding activity of OsWRKY70 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We also investigated if phosphorylation enhances the transactivation activity of OsWRKY70 using <i>N. benthamiana</i> as a transient expression system (<a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2014</a>). As the constitutive expression of OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup> induces HR-like cell death in tobacco plants, we used an estradiol-inducible system of OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ishihama et al., 2011</a>). Given that OsWRKY70 can auto-activate its promoter (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), we used WRKY70 promoter:<i>GUS</i> as a reporter and 35S:<i>WRKY70-GFP</i>, 35S:<i>OsMPK3-YFP</i>, 35S:<i>OsMPK6-YFP</i> as effectors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). GUS activity was higher in OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup>-MPK3-OsWRKY70 or OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup>-MPK6-OsWRKY70 co-expressed leaves than leaves expressing OsWRKY70 alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These results show that phosphorylation of OsWRKY70 can increase transactivation activity, but not W-box binding activity, of OsWRKY70."

                                "text": "To determine the role of OsWRKY70 in herbivore-induced defence responses, we constructed <i>OsWRKY70</i> overexpression and knockdown lines using <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> mediated transformation. Through GUS staining and hygromycin resistance selection, we obtained two homozygous, single-insertion <i>OsWRKY70</i>-silenced lines (irWRKY70-7 and irWRKY70-8) and two overexpression lines (oeWRKY70-8 and oeWRKY70-17; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>OsWRKY70</i> overexpression resulted in dwarfed plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that OsWRKY70 is a negative growth regulator. To reduce phenotypic effects (see below), we also created hemizygous overexpressing lines (hemi-oeWRKY70-8 and hemi-oeWRKY70-17) whose phenotype was weaker but still visible in both nutrient solution and soil (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). SSB-induced transcript levels of <i>OsWRKY70</i> in irWRKY70-7 and irWRKY70-8 were suppressed by more than 80% compared to WT plants at 1 hr after SSB feeding. Conversely, <i>OsWRKY70</i> transcript levels were increased about 14-fold in hemi-oeWRKY70-8 and hemi-oeWRKY70-17 plants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Transcriptional profiling of the <i>OsWRKY70</i>-homologous genes <i>OsWRKY24</i> and <i>OsWRKY53</i> confirmed that gene targeting was specific for <i>OsWRKY70</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). In soil, the hemi-oeWRKY70 lines displayed dark green leaves and delayed flowering, similar to known GA-deficient mutants (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sakamoto et al., 2004</a>). Plant height was reduced by 29% and 27%, and root length by 49% and 30%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). In contrast, the irWRKY70 lines grew similar to WT plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), except for a slight increase in root length. To test whether <i>OsWRKY70</i> acts as a negative regulator of GA biosynthesis, we profiled GA levels in the different lines using HPLC/MS\u2013MS. The experiment revealed that GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>7</sub>, GA<sub>19</sub>, GA<sub>20</sub>, GA<sub>24</sub>, and GA<sub>53</sub> levels were significantly lower in hemi-oeWRKY70 lines (hemi-oeWRKY70-8 and hemi-oeWRKY70-17) than in WT plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Moreover, the growth phenotype of the oeWRKY70 seedlings was successfully restored to WT levels when they were grown on 1/2 MS plates with GA<sub>3</sub> at a concentration of 0.01 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Consistently, the GA biosynthesis gene GA 20 oxidase (<i>GA20ox7</i>) was significantly down-regulated in the hemi-oeWRKY70-8 lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results suggest that OsWRKY70 regulates plant growth through GA biosynthesis."

JA levels in the irWRKY70 lines were significantly decreased compared with WT plants upon SSB attack, while they were increased in the overexpressing lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In accordance with this data <i>OsWRKY70</i> positively regulated SSB-induced transcript levels of the JA-biosynthesis genes <i>OsHI-LOX</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>) and <i>OsAOS2</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mei et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). The accumulation of ethylene was similar in the irWRKY70 lines and WT plants, but the levels were significantly elevated in hemi-oeWRKY70 lines after SSB infestation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Consistent with this result, transcript levels of the ethylene biosynthesis gene <i>OsACS2</i> were similar in irWRKY70 and WT plants when infested by SSB, but were much higher in the induced hemi-oeWRKY70 lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). WT plants and ir<i>WRKY70</i> lines had nearly identical constitutive and SSB-induced SA levels, whereas the SA levels in the hemi-oe<i>WRKY70</i> lines were significantly lower than in WT plants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Isochorismate synthase (ICS) is a key enzyme in plant SA biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>). We examined the <i>OsICS1</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib12\">Du et al., 2009</a>) in rice after SSB infestation and found that the <i>OsICS1</i> transcriptional level was significantly decreased in the hemi-oe<i>WRKY70</i> lines compared with WT plants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that OsWRKY70 positively regulates SSB-induced JA- and ET levels but negatively regulates SA levels. To explore the notion that OsWRKY70 may be an upstream regulator of the JA and ET pathways, we investigated the expression of <i>OsWRKY70</i> in transgenic plants with impaired JA and ET signaling. We used an antisense <i>OsHI-LOX</i> line (as<i>-lox</i>), which produces 50% less JA upon SSB infestation than WT plants (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>), and an antisense-<i>ACS2</i> line (as<i>-acs</i>), which produces significantly less SSB-elicited ET than WT plants (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2011</a>). The experiments revealed that the levels of constitutive and SSB-induced <i>OsWRKY70</i> transcripts in as<i>-lox</i> and as<i>-acs</i> plants were the same as those in WT plants over the first 60 min of infestation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), suggesting that OsWRKY70 functions upstream of JA and ET signaling. To fully demonstrate that OsWRKY70 acts upstream of JA and ET, additional experiments with null-mutants would be required."

Thus, we investigated the influence of OsWRKY70 on TrypPI activity and SSB performance. TrypPI activity was suppressed in the irWRKY70 lines and enhanced in the hemi-oeWRKY70 lines compared with WT plants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). As expected, SSB caterpillars gained more mass on irWRKY70-7 and irWRKY70-8 plants and less mass on the overexpressing lines compared to those fed on WT plants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). IrWRKY70 lines were more severely damaged by SSB than the WT plants, whereas the hemi-oeWRKY70 lines were less damaged (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). To determine whether the impaired SSB resistance and defences in the irWRKY70 lines is due to lower JA levels, we complemented irWRKY70 plants with JA and examined SSB-induced TrypPI production and SSB performance. JA treatment attenuated the difference in TrypPI levels between WT plants and the irWRKY70 lines (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Moreover, SSB larvae fed on JA-treated irWRKY70 lines gained a similar amount of weight to those fed on equally treated WT plants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The complete restoration of plant resistance to SSB and elicited accumulation of TrypPIs in irWRKY70 by exogenous JA application suggests that OsWRKY70 mediates rice-resistance to SSB through JA signaling."

When irWRKY70 lines and WT plants were exposed to a BPH colony, adult females preferred feeding on the WT rather than the irWRKY70 lines (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). Similarly, BPH adult females laid more eggs on WT plants than irWRKY70 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, inserts). In accordance with these findings, BPH adult females were found more often on hemi-oeWRKY70 lines than on WT plants and laid more eggs on the former than on the latter (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). Moreover, BPH nymphs fed on the irWRKY70 lines had lower survival rates than those fed on WT plants; in contrast, BPH nymphs fed on the hemi-oeWRKY70 lines had higher survival rates (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>), showing that OsWRKY70 negatively regulates rice BPH resistance. Based on the signaling profiles showing that OsWRKY70 negatively regulates GAs, we hypothesized that the down regulation of GAs may be responsible for the enhanced susceptibility to BPH. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to explore the influence of OsWRKY70 dependent GA on BPH. First, we used a GA-deficient mutant, <i>sd-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Spielmeyer et al., 2002</a>), and a GA-excessive mutant, <i>eui</i> (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhu et al., 2006</a>), to test the importance of GA for BPH resistance. The BPH female adults preferred feeding and ovipositing on <i>sd-1</i> rather than the WT (ZH11) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), whereas the <i>eui</i> lines repelled BPH feeding compared with WT plants and did not affect BPH oviposition (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The BPH nymph mortality was significant higher on the <i>eui</i> mutant compared with WT plants, but the <i>sd-1</i> mutant did not influence BPH nymph performance (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Second, we complemented the hemi-oeWRKY70 lines with GA<sub>3</sub> at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM. This treatment restored BPH resistance to WT levels: BPH female adults feeding and ovipositing showed no preference between the WT and GA<sub>3</sub>-treated hemi-oeWRKY70 lines (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D,E</a>), and the BPH nymph survival rate was the same on GA<sub>3</sub>-treated hemi-oeWRKY70 and WT plants (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that OsWRKY70 negatively regulates BPH resistance through GA signaling."

This indirect additional cost of defence may lead to the evolution of divergent, herbivore-community dependent plant resistance strategies in nature and may significantly constrain efforts to breed herbivore-resistant plants. It has been well documented that there are trade-offs between plant growth and defence (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zavala and Baldwin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Meldau et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). Resource availability, competition, plant ontogeny, and herbivory can influence the allocation of resources to growth and defence (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stamp, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boege and Marquis, 2005</a>). In nature, defence prioritization is complicated by the fact that plants are often attacked simultaneously by multiple herbivore species, which have different sensitivities to various defence strategies, leading to resistance trade-offs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stam et al., 2014</a>). For example, leaf-chewing caterpillars were found to perform better on <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants that are attacked by phloem-sucking aphids and <i>vice versa</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Soler et al., 2012</a>). Given that herbivory is an important driving force for the evolution of plant defence (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agrawal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Z\u00fcst et al., 2012</a>), understanding growth/defence and resistance trade-offs is important to predict and understand selection patterns in nature. Our study reveals that growth/defence and resistance trade-offs can emanate from the same mechanistic basis. From a plant's perspective, this suggests that reducing growth to support defence is even more costly than previously anticipated. From an agricultural point of view, this result indicates that it may be problematic to breed resistant varieties that rely on induced defence, as these plants may suffer from both a depression in growth and increased susceptibility to non-target herbivores."

                        "text": "The discovery and manipulation of a TF that directly regulates defence prioritization allows us to draw a detailed picture of the mechanisms that underlie defence prioritization in rice. OsWRKY70 is rapidly induced following mechanical wounding and SSB feeding, but not following attack by a piercing sucking herbivore. Despite a lacking D-domain, OsWRKY70 interacts with and is regulated by two MAP-kinases, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). It has been well documented that Group I-type WRKY TFs can be phosphorylated by MAPKs and that the SP clusters are the phosphorylating sites (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ishihama and Yoshioka, 2012</a>). We found that both OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 phosphorylate OsWRKY70, which in turn increased the transactivation activity of OsWRKY70 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Moreover, OsWRKY70 can auto-regulate itself (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given that autoregulation and cross-regulation are common features of WRKY action (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ishihama and Yoshioka, 2012</a>), OsWRKY70 transcript levels are likely reduced in OsMPK3 and 6 silenced lines because of the reduction in phosphorylated WRKY70 and other WRKYs, which decreases WRKY activity and thereby reduce OsWRKY70 transcript levels. Phytohormones on the other hand do not regulate OsWRKY70. Combined with its capacity to bind to W-box sequences and to act as transcriptional activator, this places OsWRKY70 at the interface between early recognition and signaling and hormonal regulation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rushton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Erb et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, silencing and over-expression of <i>OsWRKY70</i> demonstrates its central role in regulating defence and growth through JA, ET, SA, and GA signaling, which enables OsWRKY70 to reduce plant growth and increases defence upon herbivore attack. In other plant systems, WRKYs have also been reported to play important roles in the regulation of transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant growth, development, and stress responses at different levels, including upstream and downstream of protein kinases and hormones (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rushton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ishihama et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6, the homologs of OsWRKY70 in <i>N. attenuata</i>, for instance, have been reported to function downstream of NaSIPK and NaWIPK and upstream of JA biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Skibbe et al., 2008</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, AtWRKY33, the homolog of OsWRKY70 is phosphorylated by AtMPK3/MPK6 and can affect ET synthesis by directly binding promoter region of <i>ACS2</i> and <i>ACS6</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Another rice WRKY, OsWRKY24 has been reported to repress GA signaling in rice aleurone cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>)."

First, it may directly bind to genes that are involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, OsWRKY70 positively modulated the transcript levels of the JA- and ET-synthesis genes <i>OsHI-LOX</i>, <i>OsAOS2</i>, and <i>OsACS2</i>, and negatively regulated the transcripts of the SA- and GA-biosynthesis genes <i>OsICS1</i> and <i>OsGA20ox7</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5B,C,E,G</a>). The existence of W-box or W-box like motifs in the promoters of these genes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) provides additional indirect evidence for their interaction with OsWRKY70. Second, OsWRKY may regulate growth and defence through indirect hormonal cross-talk. It has been reported that the JA-signaling pathway is connected to the GA-signaling pathway through COI1-JAZ1-DELLA-PIF complexes, resulting in mutual suppression. The activation of JA signaling inhibits GA-mediated plant growth, whereas the activation of the GA pathway inhibits JA-mediated plant defence (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, JA was found to inhibit GA biosynthesis via an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Heinrich et al., 2013</a>), and the GA-GID1-DELLA complex was found to positively regulate the production of SA (<a href=\"#bib30\">Navarro et al., 2008</a>). Thus, the observed phytohormone levels and associated phenotypes in the transgenic OsWRKY70 lines might be at least in part due to antagonistic and synergistic phytohormone crosstalk. It has also been reported that the absence of JA signaling enhances the sensitivity of plants to GAs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). In our experiments, the promotion of JA signaling in oeWRKY70 lines did not decrease the sensitivity of plants to GA<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, the dwarf phenotype of oeWRKY70 lines was completely restored by exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> at low concentrations of 0.01 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This suggests that the dwarf phenotype of oeWRKY70 lines is directly related to the low level of GAs and that the sensitivity of plants to GAs may be influenced by other <i>OsWRKY70</i>-mediated factors other than JA. Interestingly, irWRKY70 lines showed similar growth phenotypes to WT plants, indicating that GA levels are unlikely to be altered in irWRKY70 lines. This suggests an involvement of other factors, such as the homologs of OsWRKY70, OsWRKY24, and OsWRKY53, in the biosynthesis of GAs. Overall, the combination of direct regulation and indirect phytohormone crosstalk may explain how a single TF can act as a node in multiple signaling processes and integrate growth and defence responses."

                        "text": "Our experiments do not only connect OsWRKY70 with phytohormone signaling, but also illustrate how hormonal signaling affects resistance responses against different herbivores. In rice, it is well documented that TrypPIs are an effective JA-dependent defence against chewing herbivores, including SSB (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2011</a>). Here, we found that OsWRKY70 positively mediated the production of elicited JA and TrypPIs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7A</a>), which subsequently modulated resistance in rice to SSB (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>). Moreover, JA complementation of irWRKY70 lines, which had lower herbivore-elicited JA levels, completely restored TrypPI activity and SSB resistance compared to equally treated WT plants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). These data suggest that OsWRKY70-mediated resistance in rice to SSB is mainly due to its effect on the JA-signaling pathway. On the other hand, little is known so far about the role of GA in herbivore resistance against piercing-sucking insects. We found that GA<sub>3</sub> application restored BPH resistance in hemi-oeWRKY70 mutants (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>). Moreover, the GA-deficient mutant <i>sd-1</i> improved the performance of BPH, whereas the GA-excessive mutant <i>eui</i> decreased BPH performance (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>). These data demonstrate that the GA-signaling pathway plays an important role in modulating resistance in rice to BPH in addition to its regulation of plant growth. GA-modulated BPH resistance in rice may occur via two mechanisms. One is that GA directly regulates the BPH defence response. It has been reported that GA can positively modulate the pathogen-related <i>PBZ1</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tanaka et al., 2006</a>) and cell modification (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). The rigidity of the cell wall is important for resistance to BPH phloem-feeding. Moreover, GA can directly elicit the plant growth, which may enhance the tolerance of rice to BPH. Another possibility is that GA indirectly regulates BPH resistance by eliciting SA and ROS pathways, both of which have been reported to be involved in resistance of rice to BPH (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2011</a>), via GA-GID1-DELLA complex (<a href=\"#bib30\">Navarro et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alonso-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2009</a>). Thus far, several other elements of the rice defense signaling cascade, including JA (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>), OsERF3 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2011</a>), and ethylene (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lu et al., 2014</a>) have also been shown to have similar divergent effects on SSB and BPH, suggesting distinct resistance strategies of rice plants against these two herbivores. The main reason for the divergent signaling, response and resistance to the two herbivores might be their different feeding habits. Resistance mechanisms against phloem-feeders are well documented to differ substantially from mechanisms against chewing herbivores (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bostock, 2005</a>)."

When attacked by a chewing herbivore such as SSB, rice plants will recognize signals derived from the herbivore and activate OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. The activated OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 then elicit OsWRKY70, which subsequently activates the JA- and ET-signaling pathways, resulting in the production of defence compounds such as TrypPIs and an increase in plant resistance. Simultaneously, the activation of OsWRKY70 decreases the production of GAs, which inhibits plant growth and thus prioritizes defence overgrowth and leads to increased susceptibility to BPH. Through these results, our study illustrates that the transcriptional modulation of hormonal networks allows plants to mount an appropriate defence program. At the same time, however, prioritizing defence over growth leads to significant resistance trade-offs, which may constrain plant resistance breeding and favor the evolution of herbivore-specific responses in plants."

These findings are consistent with functions that have been reported previously for the corresponding <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (AtWRKY33) and <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> (NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6) genes, as well as with earlier publications showing negative interactions between jasmonate and gibberellin signaling. Prior to the current manuscript, no publication has put these findings together in such a specific manner to illustrate a tradeoff in plant defense and growth based on a single transcription factor. Nevertheless, the manuscript as a whole seems more incremental than ground-breaking."

Although binding to OsWRK70 is demonstrated, the authors do not show that OsWRK70 is phosphorylated. I had expected some sort of demonstration that OsMPK3 and/or OsMPK6 modify OsWRK70 activity. However, the main phenotype that is demonstrated is reduced OsWRK70 transcription in lines with expression-silenced OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. Does this mean that OsWRK70 up-regulates its own transcription after binding to OsMPK3 and OsMPK6? Does the OsWRK70 have a W-box motif? Or do the authors have some other explanation for the transcriptional up-regulation."

This seems to run counter to the overall hypothesis of a trade-off between plant defense and growth.

Why is the rice BPH interaction so different from the rice-SSB interaction?"

The presented data imply that OsWRKY70, which is induced upon SSB challenge but not by BPH, positively regulates JA/ET levels, and functions upstream of JA and ET signaling. Using two independent RNAi knock-down and OsWRKY70 overexpressor (OE) lines each, the authors show that OsWRKY70 positively regulates resistance to SSB but negatively affects resistance to BPH. The authors demonstrate that OsWRKY70 physically interacts with OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, and that silencing of these MAP kinases results in decreased levels of OsWRKY70 transcript. OsWRKY70-mediated SSB resistance very likely occurs via increased JA-dependent trypsin protease inhibitor activities. OsWRKY70 also appears to be a negative regulator of GA biosynthesis since OsWRKY70 OE lines show significantly lower GA levels when compared to wildtype plants. The negative regulation of BPH resistance by OsWRKY70 appears to be through GA signaling."

These plants (even the hemizygous lines used in the study) show strong pleiotropic affects. Thus, how valid some of uncovered molecular mechanisms are under normal physiological conditions remains an open question."

These findings are consistent with functions that have been reported previously for the corresponding</i> Arabidopsis thaliana <i>(AtWRKY33) and</i> Nicotiana attenuata <i>(NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6) genes, as well as with earlier publications showing negative interactions between jasmonate and gibberellin signaling.

The strength of our paper is the combination of mechanistic depth with biological relevance. On a mechanistic level, we show for the first time that a WRKY transcription factor directly regulates GA-JA crosstalk. On a biological level, we demonstrate that this regulation is responsible for growth defense trade-offs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prioritizing defense over growth against one herbivore also leads to an additional cost by reducing resistance against another herbivore. In our opinion, this is not an incremental finding, but a new mechanism for defense trade-offs in plants which has important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of induced resistance."

Like <i>N. benthamiana</i> NbWRKY8, <i>Arabiodpsis</i> AtWRKY33 and rice OsWRKY53, OsWRKY70 also has SP clusters (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Moreover, OsWRKY70 contains W-boxes in its promoter region and OsWRKY70 can auto-regulate its expression by binding its own promoter (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, OsWRKY70 transcript levels are likely reduced in OsMAPK3 and 6 silenced lines because of the reduction in phosphorylated WRKY70 and other WRKYs, which decreases WRKY activity and thereby reduces OsWRKY70 transcript levels."

Second, we created both OsWRKY70 overexpressing and silenced lines. The silenced lines did not show any growth phenotype and therefore do not suffer from any growth-related limitations.
