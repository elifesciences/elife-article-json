Nevertheless, many pathogenic states are associated with protein misfolding, revealing in vivo limitations on quality control mechanisms. One contributor to these limitations is the physical characteristics of misfolded proteins, as exemplified by amyloids, which are largely resistant to clearance. However, other limitations imposed by the cellular environment are poorly understood. To identify cell-based restrictions on proteostasis capacity, we determined the mechanism by which thermal stress cures the [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>]/Sup35 prion. Remarkably, Sup35 amyloid is disassembled at elevated temperatures by the molecular chaperone Hsp104. This process requires Hsp104 engagement with heat-induced non-prion aggregates in late cell-cycle stage cells, which promotes its asymmetric retention and thereby effective activity. Thus, cell division imposes a potent limitation on proteostasis capacity that can be bypassed by the spatial engagement of a quality control factor."

Nevertheless, many pathogenic states are associated with protein misfolding, revealing in vivo limitations on quality control mechanisms. One contributor to these limitations is the physical characteristics of misfolded proteins, as exemplified by amyloids, which are largely resistant to clearance. However, other limitations imposed by the cellular environment are poorly understood. To identify cell-based restrictions on proteostasis capacity, we determined the mechanism by which thermal stress cures the [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>]/Sup35 prion. Remarkably, Sup35 amyloid is disassembled at elevated temperatures by the molecular chaperone Hsp104. This process requires Hsp104 engagement with heat-induced non-prion aggregates in late cell-cycle stage cells, which promotes its asymmetric retention and thereby effective activity. Thus, cell division imposes a potent limitation on proteostasis capacity that can be bypassed by the spatial engagement of a quality control factor."

The PQC network is tailored to buffer protein folding in a distinct homeostatic niche but can adapt when these buffering thresholds are exceeded by elevating the expression of PQC factors, including proteases and molecular chaperones, to clear accumulating misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Morimoto, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Powers et al., 2009</a>). In cases such as thermal stress, these corrections are sufficient to restore balance, but in others such as aging, misfolded proteins assemble into ordered amyloid aggregates, which persist and dramatically alter cellular physiology by inducing disease (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tuite and Serio, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Voisine et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). This proteostasis collapse has been linked to the unique ability of amyloids to incorporate and conformationally convert like protein to the misfolded state and to their high thermodynamic stability (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jahn and Radford, 2008</a>).

While these observations are often interpreted as evidence of amyloid resolution, existing protein has not been demonstrated to transition from an amyloid to a non-amyloid form in any of the studies. Instead, two correlations have been observed where the reduced proteotoxicity has been linked to a change in amyloid state. Either amyloid accumulation is enhanced by chaperone overexpression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Douglas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cushman-Nick et al., 2013</a>), or amyloid accumulation is reduced. In the few cases where the mechanism has been determined, the reduction in amyloid accumulation results from an inhibition of amyloid assembly by the overexpressed chaperone (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kobayashi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schaffar et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Shorter and Lindquist, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Winkler et al., 2012</a>).

In this study, we report that a transient thermal stress surprisingly leads to the complete disassembly of existing Sup35 amyloid. This process requires the accumulation of heat-induced non-prion protein aggregates in cells primarily at the later stages of the cell cycle. The engagement of Hsp104 with these substrates, and its inability to resolve them before cell division, leads to asymmetric retention of the chaperone in cells that experienced the thermal stress. As a result, Hsp104 accumulates to a level that is sufficient to resolve amyloid aggregates. Thus, the kinetics of substrate engagement by a PQC factor and its partitioning during cell division impose cell-based limitations on proteostasis capacity."

To test this possibility, we incubated a [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> culture at 40\u00b0C, returned the culture to 30\u00b0C in the presence of cycloheximide to repress new protein synthesis, and monitored the conversion of existing Sup35 from the amyloid [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>] state (i.e. SDS-resistant) to the non-amyloid [<i>psi</i><sup>\u2212</sup>] state (i.e. SDS-sensitive) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Serio et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Satpute-Krishnan and Serio, 2005</a>).

To determine if the prion curing resulting from this disassembly was mediated by Hsp104, we chemically inhibited this factor with guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) treatment or reduced its dosage by creating a heterozygous disruption in a diploid strain (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eaglestone et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jung and Masison, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Grimminger et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kummer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Tariq et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Zeymer et al., 2013</a>), and in both cases, [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing was reduced by more than 50% relative to the wild-type untreated strain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

Because [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> propagates more efficiently than [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup>, the former may be protected from curing at elevated temperature if the rate of Sup35 assembly continued to outpace the rate of its disassembly, a scenario that should be reversed by reducing the efficiency of [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> propagation. To test this idea, we subjected [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Strong</sup> diploid strains heterozygous for either a Sup35 mutant (G58D) or for a Sup35 disruption, which both reduce propagation efficiency (<a href=\"#bib13\">Derdowski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">DiSalvo et al., 2011</a>), to thermal stress.

One possibility is that the asymmetric localization of Hsp104, resulting from its engagement with heat-induced protein aggregates (<a href=\"#bib21\">Erjavec et al., 2007</a>), increases its accumulation in a subpopulation of cells beyond that which can be achieved by its transcriptional up-regulation. To test this possibility, we first monitored the partitioning of Hsp104-GFP during cell division following incubation at various temperatures using microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy. Starting with budded cells, mother cells accumulated \u223c60% of Hsp104-GFP following the completion of cell division at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, gray), which is comparable to the accumulation of untagged GFP expressed from the same promoter (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and thus likely reflects the volume differences between mother and daughter cells. This baseline asymmetry progressively increased as the temperature was increased to 37\u00b0C (\u223c65% retention), 37\u00b0C followed by 40\u00b0C (\u223c73% retention), and finally 40\u00b0C (\u223c75% retention; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, gray). Notably, both Ssa1-GFP and Sis1-GFP fusions also localized to cytoplasmic, and, in the case of Sis1, nuclear foci (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>), but neither was asymmetrically retained following incubation at 40\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), although their levels were elevated relative to 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) due to their enhanced expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus, curing efficiency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) correlates directly with the asymmetric retention of Hsp104 in cells at elevated temperature."

Mother cells, which experienced the elevated temperature and accumulated Hsp104 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), were more likely to be cured than their daughters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, note most data points fall below the diagonal), as predicted by our hypothesis. To more quantitatively correlate Hsp104-GFP accumulation with curing efficiency, we analyzed the distribution of Hsp104-GFP in a population of cells by flow cytometry. At 30\u00b0C, Hsp104-GFP fluorescence was distributed normally in the population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, dotted).

When these subpopulations were separated by FACS and analyzed for colony-based phenotype, the efficiency of curing correlated directly with the accumulation of Hsp104-GFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>).

One source of heterogeneity in the population was cell-cycle stage, as our experiments used asynchronous cultures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Thus, cell-based limitations must finely tune proteostasis capacity not only to control protein misfolding induced by stress but also to allow normal protein folding in the absence of these challenges (<a href=\"#bib55\">Morimoto, 2008</a>). Using the yeast prion [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>] as a model to understand the in vivo interactions between amyloid and PQC pathways, we have uncovered one such pathway. While [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> is mitotically stable at the normal growth temperature (\u223c3% loss) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Derkatch et al., 1996</a>), a transient sub-lethal thermal stress induces quantitative curing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) through the disassembly of existing Sup35 amyloid by Hsp104 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2 and 8</a>).

Rather, Hsp104 must engage heat-induced protein aggregates for a period that exceeds the time to the next cell division (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7, 8</a>). As a result, Hsp104 is asymmetrically localized to the cells that experienced the thermal stress (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 8</a>), and this increase in chaperone accumulation, along with its activity, promotes curing in the same cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 8</a>). Thus, chaperone spatial engagement, substrate processing dynamics, and partitioning during cell division represent cell based limitations on proteostasis capacity."

These foci include aggresomes, the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD), the juxtanuclear quality control compartment (JUNQ), StiF-inducible foci (StiF), and Q-bodies, the latter of which form under the mild thermal stress conditions employed in our studies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Johnston et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Erjavec et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Specht et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Malinovska et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Weisberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wolfe et al., 2013</a>).

Indeed, our observations reveal other cell-based limitations beyond chaperone partitioning. For example, in contrast to the proteostasis enhancement we observe following thermal stress in yeast, previous studies have linked the accumulation of protein aggregates to reduced proteostasis capacity in vivo (<a href=\"#bib4\">Broadley and Hartl, 2009</a>). In these cases, protein aggregates, including those resulting from oxidative damage with age or proteotoxic stresses, have been linked to reduced replicative lifespan, (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hernebring et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rujano et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Erjavec et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tessarz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Knorre et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Unal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Spokoini et al., 2012</a>) and, the presence of protein amyloids, such as polyglutamine-expanded proteins and other yeast prions, promote the misfolding of metastable proteins, interfere with proteolysis, reduce protein synthesis, inhibit endocytosis, and disrupt prion propagation through the sequestration of chaperones (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gidalevitz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Meriin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kirstein-Miles and Morimoto, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Park et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Yu et al., 2014</a>). A comparison of these studies with our work suggests that the dynamics of chaperone engagement with distinct substrates, rather than simply their presence, correlates with the impact of these interactions on proteostasis capacity. In the studies resulting in chaperone sequestration, proteotoxicity correlates with imbalances in the system imposed by harsh conditions and/or the unnaturally high expression of amyloidogenic proteins. In contrast, we detect no differences in Hsp104-GFP localization in [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>] and [<i>psi</i><sup>\u2212</sup>] strains expressing Sup35 at its endogenous level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, 30\u00b0C), and Sup35 amyloid can clearly be resolved at these native stoichiometries when the system is elevated to a distinct but accessible proteostatic niche (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, paralleling the studies in metazoans, [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>] can transition from a benign to a toxic state upon Sup35 overexpression (<a href=\"#bib83\">Ter-Avanesyan et al., 1993</a>), a condition that also induces Hsp70 co-localization (<a href=\"#bib94\">Winkler et al., 2012</a>).

For example, overexpression of Hsp104 alone, to the same level achieved here through asymmetric retention of this factor (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), also induces curing (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chernoff et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wegrzyn et al., 2001</a>). While it has been suggested that Hsp104 overexpression dissolves Sup35 amyloid in vivo, this interpretation is complicated by a lack of temporal resolution and the ability to monitor existing protein (<a href=\"#bib61\">Park et al., 2014</a>) and is inconsistent with the increase in the size of SDS-resistant Sup35 aggregates under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</a>). An alternative model, which is consistent with this biochemical evidence of Hsp104 inhibition, suggests that upon its overexpression, Hsp104 aberrantly and non-productively co-localizes with Sup35 amyloid (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chernoff et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bagriantsev et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Winkler et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, our studies indicate that Hsp104 overexpression within the context of a thermal stress transitions Sup35 amyloid from outside the buffering capacity of the proteostasis network to within its sphere of protection. Notably, Hsp104 co-localization with Sup35 amyloid varies based on its mode of overexpression (i.e. individual vs network up-regulation), again implicating substrate\u2013chaperone dynamics, rather than simply chaperone availability, in proteostasis capacity. Intriguingly, this interplay is distinct for individual PQC factors within the same cell, as thermal stress induces localization of Hsp104, Ssa1, and Sis1 to cytoplasmic foci, but only Hsp104 is asymmetrically retained upon cell division (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D, E</a>), suggesting an additional point of proteostasis regulation."

Our studies, therefore, raise the possibility that the proteostasis limitations that allow the accumulation of chronically misfolded proteins may be distinct in a native context and under conditions of their overexpression. Within this framework, our studies provide a proof-of-principle example to support the idea that proteostasis regulators, which are aimed at transitioning proteostasis landscapes to new thresholds, may be the most effective interventions into amyloidosis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lindquist and Kelly, 2011</a>)."

Cultures were maintained at an OD<sub>600</sub> of less that 0.5 at 30\u00b0C for at least 10 doublings to ensure exponential growth. Where indicated, cultures were then transferred to 37\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C for the specified period. Pretreatment of cultures at 37\u00b0C prior to shift to 40\u00b0C was for 30 min. To analyze colony color phenotype, aliquots of cultures were diluted in H<sub>2</sub>O as needed to ensure well-separated single colonies upon plating to solid YPD medium. After growth at 30\u00b0C, each colony was scored based on colony color phenotype: fully cured (completely red, [<i>psi</i><sup>\u2212</sup>]), sectored (part red and part white), or [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>] (completely white). Unless otherwise indicated, fully cured and sectored colonies were combined in the \u2018cured\u2019 category. For all colony counting assays, at least 150 colonies were counted for each experimental condition/timepoint. For the galactose-inducible Hsp104 experiments, cells were grown in rich YP medium containing 3% raffinose supplemented with 3% galactose during induction. \u03b1-factor and nocodazole arrests were performed in YPD liquid medium containing final concentrations of 5 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1-factor or 15 \u03bcg/ml nocodazole, respectively, for \u223c2 hr. Following confirmation of arrest based on cell morphology by bright-field microscopy, cultures were washed three times with medium containing 1 mM DMSO followed by one wash in YPD before resuspension for indicated manipulation. GdnHCl treatment was performed at 3 mM final concentration in liquid YPD, and for experiments involving recovery, cultures were washed three times with medium before resuspension in YPD for indicated manipulation."

The cycloheximide SDS-sensitivity assay was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">DiSalvo et al., 2011</a>) with the following modifications: 1) cultures were treated at the various experimental temperatures for 30 min prior to the addition of cycloheximide to allow for the induction of chaperone proteins, and 2) after cycloheximide treatment, cultures were incubated with shaking at 30\u00b0C for 2 hr before lysis and analysis. For the aggregation analysis, native lysates were prepared as described previously (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</a>). Lysates were pre-cleared for 1 min at 500\u00d7<i>g</i> and total protein content was quantified using the BioRad Bradford assay in triplicate. Lysates were subjected to 15,000\u00d7g centrifugation for 15 min, and pellets were washed with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.5) containing 2% NP-40 before being resuspended in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.5) and quantified again in triplicate using the Bradford assay. For the Hsp104 immunocapture, native lysates were prepared at 4\u00b0C in IP buffer (50 mM HEPES\u2013NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (2 mM PMSF, 5 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin, complete protease inhibitor tablets (Pierce, Rockford, IL), protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)). Lysates were pre-cleared for 1 min at 500\u00d7<i>g</i>, and then incubated for 1 hr with Protein G magnetic beads (NEB, Ipswich, MA) with nutation. Immunocapture was performed using Protein G magnetic beads and anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche, Switzerland). Beads were washed 4\u00d7 with IP buffer and 1\u00d7 with 50 mM HEPES\u2013NaOH (pH 7.5), and protein was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Co-captured proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by gel staining with Flamingo (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and fluorescent scanning on a Typhoon imager (GE Lifesciences, Marlborough, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by western blot for GFP."

This study provides evidence that the engagement of Hsp104 with heat-induced misfolded Sup35 aggregates enhances proteostasis capacity by increasing the accumulation of this factor, perhaps beyond the level attainable by changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), thereby enabling the disassembly of existing Sup35 amyloid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1, 4</a>), restoring homeostasis to the mother cell.

(Serio) have explored the mechanism of curing of Sup35 prion aggregates upon exposure of yeast to transient thermal stress to test a hypothesis that the cellular environment sets limits on protein quality control (PQC). The authors show that exposure of yeast (S. cerevisiae) at specific stages of the cell cycle to short periods of thermal stress leads to the disassembly of Sup35 amyloid, and propose that this is due to the spatial sequestration of Hsp104 in the mother cell rather than the result of overall elevated levels of Hsp104 or other chaperones. The sequestration of Hsp104 is correlated with the accumulation of heat-induced, non-prion aggregates upon thermal stress and the data suggest that the disassembly of Sup35 is more a function of amplification efficiency than thermodynamic stability. FACS experiments coupled with the use of two different cell-cycle inhibitors demonstrated that prion curing was highly dependent upon the cell-cycle stage."

An argument is made that it is the asymmetrical partitioning of Hsp104 by its association with thermal aggregates that leads to a sufficiently high concentration of Hsp104 to resolve Sup35 amyloids. What is this concentration, what is the nature and basis of the interaction? Will elevated levels of Hsp104 achieved using conditional systems or shield-based metastable DHFR achieve the same outcome? Finally, the effects of different temperature conditions are intriguing. What is the nature of the biophysical transformation of Sup35 in 30C cells compared to those exposed to 40C beyond that rather vague terminology of shift from SDS-resistant to SDS-sensitive?

Interestingly, this curing process depends upon an unprecedented spatiotemporal mechanism. Thus, asymmetric Hsp104 retention by heat induced, non-prion aggregates in late cell cycle-stage cells, leads to high enough Hsp104 levels to promote dissolution of Sup35 prions encoding weak [PSI+]. Upon recognizing this potential mechanism, the authors then cleverly tweak the system to enable curing of Sup35 prions that encode strong [PSI+]. Although Sup35 prion dissolution by Hsp104 is not very surprising per se, the spatiotemporal mechanism revealed by these studies is entirely novel and should interest a broad audience. Indeed, this paper will raise awareness that spatiotemporal mechanisms can have a profound impact on proteostasis and amyloid resolution. In my view, the study is high quality and is carefully conducted and controlled, and I do not have any issues with the experiments or data as presented. A limitation is that several conclusions are based upon correlative evidence, but it has already been shown in vitro that Hsp104 can rapidly dissolve Sup35 prions.

To address this point, we have added two new pieces of data to the manuscript. First, we demonstrate that Hsp104 co-localizes with a model substrate (firefly luciferase-mCherry), which denatures upon thermal stress and is reactivated in an Hsp104-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>; Parsell et al. 1994). Second, we demonstrate by immunocapture of Hsp104-GFP, SDS-PAGE and general protein staining, that Hsp104-GFP associates with a larger number of proteins upon thermal stress (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Importantly, the number of co-captured proteins increases with the severity of the stress (i.e. 40\u00b0C &gt; 37\u00b0C) and decreases with GdnHCl treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), which blocks Hsp104 activity. Thus, the engagement of Hsp104-GFP with heat-induced substrates parallels the efficiency of [<i>PSI</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>]<sup>Weak</sup> curing, which is increased at 40\u00b0C relative to 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a, b</a>) and is inhibited by treatment with GdnHCl (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), providing additional support for our model of prion curing."
