                    "text": "Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels constitutes a primary route of calcium entry in most cells. Orai1 forms the pore subunit of CRAC channels and Stim1 is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. Upon store-depletion, Stim1 translocates to domains of ER adjacent to the plasma membrane where it interacts with and clusters Orai1 hexamers to form the CRAC channel complex. Molecular steps enabling activation of SOCE via CRAC channel clusters remain incompletely defined. Here we identify an essential role of \u03b1-SNAP in mediating functional coupling of Stim1 and Orai1 molecules to activate SOCE. This role for \u03b1-SNAP is direct and independent of its known activity in NSF dependent SNARE complex disassembly. Importantly, Stim1-Orai1 clustering still occurs in the absence of \u03b1-SNAP but its inability to support SOCE reveals that a previously unsuspected molecular re-arrangement within CRAC channel clusters is necessary for SOCE."

                    "text": "Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels constitutes a primary route of calcium entry in most cells. Orai1 forms the pore subunit of CRAC channels and Stim1 is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. Upon store-depletion, Stim1 translocates to domains of ER adjacent to the plasma membrane where it interacts with and clusters Orai1 hexamers to form the CRAC channel complex. Molecular steps enabling activation of SOCE via CRAC channel clusters remain incompletely defined. Here we identify an essential role of \u03b1-SNAP in mediating functional coupling of Stim1 and Orai1 molecules to activate SOCE. This role for \u03b1-SNAP is direct and independent of its known activity in NSF dependent SNARE complex disassembly. Importantly, Stim1-Orai1 clustering still occurs in the absence of \u03b1-SNAP but its inability to support SOCE reveals that a previously unsuspected molecular re-arrangement within CRAC channel clusters is necessary for SOCE."

One of these candidates, a protein called \u03b1-SNAP that is found in the internal fluid of the cell, was identified as having a central role in the import of calcium ions into the cell. Further work showed that \u03b1-SNAP re-organizes the Stim and Orai proteins to produce working CRAC channels."

Store-operated calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels have been extensively studied for their role in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) regulated gene expression in lymphocytes and other cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lewis, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Crabtree and Olson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Feske et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Parekh and Putney, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Vig and Kinet, 2009</a>). Previously, genome-wide RNAi screens in <i>Drosophila</i> cell lines led to the identification of ER-resident STIMs as the store sensors and plasma membrane (PM) resident Orai/CRACMs as the pore forming subunit of CRAC channels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Liou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Feske et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Peinelt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Prakriya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yeromin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Vig et al., 2006a</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2006b</a>). Stim1, and its homolog Stim2, contain a calcium-sensing EF-hand like domain facing the ER lumen. Upon store-depletion, Stim1 oligomerizes and concentrates in regions of ER directly adjacent to the PM, frequently referred to as junctional ER (<a href=\"#bib18\">Liou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Stathopulos et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Liou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Luik et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Stathopulos et al., 2008</a>). While some factors involved in store-dependent and store-independent Stim1 clustering have been described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Honnappa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Smyth et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Srikanth et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Walsh et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Krapivinsky et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lewis, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Singaravelu et al., 2011</a>), little is known about the final steps in CRAC channel activation. For instance, Orai1 multimers are thought to diffuse freely until trapped by Stim1 clusters in the ER\u2013PM junctions, with active CRAC channels consisting of Orai1 hexamers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Penna et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Park et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Madl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Walsh et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hou et al., 2012</a>), however, it remains unexplored whether mere trapping of Orai1 by Stim1 in ER\u2013PM junctions is sufficient or additional molecular steps enable optimal activation of SOCE. We hypothesized that additional cytosolic proteins might be necessary to impart functionality to Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters that constitute the CRAC channel complex and adopted a candidate-based approach based on our earlier genome-wide RNAi screen (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vig et al., 2006b</a>)."

                        "text": "Here we identify a direct and unexpected role for \u03b1-SNAP in the activation of SOCE. \u03b1-SNAP is a cytosolic protein with tetra-tricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like helical domains that bridges N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF) to soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes to promote their disassembly and SNARE recycling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Clary et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chang et al., 2012</a>). We find that \u03b1-SNAP directly and independently binds Stim1 and Orai1 to regulate the function and molecular composition of Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters that form the CRAC channel complex. This role for \u03b1-SNAP in SOCE is independent of its conventional role in facilitating NSF mediated SNARE complex disassembly. Thus, we have identified a novel role for \u03b1-SNAP and our data define a new \u03b1-SNAP dependent step in the physiological activation of SOCE via CRAC channels."

                                "text": "To test our hypothesis that additional proteins are needed to facilitate SOCE under physiological conditions, we used \u223c200 to 500 base pair long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to deplete the expression of six genes that we previously identified as candidates in a genome-wide RNAi screen (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vig et al., 2006b</a>) in <i>Drosophila</i> Kc cells. We found that knockdown of soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) strongly reduces SOCE by day 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Given the almost complete inhibition of SOCE in SNAP deficient <i>Drosophila</i> cells, we hypothesized that SNAP might engage in novel, SOCE specific protein\u2013protein interactions that may or may not involve NSF and SNAREs. \u03b1- and \u03b2-SNAP are the two mammalian proteins most closely related to <i>Drosophila</i> SNAP (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). \u03b1-SNAP is ubiquitously expressed while \u03b2-SNAP expression is largely restricted to the brain. We depleted \u03b1-SNAP in HEK-293 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), Jurkat T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) using lentivirus-based RNAi constructs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and found SOCE to be strongly inhibited by day three compared to cells treated with control RNAi. By day five, depletion of \u03b1-SNAP caused cell rounding in adherent cell lines; we therefore restricted our analysis to adherent cells at early time-points. We confirmed the efficiency of \u03b1-SNAP knockdown for each experiment on western blots of whole cell lysates (WCLs) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and by immunostaining cells with anti-\u03b1-SNAP antibody (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Importantly, when we reconstituted \u03b1-SNAP deficient HEK 293 cells with an RNAi resistant version of \u03b1-SNAP we found that SOCE was largely restored (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Defective SOCE in \u03b1-SNAP deficient HEK 293 cells could also be restored by over-expressing \u03b2-SNAP (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). \u03b3-SNAP is a third SNAP protein widely expressed in mammalian tissues but is less similar to <i>Drosophila</i> SNAP and \u03b1-SNAP than \u03b2-SNAP (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). \u03b3-SNAP depletion failed to inhibit SOCE in HEK 293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) and \u03b3-SNAP over-expression did not compensate for \u03b1-SNAP depletion (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

We used inducible expression of a dominant negative NSF mutant, E329Q-NSF, which lacks the ATPase activity required for dissociating the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dalal et al., 2004</a>) and blocks transferrin flux through the endocytic pathway by 8 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

The N-terminal half of \u03b1-SNAP (1\u2013160 aa) or \u03b1-SNAP-NT is predicted to contain a hydrophobic loop along with three putative TPR domains and the C-terminal half (161\u2013295 aa) or \u03b1-SNAP-CT contains the fourth putative TPR domain (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rice and Brunger, 1999</a>).

To test this hypothesis and directly place \u03b1-SNAP in the molecular sequence of SOCE, we first asked whether the final molecular step of CAD domain mediated activation of SOCE via Orai1 is intact in \u03b1-SNAP depleted cells. To address this, we generated an inducible stable HEK 293 cell line, co-expressing Orai1 along with either full length Stim1 or just the soluble CAD domain of Stim1. As expected, \u03b1-SNAP depletion caused significant inhibition of SOCE in cells co-expressing full length Stim1 and Orai1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and 5D</a>). However, SOCE in cells co-expressing the cytosolic CAD fragment of Stim1 along with Orai1, although overall smaller, was resistant to \u03b1-SNAP depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E and 5F</a>). Similarly, basal calcium levels in cells co-expressing the cytosolic CAD fragment of Stim1 along with Orai1, although higher compared to WT HEK 293 cells, were unaffected by \u03b1-SNAP depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Importantly, the lack of effect of \u03b1-SNAP depletion on CAD mediated constitutive and SOCE conclusively rules out any possible unknown effects on membrane potential or membrane trafficking of other components contributing to the activation of SOCE. Taken together, these data demonstrate that \u03b1-SNAP directly binds specific domains within Stim1 and Orai1 to enable a molecular step that precedes CAD mediated activation of SOCE in cells expressing full length Stim1."

While the ability of Stim1 to oligomerize and translocate to the junctional ER upon store-depletion appeared normal in \u03b1-SNAP deficient cells, the size of Stim1-Orai1 clusters appeared larger (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We adopted a localized thresholding method to detect Stim1-Orai1 cluster boundaries (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), used it to quantify the size and intensity of individual Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters, and found that \u03b1-SNAP depletion increased the overall size of CRAC channel clusters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we first quantified the average intensity of CFP-Stim1 in individual Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters. We did not find an appreciable difference in the average intensity of CFP-Stim1 estimated from Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters in control or \u03b1-SNAP depleted, HEK 293 cells stably expressing CFP-Stim1 and Orai1-YFP (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data suggest that \u03b1-SNAP depletion does not affect the density of Stim1 in junctional clusters. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in the average Orai1-YFP intensity in \u03b1-SNAP depleted clusters (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), resulting in a significant decrease in the ratio of CFP (Stim1) to YFP (Orai1) across all CRAC channel clusters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) as well as in the majority of individual clusters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These changes and their inhibitory effect on SOCE (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) suggest that \u03b1-SNAP regulates an active molecular rearrangement within CRAC channel clusters that is necessary for obtaining optimal Stim1/Orai1 ratios required for the physiological activation of SOCE through CRAC channels. Indeed, two independent recent studies that experimentally manipulated Stim1:Orai1 ratios in junctional clusters showed that the amplitude of calcium selective CRAC currents correlates well with the ratio of Stim1 to Orai1 or CAD to Orai1 within CRAC channel complex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mcnally et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hoover and Lewis, 2011</a>)."

Remarkably, over-expression of \u03b1-SNAP enhanced SOCE beyond what is typically seen in cells stably co-expressing Stim1 and Orai1 (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Next, we examined the relative average intensities of CFP and YFP in junctional clusters of cells stably expressing CFP-Stim1, Orai1-YFP and transiently transfected with \u03b1-SNAP or empty vector.

Upon store-depletion, \u03b1-SNAP but not its usual binding partner, NSF, co-localizes with Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters. Secondly, dominant inhibition of NSF does not inhibit SOCE. \u03b1-SNAP depletion disrupts SOCE without affecting the resting and stimulated subcellular localization of Orai1 and Stim1. Furthermore, using deletion and point mutations in \u03b1-SNAP we show that the domains and residues crucial for facilitating SOCE do not overlap with those known to be essential for binding or activating NSF dependent SNARE complex disassembly (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barnard et al., 1997</a>). Finally, the identification of an NSF independent role of \u03b1-SNAP is consistent with our previously reported primary genome-wide RNAi screen, where neither silencing of SNARE proteins nor NSF specifically inhibited SOCE in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vig et al., 2006b</a>)."

These data are consistent with many previous studies that have shown a direct interaction between Stim1 and Orai1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yeromin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Vig et al., 2006a</a>) and identified the CAD domain of Stim1 as a critical domain involved in Stim-Orai1 clustering as well as SOCE activation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Park et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, mutagenesis studies within the CAD domain have identified distinct residues that regulate Stim1 clustering vs activation of SOCE (<a href=\"#bib25\">Park et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>). Yet, the existence of non-functional Stim1\u2013Orai1 coupling in a physiological context or the dependence of CRAC channel clusters on a third protein for regulating the final steps in SOCE activation has not been previously speculated. While several proteins have been previously identified to bind Stim1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Honnappa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Smyth et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Walsh et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Krapivinsky et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lewis, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Singaravelu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Soboloff et al., 2012</a>), only CRACR2A and Junctate have been shown to bind both Stim1 as well as Orai1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Srikanth et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2012</a>). Of these, CRACR2A has been shown to bind CRAC channel clusters in a calcium dependent fashion and its depletion inhibits the formation of Stim1 clusters. Therefore, consistent with the current model of SOCE where Stim1\u2013Orai1 clustering is considered necessary and sufficient for the physiological activation of SOCE, CRACR2A regulates the formation of Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters (<a href=\"#bib36\">Srikanth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lewis, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Soboloff et al., 2012</a>)."

More importantly, in contrast to CRACR2A, \u03b1-SNAP depletion inhibits SOCE without decreasing Stim1 clustering, the density of Stim1 in the junctional ER or the ability of Stim1 to bind Orai1. Therefore, for the first time, our studies have identified the existence of a crucial late step in the molecular sequence of SOCE that involves \u03b1-SNAP dependent active re-arrangement of Stim1 and Orai1 molecules within CRAC channel clusters necessary for the physiological activation of SOCE. We place the requirement for \u03b1-SNAP just after Stim1\u2013Orai1 clustering but before CAD mediated activation of SOCE."

In turn, co-expression of \u03b1-SNAP synergizes with Stim1 and Orai1 to amplify SOCE likely by ensuring that a higher percentage of Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters form functional CRAC channels. Interestingly, like in the case of \u03b1-SNAP depleted cells, we observed an increase in the size of CRAC channel clusters even in cells over-expressing \u03b1-SNAP (<a href=\"#fig6s6\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), suggesting that the ratio of Stim1:Orai1 molecules within CRAC channel clusters determines the amplitude of SOCE rather than the size of clusters themselves or the absolute amount of Stim1 in the junctional ER. The increase in size could result from a disrupted stoichiometry between \u03b1-SNAP and a fraction of Stim1\u2013Orai1 clusters in \u03b1-SNAP depleted as well as over-expressing cells. Alternatively, expansion in cluster size could result from an increase in the total amount of Stim1 in the junctional ER (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). Future studies employing sub-diffraction, single molecule imaging approaches would help elucidate the dynamics of \u03b1-SNAP dependent re-arrangement of Stim1-Orai1 molecules within junctional CRAC channel clusters."

Orai1 and Stim1 interact and cluster at the ER-PM junction, and constitute the active CRAC channel. The ratio of Orai1:Stim1 is crucial for SOCE as reported recently (McNally et al., 2012). The surprising finding here is that \u03b1-SNAP function regulates the ratio of Orai1 and Stim1 clusters and, more importantly, this function is independent of NSF. The data on the requirement of \u03b1-SNAP in this process and its interaction with Orai1 and Stim1 represent a potentially important step in our understanding of SOCE. However, the data does not reveal how \u03b1-SNAP controls the size of the clusters containing Orai1 and Stim1. We would be willing to consider a revised version provided it contains new data that addresses the following two major issues."
