                    "text": "Clustering of receptors associated with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) initiates the macrophage antimicrobial response. ITAM receptors engage Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) to initiate phagocytosis and macrophage activation. Macrophages also encounter nonpathogenic molecules that cluster receptors weakly and must tune their sensitivity to avoid inappropriate responses. To investigate this response threshold, we compared signaling in the presence and absence of receptor clustering using a small-molecule inhibitor of Csk, which increased SFK activation and produced robust membrane-proximal signaling. Surprisingly, receptor-independent SFK activation led to a downstream signaling blockade associated with rapid degradation of the SFK LynA. Inflammatory priming of macrophages upregulated LynA and promoted receptor-independent signaling. In contrast, clustering the hemi-ITAM receptor Dectin-1 induced signaling that did not require LynA or inflammatory priming. Together, the basal-state signaling checkpoint regulated by LynA expression and degradation and the signaling reorganization initiated by receptor clustering allow cells to discriminate optimally between pathogens and nonpathogens."

ITAM receptors engage Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) to initiate phagocytosis and macrophage activation. Macrophages also encounter nonpathogenic molecules that cluster receptors weakly and must tune their sensitivity to avoid inappropriate responses. To investigate this response threshold, we compared signaling in the presence and absence of receptor clustering using a small-molecule inhibitor of Csk, which increased SFK activation and produced robust membrane-proximal signaling. Surprisingly, receptor-independent SFK activation led to a downstream signaling blockade associated with rapid degradation of the SFK LynA. Inflammatory priming of macrophages upregulated LynA and promoted receptor-independent signaling. In contrast, clustering the hemi-ITAM receptor Dectin-1 induced signaling that did not require LynA or inflammatory priming. Together, the basal-state signaling checkpoint regulated by LynA expression and degradation and the signaling reorganization initiated by receptor clustering allow cells to discriminate optimally between pathogens and nonpathogens."

The experiments used macrophages obtained from genetically engineered mice and found that the direct activation of SFK proteins alone does not fully activate signaling pathways in the macrophages. A signaling blockade occurs due to the rapid destruction of an SFK protein called LynA. When the macrophages were exposed to molecules that are signals of inflammation in the body, they produced more LynA. This allowed these macrophages to be activated even without the formation of receptor clusters by interactions with pathogens."

To prevent nonproductive activation and tissue damage, macrophages must differentiate between receptor ligands displayed during a pathogen encounter (e.g., a \u03b2-glucan-presenting fungal cell wall or an IgG-opsonized cell) vs. environmental noise (e.g., glycans shed from fungi or other cell debris). One mechanism by which cells make this distinction is by using receptor clustering to sense the size of a potential stimulus. Large-diameter stimuli that are more likely to be associated with pathogenic particles nucleate large-scale receptor clusters, forming a signaling complex called a phagocytic synapse. In contrast, small-diameter stimuli induce only small-scale or transient receptor clusters (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goodridge et al., 2011</a>). Hereafter, we will refer to ligands that cluster ITAM/hemi-ITAM receptors efficiently as \u2018strong stimuli\u2019 and ligands that cluster receptors poorly as \u2018weak stimuli\u2019. In mast cells, a related myeloid subtype, treatment with a high dose of weak stimulus can produce robust receptor phosphorylation without stable receptor clustering. Interestingly, the resulting membrane-proximal signaling patterns, as well as the associated immunopathologies, are qualitatively different than those produced in response to a strong stimulus (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carroll-Portillo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>), which indicates that myeloid cells can distinguish between strong and weak stimuli beyond simply sensing the degree of receptor phosphorylation."

The phosphatases CD45 and CD148 dephosphorylate the inhibitory-tail tyrosine of the SFK, releasing this autoinhibition and enabling subsequent activation-loop autophosphorylation and full activation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chow and Veillette, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). The continuous competition of Csk and CD45/CD148 sets the steady state of SFK inhibitory-tail phosphorylation in the cell. Inhibiting Csk activity disrupts this steady state, allowing CD45 and CD148 initiate bulk SFK activation unopposed (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schoenborn et al., 2011</a>). We previously described a Csk variant (analog-sensitive Csk, \u2018Csk<sup>AS</sup>\u2019) that is sensitized to inhibition by a 3-iodobenzyl analog of the kinase inhibitor PP1 (3-IB-PP1). The bulkiness of 3-IB-PP1 prevents its interaction with WT Csk and other WT kinases (<a href=\"#bib40\">Okuzumi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schoenborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). We have also described a transgenic mouse that expresses Csk<sup>AS</sup> but not WT Csk and have studied the effects of Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition in T cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schoenborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). Macrophages express a distinct subset of Src family members (Lyn, Hck, and Fgr) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lowell, 2004</a>), and, unlike naive T cells, macrophages express the ITAM-proximal kinase Syk (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2010</a>) and SFK-dependent negative-regulatory phosphatases associated with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Veillette et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lowell, 2004</a>). This distinct membrane-proximal signaling environment likely modifies the signaling program initiated by macrophage receptors in service of cell-specific functions."

Receptor-independent SFK activation by 3-IB-PP1 induced robust membrane-proximal signaling but no downstream signaling through the MAPKs or Akt. We determined that this signaling blockade was caused by rapid degradation of the SFK LynA, which resulted in a loss of function that could not be compensated for by the other SFKs. We were able to rescue downstream signaling by priming the macrophages, which led to the upregulation of LynA. Receptor clustering enabled the participation of the other SFKs in the activation of downstream MAPK, Akt, and calcium signaling independently of LynA. From the data presented in this article, we propose a model to explain how macrophages are prevented from responding to weak stimuli, how inflammation increases macrophage sensitivity to weak stimuli, and how receptor clustering rewires SFK signaling to enable macrophage activation."

In fact, SFK activation by this maximally effective dose of 3-IB-PP1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tan et al., 2014</a>) produced much more robust membrane-proximal signaling than did zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, where an increase in SFK activation-loop phosphorylation was not even detectable. It is possible that our failure to detect SFK activation-loop phosphorylation in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup> was due to only a small, local pool of SFKs being activated at the site of receptor clustering, as suggested by previous imaging (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goodridge et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, perhaps an increase in SFK activation is not the initiating event of receptor-mediated signaling. Rather, it is the interaction of clustered receptors with a preexisting pool of active SFKs, whose function is somehow blocked outside of large-scale receptor clusters. This model would be consistent with recent studies in T cells in which a basally active pool of SFKs is the major driver of TCR signaling (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nika et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Manz et al., 2015</a>)."

However, all ATP-mimetic kinase inhibitors, even the bulkier analogs, have the potential for nonspecific interactions with kinase active sites (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bain et al., 2007</a>). To minimize the possibility that an off-target effect of 3-IB-PP1 blocks Erk phosphorylation by a Csk<sup>AS</sup>-independent mechanism, we treated WT BMDMs with a combination of zymosan<sup>dep</sup> and increasing concentrations of 3-IB-PP1 and found no suppression of Erk phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Signaling in response to the growth factor M-CSF, which initiates Erk and Akt signaling through the CSF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pixley and Stanley, 2004</a>), was similarly unaffected by 3-IB-PP1 in WT BMDMs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also tested 3-IB-PP1 specificity by treating WT and Csk<sup>AS</sup> BMDMs with 3-IB-PP1 and assessing global tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation in WT BMDMs was insensitive to 3-IB-PP1. We conclude that the specific inhibitory effect of 3-IB-PP1 on Csk<sup>AS</sup>, not a nonspecific effect, causes the measured signaling responses. Interestingly, we found that 3-IB-PP1 impaired Erk and Akt responses to M-CSF in Csk<sup>AS</sup> BMDMs, suggesting that the failure of Erk signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 arises from an active signaling blockade rather than a quantitative failure of membrane-proximal signaling (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We performed analogous experiments with BMDMs by adding Cytochalasin D, Latrunculin A, or Jasplakinolide in combination with 3-IB-PP1 or zymosan<sup>dep</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Although actin remodeling affected Erk phosphorylation in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, it did not increase Erk phosphorylation in response to 3-IB-PP1. This finding suggests that the signaling blockade between activated SFKs and Erk in the absence of receptor clustering is fundamentally different in macrophages than in thymocytes, reflecting the different functions of actin remodeling and costimulatory pathways in signal initiation."

This observation is especially striking because Syk phosphorylation continued to increase over time during treatment with 3-IB-PP1 in either primed or unprimed cells and also during treatment with zymosan<sup>dep</sup> and was therefore kinetically uncoupled from downstream signaling through Erk and Akt. Additionally, even the transient, low-level proximal signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 in unprimed cells was quantitatively equivalent to or higher in magnitude than the signaling in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup>. Finally, as mentioned above, cotreatment with 3-IB-PP1 suppressed signaling through the CSF-1R pathway (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these observations reinforce our claim that unprimed cells do not simply fail to reach a quantitative signaling threshold. Rather, a more qualitative difference in signaling circuitry explains the differential effects of priming on 3-IB-PP1 vs zymosan<sup>dep</sup> signaling. After observing a general enhancement of membrane-proximal signaling in primed cells, we hypothesized that priming directly influences the activation of all the membrane-proximal signaling proteins we tested."

We therefore treated BMDMs with IFN-\u03b3 in combination with cycloheximide to block translation, but we found that cycloheximide exposure was toxic and blocked all signaling through Erk. As an alternative, we tested different IFN-\u03b3 incubation times to look at the kinetics of the signaling enhancement. We found that 3-IB-PP1 failed to induce robust Erk phosphorylation in cells treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 4 hr or less (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). IFN-\u03b3 priming for 6 hr or 8 hr produced modest Erk phosphorylation, and priming for 16 hr led to robust Erk phosphorylation in response to 3-IB-PP1. This temporal pattern strongly suggests that a priming-dependent transcriptional change potentiates Erk signaling after 3-IB-PP1 treatment."

The basal expression level of Lyn sets this threshold, and this level of expression can be tuned by the extracellular milieu: inflammation initiates a program that overrides this LynA-mediated signaling checkpoint, thereby sensitizing macrophages to stimuli that fail to cluster receptors efficiently.

Treatment with 3-IB-PP1 induced robust membrane-proximal signaling, but signal propagation was blocked downstream of PLC\u03b3 and PI3K, with no apparent activation of Erk, JNK, Akt, or NFAT. We determined that propagation of receptor-independent signaling induced by 3-IB-PP1 requires the SFK LynA, but we observed that LynA protein was almost completely degraded within the first three minutes after 3-IB-PP1 addition. This blockade was overcome by priming macrophages with IFN-\u03b3 or GM-CSF before 3-IB-PP1 treatment, which led to increased expression of LynA, thus buffering it against total degradation and leading to a more sustained presence of LynA during the first minutes of 3-IB-PP1 treatment. The other macrophage SFKs, Hck and Fgr, were also activated in response to 3-IB-PP1 treatment but were not capable of compensating for the lack of LynA activity after LynA degradation or in Lyn-deficient cells. In contrast, receptor clustering by zymosan<sup>dep</sup> induced signaling through the MAPKs and Akt independently of LynA function and inflammatory priming."

In the experiments discussed here, we treated cells with a high dose of 3-IB-PP1 to induce robust SFK activation and unmask signaling that would otherwise be undetectable with weak stimulation. When we titrate 3-IB-PP1 to lower doses, the signaling pattern is unchanged, just generally weaker in strength. Therefore, we believe that the strong SFK activation in response to 3-IB-PP1 is an advantage of this experimental system and allows the comparison of signaling in the absence of receptor clustering, as in a weak physiological stimulus, to signaling in response to zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, which mimics a strong physiological stimulus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goodridge et al., 2011</a>). In this context, differences in signaling between 3-IB-PP1- and zymosan<sup>dep</sup>-treated cells reveal how receptor clustering relays signaling information. Importantly, we found that Erk, JNK, Akt, and NFAT activation patterns do not only depend on the strength of SFK activation and membrane-proximal signaling, but instead arise from the different roles of LynA and the other SFKs in the presence and absence of induced receptor clustering. We conclude, therefore, that large-scale receptor clustering does qualitatively change the chain of events necessary for signaling to occur independently of general SFK activation strength."

As a result, signaling induced in the absence of significant receptor clustering is blocked at the level of Erk, JNK, Akt, and NFAT, while signaling induced by high-valency receptor clustering proceeds through these pathways. However, when cells are primed with IFN-\u03b3, they upregulate expression of LynA sufficiently that even weak or low-valency ligands can produce downstream Erk, JNK, Akt, and NFAT signaling. While priming sensitizes macrophages to small amounts of high-valency pathogen ligands, it will also increase the chance to signaling to host-derived or nonpathogenic low-valency ligands that may lead to immunopathology."

Lyn phosphorylates ITIMs and their associated phosphatases, and so Lyn deficiency leads to hyperactivation of cell signaling (<a href=\"#bib50\">Scapini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ingley, 2012</a>). However, such Lyn-deficient cells lack both LynA and LynB. When mast cells derived from <i>Lyn</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice are reconstituted either with LynA or LynB, LynA expression leads to more robust PLC\u03b3 phosphorylation and better association of PLC\u03b3 with the adaptor protein LAT in response to Fc\u03f5RI ligation. In contrast, LynB expression drives the formation of a LynB-SHIP1 complex and impairs calcium and degranulation responses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez-Errico et al., 2010</a>). These observations are consistent with our conclusion that in macrophages, LynA is the primary mediator of downstream signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1. The persisting activity of LynB after LynA degradation is likely to activate negative feedback responses and ensure deterioration of membrane-proximal signaling. It is likely, however, that the loss of some positive function of LynA leads to the primary blockade in signaling because Lyn-deficient macrophages (lacking both LynA and LynB) lose all capacity to signal through Erk and Akt in response to 3-IB-PP1. In addition, LynB, like LynA, is upregulated during priming and fails to suppress LynA-mediated signaling. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of LynA activity are dominant or orthogonal to any negative-regulatory effects of LynB."

We have detected general tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-3 and its association with SHIP1 in response to 3-IB-PP1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and the role of Dok-3 in signaling will be the subject of future studies."

However, previous work has shown that activated SFKs can phosphorylate the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, which then targets them for degradation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rao et al., 2002</a>). In fact, Lyn ubiquitination in mast cells has been observed within 15\u201330 s of Fc\u03f5RI activation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kyo et al., 2003</a>). What surprised us was that bulk protein degradation appeared to account for all loss of activated Lyn after 3-IB-PP1 treatment. This mechanism is reminiscent of the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by Cbl (<a href=\"#bib60\">Thien and Langdon, 2001</a>) and internalization/degradation processes for deactivating the T-cell receptor (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2000</a>). This observation has important implications for how macrophages might respond to repeated encounters with weak stimuli. The LynA checkpoint would not only shut signaling down but also render macrophages refractory to restimulation by another weak stimulus, at least until redistribution at the membrane or new synthesis replenishes local reserves of LynA. We have observed one form of this desensitization during 3-IB-PP1 wash-out and subsequent stimulation with the growth factor M-CSF, but in vivo this process likely occurs in a highly spatially localized manner. This degradation and desensitization could prevent the accumulation of hyperactivated macrophages at sites rich in weak stimuli but lacking genuine pathogenic invaders."

Moreover, alterations in macrophage sensitivity through defects in membrane-proximal negative regulators have already been linked directly to disease. For example, loss of negative-regulatory receptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3, Axl, and Mer exacerbates lupus-like disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease through enhanced Toll-like receptor signaling (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rothlin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lemke and Rothlin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rothlin and Lemke, 2010</a>).

The LynA checkpoint constitutes an additional system by which macrophages sense inflammation and set basal sensitivity accordingly. Understanding the ways that macrophages become hypersensitive to stimulation, including the bypass of the LynA checkpoint, will provide insights into how we might limit this process and reduce the contribution of macrophage signaling to disease pathology."

After scraping the plates, cells and detergent were incubated 30 min on ice. The lysate was then cleared by ultracentrifugation for 15 min at 50,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman (Pasadena, CA) TLA120.2 rotor. The lysates were precleared for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with Protein G Sepharose beads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and normal rabbit or goat serum as appropriate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Protein G-Sepharose beads were covalently conjugated to Lyn or Hck antibodies (see table below) using dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma). Antibody-bound beads were added to the lysate and mixed 1.5 hr at 4\u00b0C to immunoprecipitate Hck or Lyn. Finally, the samples were applied to micro bio-spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), washed, and eluted with SDS Sample Buffer."

Using a technique that allows them to pharmacologically inhibit the CSK kinase, they report rapid activation of SFK activity and robust phosphorylation of immediate downstream effectors but inability to activate ERK, suggesting some type of block. This is in contrast to activation by zymosan, which achieves similar levels of phosphorylated downstream intermediates but also allows for strong ERK activation. The ability of CSK inhibition to activate ERK could be overcome by macrophage priming suggesting that priming allows for some rewiring. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that CSK inhibition activates SFK and results in preferential inhibition of the LynA isoform. Presumably, the loss of LynA prevents a sustained enough of a signal to allow for ERK activation."

First, the data clearly show how dynamic the tyrosine phosphorylation of the SFK is as changes in phosphorylation are seen after 3 seconds. Second, the data show fundamental difference in LynA vs LynB, suggesting that LynA is responsible for positive signaling while LynB is responsible for negative regulator signaling. Third, it is shown that LynA is preferentially phosphorylated by CSK compared to other SFK and that LynA is also preferentially degraded. Fourth, the manuscript shows how rapidly SFK are lost after their activation. This is a little studied but important area. Lastly, the manuscript shows that an important effect of priming is up regulation of Lyn expression."

In fact, we found that the introduction of LynA or LynAK40R into WT or even Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> cells was toxic, whereas cells transduced instead with LacZ or Hck survived blasticidin selection. Although we were disappointed that we encountered this technical limitation, this observation of differential survival does support our model, since enhancing Lyn activity appears to affect the basal state of macrophages but enhancing Hck activity does not."

Indeed (as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), membrane-proximal signaling in response to 3-IB-PP1 is more transient downstream of Syk in unprimed cells and more sustained in primed cells, consistent with our model that sustained LynA activity is necessary to promote signaling continuously to generate an Erk response. This observation is complicated by the fact that Syk phosphorylation itself is not transient in either case, rather activated Syk continues to accumulate well beyond the point of Erk signaling initiation. Also, the quantitative amount of even the transient signaling in unprimed cells is greater with 3-IB-PP1 than with zymosan<sup>dep</sup>, so quantity of signaling cannot be the complete story.

The reviewers are correct that there are quantitative differences in signaling in primed vs. unprimed cells, depending on the level of LynA persisting during the first 5 min of 3-IB-PP1 treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The qualitative differences, we argue, are in the requirement for Lyn protein in the absence of receptor clustering vs. the lifting of this requirement in the context of receptor clusters (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Again, we clarified the manuscript to emphasize that the failure of 3-IB-PP1 to initiate Erk/Akt signaling is not simply a failure to pass some threshold strength of membrane-proximal signaling. In addition, we have added a figure (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>), which demonstrates that 3-IB-PP1 treatment actually suppresses Erk and Akt signaling through the CSF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, suggesting an active signaling block that prevents a full response to 3-IB-PP1 in unprimed cells."
