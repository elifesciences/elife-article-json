Enhanced production of type I IFNs in <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup> </i>dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro have led to speculation that inhibition of AXL would promote antiviral responses. Notwithstanding, type I IFNs also exert potent immunosuppressive functions. Here we demonstrate that ablation of AXL enhances the susceptibility to infection by influenza A virus and West Nile virus. The increased type I IFN response in <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was associated with diminished DC maturation, reduced production of IL-1\u03b2, and defective antiviral T cell immunity. Blockade of type I IFN receptor or administration of IL-1\u03b2 to <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice restored the antiviral adaptive response and control of infection. Our results demonstrate that AXL is essential for limiting the immunosuppressive effects of type I IFNs and enabling the induction of protective antiviral adaptive immunity."

Enhanced production of type I IFNs in <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup> </i>dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro have led to speculation that inhibition of AXL would promote antiviral responses. Notwithstanding, type I IFNs also exert potent immunosuppressive functions. Here we demonstrate that ablation of AXL enhances the susceptibility to infection by influenza A virus and West Nile virus. The increased type I IFN response in <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was associated with diminished DC maturation, reduced production of IL-1\u03b2, and defective antiviral T cell immunity. Blockade of type I IFN receptor or administration of IL-1\u03b2 to <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice restored the antiviral adaptive response and control of infection. Our results demonstrate that AXL is essential for limiting the immunosuppressive effects of type I IFNs and enabling the induction of protective antiviral adaptive immunity."

Enveloped viruses exploit apoptotic mimicry by exposing phosphatidylserine on their lipid envelopes. Binding of phosphatidylserine to the AXL agonist growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) protein leads to the activation of AXL on host cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lew et al., 2014</a>). Activation of AXL through viral apoptotic mimicry leads to the induction of the <i>Socs</i> genes and the suppression of type I IFN production and signaling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</a>). It was also shown that the non-enveloped virus SV40 can engage AXL directly by structural mimicry to facilitate infection (<a href=\"#bib7\">Drayman et al., 2013</a>). Type I IFNs were identified based on their ability to inhibit the propagation of viruses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Taniguchi et al., 1980</a>).

Unexpectedly, <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup></i>mice were more susceptible than WT mice to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. This enhanced susceptibility correlated with reduced maturation of DCs and deficient induction of antiviral T cell responses. A similar impairment in inducing an effective adaptive T cell response in <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was detected during infection with the unrelated neurotropic West Nile virus (WNV). The failure to engage antiviral adaptive immunity could be ascribed to increased type I IFN and the associated reduction in IL-1\u03b2 production in infected <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup>mice. Neutralization of type I IFN function restored the production of IL-1\u03b2 in infected <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> DCs and rescued the capacity of <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice to induce the protective antiviral adaptive immune response and resist IAV infection. Similarly, delivery of IL-1\u03b2 restored antiviral adaptive immunity in\u00a0<i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and survival to\u00a0IAV infection. In summary, our studies underscore the function of AXL in calibrating the antiviral versus the immunosuppressive functions of type I IFNs during viral infection."

The AXL agonist, GAS6, can bind to phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of apoptotic membranes and thus bridge apoptotic cells to AXL-expressing phagocytes.

Similarly, <i>Cd11c</i>-Cre<sup>+</sup><i>Axl</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice developed fewer IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in comparison to respective controls, while this response was conserved in <i>Csf1r</i>-Cre<sup>+</sup><i>Axl</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The number of CD8<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> T cells was also significantly reduced in the lung of <i>Cd11c</i>-Cre<sup>+</sup><i>Axl</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> infected mice compared to control mice (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate that myeloid-specific ablation of AXL in <i>Cd11c</i>-Cre<sup>+</sup><i>Axl</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice is sufficient to account for the impaired T cell activation phenotype seen in complete <i>Axl<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Furthermore, the ability of <i>Csf1r</i>-Cre<sup>+</sup><i>Axl</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> infected mice to mount protective adaptive antiviral responses is consistent with the preserved expression of AXL in lung DCs and the lack of increased susceptibility to infection in this conditional knock out line."

This is particularly relevant in the context of IAV infection, as IL-1\u03b2 is required for effective priming of antiviral T cells and antibody responses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ichinohe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schmitz et al., 2005</a>). The increased production of IFN-\u03b2 in IAV-infected <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> BMDCs correlated with a concomitant reduction in the production of IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This is in agreement with the decreased production of IL-1\u03b2 found in lung DCs of infected <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>). Furthermore, neutralization of type I IFN signaling in infected <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> BMDCs rescued IL-1\u03b2 production by these cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). To test if the diminished production of IL-1\u03b2 in infected <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice was causal for their increased susceptibility to IAV, we administered recombinant IL-1\u03b2 intranasally to WT and <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice on days 1, 2, and 3 post-infection with 10 PFU of PR8. <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice that were given IL-1\u03b2 were completely protected and survived the infection (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

Since loss of AXL function in DCs protected the cells from viral infection, these results suggested that AXL inhibition might lead to improved antiviral response in infected hosts. This idea is of particular importance given that small molecule inhibitors against AXL are currently in development and one of them is in Phase 1 clinical trial (<a href=\"#bib11\">Graham et al., 2014</a>). In direct opposition to this hypothesis, our experimental evidence demonstrates that mice featuring the genetic ablation of <i>Axl</i>, even after selective deletion in myeloid cells, are more susceptible to viral infection than WT mice."

This phenotype is consistent with previous findings on the susceptibility to IAV infection of mice lacking CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bender et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). How does AXL signaling protect the host against viral infection? Albeit paradoxical, the ability of AXL to inhibit type I IFN production appears to be important for induction of antiviral adaptive immunity. While type I IFNs are considered classical inducers of DC maturation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gallucci et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Montoya et al., 2002</a>), the immunosuppressive effects of type I IFNs are also well known (<a href=\"#bib24\">McNab et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, the increased production of type I IFNs in response to infection in <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells limited the production of IL-1\u03b2, a cytokine required for the effective priming of antiviral T cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ichinohe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schmitz et al., 2005</a>). Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and production of IL-1\u03b2 are important components of the antiviral immune response to a variety of RNA viruses, including IAV, WNV, Sendai virus, adenovirus, and vaccinia virus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kanneganti, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ramos et al., 2012</a>). Similar to our findings in <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, hosts deficient in inflammasome signaling experience heightened mortality to IAV or WNV infection (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ichinohe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ramos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thomas et al., 2009</a>). Thus, our studies highlight the central role of AXL in the protection of the host against viral infections through the tightly regulated production of type I IFNs."

We generated an <i>Axl</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse line and demonstrated that ablation of <i>Axl</i> in DCs and alveolar macrophages was sufficient to result in deficient T cell responses and confer susceptibility to IAV. While AXL function in DCs appears to be required for the appropriate priming of adaptive immunity, our approach did not ablate <i>Axl</i> in exclusively these cells. The development of more selective approaches to induce the ablation of genes in distinct DC populations will provide a better understanding. In contrast, mice featuring preferential ablation in macrophages did not succumb to the same infection. AXL and the related RTK MERTK are expressed in alveolar macrophages. These receptors are not only inhibitors of the immune response but also mediate the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fujimori et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rothlin et al., 2015</a>). Thus it is possible that AXL and MERTK function in alveolar macrophages is dispensable for the regulation of the priming of adaptive immunity, but participates in the clearance of apoptotic debris during the resolution phase."

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a critical role in clearing WNV from the CNS. Indeed, mice lacking CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibit ~95% mortality during WNV infection due to delayed clearance of WNV-infected cells from the CNS (Shrestha and Diamond, J. Virol. 2004). Thus, the deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with WNV are likely to explain their increased mortality and viral burden. A reference to the previously reported increased susceptibility of <i>Axl</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice to WNV has been included in the revised manuscript."
