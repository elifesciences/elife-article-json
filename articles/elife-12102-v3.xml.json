Free CSN is autoinhibited, and it remains unclear how it becomes activated. We combine structural and kinetic analyses to identify mechanisms that contribute to CSN activation and Nedd8 deconjugation. Both CSN and neddylated substrate undergo large conformational changes upon binding, with important roles played by the N-terminal domains of Csn2 and Csn4 and the RING domain of Rbx1 in enabling formation of a high affinity, fully active complex. The RING domain is crucial for deneddylation, and works in part through conformational changes involving insert-2 of Csn6. Nedd8 deconjugation and re-engagement of the active site zinc by the autoinhibitory Csn5 glutamate-104 diminish affinity for Cul1/Rbx1 by ~100-fold, resulting in its rapid ejection from the active site. Together, these mechanisms enable a dynamic deneddylation-disassembly cycle that promotes rapid remodeling of the cellular CRL network."

Free CSN is autoinhibited, and it remains unclear how it becomes activated. We combine structural and kinetic analyses to identify mechanisms that contribute to CSN activation and Nedd8 deconjugation. Both CSN and neddylated substrate undergo large conformational changes upon binding, with important roles played by the N-terminal domains of Csn2 and Csn4 and the RING domain of Rbx1 in enabling formation of a high affinity, fully active complex. The RING domain is crucial for deneddylation, and works in part through conformational changes involving insert-2 of Csn6. Nedd8 deconjugation and re-engagement of the active site zinc by the autoinhibitory Csn5 glutamate-104 diminish affinity for Cul1/Rbx1 by ~100-fold, resulting in its rapid ejection from the active site. Together, these mechanisms enable a dynamic deneddylation-disassembly cycle that promotes rapid remodeling of the cellular CRL network."

The enzymes that generally carry out the first step of this breakdown process are called ubiquitin ligases and human cells make hundreds of different ones. These ubiquitin ligases are not always active and a large group of them can be switched off by a group of proteins known as the COP9-Signalosome (or CSN for short). To achieve this, CSN recognizes and cuts off a structure called Nedd8 from these ubiquitin ligases. However, CSN itself remains inactive until it finds and binds to ubiquitin ligases that have Nedd8 attached."

The experiments provided a clearer picture of what the CSN looks like when it binds its targets and revealed which parts of the proteins are involved in the interaction. Furthermore, the data showed that, immediately after Nedd8 is removed from the ubiquitin ligase, CSN quickly switches back into an \u201coff\u201d position that allows it to release the now inactive ubiquitin ligase. This helps to explain how CSN can remove Nedd8 from many ubiquitin ligase molecules in a short period of time."

The available structural and biochemical data indicate that Nedd8 conjugation (neddylation) stabilizes a profound conformational change in the C-terminal domain of the cullin. It loosens the interaction of the WHB domain with the RING subunit, allowing both of them to sample a greater conformational space (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duda et al., 2008</a>), thereby enhancing the ability of the RING domain to promote ubiquitin transfer to substrate (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yamoah et al., 2008</a>)."

Cand1 binds unmodified SCF complexes and promotes rapid dissociation of the F-box protein (FBP)/Skp1 substrate receptor\u2013adaptor module from the Cul1/Rbx1 core. Cand1 can subsequently be dissociated from Cul1 by a different FBP/Skp1 complex, and as a result Cand1 functions as an SREF that accelerates the rate at which Cul1/Rbx1 comes to equilibrium with different FBP/Skp1 substrate receptor\u2013adaptor complexes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pierce et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, the SREF activity of Cand1 is tightly restricted by Nedd8. Cand1 is not able to bind stably to Cul1 and promote dissociation of FBP/Skp1 when Cul1 is conjugated to Nedd8 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pierce et al., 2013</a>). These observations underscore the importance of neddylation not only for controlling the enzymatic activity of CRLs, but also potentially for controlling the repertoire of assembled CRLs."

Of particular significance is the rate of Nedd8 deconjugation, because it serves as the gateway for the exchange cycle; once Nedd8 is removed, a CRL complex is susceptible to the potent SREF activity of Cand1, and its substrate receptor can be exchanged (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pierce et al., 2013</a>). Deconjugation of Nedd8 is mediated by the COP9-signalosome (CSN), which is an eight-subunit Nedd8 isopeptidase (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lyapina et al., 2001</a>). The enzymatic activity of CSN resides in its Csn5 subunit, which contains a metalloprotease active site referred to as the \u2018JAMM\u2019 domain (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cope et al., 2002</a>). The JAMM domain has the general structure E<sub>76</sub>-Xn-H<sub>138</sub>-X-H<sub>140</sub>-X10-D<sub>151</sub> (the subscripts refer to the sequence position of these residues in human Csn5), wherein the H and D residues coordinate a zinc ion. The fourth zinc-coordination site is occupied by a water molecule that that also forms a hydrogen bond to E76 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ambroggio et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tran et al., 2003</a>). Deneddylation of CRLs by CSN is rapid but can be regulated by CRL substrates (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emberley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fischer et al., 2011</a>). Structural analysis suggests that a CRL ubiquitination substrate bound to a substrate receptor sterically prevents concurrent binding of CSN (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fischer et al., 2011</a>). This suggests a model wherein a CRL complex has a higher probability of being conjugated to Nedd8 (and therefore of being shielded from Cand1) as long as it is bound to substrate. Upon dissociation of substrate, a race ensues between binding of either a new substrate or CSN. If CSN wins, Nedd8 is removed, paving the way for Cand1 to initiate substrate receptor exchange."

                        "text": "Recently, a crystal structure of free CSN was determined (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>). A major insight to emerge from the structure was the unexpected finding that Csn5 was present in an autoinhibited state, wherein a glutamate (Csn5-E104) within the \u2018insert-1\u2019 (INS1) sequence common to JAMM family members (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sato et al., 2008</a>) forms a fourth ligand to the zinc, displacing the catalytic Csn5-E76-bound water molecule and shifting Csn5-E76. Csn5-E104 is found in all Csn5 orthologs, but not in other JAMM proteins, suggesting that this mode of regulation is conserved but unique to CSN. Comparison of the structure of free CSN to the structure of a catalytically-dead mutant CSN bound to Nedd8-conjugated SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> determined by negative stain electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>) implied that binding of substrate to CSN may induce several conformational changes in the latter, including movement of the N-terminal domains (NTD) of Csn2 and Csn4 towards the cullin. The latter movement, in turn, might be further propagated to the Csn5/6 module (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that during catalysis INS1 moves out of the active site and Csn5-E76 adopts a position similar to that observed in a crystallographic structure of Csn5 in isolation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Echalier et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, if Csn5-E104 is mutated to an alanine, CSN more rapidly cleaves the simple model substrate ubiquitin-rhodamine (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>). This was interpreted to mean that the primary reason for the autoinhibited state is to keep CSN off until it binds a physiologic substrate, which would prevent spurious cleavage of non-cullin Nedd8 conjugates and possibly even ubiquitin conjugates. However, the full extent of the conformational changes required to form an activated complex between CSN and its neddylated substrate, as well as the detailed molecular basis for these changes remain to be established. Therefore, at present, the mechanism of how CSN is switched on and off and the significance of this switching behavior remain unknown."

Specifically, this allowed us to describe movements of the N-terminal domains of Csn2 and Csn4, the MPN domains of Csn5 and Csn6. Moreover, in contrast to our previous work, we could locate the RING domain of Rbx1, as well as Nedd8 and the winged-helix B (WHB) domain of Cul1 relative to Csn5. Nevertheless, the present resolution precludes the determination of the exact orientations of the latter domains but notably, the relative positions of the RING, WHB and Nedd8 reported here have not been reported in any structural model of a cullin, and strongly suggest that both the enzyme and substrate undergo significant conformational rearrangements to enable catalysis."

We thus docked these domains individually (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). A Csn2\u2009N-terminal fragment encompassing the portion between its crystallographically resolved N-terminus (amino acid 30) through to a flexible loop at amino acid 180, was docked as a rigid body (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>), positioning it close to the four-helical bundle and helix 24 of Cul1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zheng et al., 2002</a>). An N-terminal fragment of Csn4, spanning amino acids 1 to 295, which ends in a previously reported hinge loop (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>), was also docked independently as a rigid body (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

The local resolution in this region was lower, presumably due to higher flexibility around the catalytic site. Importantly, after docking Csn5, we observed two empty neighboring densities (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>, right hand panel, circles), which accommodated the two yet undocked protein components \u2013 Nedd8 and the WHB domain of Cul1 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). The docking of the latter was enabled by allowing helix 29 and the WHB, amino acids 690 to the C-terminus of Cul1, to move as a rigid body towards Csn5. However, we did not observe an electron density around helix 29 of Cul1, consistent with a structural flexibility in this region. This model places the neddylated WHB domain in close binding proximity to the RING domain, as well as both INS1 and INS2 of Csn5. The hydrophobic patch of Nedd8 is facing INS1, and not the WHB domain, as has been reported for the isolated neddylated C-terminal domain of Cul5 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duda et al., 2008</a>). Similar to the RING domain, we cannot be fully certain about the exact orientations of Nedd8 and the WHB domain at the present resolution. Nevertheless, to further substantiate this docking, we mutagenized conserved charged residues in the INS2 domain of Csn5 as well as the WHB domain, and as expected all of these constructs showed reduced catalytic activity in deneddylation assays (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E, F</a>)."

For the cross-linker used in this study (disuccinimidylsuberate H<sub>12/</sub>D<sub>12</sub>), the maximum predicted distance between two cross-linked lysine residues is generally accepted to be below ~30\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Politis et al., 2014</a>).

However, all of these larger-distance links are connected to the flexibly positioned Skp2 density. Moreover, we further performed similar cross-linking experiments on a number of different CSN-CRL complexes, varying the substrate receptor, the cullin and the neddylation state (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary files 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#SD6-data\">6</a>).

Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 exhibited normal E3 activity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and bound CSN with an affinity similar to Cul1/Rbx1 based on their IC<sub>50</sub> values for competitive inhibition of a deneddylation reaction (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Emberley et al., 2012</a>). When Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 was incubated with CSN (all CSN preparations used in this work are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), we observed an increase in dansyl fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This signal was due to specific binding because it was chased upon addition of excess unlabeled Cul1/Rbx1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, titration shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) or Cand1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), which competes for substrate deneddylation by CSN (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emberley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we concluded that the increase in dansyl fluorescence accurately reported on the interaction of CSN with Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1. Using this assay we determined that CSN bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 310 nM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 binding to CSN was only modestly affected by the addition of free Nedd8 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) or assembly with Skp2/Skp1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) or Fbxw7/Skp1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>)."

To circumvent this problem, we performed binding assays with the extensively characterized inactive mutant CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> (assay confirming loss of activity is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Remarkably, CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 ~200-fold more tightly than CSN bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> 1.6 nM vs. 310 nM; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A\u2013B</a>).

This introduces greater uncertainty into our estimate but nevertheless we can conclude with confidence that the binding of substrate to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> is very tight (\u22645 nM; see Materials and Methods for further discussion of this matter).

The high affinity binding of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to substrate was supported by an orthogonal competition experiment in which 100 nM CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> completely blocked deneddylation of 75 nM Cul1-N8/Rbx1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

First, we investigated the roles of the NTDs of Csn2 and Csn4, both of which, upon binding substrate, underwent conformational changes and made contact with Cul1 and the RING domain of Rbx1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3A</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>). To measure the effect of these mutations on binding to Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1, we combined them with Csn5-H138A to prevent deneddylation. Deletion of the first 269 amino acids of Csn2, observed to interact with Cul1 but not the RING domain of Rbx1, caused a massive loss in binding to substrate (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> &gt; 1300 nM; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>). Thus, the contact we observed between Csn2-NTD and N8-SCF<sup>Skp2/Cks1</sup> was critical to formation of the [ES] complex. By contrast, deletion of the first 297 amino acids NTD of Csn4 (4\u2206N), a portion which was observed to form interfaces with both Cul1 and the RING domain of Rbx1, had a relatively modest effect; CSN<sup>4\u2206N,5H138A</sup> bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 and Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 with <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values of &gt; 750 nM and 20 nM, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A, B</a>)."

To test the role of the RING domain in complex formation, we generated both Cul1/Rbx1 and Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 in which the RING domain can be deleted by introducing a TEV protease cleavage site (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dougherty et al., 1989</a>) after residue 37 of Rbx1 to generate Cul1 (or Cul1<sup>d</sup>)/Rbx1<sup>TEV</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This was essential, because it would not be possible to conjugate Nedd8 to Cul1/Rbx1 expressed as a mutant lacking the RING domain. After conjugating Nedd8 to the purified complex, we treated it with TEV protease to remove the RING domain, yielding Cul1 (or Cul1<sup>d</sup>)-N8/Rbx1<sup>\u2206RING</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The truncated Cul1/Rbx1<sup>\u2206RING</sup> was inactive in an ubiquitylation assay (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) but behaved as a monodisperse sample with the expected hydrodynamic radius upon size exclusion chromatography (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Notably, Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1<sup>\u2206RING</sup> bound CSN<sup>5E76A,5H138A</sup> and CSN<sup>5E76A</sup> with affinities (12 nM and 13 nM respectively; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) similar to that observed for binding of wild type Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 to CSN<sup>4\u2206N,5H138A</sup>. Given the similar effects of the Csn4-\u2206NTD and Rbx1-\u2206RING mutations on complex formation, we next tested whether their effects arose from loss of the interface that forms between these domains (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). However, double mutant analysis suggested that the Csn4-\u2206N and Rbx1-\u2206RING mutations had largely independent effects on binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The overall picture that emerged from these studies in light of the structural data is that the interaction of Csn2-NTD with neddylated substrate makes a large contribution to binding energy, with modest enhancements independently provided by the Csn4-NTD and Rbx1-RING domains."

However, we were puzzled by the relatively minor impact of Nedd8 on the affinity of Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>; whereas substrate bound with <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 1.6 nM, product binding was only ~6-fold weaker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Why, then, did CSN bind so much less tightly to product? We reasoned that a key difference between CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> and CSN is the absence of the active site zinc from CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>, which prevents formation of a stable apo-CSN complex in which E104 of the INS1 domain of Csn5 is bound to the active site zinc. If this conjecture is correct, it makes the prediction that CSN<sup>5E104A</sup>, which should also be unable to form stable apo-CSN, should likewise exhibit high affinity for product. This was confirmed: CSN<sup>5E104</sup> bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 26 nM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Furthermore, measurement of <i>k<sub>off</sub></i> values revealed that product dissociated from CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> and CSN<sup>5E104A</sup> about eightfold more slowly than it dissociated from CSN (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Based on these observations, we propose the \u2018E-vict\u2019 hypothesis, which is described in more detail in the Discussion. The essence of this hypothesis is that, following cleavage of the isopeptide bond and dissociation of Nedd8, INS1 of Csn5 engages the active site zinc. This accelerates the rate of dissociation of deneddylated Cul1/Rbx1, thereby preventing CSN from becoming clogged with product. We note that Csn5-E76 also contributes to the operation of this mechanism, because CSN<sup>5E76A</sup> bound tightly to product (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). We speculate that engagement of the active site zinc by Csn5-E104 forces Csn5-E76 into a configuration that promotes egress of product. Further insights into the exact sequence of events that accelerates product dissociation await high-resolution structures of CSN bound to Cul1/Rbx1 in various states."

We previously showed that CSN<sup>2\u2206N</sup> has severely reduced catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>), which is consistent with the binding data reported here. CSN<sup>4\u2206N</sup> exhibited a 20-fold defect in substrate cleavage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Meanwhile, the <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> for cleavage of Cul1-N8/Rbx1<sup>\u2206RING</sup> by CSN was reduced by a staggering ~18,000-fold relative to wild type substrate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A\u2013B</a>). Given that the neddylated \u2206RING substrate bound to CSN with only modestly reduced affinity, we surmised that the principal defect of this mutant might be its failure either to induce the activating conformational change in CSN, and/or to position accurately the isopeptide bond in the active site. Although we do not have the tools to address the latter point, we queried the former by examining the Csn6-\u2206INS2 mutation, which partially mimics the effect of substrate binding in that it destabilizes the autoinhibited state (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>). The Csn6-\u2206INS2 mutation slightly weakened binding to wild type product (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>) but completely suppressed the modest binding defect of the neddylated \u2206RING substrate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>) and promoted an ~8-fold increase in its deneddylation rate (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

                                "text": "A noteworthy feature of the deneddylation reactions carried out with CSN<sup>4\u2206N</sup> enzyme or \u2206RING substrate is that although <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> was reduced in both cases, <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> was also reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Whereas these results imply that deletion of the Csn4-NTD or Rbx1-RING improved affinity of the [ES] complex, our direct binding measurements indicated this was not the case. To understand this apparent paradox, it is essential to consider the kinetic behavior of CSN-mediated deneddylation. The formal definition of <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> for a deneddylation reaction (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>), as stipulated by Briggs and Haldane (<a href=\"#bib5\">Briggs and Haldane, 1925</a>), is: <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> = (<i>k<sub>off</sub></i> + <i>k<sub>cat</sub>)/k<sub>on.</sub></i>. In the special case of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which is based on the assumption that <i>k<sub>off</sub></i> is much larger than <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> the expression simplifies to <i>k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub></i>, or <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>. However, <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> for CSN (~1.1 sec<sup>-1</sup>) is actually much faster than <i>k<sub>off</sub></i> measured for dissociation of substrate from the CSN<sup>5E76A, 5H138A</sup> mutant (0.017 sec<sup>-1</sup>). The implication of this is that almost every binding event between CSN and substrate results in catalysis, and <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> (200 nM; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emberley et al., 2012</a>) is much larger than <i>K<sub>d\u00a0</sub></i>(1.6 nM, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). But, if <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> is reduced by mutation, the Briggs-Haldane equation predicts that <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> should approach <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>. Indeed, this is exactly what we see for reactions that exhibit reduced <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>, including reactions with mutant CSN<sup>4\u2206N</sup> enzyme or mutant \u2206RING substrate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In the slowest reaction (cleavage of Cul1/Rbx1<sup>\u2206RING</sup> by CSN) the <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> (5 nM) is in the same range as the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> with which this substrate bound to CSN<sup>5E76A, H138A</sup> (12 nM; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and approaches the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> measured for binding of substrate to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> (1.6 nM). This provides strong support for our proposal that the CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>\u2013Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 complex is representative of the affinity that develops during normal catalysis."

Interestingly, a similar reduced rate was observed in both single- and multi-turnover reactions, indicating that under our specific reactions conditions, the activating conformational changes/chemical step are affected at least as much as product dissociation.

This cell line expressed severely reduced levels of Csn5 and consequently displayed hyper-accumulation of Nedd8-conjugated endogenous Cul1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), but retained sufficient protein to survive. We introduced either an empty retrovirus or retroviruses coding for Flag-tagged wild type or mutant Csn5 proteins into these cells, and then monitored the Cul1 neddylation status by immunoblotting. In contrast to wild type <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5, cells expressing <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5-E104A, H138A or E76A did not regain a normal pattern of Cul1 neddylation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

To test whether mutations in the catalytic site of Csn5 resulted in increased affinity for Cul1, we immunoprecipitated wild type and mutant <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5 proteins and probed for co-precipitation of endogenous Cul1. In addition to the mutants described above, we surveyed a much broader panel of catalytic site substitutions to determine whether the results observed in our in vitro experiments were specific to the mutations employed or were a general consequence of disrupting the active site. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, the results were concordant with what was observed in vitro. On the one hand, <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5\u2013H138A retrieved high levels of Cul1-N8. The same was true for <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5 carrying mutations in other core residues of the JAMM domain (e.g. H140 and D151)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Cope et al., 2002</a>). On the other hand, <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5-E104A retrieved high levels of unmodified Cul1. We propose that this arises from its ability to bind and deneddylate substrate (albeit at a reduced rate), but then remain tightly bound to the product due to loss of the E-vict mechanism."

Indeed, like Csn5-E104A, Csn5-T103I did not restore a normal Cul1 neddylation pattern when expressed in Csn5-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and exhibited low deneddylase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). In contrast to CSN<sup>5E104A</sup>, however, CSN<sup>5T103I</sup> bound Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 product with low affinity, both in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>) and in cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Therefore, although CSN<sup>5E104A</sup> and CSN<sup>5T103I</sup> both have diminished catalytic activity, their defects appear to have distinct molecular bases. To further explore the divergent effects of Csn5-E104A and Csn5-T103I mutations on Cul1 binding, HEK293T stably expressing wild type or mutant versions of <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5 were grown in \u2018heavy\u2019 SILAC medium (wild type), or \u2018light\u2019 SILAC medium (mutants). Each mutant lysate was individually mixed with wild type lysate, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation and SILAC mass spectrometry. Whereas all CSN subunits exhibited light:heavy ratios of ~1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5-E104A pull-down showed elevated levels of all cullins compared to wild type, whereas <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5-T103I pulled down cullins at levels equal to or less than wild type <sup>Flag</sup>Csn5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

Panels A-C shows a schematic view of the structural transitions that occur upon substrate binding, and collectively contribute to efficient catalysis, whereas panel D provides the rate constants for the deneddylation cycle. We tentatively propose the following sequence of events. Free CSN exists in an inactive state in which E104 of Csn5-INS1 forms a fourth ligand to zinc (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)(<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>). In this state the NTDs of both Csn2 and Csn4 are in \u201copen\u201d conformations relative to the cullin substrate, and the MPN domains of Csn5/Csn6 are in a distal position relative to it. Substrate binds this state rapidly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), likely driven by electrostatic interactions between Cul1 and Csn2-NTD. This would account for the similar, extremely fast <i>k<sub>on</sub></i> values that we measured for different combinations of Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 and CSN. Binding of CSN to neddylated substrate results in a series of conformational changes in both complexes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These include (i) the translocation of the N-terminal helical repeats of Csn2 towards the CTD of Cul1, (ii) the movement of the NTD of Csn4 towards the RING domain of Rbx1 and the WHA domain of Cul1, (iii) the translocation of the MPN domains of Csn5\u2013Csn6 towards the neddylated WHB domain of Cul1, (iv) movement of the WHB domain towards Csn5, (v) the opening of the interface between Nedd8 and the WHB domain, and (vi) the formation of a new interface between Csn5 and Nedd8 probably involving the hydrophobic patch of Nedd8 and neighboring residues, as well as a tenuous interface between the WHB and the Rbx1 RING domain. Furthermore, although not structurally resolved in the present study, movements of Csn5-E76 and E104 towards and away from the zinc atom (vii), respectively, probably similar to the conformation reported in (<a href=\"#bib14\">Echalier et al., 2013</a>), must occur to enable catalysis. Finally, a series of other unresolved movements are likely to be germane including (viii) positioning of the extended C-terminus of Nedd8, and the corresponding portion of the WHB domain for catalysis as well as contacts between the INS1 and INS2 domains of Csn5 and the WHB domain of Cul1."

Deletion of Csn2-NTD virtually eliminated substrate binding (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>), suggesting that movement of this domain (motion i) enables a high affinity interaction between CSN and neddylated CRLs. Meanwhile a mutant lacking Csn4-NTD, CSN<sup>4\u2206N,5H138A</sup>, bound Cul1-N8/Rbx1 ~10-fold less tightly than CSN<sup>5H138A</sup>, albeit still with a relatively high affinity (20 nM, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A similar effect on binding affinity was seen with a substrate lacking the RING domain of Rbx1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Even though the RING and Csn4-NTD domains are adjacent in the enzyme-substrate [ES] complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), double mutant analysis suggests that they make substantially independent contributions to binding energy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Interestingly, enzyme assays revealed a much greater effect of deleting the RING than deleting the Csn4-NTD, suggesting that the RING domain makes a profound contribution to catalysis in a manner that does not depend on its proximity to Csn4-NTD. We do not know the extent to which the reduced catalytic rates for these mutants arise from defects in enzyme activation versus substrate positioning, but we note that cleavage of \u2206RING substrate was accelerated by ~8-fold upon deletion of Csn6-INS2, suggesting that at least a small part of the problem with this substrate is that it failed to properly trigger activating conformational changes in CSN."

We suggest that this motion contributes primarily a <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> effect, because deletion of Csn6-INS2, which is proposed to facilitate this motion, enhanced <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> but had no noteworthy impact on binding to substrate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and removal of Csn5 from the complex did not substantially affect CSN assembly with substrate (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>). We cannot conclude much about the other motions enumerated above, but we note that mutations that are predicted to reside near the interface of the Csn5-INS2 and Cul1-WHB domains cause significant reductions in substrate deneddylation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E, F</a>). In addition, reorientation of Nedd8 away from Cul1-WHB and towards Csn5 as predicted here is consistent with the prior observation that the hydrophobic patch of Nedd8 recruits UBXD7 to neddylated CRLs (<a href=\"#bib10\">den Besten et al., 2012</a>). Presumably, the conformational changes that occur during the activation process are connected in some manner. Interestingly, CSN<sup>5E104A</sup> and CSN<sup>6\u2206INS2</sup> both cleave ubiquitin-rhodamine at 0.04 sec<sup>-1</sup> (which is ~6-fold faster than wild type CSN), but CSN<sup>5E104A,6\u2206INS2</sup> is yet fivefold faster (0.2 sec<sup>-1</sup>) than either single mutant (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>). The activities of the single and double mutants imply that the Csn6-\u2206INS2 mutation must destabilize binding of Csn5-E104 to the catalytic zinc, but only in a small fraction (\u226420%) of complexes. Meanwhile, movements at the Csn4/6 interface must do more to the active site than simply disrupt the interaction of Csn5-E104 with the catalytic zinc, implying the existence of at least two inputs to CSN activation. Resolving how binding of substrate is connected to enzyme activation awaits high-resolution structural analyses of the enzyme and substrate in various states."

Removal of Nedd8 increases dissociation of Cul1/Rbx1 by ~7\u201310 fold. We propose that dissociation of the cleaved Nedd8 also removes an impediment to Csn5-INS1, which can now bind the catalytic site zinc via E104 to return CSN to its apo state. This engagement, which we refer to as the \u2018E-vict\u2019 mechanism, is a critical step in what is likely to be a series of conformational rearrangements that include repositioning of Csn5-E76. Collectively, these movements reduce the affinity of CSN for product and accelerate its rate of dissociation by an additional order of magnitude. The removal of Nedd8 and E-vict together bring about an ~100-fold loss in affinity of Cul1/Rbx1 for CSN. The slow dissociation of product from CSN mutants that were unable to undergo E-vict (0.12\u20130.16 s<sup>-1</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) suggests that this mechanism is important for maintaining physiological rates of CRL deneddylation. This is further supported by the observation that Csn5-E104A, but not wild type Csn5, co-precipitates substantial amounts of deneddylated Cul1 from cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Slow clearance of product could explain, in part, the failure of this mutant to complement a Csn5 deficiency (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

The total cullin concentration in the 293T cell line used in this work is ~2200 nM. Meanwhile, the CSN concentration is ~450 nM. Although the total amount of Nedd8-conjugated cullins was not measured, immunoblot data suggest that ~1000 nM is a reasonable estimate. The <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> reported here for the [ES] complex (~2 nM), thus predicts potentially near-complete saturation of the cellular CSN pool with neddylated cullins. This implies that formation of new [ES] complexes is limited by the slowest step in the catalytic cycle, i.e. either the conformational rearrangements or product dissociation. In vitro, CSN follows Briggs-Haldane kinetics and cleaves Nedd8 off nearly every neddylated CRL that it binds. Because CSN is not in equilibrium with its substrates in our simplified in vitro system, it cannot rely on differences in substrate <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> to achieve specificity. Thus, differences in <i>k<sub>off</sub></i> on the order of \u226410-fold, which might occur with different cullins or substrate adaptors, would be predicted to have minimal effects on catalytic efficiency provided that <i>k<sub>on</sub></i> remains roughly the same, as was observed for different configurations of substrate and product in this study. Importantly, this parameter can potentially be profoundly altered by ubiquitylation substrates, E2 enzyme, or other in vivo binding partners of Nedd8-conjugated CRLs, which compete with CSN (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emberley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fischer et al., 2011</a>) and thus should reduce its apparent <i>k<sub>on</sub></i>. It is also conceivable that binding partners might alter the partitioning of the CSN\u2013N8-CRL complex either by increasing <i>k<sub>off</sub></i> and/or reducing <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>, such that N8-CRL bound to an ubiquitylation substrate dissociates prior to completion of the conformational rearrangements that culminate in its deneddylation."

Consistent with this picture, addition of a Nedd8 conjugation inhibitor to cells leads to nearly complete disappearance of neddylated cullins within 5 min, and this does not account for the time it takes the drug to equilibrate across the membrane and deplete the cellular pool of Nedd8~Ubc12 thioesters (<a href=\"#bib40\">Soucy et al., 2009</a>). The dynamic properties of CSN measured here reveal a CRL network of extreme plasticity that can be reconfigured in minutes to respond to changing regulatory inputs. Although quantitative studies of CRL network dynamics remain in their infancy, it is evident that the tools are at hand to begin to understand how these remarkable enzymes function and are regulated within cells."

The mixtures were allowed to reach equilibrium by incubation at room temperature for ~10 min prior to measurements.

Binding assay with Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 (substrate) and CSN<sup>5E76A</sup> were allowed to equilibrate for only 45 s, because although this mutant exhibited an ~300-fold decrease in activity (data not shown) the residual activity was high enough to cause substantial deneddylation in a 10 min incubation. It should be noted that several of the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values reported for CSN binding to Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 or Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1 are below the concentration of the dansylated ligand (30 nM). While this is generally not the preferred approach, we found that 30 nM was the lowest concentration that consistently yielded highly reproducible results. The estimated <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> is very sensitive to the density of data points at the inflection point of the curve, and thus these estimates can be more prone to error. Nevertheless, different investigators in Zurich and Pasadena have consistently obtained an estimate of 1.6\u20135 nM for binding of CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 and of 9\u201313 nM for binding to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> to Cul1<sup>d</sup>/Rbx1, using different protein preparations. To estimate <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>, all data points were fitted to a quadratic equation, Y = Y0+(Ymax-Y0)*(<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>+A+X-sqrt((<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>+A+X)^2-4A*X))/2*A where A equals concentration of labeled protein, using Prism (Graph Pad). On-rate and off-rate measurements were performed on a Kintek Stopped-flow SF-2004 by exciting at 340 nM and collecting emissions through a 520 +/- 20 nm filter. For off-rate measurements, the concentrations of proteins used in each reaction are provided in the legend of <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F-I</a>. Off rate data were fit to one phase decay function: Y=(Y0 - EP)*exp(-<i>k<sub>off</sub></i>*X) + EP (where EP corresponds to reaction end point value).Whereas <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>, on-rate, and off-rate measurements with different configurations of Cul1 or different CSN mutants are directly comparable, off-rate measurements are not directly comparable to <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> measurements and may differ from expectation by a few fold because different buffers were used, the Cul1/Rbx1 preparations were from different sources (bacterial for <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>, baculoviral for <i>k<sub>off</sub></i>), and the Cul1/Rbx1 preparations carried different labels (dansylated Cul1 for <i>k<sub>off</sub></i>, [<sup>32</sup>P]-Nedd8 for <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>."

The grids were manually blotted to produce a thin sample film and plunge-frozen into liquid ethane. Data were collected automatically using EPU software in low dose mode on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope, equipped with a Falcon II direct electron detector (FEI), and operated at 300 kV, an applied nominal defocus from -2.5 to - 5.0 \u00b5m in steps of 0.25 \u00b5m, and 80,460-fold magnification, resulting in a pixel size of 1.74\u2009\u00c5 on the sample scale. Images were collected as seven separate frames with a total dose of 25 e<sup>-</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>."

All micrographs were initially visually inspected and only those with appropriate ice thickness as well as Thon rings in their power spectra showing regularity and extending to 6\u2009\u00c5 or beyond were used for subsequent analysis. In order to generate 2D references for automated particle selection, ~4,000 single particles were manually picked and subjected to 2D classification in RELION. Six well-defined 2D class averages were selected, low-pass filtered to 35\u2009\u00c5 to prevent reference bias, and used as references. Approximately 150,000 single particles were automatically selected and subjected to reference-free 2D and 3D classification, in order to de-select the particles, which resulted in poorly defined or noisy averages. Approximately half of these single particles resulted in a well-defined 3D class average, which resembled the previously published negative stain EM map of the same complex (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enchev et al., 2012</a>). This dataset was subject to 3D auto-refinement in RELION, using a version low-pass filtered to 50 \u00c5as an initial reference. The converged map was further post-processed in RELION, using MTF-correction, FSC-weighting and a soft spherical mask with a 5-pixel fall-off."

The kinetic binding studies were performed with a fixed concentration of Cul1 at 30 nM. However, the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values are in the single nM range, raising questions about the accuracy of the data due to the difficulty in getting accurate values when the protein concentration is higher than <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> due to the steepness of the equilibrium binding graph (see Pollard T.D. 2010, Molecular Biology of the Cell v.21 p4061-4067). For example, the plot of equilibrium binding of WT CSN with Cul1/Rbx1 reports a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 310 nM, which can be easily identified by inspection of the graph in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. In contrast the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values when <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> &lt; 30 nM cannot be inferred from their respective graphs. The problem becomes apparent if one were to plot theoretical graphs of equilibrium binding of <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>s of 1.6 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM where the fixed protein concentration is 30 nM. These graphs would almost lie entirely on top of each other. The data in the paper suggests this problem as the 5 nM <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> measured for CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K</a> doesn't match the previously stated value of 1.6 nM or 10 nM. The differences in dissociation constants are large enough between WT and mutant CSN that the general message of the paper is very likely correct, but it would probably be best if key measurements could be attempted with lower CUL1 levels. However, if this isn't possible for technical reasons, you could perhaps emphasize the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>s in the low nanomolar range (those higher than the reported limit of 1.5 nM). It was also suggested that you may want to describe the limits of the calculated <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 4 nM reported in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> for the SCF Fbxw7-CSN5H138A complexes as the error bars are large."

We settled on a Cul1<sup>d</sup> concentration of 30 nM because it is the lowest concentration at which we can consistently get reliable experimental measurements. While it is possible, when everything works perfectly, to drop the Cul1<sup>d</sup> concentration somewhat below 30 nM, under no circumstances can we work at single digit nM concentrations. We thus cannot make the simplifying assumption that [CSN]<sub>free</sub> = [CSN]<sub>tot</sub> and resorted to the standard practice of using a quadratic equation to estimate the <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>. While it is more challenging (and the results are more prone to error) to measure a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> below the concentration of the species that is held fixed, it is not impossible. <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a> shows theoretical curves calculated for a ligand that binds a receptor (held at 30 nM) with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of, 10 nM, 5 nM and 2 nM. As can be seen, distinguishing between 1.6 and 5 nM is difficult, but the shape of the binding curve we see appears to be consistent with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> well below 10 nM. We feel the most appropriate response given the technical challenges is to state very clearly in the text the limitations of measuring a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> that is below the concentration of the species that is held constant. Accordingly, we now state the following: \u201cNote that the estimated <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> falls well below the fixed concentration of Cul1<sup>d</sup>-N8/Rbx1 used in the assay. This introduces greater uncertainty into our estimate but nevertheless our data suggest that the binding of substrate to CSN<sup>5H138A</sup> is tight (\u22645 nM; see Materials and methods for further discussion of this matter)\u201d."

While this is not optimal, we found that 30 nM was the lowest concentration that consistently yielded highly reproducible results. A <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> was estimated by the standard approach of using a quadratic equation as described above. The estimated <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> is very sensitive to the density of data points at the inflection point of the curve, and thus these estimates can be more prone to error.

Whether it is 1.6 nM or 5 nM is inconsequential. The big surprise is that it is so tight (obviously far below 30 nM). This is unexpected given that the <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> is ~200 nM and the affinity for product is ~100-fold lower, despite the fact that Nedd8 itself appears to have relatively limited affinity for CSN. This extremely high affinity for substrate, the large disconnect between <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>M</sub></i>, and the great drop in affinity upon cleavage of Nedd8 have important implications for physiology, as we describe in the Discussion."
