                    "text": "While the dynamin GTPase Drp1 plays a critical role during mitochondrial fission, mechanisms controlling its recruitment to fission sites are unclear. A current assumption is that cytosolic Drp1 is recruited directly to fission sites immediately prior to fission. Using live-cell microscopy, we find evidence for a different model, progressive maturation of Drp1 oligomers on mitochondria through incorporation of smaller mitochondrially-bound Drp1 units. Maturation of a stable Drp1 oligomer does not forcibly lead to fission. Drp1 oligomers also translocate directionally along mitochondria. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, causes rapid mitochondrial accumulation of actin filaments followed by Drp1 accumulation at the fission site, and increases fission rate. Inhibiting actin polymerization, myosin IIA, or the formin INF2 reduces both un-stimulated and ionomycin-induced Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission. Actin filaments bind purified Drp1 and increase GTPase activity in a manner that is synergistic with the mitochondrial protein Mff, suggesting a role for direct Drp1/actin interaction. We propose that Drp1 is in dynamic equilibrium on mitochondria in a fission-independent manner, and that fission factors such as actin filaments target productive oligomerization to fission sites."

A current assumption is that cytosolic Drp1 is recruited directly to fission sites immediately prior to fission. Using live-cell microscopy, we find evidence for a different model, progressive maturation of Drp1 oligomers on mitochondria through incorporation of smaller mitochondrially-bound Drp1 units. Maturation of a stable Drp1 oligomer does not forcibly lead to fission. Drp1 oligomers also translocate directionally along mitochondria. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, causes rapid mitochondrial accumulation of actin filaments followed by Drp1 accumulation at the fission site, and increases fission rate. Inhibiting actin polymerization, myosin IIA, or the formin INF2 reduces both un-stimulated and ionomycin-induced Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission. Actin filaments bind purified Drp1 and increase GTPase activity in a manner that is synergistic with the mitochondrial protein Mff, suggesting a role for direct Drp1/actin interaction. We propose that Drp1 is in dynamic equilibrium on mitochondria in a fission-independent manner, and that fission factors such as actin filaments target productive oligomerization to fission sites."

We envision two possible models for the process, termed de novo assembly and targeted equilibrium. In de novo assembly, cytosolic Drp1 is recruited specifically to fission sites, where it oligomerizes and mediates fission in a concerted series of steps in response to fission signals (which include OMM receptors, cardiolipin and actin). In targeted equilibrium, Drp1 maintains a constant equilibrium between cytosolic and mitochondrial pools, as well as between dimer and oligomer. These equilibria are independent of fission. Fission signals shift these equilibria toward stable oligomerization at targeted fission sites on the OMM."

Here, we show evidence supporting targeted equilibrium. We observe that mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers mature into stable oligomers through a series of merging events. Some of these Drp1 oligomers are motile\u2014capable of translocating on the mitochondrial surface before engaging in fission. Notably, not all mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers engage in fission. Using ionomycin treatment to induce mitochondrial fission, we show that actin polymerization precedes Drp1 oligomerization, and that actin enriches with Drp1 at fission sites. Inhibition of actin polymerization, INF2 or myosin II decreases ionomycin-induced Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission. Biochemically, actin filaments bind Drp1 directly and enhance its GTPase activity, suggesting that actin filaments can organize Drp1 into a productive oligomer. These results suggest that actin promotes fission by facilitating productive oligomerization of Drp1 on the OMM."

Mitochondrial morphology appears similar between control U2OS and gDrp-U2OS cells (not shown). We also developed a live-cell assay to measure mitochondrial fission rate, in which peripheral cellular regions are imaged over 10 min for dynamics of a fluorescent mitochondrial marker. Fission events are scored based on stable separation of the marker, and similar fission rates are obtained with either a matrix marker or an OMM marker (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Using this assay, the fission rates of control U2OS and gDrp1-U2OS cells are statistically similar (1.26 \u00b1 1.01 versus 1.51 \u00b1 0.69 fission events per mm mitochondrion per min, p = 0.49) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

We observed three distinct dynamic behaviors associated with mitochondrially-bound Drp1 puncta: punctum merging, punctum motility, and mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrially-bound puncta frequently merge together, with successive merging events resulting in punctum growth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>,<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). Merging is a reversible process, and can be followed by splitting of the merged punctum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The combination of these results suggests that a population of Drp1 is in rapid equilibrium between the cytosol and the OMM, and that one mechanism for assembly of larger Drp1 oligomers is through merging of mitochondrially-bound oligomers. We refer to this process as \u2018maturation\u2019. Imaging at higher resolution by Airyscan microscopy suggests that maturing puncta are loosely associated with the mitochondrion, and progressively encircle the mitochondrion as they mature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>)."

However, only a low percentage of Drp1 puncta (2.5% of total puncta and 6.3% of high threshold puncta) engages in observable fission events during the 10 min imaging period. Even for productive puncta, the lag between punctum establishment and mitochondrial fission varies significantly, with a mean of 76.0 \u00b1 40.3 s (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) that appears to be independent of mitochondrial length (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

We previously showed that mitochondrial length increased upon three cellular treatments: inhibition of actin polymerization by Latrunculin A (LatA), siRNA suppression of the formin protein INF2, or inhibition of myosin II by chemical inhibitors or siRNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Korobova et al., 2014</a>). The increase in mitochondrial length suggests a fission defect, but could also reflect changes in mitochondrial fusion. Here, we establish that the effect is on mitochondrial fission, using our live-cell fission assay. Suppression of either INF2 or myosin IIA causes an ~50% decrease in fission rate, whereas Drp1 suppression or expression of the dominant-negative Drp1 K38A mutant cause near-complete inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In addition, suppression of either INF2 or myosin IIA reduces mitochondrially-associated Drp1 puncta, with a moderate reduction of total Drp1 puncta (2.7-fold for both INF2 and myosin IIA) and a larger reduction in high threshold puncta (6.7-fold and 8.3-fold, respectively, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). LatA treatment also causes a reduction in mitochondrially-associated Drp1 puncta, although the degree of high threshold reduction is not as great as for INF2 or myosin IIA suppression (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). These results support the previous results suggesting a role for actin polymerization in mitochondrial Drp1 assembly."

One challenge is the abundance of actin-based structures in U2OS cells. To mitigate this issue, we imaged cells at a focal plane significantly above the ventral surface, where there are fewer actin-based structures such as stress fibers. In this region, we observed frequent examples of actin filaments accumulating prior to fission (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>), but the overall actin filament abundance in the region remained a challenge for determining whether its presence might contribute to fission. To assess the significance of the actin accumulation, we calculated the mean percentage of mitochondrial area covered by actin (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), and compared this number to the percentage of fission events at which actin was present immediately prior to fission. We found that a significantly higher percentage of fission events (56%) were associated with actin filaments than would be expected by random correlation (28%, n = 59 fission events, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014 figure supplement 2C</a>)."

One possibility is that Drp1 binds directly to actin filaments at the fission site, similar to the direct binding between dynamin and actin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Palmer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mooren et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, a previous study demonstrates that actin accumulates at clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites prior to dynamin 2 arrival (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grassart et al., 2014</a>). We tested the possibility of a direct interaction using purified proteins. Through co-sedimentation assay, Drp1 binds actin with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014 figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, less than 50% of the Drp1 binds actin filaments even at saturating actin concentrations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This situation is not caused by a significant pool of \u2018inactive\u2019 Drp1 in our purified preparation, since &gt;90% of the Drp1 pellets when incubated with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We postulate that partial binding is due to differential affinities of Drp1 oligomeric states for actin filaments. In these assays, Drp1 does not change the critical concentration of actin, since actin polymerizes to a similar extent in the absence or presence of Drp1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

It is unclear whether this increased width is due to Drp1 binding a single filament or to Drp1-mediated filament bundling. The width of a Drp1 dimer is 22.9 nm (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fr\u00f6hlich et al., 2013</a>), similar to our measured width. However, Drp1 can induce filament bundling, as evidenced by TIRF microscopy (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, <a href=\"#media14\">Video 14</a>). Indeed, time-lapse imaging of the bundling process suggests that filaments have a preferred bundled orientation, and can be end-bound to the sides of Drp1-bound filaments prior to bundling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>, <a href=\"#media15\">Video 15</a>)."

We tested whether actin filaments could also increase Drp1\u2019s GTPase activity and found a ~3.5-fold increase (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). An additional question is whether actin filaments can synergize with Drp1 receptors on the OMM. We tested this possibility using the cytosolic portion of Mff. Mff alone causes only a slight increase in Drp1 GTPase activity at the concentrations tested. However, the combination of Mff and actin filaments causes a substantial increase in Drp1 activity, far beyond the additive effects of either Mff or actin alone (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). These results show that Drp1 binds actin filaments in a manner that stimulates its catalytic activity, and that actin filaments can synergize with Mff to increase productive Drp1 oligomerization."

Maturation is the progressive association of mitochondrially-bound Drp1 units, leading to assembly of an oligomer that fully encircles the mitochondrion. The size of the mature oligomer is unclear, but might be similar to the 26-40 subunits found for dynamin2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grassart et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cocucci et al., 2014</a>).

There is evidence that OMM proteins such as Mff, MiD49/51, and Fis1, as well as cardiolipin exposure on the OMM, can serve as fission signals. We postulate that actin filaments in proximity to the mitochondrion are another such signal. Other potential factors that might influence fission could include mitochondrial length and mitochondrial branches. We find that fission events occur disproportionately on longer mitochondria, but we do not find an increase in Drp1 puncta density on longer mitochondria, suggesting that maturation is not favored on long mitochondria. It should be realized, however, that most mitochondria exist in a branched network in these cells. The relationship between mitochondrial branching and mitochondrial fission is a fascinating question still to be addressed."

In other words, do the signals work together within the same fission pathway, or act in alternate pathways? Both options could be true, depending on the fission signal. For example, we postulate that actin filaments and cardiolipin might represent alternate maturation factors, since both are polyvalent anions. In contrast, actin filaments could work in concert with Mff, either in \u201ccoincidence detection\u201d by Drp1 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hatch et al., 2014</a>) or by actin filaments serving as a reservoir for delivery of Drp1 oligomers to Mff. Recent work has shown that Mff binds preferentially to oligomerized Drp1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu and Chan, 2015</a>), which is consistent with this possibility. We show here that actin filaments and Mff synergize in stimulating Drp1\u2019s GTPase activity. A final possibility is that specific fission factors mediate distinct steps in the process. For example, a recent study on the membrane-altering ability of the Drp1-cardiolipin interaction might suggest that cardiolipin triggers a conversion step (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stepanyants et al., 2015</a>)."

We cannot detect the smallest oligomers (dimers, tetramers) in this study for several reasons, including: our threshold procedure forcibly removes these from analysis, and only ~ half of the Drp1 in these cells is GFP-labeled. The available data suggest that the recruited unit may be mixed oligomers of GFP-labeled and endogenous Drp1. Recent biochemical studies have shown that Drp1 exists in equilibrium between oligomeric states in solution, with some evidence that dimers are the relevant membrane-recruited unit in the case of cardiolipin binding (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fr\u00f6hlich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Macdonald et al., 2014</a>).

We state \u2018apparently\u2019 because it is possible that these oligomers transfer from another membrane or a cytoskeletal structure.

Our data show that inhibiting actin polymerization inhibits the accumulation of Drp1 oligomers, suggestive of roles in either recruitment or maturation. Direct Drp1 binding to actin filaments near mitochondria might enhance initial mitochondrial binding, or might accelerate oligomerization steps of cytosolic Drp1 prior to mitochondrial interaction, both of which would aid recruitment. Alternately, actin binding to mitochondrially-bound Drp1 might enhance oligomerization on the mitochondrial surface, which would represent maturation. The two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. A related question is: what is myosin II\u2019s role in the process? One possibility is that myosin II activity might lead to Drp1-independent \u2018pre-constriction\u2019 of the OMM, as we have proposed previously (<a href=\"#bib23\">Korobova et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hatch et al., 2014</a>).

There is evidence that mitochondrially-bound Spire 1C and ER-bound INF2 work through the same pathway, suggesting that Spire 1C might serve as a nucleation factor and INF2 as an elongation factor and/or a severing protein. Spire proteins cooperate with other formin proteins in a similar manner (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vizcarra et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Quinlan, 2013</a>). Roles for cortactin and cofilin in the same pathway as Spire 1C/INF2 are possible, but an alternative is that they contribute to a distinct actin-dependent pathway. The fact that steady-state fission rate is only partially reduced by INF2 or myosin IIA suppression (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggests some degree of functional redundancy."

The second investigator scanned the ROIs frame-by-frame manually for fission events, and determined mitochondrial length within the ROI using the ImageJ macro, Mitochondrial Morphology (described in <a href=\"#bib8\">Dagda et al.

For measuring lengths of individual mitochondria, ROIs were selected that enabled imaging of the entire mitochondrial length where possible. Due to the fact that the majority of mitochondrial mass is in the form of a branched mitochondrial \u2018network\u2019 in these cells, and that one end of the network is often in the peri-nuclear region which is difficult to resolve, it was frequently difficult to find both ends of the network, in which case the resolvable length was reported."

However, the mechanisms underlying Drp1 association, oligomerization and dynamics on mitochondrial membrane are incompletely understood. Here, Ji et al., demonstrate that mitochondrially-bound Drp1 oligomers are motile and undergo merging events in order to mature into stable oligomers that are associated with mitochondrial fission. They also show that only a fraction of mitochondrially-associated Drp1 oligomers catalyze fission and that there is typically a long lag-period between the assembly/maturation of Drp1 puncta and the actual fission event. Finally, they provide evidence that actin filaments increase Drp1 accumulation and mitochondrial fission, and that Drp1 directly interacts with actin."

Thus, few additional experiments geared towards understanding the mechanism and function of the peculiar behavior of Drp1 would significantly strengthen the manuscript."

However, we feel that our findings make an important mechanistic advance, in showing that the assembly of productive Drp1 oligomers on mitochondria is through alteration of an equilibrium process that is continuously occurring on mitochondria. Drp1 is constantly binding to and releasing from mitochondria, as well as in equilibrium between oligomeric states both on and off mitochondria, even in the absence of signals for fission. Fission signals (in this case, actin filaments near the fission site) serve to shift this equilibrium toward productive Drp1 oligomerization at fission sites. Our model contrasts with previous models depicting that Drp1 is recruited directly from the cytosol to fission sites in response to fission signals."

We now show evidence that actin filaments and Mff (the cytoplasmic portion) synergize to increase Drp1\u2019s GTPase activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> and Results). These are very exciting results that lead to many new mechanistic hypotheses for us (included in Discussion). Although cardiolipin is an intriguing fission factor, we feel that it could be an \u201calternate\u201d co-activator to actin filaments (both being anionic multivalent surfaces). Our future experiments will focus on mechanistically dissecting the combined effects of actin filaments, cardiolipin and Mff (as well as other OMM receptors) on Drp1 activity. Resolution of this question will require extensive experimentation that we feel is beyond the scope of this manuscript, so we hope that the new data we present are sufficient to provide evidence for the potential physiological significance of the actin/Drp1 interaction."

There are several issues that complicate this analysis. First, most mitochondria are in a network in U2OS cells, which is branched. This network often extends from the periphery to the peri-nuclear region, and it is often difficult to find both ends. Second, the frequency of mitochondrial fission is relatively low and our viewing time is limited (see reviewer 2 comments), making it difficult to conduct this analysis on a large number of events at present. Given these difficulties, we analyze fission events on mitochondria for which we can measure lengths, and find the mitochondria undergoing fission to be generally longer than those not undergoing fission. We also analyze in more detail the number of Drp1 puncta as a function of mitochondrial length, in response to reviewer 2 comment 2, and find that Drp1 punctum number increases linearly with mitochondrial length (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1H</a>). Thus, Drp1 punctum density does not vary with mitochondrial length. Finally, we examine the relationship between mitochondrial length and the \u201clag time\u201d (between stable Drp1 oligomer assembly and fission) and find no apparent correlation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, paragraph six, Results). We think that the aggregate of the information suggests that the reason that fission occurs more readily on longer mitochondria is that there are more Drp1 puncta overall (but not higher density), providing a higher probability that one will become fission-competent. In the Discussion, we add a statement that the issue of mitochondrial branching, and its influence on mitochondrial fission, is a fascinating question still to be addressed (paragraph three, Discussion)."
