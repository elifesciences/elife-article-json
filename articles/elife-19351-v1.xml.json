Auditory signals from cranial nerve VIII (grey) excite the giant Mauthner neurons (blue), which transmit this information down the opposite side of the spinal cord via their axons in order to drive a rapid turn away from the stimulus. Cranial nerve VIII also excites feedforward inhibitory neurons (red), which connect with the Mauthner neurons on both sides, but connect more strongly to the Mauthner neuron on the opposite side of the brain. The feedforward inhibitory populations on each side of the brain also inhibit each other. (<b>B</b>) Left: In response to a non-localized auditory stimulus, fish turn to the left or right with equal probability. Right: destroying the feedforward inhibitory neurons on the left disinhibits the feedforward neurons on the right side of the brain. This leads to stronger inhibition of the Mauthner neuron on the left. The fish is therefore more likely to turn to the left, thanks to the firing of the right Mauthner neuron."

This asymmetry causes greater suppression of the Mauthner cell on the side of the fish that receives weaker input from the stimulus, and\u00a0could\u00a0favor turns in the correct direction. For example, if a sound is heard on the left side of the fish, the Mauthner cell on the right is suppressed more strongly. Thus the Mauthner cell on the left is more likely to fire, causing the muscles to contract on the right side of the body, and leading the fish to\u00a0turn to the right."

How do real fish avoid this unfortunate outcome?"

Modifying the model to incorporate mutual inhibition confirmed this intuition: strong stimuli could now produce appropriately directed turns. Moreover, patch clamp recordings from pairs of inhibitory neurons on both sides of the brain verified the existence of these crossed connections in living fish. Circuits that feature such reciprocal inhibition of inhibition have been shown theoretically to be optimal for rapidly and reliably categorizing inputs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</a>), which is the precise goal of the Mauthner network."

Fortunately, in the small transparent brain of the zebrafish larva, it is possible to selectively destroy single neurons using lasers, and observe the effects on behavior. The model of Koyama et al. makes two predictions of what should happen if the inhibitory neurons on one side are selectively removed. First, the response should occur even faster than before, since the activity of the inhibitory neurons delays the firing of the Mauthner neuron. Second, the fish should be more likely to turn towards the side on which the inhibitory neurons have been destroyed. Experiments performed on zebrafish larvae confirmed these predictions, providing convincing proof that Koyama et al.\u2019s model has captured the essential features of connectivity and dynamics in this small circuit."

Reciprocal inhibition of inhibitory neurons has been observed in other systems, including circuits in the avian midbrain that are involved in competitive stimulus selection (<a href=\"#bib2\">Goddard et al., 2014</a>). In other biological networks, connectivity motifs that have robust and useful dynamical properties are found with greater abundance than less stable ones (<a href=\"#bib12\">Prill et al., 2005</a>). Moreover, the relevant inhibitory neurons were identified and targeted based on previous work from the same group, which showed that transcription factor stripes in the hindbrain define different categories of neurons with distinct projection patterns and neurotransmitter types (<a href=\"#bib3\">Kinkhabwala et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Koyama et al., 2011</a>). These form a common set of building blocks for the circuits that control different behaviors."
