Activation of ATF6\u03b1 promotes cell survival in cancer models. We used cell-based screens to discover and develop Ceapins, a class of pyrazole amides, that block ATF6\u03b1 signaling in response to ER stress. Ceapins sensitize cells to ER stress without impacting viability of unstressed cells. Ceapins are highly specific inhibitors of ATF6\u03b1 signaling, not affecting signaling through the other branches of the UPR, or proteolytic processing of its close homolog ATF6\u03b2 or SREBP (a cholesterol-regulated transcription factor), both activated by the same proteases. Ceapins are first-in-class inhibitors that can be used to explore both the mechanism of activation of ATF6\u03b1 and its role in pathological settings. The discovery of Ceapins now enables pharmacological modulation all three UPR branches either singly or in combination."

Activation of ATF6\u03b1 promotes cell survival in cancer models. We used cell-based screens to discover and develop Ceapins, a class of pyrazole amides, that block ATF6\u03b1 signaling in response to ER stress. Ceapins sensitize cells to ER stress without impacting viability of unstressed cells. Ceapins are highly specific inhibitors of ATF6\u03b1 signaling, not affecting signaling through the other branches of the UPR, or proteolytic processing of its close homolog ATF6\u03b2 or SREBP (a cholesterol-regulated transcription factor), both activated by the same proteases. Ceapins are first-in-class inhibitors that can be used to explore both the mechanism of activation of ATF6\u03b1 and its role in pathological settings. The discovery of Ceapins now enables pharmacological modulation all three UPR branches either singly or in combination."

Many proteins are folded in a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. The cell closely monitors the quality of the work done by this compartment. If the endoplasmic reticulum has more proteins to fold than it can handle, unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate and trigger a stress response called the unfolded protein response. This increases the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum to fold proteins to match the demand. However, if the stress persists, then the unfolded protein response instructs the cell to die to protect the rest of the body."

It is estimated that about one third of all newly synthesized proteins pass through the ER, where they fold and assemble into multi-subunit complexes, and where post-translational modifications such as disulfide bridge formation and glycosylation occur (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braakman and Hebert, 2013</a>). Dedicated quality control mechanisms ensure that only properly folded proteins exit the ER. These mechanisms are part of the cell\u2019s 'proteostasis network' and include chaperone systems to aid in protein folding and ER associated degradation (ERAD) to remove terminally misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ruggiano et al., 2014</a>). In addition, the ER has the ability to adjust its folding capacity upon demand through activation of a homeostatic signaling network, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR directs cell fate - cells that cannot restore homeostasis then initiate apoptosis to prevent secretion or cell surface presentation of misfolded, non-functional proteins (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2014</a>)."

ATF6 is a membrane-tethered transcription factor activated by regulated trafficking and proteolysis producing ATF6-N, the ATF6 fragment that constitutes the functional transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haze et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ye et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). In contrast, the highly conserved kinase-endoribonuclease IRE1 removes an intron from the mRNA encoding the UPR effector XBP1 allowing translation of XBP1s ('s' for spliced), the functional transcription factor variant of this protein (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>). ATF6-N and XBP1s bind to ER stress response (ERSE) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yoshida et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Roy and Lee, 1999</a>) and unfolded protein response (UPRE) elements (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yamamoto et al., 2004</a>), respectively in the promoters of UPR target genes.

Decreasing the load of proteins entering the ER is coordinated by IRE1 and PERK. Regulated IRE1-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD) cleaves ER-targeted mRNAs leading to their degradation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hollien et al., 2009</a>). PERK, a second transmembrane kinase, phosphorylates itself and the \u03b1-subunit of the initiation factor (eIF2-\u03b1) leading to transient inhibition of cap-dependent translation and an increase in translation of UPR effectors with upstream open reading frames (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harding et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sidrauski et al., 2015</a>), including the transcription factor ATF4 and the apoptotic effector CHOP. The balance between survival and death is controlled temporally. Both IRE1 and ATF6 signaling attenuate after prolonged ER stress, removing most of the cytoprotective functions of the UPR (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Haze et al., 2001</a>).

Ceapins do not inhibit activation of either IRE1 or PERK in response to ER stress, nor do they inhibit trafficking and cleavage of SREBP in response to low sterols or ATF6\u03b2 in response to ER stress. Through structure-activity studies we increased the potency of the series ten-fold to an IC<sub>50</sub> of 600 nM. Inhibition of ATF6\u03b1 with Ceapin analogs has no toxicity in unstressed cells but increases the sensitivity of cells to ER stress inducers, closely mimicking the genetic ablation of ATF6\u03b1 in mice. This makes Ceapins the most selective class of ATF6\u03b1 inhibitors identified to date and the first to act through a mechanism distinct from protease inhibition or general trafficking between the ER and the Golgi."

As expected, the translation inhibitor cycloheximide ('CHX', <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>) prevented MPZ-GFP expression, and treatment of the cells with an ER stressor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) or with an S1P inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hay et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hawkins et al., 2008</a>) did not block doxycycline-induced MPZ-GFP expression.

To begin mapping the action of the inhibitors to the steps of ATF6 activation, we next determined the subcellular localization of ATF6\u03b1 using a cell line that stably expresses GFP-ATF6\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). Using an antibody against GRP94 to mark the ER and a DNA stain to mark the nucleus, we examined the ratio of GFP intensity between the nucleus and the ER. In unstressed cells, GFP-ATF6\u03b1 colocalized with GRP94, indicating its predominant localization in the ER (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Upon ER stress, GFP-ATF6\u03b1 translocated to the nucleus and colocalized with DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, yellow in merged image). As a positive control, when we inhibited ATF6 cleavage by S1P, GFP-ATF6\u03b1 no longer translocated to the nucleus but accumulated in perinuclear punctae, corresponding to the Golgi apparatus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in <a href=\"#bib16\">Gallagher and Walter (2016)</a>). We classified compounds that decreased or inhibited nuclear translocation as 'Class 1 inhibitors'. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> shows Ceapin-A1 as an example in this class showing decreased nuclear GFP signal and perinuclear GFP-ATF6\u03b1 punctae. We classified compounds that allowed nuclear translocation but inhibited reporter transcription as 'Class 2 inhibitors'. By our definition, Class 2 inhibitors act downstream of ER-Golgi trafficking, proteolysis, and nuclear import of ATF6. These inhibitors may act by preventing DNA binding or interaction with transcriptional co-activators, such as NF-Y (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yoshida et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2000</a>)."

Dashed grey lines indicate the relative luciferase activity of unstressed and stressed controls.\u00a0(<b>B</b>)\u00a0ER stress induced upregulation of the endogenous ATF6\u03b1 target gene GRP78 in U2-OS cells. Cells were treated without (DMSO, open circles) or with ER stress (100 nM Tg, black squares) in the absence or presence of inhibitors for four hours prior to isolation of mRNA. Upregulation of GRP78 mRNA was measured using qPCR. mRNA levels for GRP78 were normalized to GAPDH for each well and then compared to unstressed and stressed controls. ER stress induced GRP78 mRNA induction is inhibited by co-incubation with either S1P inhibitor (2.3 \u03bcM Pf-429424, red) or Ceapin-A1 (10 \u03bcM, green) but not the inactive Ceapin analog A5 (10 \u03bcM, blue). Inhibition of the ISR (200 nM or 400 nM ISRIB, orange) partially inhibits GRP78 induction while inhibition of IRE1 (10 \u03bcM 4\u00a0\u03bc8C, grey) has only minor effects. Data plotted is the mean percent activation of GRP78 transcription relative to unstressed (0%) and stressed (100%) controls from two or three independent experiments, each with duplicate reactions carried out on duplicate wells. (<b>C</b>) Induction of SREPB processing by lipoprotein depletion in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were grown in lipoprotein deficient media for 16.5\u2009hr prior to addition of either sterols or inhibitors for five hours. One hour prior to lysis proteasome inhibitor (25 \u03bcg/mL ALLN) was added to prevent the degradation of the cleaved SREBP-N fragment. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for SREPB1 and GAPDH. Arrowheads denote positions of full-length (SREBP) and cleaved (SREBP-N) variants of SREBP1. Lipoprotein depletion induces cleavage of SREBP (lanes 1, 11) that is inhibited by addition of sterols (10 \u03bcg/mL cholesterol, 1 \u03bcg/mL 25-hydroxycholesterol, lanes 2, 12) or increasing concentrations of a S1P inhibitor (Pf-429242, lanes 7\u201310) but not increasing concentrations of Ceapin-A1 (lanes 3\u20136). Data shown is representative of three independent experiments. (<b>D</b>)\u00a0Induction of ATF6\u03b1 processing by ER stress in T-Rex cells expressing FLAG-tagged ATF6\u03b1. Arrowheads denote positions of full-length (ATF6\u03b1), cleaved membrane-bound (ATF6\u03b1-M) and cleaved nuclear (ATF6\u03b1-N) variants of ATF6. Cells were treated without (lanes 1,6,11) or with (lanes 2,7,12) ER stressor (100 nM Tg) alone or in combination with either S1P inhibitor (0.75 \u03bcM Pf-429242, lanes 3,4,8,9,13,14) or Ceapin-A1 (14.95 \u03bcM, lanes 5,10,15) for two hours prior to harvesting. One hour prior to lysis proteasome inhibitor (MG132, 10 \u03bcM) was added. Cells were harvested and separated by centrifugation into total, membrane and nuclear fractions and analyzed by Western blot for ATF6\u03b1 (anti-FLAG), PERK (membrane control), ATF4 (nuclear control) and GAPDH (loading control). Note that totals were run on 10% gels while membrane and nuclear fractions were run on gradient gels to visualize the migration differences between ATF6\u03b1-N and ATF6\u03b1-M and between PERK and phosphorylated PERK respectively. Data shown is representative of two independent experiments."

The distributions showed a wide range of responses within the population of cells in each well. To compare wells treated with different inhibitors, we extracted from these distributions a single metric representing the percentage of stressed cells for each well, as described in the Methods. This allowed us to convert single cell measurements of GFP-ATF6\u03b1 from the images to compare across plates. We performed these analyses in biological triplicates. Statistical evaluation of unstressed and stressed controls yielded a mean Z\u2019 of 0.7 +/- 0.18, which is an exceptionally robust read-out for a cell- and image-based high-throughput assay. We further validated the analyses using S1P inhibitor as a positive control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and F</a>).

To this end, we monitored the processing of endogenous SREBP1 in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Cells grown in lipoprotein-deficient media activate SREBP processing, indicated by the presence of faster migrating, cleaved SREBP-N (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, lanes 1 and 11). This cleavage was blocked by the addition of either sterols (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, lanes 2 and 12) or increasing concentrations of the S1P inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, lanes 7\u201310) to the cell culture media.

Induction of ER stress led to cleavage of full-length ATF6\u03b1 to produce the faster migrating, active transcription factor ATF6\u03b1-N (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, lanes 1 and 2). Surprisingly, in the presence of the S1P inhibitor, ER stress-induced cleavage of ATF6\u03b1 was not blocked (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, lanes 3 and 4). This was unexpected, given that inhibition of S1P prevented both nuclear translocation of GFP- ATF6\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and F</a>) and upregulation of ATF6\u03b1 target genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>). As a first clue on how to resolve the paradox, we observed that the cleavage product, henceforth referred to as ATF6\u03b1-M, produced in the presence of the S1P inhibitor migrated more slowly on SDS polyacrylamide gels than the product ATF6\u03b1-N produced by ER stress alone."

In contrast to ER stressed cells, where ATF6\u03b1 was recovered in the membrane fraction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, lane 12) and ATF6\u03b1-N is in the nuclear fraction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, lane 7), both ATF6\u03b1 and ATF6\u03b1-M were recovered in in the membrane fraction in cells treated with ER stress inducer and the S1P inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, lane 14). We therefore denoted this fragment as ATF6\u03b1-M, since it remains membrane-bound and as such is incapable of entering the nucleus and activating ATF6\u03b1 target genes. The transmembrane protein PERK and the transcription factor ATF4 served as controls for membrane and nuclear fractions respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We observed the same fragment in cells expressing a variant of ATF6\u03b1, in which the S1P cleavage site was mutated (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), indicating that an alternate protease generated ATF6\u03b1-M and that ATF6\u03b1-M was not a substrate for subsequent membrane-release by S2P cleavage. Importantly, cells treated with both ER stress inducer and Ceapin-A1 did not show any ATF6\u03b1 cleavage product (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, lanes 5, 10, 15). This difference strongly suggested that the mechanism of inhibition of ATF6\u03b1 processing by Ceapin-A1 is not via protease inhibition, but that ATF6\u03b1 is trapped in a place or state where it cannot be cleaved. For this reason, we chose to name the chemical scaffold of the inhibitor 'Ceapin', after the Irish verb \u2018ceap\u2019 meaning to trap."

We used the ERSE-luciferase assay to guide structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies aimed at defining the essential pharmacophore within the Ceapin scaffold. We found that all four rings present in Ceapin-A1 are necessary for activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, deletion of the furan ring (as in Ceapin-A2) led to a loss of detectable activity in the ERSE-luciferase assay. Among several aryl and heteroaryl rings examined in place of the furan, only a simple phenyl ring as in Ceapin-A3 (IC<sub>50</sub> 6.9 \u00b1 0.7) afforded activity comparable to Ceapin-A1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.9 \u00b1 1.2\u2009\u03bcM). The benzyl substituent on the pyrazole ring was similarly sensitive to modification. Thus, analogs lacking the ortho and para chloro substituents (Ceapin-A4) or bearing methyl in place of the benzyl group (Ceapin-A5) were inactive (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and D</a>). Further SAR of ring substitution in the benzyl side chain revealed that substitution at both the ortho and para position with spheroid hydrophobes was optimal for activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, the 2,4-dibromobenzyl analog Ceapin-A6 was about two-fold more potent than Ceapin-A1, while the corresponding bis-trifluoromethyl congener Ceapin-A7 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.59 \u00b1 0.17\u2009\u03bcM) was approximately ten-fold more potent than Ceapin-A1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>). In contrast, analogs bearing a single trifluoromethyl group at either the para (Ceapin-A8) or ortho position (Ceapin-A9) were notably less potent than Ceapin-A7.

ATF6\u03b1 and ATF6\u03b2 show 41% identity in their amino acid sequences, with both S1P and S2P cleavage sites conserved. ATF6\u03b2 is activated with similar kinetics and in response to the same stressors as ATF6\u03b1 and, as ATF6\u03b1, moves from the ER to the Golgi apparatus where it is processed by S1P and S2P to release ATF6\u03b2-N from the membrane allowing its nuclear translocation. Given the similarity between these related proteins, we next tested if Ceapins inhibit processing of ATF6\u03b2 in response to ER stress. To this end, we treated U2-OS cells either with Tg or Tm in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of Ceapin-A7 or with S1P inhibitor and analyzed the migration pattern of both endogenous ATF6\u03b1 and ATF6\u03b2-derived bands (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

We further confirmed that while ATF6\u03b2-N is not present in nuclear extracts of ER stressed cells treated with S1P inhibitor, cells subjected to ER stress in the absence or presence of Ceapin-A7 both have nuclear localized ATF6\u03b2-N (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We treated cells with or without ER stressor at different concentrations in the absence or presence of Ceapin-A7 and analyzed the cells by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

At low concentrations of ER stress (10 nM Tg), inhibition of ATF6\u03b1 did not enhance cytotoxicity, however as the concentration of ER stressor was increased (30 nM and 90 nM), ATF6\u03b1 inhibition resulted in a two-fold increase in apoptotic cells compared to cells treated with ER stressor alone. Thus human cells treated with ER stress and Ceapin-A7 phenocopy the results obtained using genetic ablation of ATF6\u03b1 in mouse models. Ceapins therefore define a first-in-class series of ATF6\u03b1 inhibitors that selectively blocks ATF6\u03b1 and not ATF6\u03b2, SREBP or other UPR branches without relying on inhibition of the proteases that are also used by other critical signaling pathways."

We successfully isolated compounds that act both upstream of proteolytic cleavage, corresponding to the early stages of activation of ATF6\u03b1, and downstream of nuclear import, corresponding to transcriptional activation. From over 100,000 compounds screened, we found one, Ceapin-A1, that is not only selective for ATF6\u03b1 but acts precisely at its initial activation stage that currently is the least understood step.

Further underscoring their high selectivity, Ceapins show no toxicity to unstressed cells, consistent with the fact that ATF6\u03b1 knockout mice are viable and fertile. Loss of ATF6\u03b1 becomes detrimental when cells or animals are treated with ER stressors, and Ceapin action mimics this effect. Thus Ceapins promise to be invaluable, first-in-class tools to investigate the role of ATF6\u03b1 independently or in combination with inhibition of other UPR branches in models of human disease."

In a cystic fibrosis model, knockdown of ATF6\u03b1 was shown to increase delivery of the poorly folded \u25b3F508 variant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the plasma membrane where it could function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kerbiriou et al., 2007</a>).

In contrast, enhancing ATF6\u03b1 activity using inducible activation of ATF6\u03b1-N increased quality control of protein folding in the ER and decreased secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins involved in light chain amyloidosis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cooley et al., 2014</a>).

As these examples illustrate, appreciating the level of cross talk and compensation between UPR branches is essential to the design of successful UPR-based therapeutic strategies. To date, this was only possible for IRE1 and PERK. With the identification of Ceapins, we finally have tools to modulate all three branches and to unleash the full potential of UPR modulation that has remained theoretical up to this point."

The highest concentration of thapsigargin was 90 nM and six 1:3 serial dilutions were performed. The final DMSO concentration for all samples including the DMSO only control was 0.034%. Breathable seals were used to seal the plate and placed in the incubator in a humidified chamber. At 72\u2009hr, PrestoBlue Cell Viability Reagent (Life Technologies #A13262) was added to each well and incubated at 37C for 10 min and read on a plate reader as described by the manufacturer. PrestoBlue Cell Viability Reagent is a Resazurin based cell viability indicator that is reduced to a highly fluorescent molecule by viable cells. For data analysis the background (wells with media without cells) was subtracted from the experimental wells and viability relative to the DMSO treated wells was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The means of four independent experiments performed in triplicate were graphed using GraphPad Prism using the non-linear regression Sigmoidal, 4PL, X is log (Concentration) equation. The absolute EC50 was calculated in GraphPad Prism to interpolate X at 50% with 95% confidence intervals."

Using a cell-based reporter screen, just over 100K compounds were screened with extensive secondary screens to yield a single compound designated Ceapin-A1 that specifically inhibits ATF6\u03b1 activation without effect on other arms of the UPR nor interfering with basic mechanisms involved in ATF6\u03b1 processing. The molecule was altered further to yield several variants including inactive Ceapin-A5 and a higher potency Ceapin-A7. This is the first time the ATF6\u03b1 pathway has been successfully \"drugged\" and completes the range of inhibitors for all three arms of the mammalian UPR. Interestingly, the authors also shed new light on the SKI-1/S1P inhibitor pf-429242's effect on ATF6 processing, which was previously not known in detail as it was used primarily to study its effects on viral membrane proteins."
