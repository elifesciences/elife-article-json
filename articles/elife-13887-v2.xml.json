Here, we show that the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-resident protein anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), a soluble protein-disulfide isomerase involved in ER protein folding and quality control, is secreted and interacts with the ECM. Extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) is a microenvironmental regulator of epithelial tissue architecture, which plays a role in the preneoplastic phenotype and contributes to epithelial tumorigenicity. Indeed, eAGR2, is secreted as a functionally active protein independently of its thioredoxin-like domain (CXXS) and of its ER-retention domain (KTEL), and is sufficient, by itself, to promote the acquisition of invasive and metastatic features. Therefore, we conclude that eAGR2 plays an extracellular role independent of its ER function and we elucidate this gain-of-function as a novel and unexpected critical ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic regulator of epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis."

Here, we show that the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-resident protein anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), a soluble protein-disulfide isomerase involved in ER protein folding and quality control, is secreted and interacts with the ECM. Extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) is a microenvironmental regulator of epithelial tissue architecture, which plays a role in the preneoplastic phenotype and contributes to epithelial tumorigenicity. Indeed, eAGR2, is secreted as a functionally active protein independently of its thioredoxin-like domain (CXXS) and of its ER-retention domain (KTEL), and is sufficient, by itself, to promote the acquisition of invasive and metastatic features. Therefore, we conclude that eAGR2 plays an extracellular role independent of its ER function and we elucidate this gain-of-function as a novel and unexpected critical ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic regulator of epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis."

Polarization is initiated by signaling from cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM contacts (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nelson and Bissell, 2006</a>). Polarization of epithelial cells is implicit for the development of lumens, which are essential for glandular tissues to carry out their normal functions. Conversely, loss of tissue organization is among the earliest hallmarks of epithelial cancer. Therefore, understanding mechanisms of lumen and apical surface formation will improve future prospects for therapy."

Enhanced intracellular AGR2 (iAGR2) expression is observed in many cancers (reviewed in Ref [<a href=\"#bib6\">Chevet et al., 2013</a>]). Previously, we have demonstrated that iAGR2 overexpression could represent a mechanistic intermediate between endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC) and tumor development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Higa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chevet et al., 2013</a>). In such model, increased iAGR2 expression could enhance ER protein homeostasis/proteostasis thereby allowing tumor cells to cope with abnormal protein production and secretion and contributing to the aggressiveness of cancer (<a href=\"#bib19\">Higa et al., 2011</a>). The latter was demonstrated using both in vitro and in vivo approaches (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chevet et al., 2013</a>). Although the iAGR2-mediated ER proteostasis control model is appealing, it was also observed that in cancer, AGR2 was present in the extracellular space, serum, and urine (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Park et al., 2011</a>), thereby opening other avenues for its role on tumor microenvironment. Despite the detailed characterization of its intracellular function, the physiological role of extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) remains unknown. AGR2 is a Protein-Disulfide Isomerase (PDI), PDIA17 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Persson et al., 2005</a>), and although the intracellular roles of PDIs have been well documented, some of these proteins were also found in the extracellular milieu, with unclear functions. For instance, we have previously shown that PDIA2 is secreted into the lumen of the thyroid follicles by thyrocytes to control extracellular thyroglobulin folding and multimerisation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delom et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Delom et al., 2001</a>). Further, PDIA3 was found to be secreted and to interact with ECM proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dihazi et al., 2013</a>) and QSOX1 was reported to participate in laminin assembly thereby controlling ECM functionality (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ilani et al., 2013</a>)."

Therefore, to address whether eAGR2 could act as a pro-oncogenic molecule in the ECM, we have used our human epithelial organoid model (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fessart et al., 2013</a>). We demonstrate, for the first time, that eAGR2 plays an extracellular role independent of its ER function and we elucidate this gain-of-function as a novel and unexpected critical ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic regulator of epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis."

High AGR2 expression was only observed in lung tumor cell lines (A549, H23, H1838) compared to a non-tumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). Moreover, the expression pattern of AGR2 in tumor and non-tumor bronchial organoids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) was similar to that observed in 2D culture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Immunohistochemistry of AGR2 in a cohort of 34 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) revealed that AGR2 was overexpressed in tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Consequently, AGR2 expression was increased in NSCLC tissues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and was essentially restricted to type II pneumocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We then used a log-rank test with Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates to analyze the cohort in order to stratify patient samples as having high, low/intermediate AGR2 expression status (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). High AGR2 expression correlated with low survival rate and the low/intermediate AGR2 expression with high survival rate in NSCLCs patients (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Hence NSCLC patients can be sorted into poor and good prognosis groups as a function of high or low/intermediate AGR2 expression levels, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo correlations between AGR2 expression levels and lung cancer, suggesting a function for this protein in tumor development, progression and aggressiveness."

First, we monitored the efficacy of AGR2 depletion using immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D,G</a>) and Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E,H</a>). Cell growth was strongly inhibited in Sh-AGR2 cells compared to control cells (Sh-ctl) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F,I\u2013J</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) with no cell death detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). Interestingly, soft-agar colony formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L\u2013N</a>) (used as indicator of malignant transformation) significantly reduced upon AGR2 silencing in adenocarcinoma cell lines, thereby indicating that AGR2 may favor tumor progression by increasing anchorage-independent growth. To further characterize the role of AGR2 in cancer, we assessed the impact of AGR2 depletion using the 3D human bronchial organoids system which we previously established (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fessart et al., 2013</a>). AGR2 silencing dramatically decreased the formation of tumor organoids (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). To determine whether AGR2 is required for tumor progression in vivo, we then evaluated the in vivo\u00a0tumorigenic potential of Sh-ctl and Sh-AGR2 cells using two different adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549 and H1838), following tail vein injection in immunodeficient mice. Sh-ctl mice presented large metastases that were easily detected at the surface of the lungs compared to mice injected with Sh-AGR2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). Moreover, AGR2 depletion significantly reduced total metastasis number (by ~50%) in both A549-Sh-AGR2 and H1838-Sh-AGR2 injected mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). Taken together, these results show that overexpression of AGR2 in cancer cells increases their tumorigenic and metastatic potential."

To ensure that the presence of eAGR2 in the extracellular medium correlated to its overall level of expression, we also assessed the levels of eAGR2 in non-tumor organoids overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Similarly, we found that eAGR2 was secreted in the extracellular medium from HEBC-AGR2 organoids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

AGR2 protein was immunoprecipitated from both intracellular and extracellular organoid extracts and analyzed by Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In adenocarcinoma organoids (H23), we found ~20% of eAGR2 and ~80% of iAGR2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), while in non-tumor organoids (HBEC-EV), AGR2 protein was exclusively intracellular (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In contrast, AGR2 overexpression in non-tumor organoids (HBEC-AGR2) forced the secretion of eAGR2 (~30% in the extracellular medium) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Next, to test if the distribution of AGR2 could modify other components of the secretory pathway, a ratiometric comparison of both BiP and CANX was performed in tumor organoids (Sh-ctl) as compared to tumor organoids silenced for AGR2 (Sh-AGR2) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Results showed that of AGR2 depletion had no impact on BiP and CANX expression. Similarly, we found no difference in the expression of BiP and CANX between non-tumor organoids overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) or not (HBEC-EV) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5-\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) indicating that the secretory pathway was not altered upon changes in AGR2 expression. To further correlate the amount of AGR2 produced by tumor organoids to the capacity of cancer cells to secrete eAGR2, we transiently blocked protein synthesis using a cycloheximide (CHX) pulse-chase approach and evaluated the amounts of iAGR2 and eAGR2 in tumor organoids. After 8\u2009hr of CHX treatment, eAGR2 was practically undetectable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>), whereas ~60% of iAGR2 was still present. These results demonstrate that CHX treatment significantly reduces AGR2 protein synthesis which impacts on AGR2 protein secretion. Indeed, extracellular AGR2 rapidly disappeared from the culture medium through yet unknown mechanisms and became undetectable within 8\u2009hr of CHX treatment, due to the attenuated iAGR2 synthesis and the subsequent reduction of the secreted pool. Although we have not yet identified the mechanisms by which eAGR2 disappears from the medium, several hypothesis could be postulated concerning its extracellular fate. As such the secreted protein could be i) trapped in the ECM and become unavailable as a free protein in the medium; ii) aggregated and therefore remain in the unsoluble fraction before biochemical analysis; iii) degraded by extracellular proteases released by the cell or even iv) internalized by the cells and degraded through an endolysosomal pathway. Thus, the precise mechanisms by which eAGR2 disappears remain to be further investigated."

This questioned the accessibility of the ER-retention motif present on AGR2, namely the KTEL sequence. Although AGR2 KTEL was described to bind to KDELR1 and to a lesser extent to KDELR2 and 3 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Alanen et al., 2007</a>), the secretion of AGR2 might indicate a mechanism specific to this protein. Structural analysis of AGR2 showed that the KTEL motif stemmed out of the core protein and had no interaction with the rest of the protein. The protein backbone is displayed as 'tube' model with the atoms in the KTEL sequence shown in stick format (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Residue interactions within the KTEL motif are seen more clearly: the NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group of K172 forms a very clear salt bridge to the C-terminal carboxylic group of L175, which yields a stable 'hook' shape (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>, bottom panel). Thus, it appears that the KTEL motif really stands out of the core protein and is accessible to bind to its receptors. To explore the functional significance of the KTEL motif for the AGR2 secretion, HEK-293T cells which do not secrete AGR2, were used (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J\u2013K</a>). HEK-293T cells were transfected with different AGR2 mutant constructs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>) in which the KTEL motif was mutated to either KDEL, K172D, K172A or a STOP was inserted before the KTEL (\u0394KTEL) and the secretion of AGR2 protein was assessed by the presence of AGR2 protein in the extracellular medium. The eAGR2 levels in cells expressing the AGR2 mutants, in the extracellular milieu, were at least equal to that observed in cells expressing wild-type AGR2. Therefore, none of our different KTEL motif mutants displayed a specific intracellular localization and all were secreted."

To investigate the interaction between ECM and eAGR2, HBEC cell-derived ECM was purified from HBEC cells overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) or not (HBEC-EV). Since the synthesis and organization of ECM increases with time (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rashid et al., 2012</a>), ECM was isolated after 8 days of culture (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a>). Western blotting revealed the presence of the ECM component laminin in both HBEC-EV and HBEC-AGR2 cell-derived matrices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M</a>), however AGR2 was only detected in the ECM derived from HBEC-AGR2 cell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M</a>).

To this end, we purified recombinant human AGR2-AXXA, the inactive form of AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>). AGR2-AXXA mutant, in the ECM of AGR2-depleted organoids, did not restore the formation of tumor organoids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). However, the AGR2-AXXA mutant might be improperly folded as displayed in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. The sequence C81-S84 is a loop connecting a \u03b2-sheet strand with an \u03b1-helix. The mutation to A could affect the structure, since we thereby loose the key interactions stabilizing the 'folding'/closure of that loop (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). S84 forms strong hydrogen bonds to both the carboxylic acid of D79 and the backbone carbonyl of L78 (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, we used another inactive form of AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain, the AGR2-SXXS mutant. In contrast to the AGR2-AXXA mutant, AGR2-SXXS mutant restored the formation of AGR2-depleted tumor organoids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). These results show that the single cysteine residue in the AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain is not essential for the formation of tumor organoids. To further assess the redox function of eAGR2 in such process, we treated tumor organoids depleted in AGR2 (H23-Sh-AGR2) with dithiothreitol (DTT) at a concentration of 5\u00b5M and no cell death was detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). The addition of DTT to the medium of AGR2-depleted H23 cells neither reversed the cell growth inhibition induced by AGR2 depletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>) nor restored the formation of tumor organoids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>).

As expected, eAGR2 enhanced organoid growth ten-fold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>). To determine whether eAGR2 acts through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, conditioned media from HBEC cells stably infected with empty vector (HBEC-EV) or overexpressing AGR2 (HBEC-AGR2) were added to HBEC organoids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>). Conditioned media from control (HBEC-EV) did not significantly stimulate the formation of HBEC organoids. In contrast, conditioned media from HBEC-AGR2 stimulates the formation of non-tumorigenic organoids eight-fold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>). This demonstrated that eAGR2 secreted by organoids and the bacterially expressed human recombinant AGR2 are both active and have the same role on the organoid growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K\u2013L</a>). Next, to confirm that eAGR2 achieved its functions through an autocrine/paracrine manner, we explored the functional effect of the AGR2-\u0394KTEL protein, which is secreted and not retained by the KDEL receptors of the ER (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>), on non-tumorigenic organoids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M</a>). HBECs were infected with either empty vector (HBEC-EV) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M</a>) or AGR2-\u0394KTEL containing vector (HBEC-AGR2-\u0394KTEL) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M</a>). AGR2-\u0394KTEL overexpression increased the formation of organoids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M</a>), thereby confirming that the expression of AGR2 dictates organoid-initiating frequency through an autocrine/paracrine manner. These results demonstrate that eAGR2 extracellular functions were independent of its thioredoxin-like domain and occurred through an autocrine/paracrine manner on organoid-initiating frequency, a phenotype of transformed tumor cells."

We showed that eAGR2-induced re-distribution of polarization markers using confocal microscopy in HBEC organoids (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a> (bottom and right panels), the apical marker GM130 was randomly distributed throughout the HBEC organoids in presence of eAGR2 in the ECM, in contrast to its restriction to the apical localization in HBEC organoids in the absence of eAGR2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a> (top and left panels). Fluorescence intensity cross-section profile (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) revealed that the intensity of GM130 (green) had two side peaks that referred to the control HBEC organoid shell (- eAGR2). In presence of eAGR2, GM130 distributed randomly within the HBEC organoid (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Similarly, control HBEC organoids exhibited a lumen lined by the tight junction marker ZO-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and D</a>; top and left panels), whereas ZO-1 was no longer restricted to the lumen compartment upon eAGR2 exposure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and D</a>; bottom and right panels). Thus, eAGR2 in the ECM, resulted in a disruption of apicobasal polarity, of non-tumorigenic organoids. Therefore, we hypothesize that eAGR2 determines the orientation of epithelial polarity and thereby lumen formation. Hence, we next investigated the development of lumen in HBEC organoids, in the absence (- eAGR2) or in the presence (+ eAGR2) in the ECM of eAGR2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013G</a>) using apical F-actin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). The presence of eAGR2, at the time of plating, gave rise to organoids unable to form a lumen (+ eAGR2) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013G</a>) thereby showing that eAGR2 interferes with the formation of hollow organoid.

The expression of 84 EMT genes was quantified and presented as a Volcano plot (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The addition of eAGR2 to the organoids ECM significantly modified EMT transcripts such as Wnt5b (~thirteen-fold), MMP3 (~eleven-fold), MAP1B (~ten-fold), MMP9 (~eight-fold), ZEB1 (~three-fold), and VIM (~two-fold) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>).

These experiments showed that eAGR2 disrupted laminin layers to invasive structures (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>).

To our knowledge, this is the first time eAGR2 is characterized in the epithelial tissue morphogenesis and tumorigenesis, and this information will increase our understanding of the biological and physiological properties of AGR2 in this field. Studies in the last decade demonstrated that despite the integrity of its KTEL signal (ER retention motif) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>), the ER-resident AGR2 is secreted in various cancers (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chevet et al., 2013</a>). AGR2 is retained in the ER through a mechanism involving its KTEL motif and the three KDEL receptors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Alanen et al., 2007</a>). To further support this aspect, we showed that AGR2 KTEL motif is accessible to bind to the KDEL receptors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that eAGR2 secretion is independent of the KTEL sequence and, is not a consequence of cell death or \u201cleaky\u201d release of ER proteins into the extracellular medium. Moreover, the secretory pathway was not dramatically altered upon exposure to eAGR2. Hence, our data show that the production of AGR2 is linked to the amount of secreted eAGR2. Recent studies have suggested that different affinities for the KDEL receptors may impact on subcellular distribution, the latter being dynamic and dependent on conditions such as cell density or growth media (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alanen et al., 2011</a>). This could explain how high levels of iAGR2 expression in cancer cells combined with higher cell density and/or altered growth media could impact on the amount and rate of eAGR2 secretion."

Hence, these data suggest an important role for eAGR2 in controlling ECM functionality, and most likely in the remodeling of tumor microenvironment. A similar role was described for PDIA3 in remodeling of the ECM during renal fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dihazi et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, high levels of eAGR2 could directly contribute to the tumorigenecity of tumor cells. Indeed, AGR2 depletion in cancer cells significantly decreased tumor cell proliferation, suggesting that high levels AGR2 in tumor cells is important for sustaining tumor cell growth. This is consistent with the observation that conditioned media from cells silenced for AGR2 have a reduced ability to stimulate proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Arumugam et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, our data show that restoration of eAGR2 in the microenvironment of AGR2-knockdown tumor cells reversed AGR2 depletion-induced cell growth inhibition and thus indicate that the reduced cell proliferation induced by AGR2 depletion is most likely due to the reduction of eAGR2 in the tumor microenvironment."

This is independent of iAGR2 since the reduced tumor organoids formation in AGR2-depleted cells can be restored by addition of exogenous eAGR2. It has been reported that the carboxyl-terminal KTEL domain is specifically required for intracellular AGR2 enzymatic function (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>). Our data reveal that for the eAGR2 extracellular activity, the KTEL motif is not required. Remarkably,, tumor organoid formation was restored when AGR2-depleted tumor organoids were supplemented with AGR2-SXXS (thioredoxin inactive), but not in the presence of reducing agent This result suggests a protein-protein interaction between eAGR2 and ECM proteins and/or proteins involved in the control of cell adhesion and cell-matrix interaction in an AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain independent fashion. The interaction of AGR2 with several proteins involved in such processes has been described in the literature. Indeed, AGR2 was found to interact with DAG1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fletcher et al., 2003</a>), LYPD3 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Alanen et al., 2007</a>), C4.4A (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arumugam et al., 2015</a>), however the exact mechanisms by which AGR2 interacts with those proteins remains unclear and must be further investigated. Nevertheless, our data suggest that this occurs in a thioredoxin-like domain independent fashion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that eAGR2 drives tumor organoids formation, not by changing the redox nature of microenvironment but through its presence within the ECM. However, the precise mechanisms remain to be further investigated. Our experiments provide the first evidence that eAGR2 has a crucial biological function in the tumorigenesis of cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that eAGR2 could be a pro-oncogenic protein secreted in the ECM."

                        "text": "To confirm that eAGR2 is indeed, an ECM microenvironmental pro-oncogenic protein, we investigated the effects of overexpressing AGR2 in human bronchial epithelial non-tumor cells. We found that overexpressing AGR2 enhanced cell proliferation and increased the formation of organoids. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM was sufficient to impact on cell\u2019s autocrine/paracrine signaling to in turn enhance organoid-initiating frequency. Therefore, we investigated the pro-oncogenic mechanisms of eAGR2 in non-tumor organoids to mimic the conditions under which eAGR2 acts in vivo. In normal conditions, HBECs form polarized and spherical organoids with hollow lumens, however in the presence of eAGR2 in the ECM, these identical cells form large, non-polarized, undifferentiated organoids without lumen, therefore mimicking tumor organoids. Disruption of cell polarity and tissue organization is reported to be an important event for the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis. Hence, eAGR2 alone is sufficient to confer a tumorigenic phenotype in non-tumor organoids. We next examined the impact of eAGR2 on cell\u2013cell adhesion and the development of invasive structures. We demonstrated that eAGR2: i) promotes a cell invasion phenotype characterized by the disruption of basal laminin and, ii) disrupts cell-cell contact characterized by the loss of E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin and Laminin-V at the cell membrane. Adherens junctions represent a powerful invasion suppressor complex in normal epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pe\u0107ina-Slaus, 2003</a>). Disruption of polarized tissue structure and induction of cellular invasion are accompanied by extensive remodeling of the cellular microenvironment (e.g. basement membrane degradation, disruption of cell-ECM interactions). In such context MMPs play critical roles as they stimulate tumorigenesis, cancer cell invasion and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Stallings-Mann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Arumugam et al., 2008</a>). This is consistent with induction of MMP3 and MMP9 observed in eAGR2-treated non-tumor organoids. MMP9 may function to activate local growth factors, stimulate angiogenesis in vivo, and degrade the ECM during cell invasion, whereas MMP3 is critical for the cleavage of E-cadherin and is involved in promoting EMT and invasion in epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Xian et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fingleton et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lochter et al., 1997</a>). This is a mechanism through which eAGR2 may act to promote cell invasion. Moreover, eAGR2 triggers the induction of Vimentin and N-Cadherin. Expression of these mesenchymal markers, together with the loss of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin from cell\u2013cell contacts, as well as the invasive behavior of the organoids suggests that the non-tumorigenic epithelial cells were converted from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype in presence of eAGR2 in their ECM. We also observed that eAGR2 induced the expression of other EMT-related genes. EMT is a hallmark of tumor progression associated with the acquisition of invasive and metastatic features (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>). Although it has been only correlated that AGR2 may stimulate EMT, it is intriguing to find that eAGR2 in ECM is sufficient by itself, to induce EMT in non-tumor epithelial cells. Together, our results indicate that eAGR2 is important for epithelial morphogenesis disruption and metastatic dissemination. Thus, these results provide new insight into the possible mechanisms through which AGR2 may function as a microenvironmental pro-oncogenic protein."

Indeed, eAGR2 present in the ECM of non-tumorigenic organoids is sufficient, by itself, to disrupt cell polarization and organoid formation, thus leading to a disorganized phenotype with invasive properties. In epithelial cells, dynamic remodeling of the ECM is essential for the development and normal tissue homeostasis. However, loss of polarity and uncontrolled ECM remodeling leads to cancer. Together, our results highlight that eAGR2 represents a novel and unexpected microenvironmental signaling in the epithelial morphogenesis and tumorigenesis which might be explored for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epithelial cancer."

Begueret). The number of human lung samples analyzed and their clinicopathological characteristics are described in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>. These procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Haut-Lev\u00eaque University Hospital (NFS96900 Certification). Immediately after the surgical resection, tumor specimens were fixed for 24\u00a0hr in 10% buffered formaldehyde, dehydrated and routinely embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using 4 \u00b5m sections. All staining procedures were performed in an automated immunostainer (Bond-III, Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, U.K) using standard reagents provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, after Bond Epitope Retrieval solution 2 (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, U.K) antigen retrieval for 20\u2009min, de-paraffinized sections were incubated with the anti-AGR2 (Abnova, clone 1C3) human monoclonal antibody at a 1:100 dilution for 15 min at room temperature. For visualization, the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, U.K) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Each immunohistochemical run contained an internal positive control (bronchiolar epithelium or type II pneumocytes) and an antibody negative control (buffer, no primary antibody). Sections were visualized with a Nikon-Eclipse501 microscope, and images were acquired using NIS-Elements F 3.00 System (Nikon Digital Sight). Immunohistochemical staining was scored by intensity using the following criteria: 0, no staining; 1, mild staining and 2, dark staining. Quantification was done using ImageJ software and analyzing 20 images (20X) per tumor. Tumors of at least six mice were used for quantification. The number of tumor foci was calculated from whole lung sections with a cut-off of &gt;0.32\u00a0mm for tumor nodule diameter."
