Its highly conserved central helix (CH) directly binds the ternary SNARE complex and is required for all known CPX functions. The adjacent accessory helix (AH) is not conserved despite also playing an important role in CPX function, and numerous models for its mechanism have been proposed. We examined the impact of AH mutations and chimeras on CPX function in vivo and in vitro using <i>C. elegans</i>. The mouse AH fully restored function when substituted into worm CPX suggesting its mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. CPX inhibitory function was impaired when helix propagation into the CH was disrupted whereas replacing the AH with a non-native helical sequence restored CPX function. We propose that the AH operates by stabilizing CH secondary structure rather than through protein or lipid interactions."

Its highly conserved central helix (CH) directly binds the ternary SNARE complex and is required for all known CPX functions. The adjacent accessory helix (AH) is not conserved despite also playing an important role in CPX function, and numerous models for its mechanism have been proposed. We examined the impact of AH mutations and chimeras on CPX function in vivo and in vitro using <i>C. elegans</i>. The mouse AH fully restored function when substituted into worm CPX suggesting its mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. CPX inhibitory function was impaired when helix propagation into the CH was disrupted whereas replacing the AH with a non-native helical sequence restored CPX function. We propose that the AH operates by stabilizing CH secondary structure rather than through protein or lipid interactions."

                        "text": "Precise control of synaptic vesicle fusion at the presynaptic terminal endows a nervous system with the means to regulate functional synaptic connectivity. Although many of the molecules required for neurotransmitter exocytosis are known, the mechanisms by which this process is regulated are less well understood. The core machinery of the fusion process is composed of the neuronal SNAREs (VAMP2, syntaxin 1, and SNAP-25) along with several SNARE-binding proteins such as synaptotagmin, Munc13, and Munc18 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sudhof, 2013</a>). These proteins are highly similar in sequence and function across species, reflecting the deep conservation of synaptic transmission. Complexin is another essential SNARE-binding protein, and genetic ablation of complexin profoundly impacts neurotransmitter release and its regulation in all synaptic preparations studied to date (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xue et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Vaithianathan et al., 2013</a>). Mammals possess four isoforms of complexin, and deletion of the two broadly expressed isoforms (mCpx1/2) is lethal (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). This small cytoplasmic protein possesses an alpha-helical SNARE-binding domain known as the central helix (CH), which is broadly conserved among metazoa (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pabst et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bracher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brose, 2008</a>). The CH domain of mCpx1 is flanked on its N-terminus by a stable alpha helix called the accessory helix (AH) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pabst et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>), and this domain has subsequently been shown to play an inhibitory role in mammalian, fly, and nematode synapses (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xue et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>). However, the primary sequence of the AH domain is poorly conserved, and its secondary structure has only been investigated in rodent complexin. A wide variety of models for AH function have been proposed including direct binding to SNAREs or other proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bykhovskaia et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2014</a>), electrostatic interactions with membranes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>), and direct effects on the CH and its SNARE binding through secondary structure interactions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). Do all of these mechanisms contribute to AH domain function? If the AH domain binds specifically to another protein, why is it so poorly conserved relative to the CH domain?"

While worm and mouse AH domains are two of the most divergent among published complexin sequences, the two domains could be exchanged without impairing function in vivo. Further, the recombinant worm AH formed a highly stable alpha helix in solution similar to the mouse AH. Abolishing the hydrophobic character of the worm or mouse AH domain had little effect, whereas disrupting helix stability and invasion of helical structure into the CH severely impaired complexin inhibitory function. Moreover, replacing the AH with an artificial helical sequence fully restored inhibitory function. Remarkably, this sequence was functional despite large differences in length, charge, and hydrophobicity, indicating that these properties are not critical for AH function. These experiments indicate that the principal role of the AH domain is to nucleate and propagate helical structure into the CH domain, and this function is conserved across evolution."

This so-called \u2018central helix\u2019 (CH) is deeply conserved across phylogeny (76% identity between mammals and nematodes), whereas the adjacent helical sequence corresponding to the mouse accessory helix (AH) is much more heterogeneous, with only 20% identity between mammals and nematodes based on the 18 residues N-terminal to CH (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To compare AH function in mouse and worm, we first established whether the worm complexin protein CPX-1 possesses a stable helical region adjacent to its CH analogous to mouse complexin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pabst et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bracher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). Computational predictions based on amino acid sequence indicated a highly stable helical region including 30 residues between P37 and G66 encompassing the AH and half of the CH domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Munoz and Serrano, 1997</a>). This domain was confirmed to be helical by solution-state NMR spectroscopy on recombinant full-length worm CPX-1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Snead et al., 2014</a>) as well as on a truncated version lacking its C-terminal domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), validating the computational predictions for this protein. The stable helical structure of the AH domain is predicted to be deeply conserved across phylogeny based on the analysis of complexin sequences in 16 diverse metazoan species from seven phyla ranging from <i>Trychoplax</i> to human (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20132</a>). Thus both mouse and worm complexin possess a stable alpha helical domain N-terminal to the CH despite sharing little sequence homology, and this is likely to be a universal feature of complexin."

                                "text": "To investigate the functional significance of the AH domain in worm complexin, two deletion variants of CPX-1 missing either 12 (\u0394AH<sub>short</sub>) or 20 (\u0394AH<sub>long</sub>) residues of the AH were expressed in <i>cpx-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). All transgenic rescue experiments reported in this study utilized a functional CPX-1::GFP fusion protein, and transgene expression was monitored by imaging neuromuscular junction (NMJ) fluorescence in living intact animals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wragg et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Loss of CPX-1 caused a 12-fold increase in the rate of spontaneous fusion in the absence of external calcium at cholinergic NMJs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wragg et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Rescue with full-length CPX-1 completely restored the basal synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion rate (3.3 \u00b1 0.9 Hz for wild type, 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 Hz for FL rescue) whereas rescue with the \u0394AH<sub>short</sub> variant only partially reversed the increased rate of spontaneous fusion (39.8 \u00b1 6.2 Hz for <i>cpx-1</i>, 20.8 \u00b1 5.6 Hz for \u0394AH<sub>short</sub> rescue). Thus CPX-1 retained a limited ability to inhibit fusion in the absence of the AH domain. In all cases, the muscle miniature EPSC amplitude was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), consistent with the neuronal expression of CPX-1 in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>). <i>cpx-1</i> mutants exposed to the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb paralyzed more rapidly than wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>) as described previously (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wragg et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with the NMJ recordings, rescue with \u0394AH<sub>short</sub> or \u0394AH<sub>long</sub> only partially restored wild-type sensitivity whereas full-length CPX-1 completely rescued aldicarb sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The helix-breaking proline in position 37 is shared by all of the published nematode genomes, so the short AH domain is a common feature of this phylum. However, deletion of proline 37 does not impair CPX-1 inhibitory function, indicating that the short AH domain is not an essential feature of nematode complexin structure (data not shown). Taken together, these structural and functional results demonstrate that, despite the lack of sequence conservation between worm and mouse AH, the worm AH domain comprises a highly stable alpha helix that plays a major role in CPX-mediated inhibition of spontaneous SV fusion."

                                "text": "The similar structures of worm and mouse complexin AH domains suggest that AH function could be conserved between these highly divergent species. Indeed, several studies have indicated that mouse and fly AH domains contribute to an inhibitory activity of complexin (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Giraudo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chicka and Chapman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>). However, the AH may operate through distinct mechanisms in distantly related species. To test for conservation of mechanism, the endogenous worm AH was replaced with the mouse AH and expressed in <i>cpx-1</i> mutants. Since the length of the AH is not identical between worm and mouse, two versions of the chimeric complexin were generated: a longer version encompassing mouse residues 24\u201347 replaced the worm residues 26\u201349 (mouse AH), and a shorter AH swap replaced 38\u201349 with mouse residues 36\u201347 (mouse AH<sub>short</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Recordings from the NMJs of <i>cpx-1</i> mutants expressing the mouse AH demonstrated that CPX-1 is fully functional with a mouse AH domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Both mouse AH and mouse AH<sub>short</sub> restored near wild-type aldicarb sensitivity, further indicating that the mouse AH is functional in the context of worm CPX-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The precise length of the AH is not conserved across species (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and the spacing between the N-terminal domain and the CH is not likely to play a critical role in CPX-1 function since the NTD can be deleted without significantly impairing CPX-1 inhibitory function in worm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>)."

Comparing AH domain properties in 16 species across seven phyla, three conserved features were apparent: a region of hydrophobic residues along the helix (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), stable helicity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and high negative charge density (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). One recent model of AH function proposes that an interaction between the hydrophobic AH residues and the tSNARE complex prevents full SNARE assembly thereby inhibiting SV fusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>). To test this model in <i>C. elegans</i>, several hydrophobic residues in the AH domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) were replaced with the charged residue, glutamate (<i>h</i>\u2192E) and this CPX-1 variant was expressed in <i>cpx-1</i> mutants. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, the AH(<i>h</i>\u2192E) was fully functional in the absence of all hydrophobic side chains. Moreover, the short mouse AH chimera was also functional even when its hydrophobic residues were replaced with glutamates. Similar observations have been reported at the fly NMJ using mouse Cpx1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). These findings indicate that hydrophobic residues in the AH domain do not play a critical conserved role in complexin function."

                                "text": "Previous studies on mouse complexin suggested that the helical structure of the AH domain is important for stabilizing the CH domain (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pabst et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>) and for the inhibitory function of mCpx1 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xue et al., 2007</a>), but the reason for this requirement remains unclear. While several potential roles for the AH in mediating protein\u2013protein interactions have been proposed, the AH may simply serve to nucleate and propagate helical structure into the CH region (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>), but this idea has never been tested. To explore this possibility, a helix-breaking proline was inserted into the AH domain (R43P), and the effects on AH domain secondary structure of a recombinant truncated form of the mutant protein missing its C-terminal domain (\u0394CT) were examined by NMR spectroscopy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Furthermore, because conversion from random coil to alpha helix is a highly cooperative process, helicity in the CH domain is also predicted to decrease for the R43P mutant (<a href=\"#bib30\">Munoz and Serrano, 1997</a>). Indeed, decreased NMR carbon secondary shifts were observed throughout the AH and extending well into the CH domain, confirming decreases in both nucleation and propagation of the helical conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy provides another measure of overall alpha helical structure (<a href=\"#bib14\">Greenfield and Fasman, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Saxena and Wetlaufer, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rohl and Baldwin, 1997</a>). Absorption at 222 nm was monitored in recombinant \u0394CT protein while titrating in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), a co-solvent known to stabilize alpha helices in solution (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nelson and Kallenbach, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Segawa et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shiraki et al., 1995</a>). The increase in alpha helical structure with increasing concentration of TFE can be used to measure the stability and cooperativity of alpha helix formation. While some of the cooperativity arises from coordination of multiple TFE molecules (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berkessel et al., 2006</a>), intramolecular propagation of helical structure will also contribute. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, the R43P variant displayed a lower propensity for helix formation with a lower cooperativity, consistent with both decreased helix nucleation and propagation, as also evident from both the computational predictions and the NMR data. In living worms, inserting a proline into the AH domain completely eliminated AH function since the CPX(R43P) rescue was indistinguishable from the \u0394AH<sub>short</sub> rescue in both electrophysiological (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>) and behavioral (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) assays of synaptic function. Thus, inhibition of spontaneous fusion requires a helical AH domain in vivo."

Helical stability dropped monotonically as the residue at position 43 changed from R \u2192 V \u2192 F \u2192 P. Notably, the predictions also indicate a parallel decrease in the helicity of the CH helix, consistent with the nucleation/propagation hypothesis. This AH series was expressed in <i>cpx-1</i> mutants, and rescue was quantified using aldicarb sensitivity. Supporting this hypothesis, transgenic animals expressing this series of CPX-1 variants display a level of aldicarb sensitivity that mirrors the helical stability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). To test the second prediction, helical propagation was blocked by inserting a Gly\u2013Gly (GG) between the AH and CH domains. Because glycines destabilize helical structure, GG insertions are expected to disrupt helical propagation (<a href=\"#bib32\">O'Neil and DeGrado, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Blaber et al., 1993</a>) as supported by the computational predictions of AH and CH helical content. Rescue of <i>cpx-1</i> mutants with the GG variant demonstrated that insertion of a GG between the AH and CH was equivalent to deleting the entire AH domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This disruption is not due to a shift in the orientation of AH domain hydrophobic residues (a consequence of inserting two residues) since inserting three glycines produced a similar loss of function (data not shown). Thus helix propagation from the AH domain to the CH domain appears to play a major role in CPX-1 inhibitory function, in agreement with a similar finding at the fly NMJ (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2014</a>)."

This design was predicted to form a stable alpha-helical structure in solution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Marqusee and Baldwin, 1987</a>). CD spectroscopy of TFE titrations on recombinant CPX-1(\u0394CT) containing the 7-turn helix revealed that this variant is more helical than wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The increased helicity values could arise because 24 residues of the CPX-1 AH were replaced with 30 residues of helical EAAK repeat, so a larger fraction of the whole polypeptide will necessarily be helical. As an independent measure of helical stability, we compared the helix-coil equilibrium constants derived from TFE titrations and found that the 7-turn polypeptide forms a more stable helix than wild-type CPX-1 (17.9% for 7-turn vs 32.4% for wild type). Thus, the 7-turn artificial alpha helix provides a stable helical substitute for the endogenous AH domain irrespective of its increased length. Additionally, the 7-turn construct displayed a lower apparent cooperativity than wild-type CPX-1 (2.8 for 7-turn vs 5.6 for wild type), but the true cooperativity of the 7-turn polypeptide was underestimated since it was quite helical even at 0% TFE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Surprisingly, the 7-turn helix fully rescued both aldicarb sensitivity and suppression of spontaneous fusion at cholinergic NMJs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). Moreover, the AH(7-turn) sequence is electrostatically neutral overall, yet it fully restored CPX inhibition. Therefore, the conserved negative charge density of the AH domain was not essential for CPX inhibition. In fact, the charge density of the rescuing transgenes used in this study generally did not correlate with their function in vivo (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The EAAK motif also creates a strong hydrophobic moment, but the orientation of the moment is rotated approximately 90\u00b0 relative to wild-type CPX-1, indicating that AH function is not sensitive to the positioning of the hydrophobic residues (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together with the progressive AH destabilizing substitutions and GG insertion, these results reveal that a critical feature of AH function is the nucleation and invasion of a stable alpha helix into the CH domain."

It is not clear if these functions are always present in different species and whether they share the same underlying mechanisms. The results of this study indicate that although the AH domain is poorly conserved at the primary sequence level, at least some of its underlying inhibitory function and mechanism is preserved between species. Disruption of helix nucleation and propagation from the AH to the CH prevents CPX-mediated inhibition of spontaneous vesicle fusion. Furthermore, CPX-1 retains some inhibitory function in the absence of the AH but not in the absence of the CH (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2011</a>), consistent with the idea that inhibition derives from the CH. While the primary sequence of the CH is evolutionarily conserved in parallel with its SNARE binding partners, only the helical stability of the AH is retained across phylogeny. Thus, the various proposals of AH protein\u2013protein interactions and electrostatic repulsion effects are not fundamental requirements of CPX inhibitory function at the synapse."

Several features of the AH domain appear to be conserved across more than half a billion years of evolution based on the species examined here, so an evolutionary comparison provides insight into critical aspects of the underlying mechanisms. Beyond their primary sequence, the two most striking conserved features of the AH domain are its high negative charge density and the distribution and orientation of its hydrophobic residues (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1\u20132</a>). Although the deep conservation of charge density and hydrophobic moment suggests that they play a role in complexin function, the inhibition of spontaneous fusion does not require either feature in worm (this study) and hydrophobicity is superfluous in fly as well (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). Perhaps other roles of complexin utilize these properties. In contrast to charge and hydrophobicity, a stable helix is both deeply conserved and required for complexin inhibitory function. How conserved is helicity vs primary protein sequence? The SNARE-binding central helix is the defining motif of complexin homologs based on primary protein sequences (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pabst et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brose, 2008</a>). Two of the most distantly related complexin genes reported belong to the placozoan <i>Trichoplax adherens</i> (<i>Ta</i>) and the ctenophore <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> (<i>Ml</i>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Flicek et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, the CH domains of these representatives of basal animal phyla, share 44% identity with the human Cpx1 CH. However, whereas the AH domain of <i>Ta</i> shares 40% identity with the human AH domain, there is only 10% sequence conservation between <i>Ml</i> and human AH domains. The predicted AH and CH structures for human and <i>Ml</i> both contain extended regions of stable helix propagation similar to worm, whereas <i>Ta</i> is predicted to have only a modest degree of stable helical structure on its own (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This provides an evolutionary example of how primary sequence and helicity do not necessarily change in parallel in the AH domain. A speculative explanation for the noticeable increase in AH domain helical stability progressing from ctenophore (36%) to worm (54%) to mammal (&gt;80% in human) is the higher body temperatures of warm-blooded animals compared to soil- and marine invertebrates. Helical stability is highly dependent on ambient temperature, so the higher body temperatures of mammals and many other vertebrates may necessitate more stable helical sequences (<a href=\"#bib34\">Privalov, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Scholtz and Baldwin, 1992</a>)."

Several models for AH-domain function have been proposed over the past few years. Based on the unusual stability of the helical structure of the AH motif noted in early studies of the complexin-SNARE complex, the AH has been speculated to nucleate and propagate helical structure into the SNARE-binding CH (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). Several groups have proposed that the AH domain of mouse Cpx1 competes with the C-terminal region of VAMP2 for a binding site on the tSNAREs thereby preventing full SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#bib12\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>). The AH is also thought to mediate an intermolecular interaction between neighboring SNARE complexes, and this <i>trans</i> Cpx/SNARE array was proposed to underlie complexin-mediated inhibition based on in vitro assays of membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>). A recent study examining the <i>trans</i> Cpx/SNARE array model in the fly NMJ found that mutations expected to disrupt the hydrophobic interaction between the AH domain and the tSNAREs did not impair inhibition of spontaneous SV fusion in vivo (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2014</a>) in agreement with the hydrophobic residue substitutions used in the present study. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, another model conjectures that the AH domain can form a tight complex with the SNARE bundle and can also stabilize a partially-assembled state by binding directly to the C-terminal region of VAMP2 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bykhovskaia et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to these AH-SNARE interaction models, electrostatic repulsion between the AH domain and membranes has been suggested to be inhibitory (<a href=\"#bib44\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>). Thus a broad range of models and features have been put forward to describe AH domain function."

However, the mechanistic effect of stabilizing the CH domain remains unclear. An appealing model is that a stabilized CH alpha helix interacts more efficiently with the assembling SNARE bundle thereby promoting the SNARE interaction required for complexin inhibition. Indeed, CH binding to SNAREs is reduced in the absence of the AH in mouse Cpx1 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xue et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, the CH domain could interact with an as yet unidentified synaptic protein, and this binding would then require stabilization by the AH. The models based on hydrophobic AH interactions or electrostatic contributions are not supported by the experiments described here, but these mechanisms may be more prominent in other species. Alternatively, the high negative charge and hydrophobic moment of the AH domain may be relevant for other complexin functions. Nevertheless, our data indicate that the nucleation and propagation function of the AH domain is universal for proper complexin function across species. Further exploration of the CH and its binding partners is required for a detailed mechanistic understanding of complexin inhibitory action at the synapse."

Previous work showed that the central helix mediates binding to the surface of the neuronal SNARE complex, and this interaction is essential for function in regulated exocytosis. Numerous studies have also shown that the accessory helix, localized N-terminally directly adjacent to the central helix, is also required for function but the mechanism is controversial. In particular, the discussion is dominated by a model that suggests a direct competitive binding of this helix to a partially assembled SNARE complex, preventing zippering of synaptobrevin. Here the authors use an elegant combination of genetic rescue experiments in <i>C. elegans</i> and structural methods to show that for function of the accessory helix all that is required is a helical structure of this domain, with no requirement for a specific sequence, charge density, or overall hydrophobicity. The experiments are elegant and compelling, and in my opinion the work settles a rather long-standing controversy in the field. The authors are very cautious in their Discussion (evidently, they are aware of strongly opinionated colleagues in this field), but I would like to encourage them to be more explicit. The data and conclusions make it highly unlikely that the accessory helix functions by another specific protein-protein interaction. The findings will make a splash as they challenge and dismiss, one-by-one, essentially all theories on complexin function that have been put forward so far (hydrophobic/electrostatic protein interactions...). The authors are to be congratulated on such a nice study."
