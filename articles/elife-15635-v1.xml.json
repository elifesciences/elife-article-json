Here we show that after ablation of <i>Sox9</i> in Sertoli cells of adult, fertile <i>Sox8-/-</i> mice, testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming occurs and Sertoli cells transdifferentiate into granulosa-like cells. The process of testis regression culminates in complete degeneration of the seminiferous tubules, which become acellular, empty spaces among the extant Leydig cells. DMRT1 protein only remains in non-mutant cells, showing that SOX9/8 maintain <i>Dmrt1</i> expression in the adult testis. Also, <i>Sox9/8</i> warrant testis integrity by controlling the expression of structural proteins and protecting Sertoli cells from early apoptosis. Concluding, this study shows that, in addition to its crucial role in testis development, <i>Sox9</i>, together with <i>Sox8</i> and coordinately with <i>Dmrt1</i>, also controls adult testis maintenance."
