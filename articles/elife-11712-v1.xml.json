Until now mapping of the tumor vasculature has been difficult. We have developed a combined magnetic resonance and optical toolkit to study neoangiogenesis in glioma models. We use in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and correlative ultramicroscopy (UM) of ex vivo cleared whole brains to track neovascularization. T2* imaging allows the identification of single vessels in glioma development and the quantification of neovessels over time. Pharmacological VEGF inhibition leads to partial vascular normalization with decreased vessel caliber, density, and permeability. To further resolve the tumor microvasculature, we performed correlated UM of fluorescently labeled microvessels in cleared brains. UM resolved typical features of neoangiogenesis and tumor cell invasion with a spatial resolution of ~5 \u00b5m. MR-UM can be used as a platform for three-dimensional mapping and high-resolution quantification of tumor angiogenesis."

Until now mapping of the tumor vasculature has been difficult. We have developed a combined magnetic resonance and optical toolkit to study neoangiogenesis in glioma models. We use in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and correlative ultramicroscopy (UM) of ex vivo cleared whole brains to track neovascularization. T2* imaging allows the identification of single vessels in glioma development and the quantification of neovessels over time. Pharmacological VEGF inhibition leads to partial vascular normalization with decreased vessel caliber, density, and permeability. To further resolve the tumor microvasculature, we performed correlated UM of fluorescently labeled microvessels in cleared brains. UM resolved typical features of neoangiogenesis and tumor cell invasion with a spatial resolution of ~5 \u00b5m. MR-UM can be used as a platform for three-dimensional mapping and high-resolution quantification of tumor angiogenesis."

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by high cellular proliferation rates and a rapid induction of angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wen and Kesari, 2008</a>). Angiogenesis is a hallmark of malignant tumors, and most tumors show an exponential ingrowth of neovessels upon a certain tumor size to accommodate their metabolic needs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>). This phenomenon is called 'angiogenic switch' and is characterized by the upregulation of pro-angiogenic molecules like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) that induce fast tumor angiogenesis. The angiogenic switch is a central feature of malignant tumors and leads to a transition toward a more invasive and aggressive tumor growth (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bruno et al., 2014</a>). Hence, many efforts have been made to develop antiangiogenic therapies to 'starve' tumors off their resources (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2003</a>). So far, this approach of using anti-VEGF agents like bevacizumab has shown clinical benefit in certain tumor types (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mittal et al., 2014</a>) but, despite significant improvement of progression-free survival, does not prolong overall survival of primary GBM in an unselected patient cohort (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chinot et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) inhibition, despite strong preclinical data (<a href=\"#bib2\">Batchelor et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Winkler et al., 2004</a>), has not been successful in neuro-oncology yet (<a href=\"#bib1\">Batchelor et al., 2013</a>). New methods are currently developed to better identify those patients who might benefit from antiangiogenic therapies: Next to molecular approaches (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sandmann et al., 2015</a>), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could be used for patient stratification. In fact, accumulating data suggest that vascular normalization that occurs early after the initiation of therapy, might be such a marker which could aid clinical decision making (<a href=\"#bib9\">Emblem et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lu-Emerson et al., 2015</a>). However, improved imaging techniques that faithfully and non-invasively characterize vessel architecture and antiangiogenic treatment effects are needed to facilitate the understanding of biological actions of these therapies, and the development of clinical trials."

The technique is based on T2*-weighted (T2*-w) high-resolution Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) venography (<a href=\"#bib24\">Park et al., 2008</a>) with standard gadolinium (Gd) contrast agents at ultrahigh-field strength (9.4 Tesla, isotropic 80 \u00b5m resolution). This visualizes substantially more vascular detail compared to conventional T2*-w imaging. We performed pre- and post-contrast MR scans to define angiogenesis during glioma development in two different glioma models. Also, we assess treatment effects of anti-VEGF or radiation therapy on the vascular compartment. We further mapped the tumor vascularization by correlated, dual-color ultramicroscopy (UM) of cleared, unsectioned brains (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Schwarz et al., 2015</a>). Fluorescent labeling of the microvasculature using lectins resulted in complementary 3D MR and UM data sets (dubbed 'MR-UM') of the entire tumor 'macro-'\u00a0and 'microvasculature', which can be compared side-by-side. Thus, MR-UM bridges the gap between MR and optical imaging and may serve as a platform to better understand underlying mechanisms of antiangiogenic treatment and to identify novel druggable targets for preclinical therapy development."

The\u00a01x10<sup>5</sup> GL261 cells diluted in 2-\u00b5l sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) were stereotactically implanted into the right brain hemisphere of 6-\u00a0to\u00a08-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice (n=45 mice, Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) using a Hamilton syringe, driven by a fine step motor (coordinates: 2 mm lateral and 2 mm ventral of bregma; injection depth: 3 mm below the dural surface). Animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and unresponsive to stimuli during the intracranial injection; GL261 cells were routinely tested for viral or mycoplasma contamination, and mouse cell identity was confirmed by the multiplex cell contamination test (Multiplexion GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, <a href=\"#bib27\">Schmitt and Pawlita, 2009</a>).

Dynamic contrast-enhanced\u00a0(DCE) imaging (TE: 1.8 ms; TR: 16 ms; flip angle: 10\u00b0; slice thickness: 700 \u00b5m, acquisition matrix: 66 x 128, 3 slices acquired, number of averages: 1, 300 repetitions; 700 \u00b5m in plane resolution; duration: 10\u2009min, time resolution 2 s) was used to assess vascular permeability (K<sub>trans</sub>). 0.2 mmol/kg Gadodiamide (Omniscan, Nycomed, Ismaningen, Germany) was administered by tail vein injection for DCE and post-contrast scans. In five animals, 50 \u00b5l Gadodiamide was administered by intraperitoneal injection (ip), which had been determined before to match an iv dose of 0.2 mmol/kg. To assess the validity of the T2*-w sequence with an iron-based contrast agent, we performed blood pool imaging pre- and post-iv injections of crossed linked iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO, CLIO-FITC, 15 mg/kg, particle size: 31 nm, kind gift by R. Weissleder, MGH, Boston). MR imaging was started 7 to\u00a014 days post GL261 tumor cell implantation and repeated weekly up to 5 weeks after tumor cell implantation. For MR imaging, animals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane. Anesthesia was maintained with 1\u20132% isoflurane. Animals were kept on a heating pad to keep the body temperature constant. Animal respiration was monitored externally during imaging with a breathing surface pad controlled by an in-house developed LabView program (National Instruments Corporation)."

Brains were transferred into glass vials for tetrahydrofuran (THF; Sigma Aldrich) dehydration.\u00a0Two milliliter of 50\u00a0% THF were gently added using a pipette. Vials were placed into black 50-ml Falcon tubes and then mounted onto an overhead turning wheel (program C3, 15 rpm, Neolab, intelli-mixer). Clearing was performed at room temperature. After 12\u2009hr, the 50\u00a0% THF solution was exchanged by a 70\u00a0% THF solution. Vials were again put into black Falcon tubes and mounted onto the turning wheel for another 12\u2009hr. The procedure was repeated with 80% and 100% THF solutions, respectively. Samples were incubated for 12\u2009hr in 100\u00a0% THF for three times. The dehydrated brains were placed in benzyl ether for 48\u2009hr in order to clear the samples (98\u00a0% dibenzyl ether, DBE, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). To avoid degradation of the fluorescent signal, samples were kept in the dark and imaged immediately after the clearing procedure. S24 tumor-bearing brains were cleared with the recently published protocol FluoClearBABB (<a href=\"#bib28\">Schwarz et al., 2015</a>). This protocol is based on benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate clearing in combination with a basic pH, which is maintained throughout the clearing procedure. The protocol is especially suited for effective clearing of aged mouse brains. Mice were perfused with lectin-FITC as described. After dissection, brains were kept in PBS at 4\u00b0C. For the dehydration of brains, analytical grade alcohol (t-butanol, Sigma) was diluted with double-distilled water. Brains were dehydrated using t-butanols ranging from 30 to 100\u00a0%. The clearing solution BABB was prepared by mixing benzyl alcohol (Merck, analytical grade) and benzyl benzoate (Sigma, 'purissimum p.A.' grade) in a 1: 2 volume ratio. The pH levels of dehydration and clearing solutions were adjusted using an InLab Science electrode suited for organic solvents (Mettler-Toledo). pH levels were adjusted with triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich)."

Tumors grew rapidly and untreated mice got symptomatic and were sacrificed 4\u20135 weeks post implantation when they had developed large intracranial tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). To monitor vascularization both in the healthy brain and under pathological conditions, we employed a gradient echo, T2*-w sequence with high spatial resolution (80 \u00b5m isotropic resolution). This sequence allows the visualization of venules due to the BOLD effect of deoxygenized blood and the resulting susceptibility signals before contrast administration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). After administration of a clinically applied Gd-contrast agent, arterioles and venules show strong tubular vascular susceptibility signals that allow the assessment of the vascularization status (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Also, an iron-based experimental contrast agent (ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticle, USPIO) resulted in a good delineation of the vasculature (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

At this 'late' stage, single vessels were hard to differentiate within the tumor core because vascular density became too high for single vessel differentiation. Next to vascular susceptibility signals, also some dot-like susceptibility signals were found before contrast administration, most likely representing tumor microbleedings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Kinetic studies showed that the Gd contrast agent is cleared from the circulation within ~2\u2009hr after iv injection and vascular signals return to baseline within this time period (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Quantification of the tumor size and vascularized area showed an exponential increase of tumor vessels over the time of investigation 1\u20133 weeks post-implantation (vascularized area week 1: 0.2 mm<sup>2</sup>, week 2: 0.9 mm<sup>2</sup>, week 3: 3.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.01; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e,f</a>). Histogram analysis of MR images showed a strong signal drop in the tumor area 3 weeks post-tumor cell implantation which was present only after contrast administration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1\u2009g,h</a>). Interestingly, MRI was sensitive enough to detect single tumor vessels starting 2 weeks post implantation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1i</a>). The resolution of MRI is, however, intrinsically limited to the \u00b5m range which is insufficient to resolve tumor vessels below ~50 \u00b5m in size. To validate and correlate our MR results to the cellular level, we performed UM in combination with tissue clearing."

Similar to MRI, UM results in 3D datasets but possess a ~10-fold higher resolution (<a href=\"#bib18\">Keller and Dodt, 2012</a>). For UM, the microvasculature was assessed by lectin-FITC or lectin-texas red. These intravital dyes bind to endothelial glycoproteins in healthy tissue and tumor endothelium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">W\u00e4lchli et al., 2015</a>). After MR imaging, animals were injected intravenously with lectin and sacrificed after 5\u2009min of dye circulation. Subsequently, brains were explanted, cleared and vascularization was assessed by UM. The pathological neovascularization of the xenografted glioma was clearly visible: Single vessels in the tumor bed could be well delineated on correlated MRI and UM datasets (MR-UM) 2 weeks post-tumor implantation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>). Vessel density massively increased and large pathological vessels occurred 3 weeks post-tumor implantation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>).

Individual S24 tumor cell clusters were found outside of the tumor bulk even in the contralateral hemisphere. BBB-D, an early feature of GL261 tumors, developed in S24 tumors only at 10 weeks post-tumor implantation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). At this time\u00a0point, S24 tumors started to show clear signs of increased vascularity at the tumor stroma border on T2* post-contrast images and correlated UM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). UM also confirmed tumor cell infiltration into the contralateral hemisphere, which induced focal areas of aberrant vessel patterns with increased vessel density and diameter. The stable expression of red-fluorescent protein (td-tomato) by the S24 line allowed dual-color UM to assess the relation of cellular growth patterns and microvessel anatomy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>)."

                        "text": "In this study, we combined in vivo 9.4 Tesla MRI with ex vivo UM and tissue clearing to dynamically resolve tumor arterioles and venules as well as the capillary bed of mouse gliomas at high resolution. Contrast-enhanced T2*-w imaging allowed the visualization of neovessels in the 50\u2013100 \u00b5m range. In the GL261 model, angiogenesis started 2 weeks post-tumor implantation and massively increased until week 3. One limitation of MRI concerns its resolution, which was limited to ~80 \u00b5m in our study. To overcome this limitation, we employed correlated 3D UM of cleared specimen. For UM, we applied iv perfusion with fluorescent lectins that bind specifically to endothelial glycoproteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">W\u00e4lchli et al., 2015</a>) and subsequent optical clearing of whole adult mouse brains using the well-established 3DISCO and the recently published FluoClearBABB protocol (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Schwarz et al., 2015</a>). We obtained high-quality images with both clearing methods that were used to reconstruct the entire tumor anatomy and blood vessel architecture including bulk mass and invasive zone. Tissue clearing and UM has not been employed for the study of neurooncological disease. Previous UM studies investigated microvessels under physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib15\">J\u00e4hrling et al., 2009</a>) and in the context of solid visceral tumors (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dobosz et al., 2014</a>). We have extended this work to the field of neurooncology and combined it with advanced MRI techniques. This bridges the gap between MRI and whole brain optical microscopy, which represent separated domains so far. Optical clearing methods have recently undergone a rapid development and evoked large interest in the neuroscience community as they promise to allow 'connectomic' and circuit reconstruction studies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dodt et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Keller and Dodt, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Schwarz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Susaki et al., 2014</a>). Clearing techniques are, however, also amenable to the study of pathological states: First reports have highlighted how 3D information obtained by tissue clearing can give new insights into pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease (<a href=\"#bib16\">J\u00e4hrling et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Spence et al., 2014</a>)."

In the preclinical arena MR and UM with tissue clearing appear as natural partners as both produce 3D datasets, which can be compared side-by-side. The advantages of both techniques can be combined: Namely, MR is a versatile tool for longitudinal in vivo\u00a0studies. UM of cleared specimen can resolve cellular and subcellular processes and utilize the vast toolbox of genetic and chemical fluorescent labels with their high molecular specificity, thus complementing the information gained by MRI. Also, a combination of the two techniques allows cross-correlation of in vivo\u00a0signals with molecularly defined optical methods. To show the additive power of both methods, we used a neovascularization paradigm since neovessels are hallmarks of many diseases including cancer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Goveia et al., 2014</a>). Using cross-correlated MR-UM we achieved single vessel resolution and found pathological vessel permeability, tortuosity, and calibers, all of which could be partially reversed by VEGF treatment."

Thus, novel antiangiogenic treatment regimes, possibly in combination with chemotherapy in recurrent disease (as done with promising results in the Dutch Belob Trial (<a href=\"#bib32\">Taal et al., 2014</a>), and the ongoing EORTC 26,101 and 26,091 trials), or in combination with additional treatment modalities (i.e.immunotherapy, chemotherapy) are warranted (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chinot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kamoun et al., 2009</a>). Anti-angiogenic treatment development and clinical trials require imaging biomarkers to assess vascularization status and treatment effects. The developed T2*-w sequence is suitable to map tumor arterioles and venules in a preclinical setting. Future studies at high-field clinical MR systems should address a possible translation of our MRI approach to the clinical arena."

                        "text": "One limitation of our study relates to the differentiation of the various hierarchical parts of the vascular system. Tumors harbor a manifold of different vascular compartments (veins and arteries of different calibers and sizes with highly variable, but mostly pathological perfusion). Neither MR nor optical methods are able to capture the entire complexity of these compartments. Also, we found that in the bulk tumor some CD31 positive vessels were negative for lectin-FITC, indicating that some tumor vessels were hypo- or non-perfused. This implies that the visualization and quantification of the microvasculature by lectin-injection might slightly underestimate the vascular tumor compartment. The fact that hypo- or non-perfused vessels with abnormal flow exist in tumors is well established (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</a>). Another drawback might be that clearing methods may lead to an alteration in brain size, that\u00a0is, due to dehydration. For 3DISCO, we quantified the apparent reduction of brain volume using CT imaging before and after clearing. This revealed a volume reduction of ~40%, which however occurred in a uniform fashion and did not change macroscopic tissue proportions. Anatomical structures and substructures of the brain remained fully intact. Vessel diameters obtained by UM could therefore be corrected by a multiplication factor of ~1.6. However, microscopic shrinkage may slightly differ from the macroscopic factor obtained by CT."

The applied principles should be easily transferable to additional targets like the immune cell compartment that are amenable to MR and optical labeling strategies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kircher et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Weissleder et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, MR-UM should be useful for translational approaches to aid preclinical therapy development. In our study, mono-antiangiogenic treatment with a murine VEGF inhibitor was insufficient to halt tumor growth which mirrors current human studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chinot et al., 2014</a>). Dual angiogenesis inhibitors are currently being developed and therapeutic effects could be assessed in detail using our toolkit. Thus, we believe that MR-UM can provide a versatile platform for translational research approaches to cross-correlate MR and optical signals."

The use of contrast agents is of course justifiable for MR, but to correlate in vivo data with ex vivo structural quantifications, authors should rule out the possible involvement of perfusion in the diffusion of the injected dyes. For a thorough anatomical correlation in the same samples, authors should use well-characterized protocols of whole-mount immunohistochemistry (IHC) using specific vascular markers (e.g. CD31, such as used by iDISCO), which would ascertain that the whole vasculature is visualized. The use of IHC would also allow better staining of smaller capillary beds in which perfusion might have been affected by the presence of the tumor. One option would be to validate, in a subset of samples, the structural data with anti-CD31 IHC. Finally, vascular permeability should be assessed/validated using tracers and conventional methods (e.g., conjugated dextrans, Evans blue) such that, as for tumor angiogenesis and vascular morphology, authors could correlate in vivo and ex vivo data."

The use of contrast agents is of course justifiable for MR, but to correlate in vivo data with ex vivo structural quantifications, authors should rule out the possible involvement of perfusion in the diffusion of the injected dyes. For a thorough anatomical correlation in the same samples, authors should use well-characterized protocols of whole-mount immunohistochemistry (IHC) using specific vascular markers (e.g. CD31, such as used by iDISCO), which would ascertain that the whole vasculature is visualized. The use of IHC would also allow better staining of smaller capillary beds in which perfusion might have been affected by the presence of the tumor. One option would be to validate, in a subset of samples, the structural data with anti-CD31 IHC.</i> "

This resulted in a perfect co-localization of both stainings outside of the tumor mass. In the tumor, however, there were a number of vessels that stained only positive for CD31 but had no apparent lectin staining, indicating non-perfused vessels that were not reached by the lectin injection. We calculated that 49.3% of vessels were double positive for lectin and CD31 within the tumor (179/363 tumor vessels, n=3 mice). 50.7% were only positive for CD31 but not for lectin. The fact that hypo- or non-perfused vessels with abnormal flow exist in tumors is well established (Carmeliet and Jain, 2011). Our utilized method using injected lectins assesses perfused blood vessels and does not account for all tumor vessels.

The judgment to call the hypointense structures in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b-d</a> vessels is based on the fact that most of these hypointense structures are only seen after intravenous contrast administration. We now provide subtraction images of pre and post T2* scans of tumor animals to show the vessel outline that occurs after contrast administration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1a</a>). The concept of blood pool imaging by MR contrast agents is not new (Dosa et al., 2011) but has not been widely exploited in the context of tumor vasculature imaging. We agree with the reviewer that MR images need to be interpreted with caution as susceptibility signals are not specific to the vasculature but can be also caused e.g. by bleeding or calcification. Therefore, careful controls and pre- and post-contrast imaging are necessary for interpretation. In our opinion, however, the term \u201cneovessels\u201d and \u201cincreased vascularity\u201d seems justified also based on MRI. Our careful longitudinal study allows us to denominate newly appearing hypointensities as neovessels because such structures only appear after contrast administration and can be blocked by VEGF inhibition (longitudinal imaging of one animal, <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1b</a>)."

We have therefore eliminated the term \u201cneoangiogenesis\u201d from the MRI result section. Permeability and leakage of contrast material into the tissue is certainly a concern. We believe, however, that the linear, vascular-like patterns of the post contrast images (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>) show the tumor blood pool and not mere leakage (as this should result in a uniform signal decrease within the entire tumor).

This information is now included in the Results section. There has been speculation that inhibition of angiogenesis and vascular normalization leads to an activation of tumor stem cells with potential deleterious effects (Lathia et al., 2015). Also our ultramicroscopy data showed only partial vascular normalization and VEGF inhibition did not completely prevent vessel caliber increases and the formation of pathological vessels.
