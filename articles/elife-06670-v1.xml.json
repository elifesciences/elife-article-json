However, its in vivo mechanisms are unclear. Here, we showed,in mice, that cyclic di-GMP elicits stronger Ab and T<sub>H</sub> responses than the mammalian 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP, and generated better protection against <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> infection than 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP adjuvanted vaccine. We identified two in vivo mechanisms of cyclic di-GMP. First, intranasally administered cyclic di-GMP greatly enhances Ag uptake, including pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis in vivo. The enhancement depends on MPYS (STING, MITA) expression in CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells. Second, we found that cyclic di-GMP selectively activated pinocytosis-efficient-DCs, leading to T<sub>H</sub> polarizing cytokines IL-12p70, IFN\u03b3, IL-5, IL-13, IL-23,and IL-6 production in vivo. Notably, cyclic di-GMP induces IFN\u03bb, but not IFN\u03b2, in vivo. Our study revealed previously unrecognized in vivo functions of MPYS and advanced our understanding of cyclic di-GMP as a mucosal vaccine adjuvant."
