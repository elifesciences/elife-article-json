However, recent deep sequencing studies indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single mutations. We hypothesized that this tolerance would be reduced by chemically induced physiologic perturbations. To test this hypothesis, a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed deep mutational scanning to determine the fitness landscape of all possible single residue mutations in the presence of five different small molecule perturbations. These perturbations uncover 'shared sensitized positions' localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and the C-terminus. In addition, we identified perturbation specific effects such as a sensitization of His68 in HU and a tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT. Our data show how chemical stresses can reduce buffering effects in the ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of lab-based interdisciplinary graduate curriculum."

However, recent deep sequencing studies indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single mutations. We hypothesized that this tolerance would be reduced by chemically induced physiologic perturbations. To test this hypothesis, a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed deep mutational scanning to determine the fitness landscape of all possible single residue mutations in the presence of five different small molecule perturbations. These perturbations uncover 'shared sensitized positions' localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and the C-terminus. In addition, we identified perturbation specific effects such as a sensitization of His68 in HU and a tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT. Our data show how chemical stresses can reduce buffering effects in the ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of lab-based interdisciplinary graduate curriculum."

Misregulation of proteostasis leads to disease, including many cancers and neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Balch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lindquist and Kelly, 2011</a>). Protein degradation is an important aspect of this regulation. In eukaryotes ~80% of the proteome is degraded by the highly conserved ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zolk et al., 2006</a>). The high conservation of the UPS is epitomized by ubiquitin (Ub), a 76 amino acid protein post-translational modification that is ligated to substrate amine groups, including on Ub itself in poly-Ub linkages, via a three enzyme cascade (<a href=\"#bib7\">Finley et al., 2012</a>)."

Only three residues vary between yeast and human (96% sequence identity). This remarkable conservation implies that the UPS does not acquire new functions through mutations in the central player, Ub. Instead the evolution of proteins that add Ub to substrate proteins (E2/E3 enzymes), remove Ub (deubiquitinating enzymes, DUBs), or recognize Ub (adaptor proteins) combine to create new functions, many of which rely on various poly-Ub topologies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sharp and Li, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zuin et al., 2014</a>). The role of Lys48 linked poly-Ub in protein degradation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Thrower et al., 2000</a>) appears to be universally conserved, but the functions of other linkages are more plastic. Although mass spectroscopy of cell lysates has shown that every possible poly-Ub lysine linkage exists within yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Peng et al., 2003</a>), only the roles of Lys11 linked poly-Ub in ERAD (<a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2009</a>) and Lys63 linked poly-Ub in DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>) and endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Erpapazoglou et al., 2014</a>) are well characterized in yeast. Both of these linkages are central to stress responses, mirroring some of the established roles for non-Lys48 linkages in other organisms (<a href=\"#bib25\">Komander and Rape, 2012</a>)."

However, classic Alanine-scanning studies showed that ubiquitin is quite tolerant of mutation under normal growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sloper-Mould et al., 2001</a>). The high mutational tolerance of Ub was further confirmed using EMPIRIC ('extremely methodical and parallel investigation of randomized individual codons'), where growth rates of yeast strains harboring a nearly comprehensive library of all ubiquitin point mutations were assessed in bulk by deep sequencing (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roscoe et al., 2013</a>). Subsequent studies revealed that many of the constraints on the Ub sequence are enforced directly by the E1-Ub interaction (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roscoe and Bolon, 2014</a>); however, the surprisingly high number of tolerant positions remained unexplained."

Previous EMPIRIC experiments on HSP90 suggested that reducing protein expression could reveal fitness defects that are otherwise buffered (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, the high expression level of Ub might buffer some fitness defects. As an alternative approach to reducing expression, the buffering might also be exposed by chemical perturbations. Chemical-genetic approaches have been successful in elucidating protein function by assessing the context dependence of mutations on organismal fitness (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hietpas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Stockwell, 2000</a>). There is substantial evidence to link the pool of free Ub to the eukaryotic stress responses to many chemicals. For example, Ub overexpression is protective against the general translational inhibitor cycloheximide (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hanna et al., 2003</a>) and the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 is upregulated upon stress to increase the pool of free Ub in the cell (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hanna et al., 2007</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that the sequence of Ub is subject to many constraints arising from interacting with diverse proteins while mediating the stress responses to distinct chemical perturbations."

We expected MG132 to desensitize the yeast to deleterious mutations in Ub, as the inhibition acts on the final degradation of UPS substrates. For the other three chemicals we expected that specific sites on Ub would become sensitized to mutation. These sites could represent important Ub/protein binding interfaces that are required for Ub to bind to adaptor proteins and ligation machinery required to respond to a specific stress. Furthermore, we expected that Caffeine induced stress would be mediated through Lys48 linked poly-Ub (cell cycle), DTT induced stress would be mediated through Lys11 linked poly-Ub (ERAD), and HU induced stress would be mediated through Lys63 linked poly-Ub (DNA damage response)."

We suggest that expanding the set of environmental stresses, and improved measurement of smaller fitness defects, might be able to explain the high sequence conservation of ubiquitin, as different positions in the protein are important for interactions mediating the specific responses to a wide variety of perturbations."

                                "text": "Previously, the fitness landscape of Ub in yeast was determined using eight competition experiments using the EMPIRIC strategy of deep sequencing short regions of all possible single amino acid substitutions during a growth competition experiment in rich media (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roscoe et al., 2013</a>). These experiments measured all point mutants contained in short 30 base pair (bp)/10 amino acid residue stretches of the Ub open reading frame (ORF), which necessitated 8 separate competition experiments. To increase the throughput and reduce the cost of the experiment, we designed a barcoding strategy (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fowler et al., 2014</a>), that allowed us to determine allele fitness in a single experiment using EMPIRIC with barcodes (EMPRIC-BC). We synthesized eighteen bp random barcodes (N18 BCs), which were ligated upstream of the Illumina sequencing primer binding site. The specific association of each unique N18 BC with a given mutant Ub allele was then established through paired end sequencing of the Ub ORF and the N18 BC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) The resulting lookup table of BCs and alleles was then employed in our competition experiments to count alleles by directly sequencing the N18 BCs. In addition to simplifying the experiment, this strategy enabled us to count the alleles with a short, single end sequencing run, substantially reducing cost. The library is ~97.5% complete at the amino acid level. We observed a slight GC bias in the codon coverage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>), which is likely due to the cloning method that initially generated the Ub mutants (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hietpas et al., 2012</a>). Most substitutions are associated with many N18 BCs, with a median of fifteen unique barcodes representing a specific amino acid substitution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Fitness scores were calculated for each mutant based on the relative frequencies of mutant and wild type alleles over multiple generations.

This effect can be seen in the slight shift of the residuals distribution to the right when compared to the DMSO self distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The effect is small at the MG132 concentration we assayed, which is likely due to the poor penetrance of MG132 in yeast cells containing a wild type allele of <i>ERG6</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee and Goldberg, 1996</a>). This alleviating interaction is likely because MG132 directly perturbs proteasome, reducing the impact of defects related to Lys48 linked poly-Ub chains and leaving functions related to other, non-degradative poly-Ub topologies unperturbed. Also, reducing proteasome activity may increase the free pool of Ub in the cell by reducing the number of Ub proteins degraded by the proteasome. This increased pool of Ub could buffer the effects of deleterious Ub mutants participating in non-proteasomal functions. The consequence of an increased pool of free Ub might therefore lead to the general alleviating interactions observed between Ub mutants and MG132 treatment."

                                "text": "One potential explanation of the buffer unmasked by the chemical perturbations is the stability of the Ub protein itself. Although Ub is highly stable (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ibarra-Molero et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wintrode et al., 1994</a>), mutations that destabilize it may lead to misfolding or perturb Ub/protein interactions important for UPS function. To assess the degree to which mutational destabilization of ubiquitin itself is predictive of a decrease in mean fitness for each perturbation, we used the macromolecular modeling software Rosetta to estimate changes in protein stability (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kellogg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kortemme and Baker, 2002</a>) for every mutation in our library. With the resulting predictions, we classified each ubiquitin mutation as either destabilizing (change in Rosetta Energy Units (REU)\u00a0&gt;\u00a0=\u00a01.0) or neutral/stabilizing (change in REU &lt; 1.0). We observed a significant difference in experimental fitness between the two predicted classes for all conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This result holds independently of the absolute mean experimental fitness score of each perturbation, meaning that the difference in mean experimental fitness between predicted destabilizing and neutral mutations is not simply the result of lower mean destabilizing fitness scores. These results suggest that ubiquitin stability is more important for fitness in each of the perturbed conditions than in unperturbed yeast. Under stress, subtle changes in Ub stability could induce fitness defects that are otherwise buffered under control (DMSO) conditions. Furthermore, even small changes to ubiquitin stability could induce considerable changes to the Ub conformational ensemble that could destabilize Ub/protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lange et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Phillips et al., 2013</a>). Adaptability within the UPS could buffer these defects in DMSO, but they can be revealed upon chemical stress."

The face opposite the hydrophobic patch is mostly tolerant and the protein core and residues adjacent to the sensitive residues are mostly intermediate (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> - i).

In DMSO they tolerate a wide range of amino acids. Upon perturbation the mutational tolerance is reduced to amino acids generally compatible with surface residues.

These positions tend to be mildly sensitive to most mutations in DMSO, suggesting that these residues are involved in biological pathways that are important for cellular function, but not essential. When perturbed, these positions are mildly desensitized to mutation, with little regard for mutant amino acid identity. The most striking example is at Lys63 in DTT. In all other conditions any mutation of this residue is mildly deleterious. Because Lys63 linked poly-Ub chains are important for efficient cargo sorting in the endosome, this sensitivity is likely due to an endocytic defect. However, upon DTT treatment most mutants of Lys63 show WT-like fitness. This suggests an epistatic interaction between DTT treatment and mutations at Lys63. The endocytic defect caused by mutation Lys63 is likely masked by a similar endocytic defect induced by DTT treatment. Average difference maps showing the (DMSO - perturbation) fitness score highlight the features that underlie the sensitized and desensitized positions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

The data in DMSO again shows that biologically relevant positions are sensitive, the face opposite the hydrophobic patch is extremely tolerant to mutation, and that core residues are intermediately tolerant. Perturbations dramatically increase mutational sensitivity at the C-terminus, around the hydrophobic patch and at some core positions. However, much of the tolerant face of the protein remains tolerant to mutation in all of the perturbations. By exploring a wider array of perturbations we should be able determine the environmental pressures that constrain these tolerant positions and explain the extreme conservation of Ub."

Most of these mutations change from being mildly deleterious to being nearly null upon chemical stress. For example, in DMSO Ub tolerates mutation to small hydrophobics and other polar residues at Thr7. However, chemical stresses causes mutations of small hydrophobic or charged residues at this position to be deleterious. As Thr7 is adjacent to the hydrophobic patch residue Leu8, this sensitization is likely due to non-polar substitutions disrupting Ub adaptor protein binding and poly-Ub packing (<a href=\"#bib25\">Komander and Rape, 2012</a>). Additionally, typically destabilizing substitutions such as Proline or Tryptophan generally become more deleterious under perturbation."

Most of these perturbation specific mutants are tolerated in Caffeine and HU, but sensitized by DTT treatment. However, the H68Y mutation differs as DTT and HU treatments sensitize this mutation whereas Caffeine treatment does not. His68 is an important position found at the interface between Ub and adaptor domains such as UIM and UBA domains. These domains are important for the trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins. His68 lies adjacent to the hydrophobic patch and binding to UIM domains is reduced when it is protonated (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fujiwara et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, when His68 is mutated to Val in Ub, the binding to UIM domains is increased, likely mimicking the deprotonated state that forms a hydrophobic surface (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fujiwara et al., 2004</a>)."

In DMSO all substitutions, except to negative and aromatic residues, are tolerated. However, substitutions to Leu, Ile, His and Asn are sensitized uniquely in DTT.

Although previous studies have indicated a synthetic lethal interaction between Lys11Arg and DTT (<a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2009</a>), in our experiments, at lower DTT concentrations, the relatively high fitness of Lys11Arg suggests that the structural role of the positively charged residues and not poly-Lys11 Ub linkages may dominate the physiological response."

Our experiments were conducted in liquid culture with 1\u00a0mM DTT refreshed every sampling period. It is likely that we did not achieve a stress regime where Lys11 poly-Ub is essential for DTT tolerance. The Lys11Arg mutation induces the upregulation of proteins involved in ERAD including Ubc6, the ERAD E2. Also, the turnover of known ERAD substrates is unaffected by the Lys11Arg mutation, suggesting that Lys48 linked chains can be substituted for Lys11 linked chains (<a href=\"#bib51\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). These adaptations could be sufficient to counteract the loss of Lys11 poly-Ub in our experiments, but are insufficient at higher concentrations of DTT.

While much of the protein is tolerant to mutation when cells are grown with traditional laboratory conditions, new stress conditions reveal hidden mutational sensitivity. We show that thirteen new positions are extremely sensitized in at least one stress condition with an additional thirteen new positions intermediately sensitized. While the incorporation of these new stresses provides a rationale for an additional 1/3 of the protein, we cannot currently explain the conservation of some positions in the 'tolerant' face of the protein. Expanding the set of chemical perturbations assayed may begin to address this dichotomy further. It is also possible that mutations at tolerant positions create fitness defects that are too subtle to be determined by our current methods. These subtle defects can lead to the sequence conservation observed in Ub when a large population undergoes selection over a longer evolutionary time (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boucher et al., 2014</a>). Future experiments may be able to identify these effects by: i) increasing the dose of the perturbation; ii) reducing the expression of the mutant Ub; or iii) performing the selection over more generations (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rockah-Shmuel et al., 2015</a>)."

The mutants in the library are all expressed on the same plasmid and the same promoter, which gave us confidence to interpret the effect of the mutants on Ub thermostablitly and biological function. However, it is important to note that the fitness defects may be due to decreased Ub mutant expression or increased Ub mutant degradation."

Ub turnover is unique in that free Ub is not degraded (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shabek et al., 2007</a>) and conjugated Ub is degraded by the proteasome when the DUBs Upb6 and Rpn11 do not remove Ub from the substrate, causing Ub to be pulled into the proteasome along with the substrate protein (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hanna et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, the free Ub pool can be increased by the activity of the DUB Doa4 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kimura et al., 2009</a>), which cleaves Ub conjugates into free Ub. Therefore some of the mutants may increase Ub turnover either by interfering with DUB recognition or by destabilizing Ub and easing Ub unraveling by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Prakash et al., 2004</a>). Selection experiments that probe protein-protein interactions more directly, similar to those performed between the yeast E1 and Ub (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roscoe and Bolon, 2014</a>), may be able to directly determine whether some mutants have abnormal proteasomal engagement and turnover."

Physiologically Ub protein levels are maintained by strong expression of the UBI4 locus in response to stress conditions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Finley et al., 1987</a>). In the strain used in these experiments (SUB328 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Finley et al., 1994</a>), the native Ub loci have been deleted and complemented with both a plasmid containing WT Ub and a plasmid containing the mutant Ub. Therefore, SUB328 can no longer respond to stress by increasing the expression of UBI4 and is entirely dependent on DUB based mechanisms to maintain the free Ub pool, increasing the fitness defects of mutants that interfere with Doa4, Upb6, and Rpn11 activity. Alternatively, SUB328 expressing a deficient Ub mutant might increase Ub expression by increasing the copy number of the plasmid. While integrating these Ub alleles into the genome would remove copy number variation, it would also dramatically decrease number of Ub variants that could be assessed due to the relative inefficiency of integration when compared to transformation."

Furthermore, we have only interpreted mutants that cause large defects, such as the biologically sensible fitness defects of mutations at known important residues such as Leu8 or Lys48 and residues with fitness values that vary between conditions such as His68. The fitness effects at these variable positions are not simply due to expression or turnover defects, which should decrease fitness uniformly across the chemical stresses. Therefore, mutants that affect protein turnover or expression are likely members of the 'shared response' mutants described above. In the case where a perturbation increased Ub turnover we would expect that most positions would be uniformly sensitized. Instead we observe a stereotyped pattern of sensation for the three sensitizing perturbations, suggesting that Ub turnover is similar for all three perturbations and the 'perturbation specific mutations' are independent of protein turnover and/or expression defects."

Our students were able to generate high quality data and useable computational pipelines during the 8 weeks of class time. These successes are notable because few students began the class with a background in both areas. By creating a project lab environment that encouraged team based learning and teaching, we enabled students to quickly acquire relevant skills within the context of an active research project. The wide variety of stress responses that Ub mediates and the vast chemical space that can be safely and economically addressed in a classroom make yeast and Ub ideal systems for continuing these studies. It is our hope that other graduate programs can similarly offer project based classes in their curriculums and we will make our reagents available for use to further that goal."

It's a good rationale since stress states and particularly stationary phase (though that was not examined) probably do contribute substantially to natural selective pressures. The most interesting data are those showing distinct mutational profiles depending on the type of stress applied. In an extreme case, the stressor MG132 improved rather than attenuated mutational robustness. In general this is a well-executed and interesting study. Thus the data are good and I fully support publication. However, it may be that the interpretation is a bit narrow, a problem that is correctable."

Rather, the tendency is to attribute the fitness effects to perturbed protein-protein interactions, ubiquitin chain formation, and so forth \u2013 which may well be the case for the bulk of mutants. But in any mutagenesis, possible effects on protein level or degradation rates are in play, or to put it differently, this may play a role in the fitness landscape of many proteins. Many ts mutants are ts for protein levels, not function, with the ts protein being eliminated by the proteasome (Gardiner et al. Cell 120, 803 [2005]). Is ubiquitin any different? Ubiquitin is an unusual protein in these respects. Under stress conditions, ubiquitin rapidly declines in levels, and the UBI4 gene, running off of a strong promoter, serves principally to preserve ubiquitin levels under a variety of stress conditions, and in stationary phase (Cell 1987; 48: 1035-1046 [2007]). Other genes also play key roles in sensing and adjusting ubiquitin levels (Mol Cell Biol. 23: 9251-9261 [2003]; Cell 129, 747 [2007]; Cell 137: 549-59 [2009]). In the host strain, the levels of ubiquitin, if wild-type, do appear to be adequate after shift to galactose (Mol Cell Biol 23: 9251-9261 [2003])."

This proceeds mainly via the proteasome (Mol Cell Biol 23: 9251-9261 [2003]), when deubiquitinating enzymes Ubp6 and Rpn11 together fail to remove ubiquitin from proteolytic substrates, and ubiquitin is dragged into the core particle. Accordingly, only conjugated ubiquitin is degraded, not free (Biochem Biophys Res Comm 363:425-31 [2007])."

If the proteasome fails to unfold ubiquitin, ubiquitin will not be dragged into the core particle and degraded, but rather it will be removed from substrate by deubiquitinating enzymes. This need for ubiquitin to resist the proteasome's mechanical unfolding action could possibly underlie the exceptional physical stability of ubiquitin and some component of its sequence conservation, whether substantial or not. Put differently, it might be reflected to some extent in the fitness landscape of ubiquitin. However, as noted above, unfolding by the proteasome is not equivalent to thermal unfolding (Mol Cell 7:627-37 [2001]; Nat Struct Mol Biol 11:830-7 [2004]), so purely physical studies might miss relevant effects."

Ideally one would assess ubiquitin levels in the various mutants, though because they are mutants antibody recognition may be affected, so this approach could be flawed. Quantitative mass spectrometry would be the preferred method."

This is not a fast mechanism so would essentially not operate over the time course of the present studies. Thus, when examining ubiquitin under stress, in this short-term protocol, this putative effect could be more prominent than otherwise. Ultimately, integrated mutants will have advantages where ubiquitin levels are a concern, as potential plasmid copy number effects will be eliminated. It may be argued that the different relative mutant fitness seen under different stresses mitigates ubiquitin levels as a concern. Perhaps so, but degradation itself will be affected differently by these stresses; I don't think this argument can entirely neutralize the problem."

Large populations and evolutionary timescales can act on such small fitness effects. This caveat should be mentioned earlier on.

It is of interest because of its central role in cellular regulation, its extraordinary evolutionary conservation, the multiplicity of its interactors, the stability of it structure, and the speed of its folding. The present study is motivated by the conundrum that ubiquitin is so highly conserved while in experimental settings tolerating substitution at many residues. This paper describes a plunge into the importance of individual amino acid residues to fitness across the sequence of ubiquitin, focusing on stress conditions, using a very sophisticated approach including a deep dataset. It's a good rationale since stress states and particularly stationary phase (though that was not examined) probably do contribute substantially to natural selective pressures. The most interesting data are those showing distinct mutational profiles depending on the type of stress applied. In an extreme case, the stressor MG132 improved rather than attenuated mutational robustness. In general this is a well-executed and interesting study. Thus the data are good and I fully support publication. However, it may be that the interpretation is a bit narrow, a problem that is correctable.</i> We thank the reviewer for the kind words and have worked to broaden the interpretation.

Their in silico approach points to a role of physical stability in accounting for some of the observed effects but it's possible that the physical stability effects are mediated through metabolic instability, which was not examined, or that metabolic stability effects are in play where physical stability is only modestly perturbed. The exceptional physical stability may reflect the need to minimize ubiquitin degradation by the proteasome, an occupational hazard unique to this molecule. If the proteasome fails to unfold ubiquitin, ubiquitin will not be dragged into the core particle and degraded, but rather it will be removed from substrate by deubiquitinating enzymes. This need for ubiquitin to resist the proteasome's mechanical unfolding action could possibly underlie the exceptional physical stability of ubiquitin and some component of its sequence conservation, whether substantial or not. Put differently, it might be reflected to some extent in the fitness landscape of ubiquitin. However, as noted above, unfolding by the proteasome is not equivalent to thermal unfolding (Mol Cell 7:627-37 [2001]; Nat Struct Mol Biol 11:830-7 [2004]), so purely physical studies might miss relevant effects.</i> As noted above, we have added the following text to the Discussion:"

To normalize our peptide intensities to the number of cell in each sample, we would also have to follow the intensities of various peptides from housekeeping proteins that should have stable expression levels. To accomplish this task, we would first individually clone each point mutant into SUB328 and then grow each strain individually in glucose to repress the WT copy until the WT ubiquitin was removed by cell division.
