We have developed a proteomics approach to quantitatively profile the changes of sulfhydrated cysteines in biological systems. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that sulfhydrated cysteines are part of a wide range of biological functions. In pancreatic \u03b2 cells exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, elevated H<sub>2</sub>S promotes the sulfhydration of enzymes in energy metabolism and stimulates glycolytic flux. We propose that transcriptional and translational reprogramming by the integrated stress response (ISR) in pancreatic \u03b2 cells is coupled to metabolic alternations triggered by sulfhydration of key enzymes in intermediary metabolism."

We have developed a proteomics approach to quantitatively profile the changes of sulfhydrated cysteines in biological systems. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that sulfhydrated cysteines are part of a wide range of biological functions. In pancreatic \u03b2 cells exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, elevated H<sub>2</sub>S promotes the sulfhydration of enzymes in energy metabolism and stimulates glycolytic flux. We propose that transcriptional and translational reprogramming by the integrated stress response (ISR) in pancreatic \u03b2 cells is coupled to metabolic alternations triggered by sulfhydration of key enzymes in intermediary metabolism."

The covalent modification of specific amino acid residues influences diverse biological processes and cell physiology across species. Reactive cysteine residues in proteins have high nucleophilicity and low p<i>K</i>a values and serve as a major target for oxidative modifications, which can vary depending on the subcellular environment, including the type and intensity of intracellular or environmental cues. Oxidative environments cause different post-translational cysteine modifications, including disulfide bond formation (-S-S-), sulfenylation (-S-OH), nitrosylation (-S-NO), glutathionylation (-S-SG), and sulfhydration (-S-SH) (also called persulfidation) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Finkel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mishanina et al., 2015</a>). In the latter, an oxidized cysteine residue included glutathionylated, sulfenylated, and nitrosylated on a protein reacts with the sulfide anion to form a cysteine persulfide. The reversible nature of this modification provides a mechanism to fine tune biological processes in different cellular redox states."

Despite great progress in bioinformatics and advanced mass spectroscopic (MS) techniques, identification of different cysteine-based protein modifications has been slow compared to other post-translational modifications. In the case of sulfhydration, a small number of proteins have been identified, among them the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mustafa et al., 2009</a>). Sulfhydrated GAPDH at Cys<sup>150</sup> exhibits an increase in its catalytic activity, in contrast to the inhibitory effects of nitrosylation or glutathionylation of the same cysteine residue (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mustafa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Paul and Snyder, 2012</a>). The biological significance of the Cys<sup>150</sup> modification by H<sub>2</sub>S is not well-studied, but H<sub>2</sub>S could serve as a biological switch for protein function acting via oxidative modification of specific cysteine residues in response to redox homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Paul and Snyder, 2012</a>). Understanding the physiological significance of protein sulfhydration requires the development of genome-wide innovative experimental approaches. Current methodologies based on the modified biotin switch technique do not allow detection of a broad spectrum of sulfhydrated proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Finkel, 2012</a>). Guided by a previously reported strategy (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sen et al., 2012</a>), we developed an experimental approach that allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the sulfhydrated proteome and the physiological consequences of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis during chronic ER stress. The new methodology allows a quantitative, close-up view of the integrated cellular response to environmental and intracellular cues and is pertinent to our understanding of human disease development."

Disruption of this process results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins, causing ER stress (<a href=\"#bib32\">Tabas and Ron, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>), which is associated with development of many diseases ranging from metabolic dysfunction to neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hetz, 2012</a>). ER stress induces transcriptional, translational, and metabolic reprogramming, all of which are interconnected through the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 increases expression of genes promoting adaptation to stress via their protein products. One such gene is the H<sub>2</sub>S-producing enzyme, cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) or \u03b3-cystathionase , previously shown to be involved in the signaling pathway that negatively regulates the activity of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) via sulfhydration (<a href=\"#bib18\">Krishnan et al., 2011</a>). We therefore hypothesized that low or even modest levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during ER stress may reprogram cellular metabolism via H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated protein sulfhydration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

We tested whether or not MIN6 cells expressed the essential components of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis and protein sulfhydration in response to ER stress induced by thapsigargin (Tg, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Upon Tg treatment, MIN6 cells exhibited higher levels of intracellular ROS, decreased GSH/GSSG (reduced/oxidized glutathione ratios), and increased CTH protein levels via transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">2A</a>). This transcriptional reprogramming was also seen in mouse and human islets subjected to physiological or pharmacologically induced ER stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B, C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). In agreement with increased CTH expression, H<sub>2</sub>S levels increased during the chronic phase of the stress response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Coordinated induction of expression of the gene encoding the glutamate/cystine exchanger, Slc7a11, also was increased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), and this induction was associated with increased glutamate/cystine flux (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Slc7a11 mediates the exchange of oxidized extracellular cystine with intracellular glutamate. Once cystine is imported into the cells it gets reduced to cysteine, and then serves as a substrate for GSH and H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis. These data support the idea that both increased uptake of the CTH substrate and increased levels of CTH contribute to increased H<sub>2</sub>S levels in cells under ER stress."

                        "text": "The functional significance of increased H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis was shown by measuring the catalytic activity of GAPDH (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mustafa et al., 2009</a>), which gradually increased in response to elevated H<sub>2</sub>S production in MIN6 cells during ER stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). This increase in activity was independent of GAPDH protein levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). As noted above, GAPDH has the unusual feature of being catalytically inactive when Cys<sup>150</sup> is oxidatively modified, except when it undergoes sulfhydration which restores/increases its activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mustafa et al., 2009</a>). We therefore tested the protective effects of Cys<sup>150</sup> sulfhydration by H<sub>2</sub>S on its catalytic activity in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidation. Recombinant GAPDH was incubated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence or absence of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor, NaHS. The inhibition of GAPDH activity by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was significantly reversed by H<sub>2</sub>S treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Furthermore, incubation of purified GAPDH with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) resulted in formation of inactive glutathionylated GAPDH (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gao et al., 2010</a>), which was significantly rescued by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>S as well as DTT reduction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). HPLC-MS confirmed that recombinant GAPDH exposed to NaHS or GSSG was modified predominantly at Cys<sup>150</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7B, C</a>). These data confirm that H<sub>2</sub>S is a positive regulator of GAPDH activity. Increased GAPDH activity is directly linked to H<sub>2</sub>S production, as shown by the loss of induction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>) upon treatment with the CTH inhibitor, propargylglycine (PAG). PAG inhibits H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis and therefore is expected to decrease Cys<sup>150</sup> modification. Taken together, these results indicate that regulation of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis during ER stress might regulate the catalytic activity of other metabolic pathway proteins. The latter is raising the possibility that the ATF4-mediated sulfhydration of proteins is part of the integrated stress response (ISR), and has regulatory effects on cellular metabolism."

We hypothesized that during ER stress, this network of ATF4 target genes promotes protein sulfhydration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Knockdown of ATF4 in MIN6 cells during Tg-induced ER stress caused inhibition of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis with a parallel loss of induction of CTH protein levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, in the absence of stress, ATF4 overexpression increased CTH and Ero1\u03b1 levels and H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis, in agreement with increased GAPDH activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We tested this hypothesis in extracts isolated from Tg-treated MIN6 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of NM-biotin (0.05\u20131 mM). The eluate containing the sulfhydrated proteins was analyzed with SDS\u2013PAGE and the proteins were visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Indeed, increasing the concentration of NM-biotin beyond 0.5 mM decreased the levels of eluted proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), consistent with cysteine residues having free -SH groups becoming alkylated at high concentrations of NM-biotin.

In the absence of stress, ATF4 knockdown resulted in an increase in sulfhydrated GAPDH in MIN6 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Because ATF4-deficient cells have decreased levels of sulfur-containing amino acids (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harding et al., 2003</a>), and sulfur amino acid restriction is linked to an increase in the transulfuration pathway (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hine et al., 2015</a>), it is possible that the increase in GAPDH sulfhydration in ATF4-depleted cells is due to activation of CBS (cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Niu et al., 2015</a>), the second cytosolic H<sub>2</sub>S-producing enzyme. Moreover, we found that in the absence of stress ATF4 overexpression induced GAPDH sulfhydration that is dependent on the CTH activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J\u2013K</a>).

However, this labeling step has some limitations under certain circumstances. For example, if free Cys-SH groups are biotinylated on the same protein containing one or more Cys-S-SH groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), then the protein will not be eluted with DTT and will not be identified as a target for sulfhydration. In addition, if a protein contains sulfhydrated cysteines with low reactivity for the probe, this protein will not be captured and identified as an H<sub>2</sub>S-modified target. Due to those limitations and in order to extend the capability of the BTA approach, we introduced a proteolytic digestion step before applying the avidin column step. This added step provided not only the isolation of cysteine-containing peptides with persulfide bonds, but also increased the identification of sulfhydrated proteins. The eluted peptides were then sequenced and identified by LC-MS/MS analysis, thereby identifying the modified cysteines on proteins. By using the modified BTA technique, we have identified over ~ 1000 novel sulfhydrated cysteines in MIN6 cells treated with Tg, corresponding to about 820 proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 9</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), including GAPDH, wherein two cysteine-containing peptides were captured: Cys<sup>150</sup> and Cys<sup>245</sup>. Remarkably, the Cys<sup>150</sup> active-site peptide was highly enriched as compared to the C-terminal of Cys<sup>245</sup>, supporting prior mutagenesis studies that have shown Cys<sup>150</sup> as the primary H<sub>2</sub>S-modified site on GAPDH, both in vitro and in vivo.

                        "text": "In order to obtain genome-wide stress-induced changes in the sulfhydrome and individual cysteine residues within these proteins, we devised a modified BTA protocol (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) by introducing a stable isotope-labeling step after the DTT elution step. This protocol uses (1) digestion of biotinylated cell extracts with trypsin before avidin capture, (2) labeling of free Cys-SH groups on peptides in the column eluent by mass-difference cysteine-alkylating reagents with either NEM-H<sub>5</sub> (Light) or NEM-D<sub>5</sub> (Heavy), and (3) quantification by LC-MS/MS analysis of H/L ratios of the individual pair-labeled cysteines in the identified peptides based on a mass-difference labeling. In addition to quantifying changes in protein sulfhydration, this modified BTA approach allows the detection of additional proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s11\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 11</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). We used as an experimental system the ATF4-expressing MIN6 cells to profile quantitatively the sulfhydrated proteome. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, ATF4-mediated signaling triggers the cellular response, which leads to increased protein sulfhydration. Using the experimental plan in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, we identified over 834 cysteine-containing peptides (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Of these peptides, 771 exhibited pair-labeling with an overall average H/L ratio 2.6, and 348 peptides (45%) displayed high ratios (H/L&gt;2). These findings confirmed that ATF4 drives global changes in protein sulfhydration in MIN6 cells."

We thus queried the Uniprot database to retrieve functional annotations for the aforementioned 827 peptides. The analysis revealed that 28% of the peptides were localized to protein regions whose structural and functional properties are known (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). An additional 18% were found within functional regions of proteins with cysteine residues of unknown significance. Our finding of sulfhydration of specific cysteine residues within functional domains of proteins suggests that the cysteine modification influences the activity of proteins. In contrast, 4.2% of the peptides in question contained cysteine residues in experimentally proven active sites of enzymes or cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This percentage of active cysteine-containing peptides from the BTA assay is significantly larger than the 0.2% of all cysteines in the Uniprot database that have been assigned to experimentally characterized active cysteines (<a href=\"#bib39\">Weerapana et al., 2010</a>). Finally, 2.4% of the annotated peptides were found in known nucleotide binding domains of proteins, suggesting the potential for regulation of gene expression by H<sub>2</sub>S cysteine-modified proteins. None of these proteins have been reported as targets of sulfhydration. Although not found among the 827 peptides in this study, the NF-\u03baB RelA transcription factor has been shown to be sulfhydrated in the DNA-binding domain, resulting in increased DNA-binding activity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sen et al., 2012</a>). We also found by querying the redox modification databases (RedoxDB and GPS-SNO) that 11% of the 834 peptides from the RedoxDB and 36% from the GPS-SNO corresponded to cysteine residues that are known to be modified by nitrosylation or glutathionylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

For example, the protein, PHGDH, was labeled on two cysteines, Cys<sup>281</sup> had an H/L ratio of 5.8, whereas Cys<sup>254</sup> displayed a ratio of 17.

Data from this analysis are in agreement with increased activity of the glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH, by sulfhydration, and prompted the question as to whether or not glycolytic flux is regulated by the H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent modification of enzymes involved in intermediary metabolism. Also in agreement with this hypothesis, we found that ATF4-overexpressing MIN6 cells had higher glycolytic rates as evaluated with a Seahorse analyzer (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, the activity of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), also was increased in ATF4 overexpressing MIN6 cells, in a manner dependent on CTH activity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We therefore returned to the induction of ER stress by Tg-treatment of MIN6 cells and evaluated glycolytic flux rates in the absence or presence of PAG.

Tg-treatment significantly augmented glycolytic flux as determined by the increase in the glycolytic intermediate, 3 phosphoglyceric acid (3PG), as well as lactate and alanine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

However, lactate levels were decreased significantly despite the increased flux. A decrease in cellular lactate levels supports the idea that there is high consumption of pyruvate by the mitochondria to generate oxaloacetate (OAA).

Thus, the development of tools that can quantitatively measure genome-wide protein sulfhydration in physiological or pathological conditions is of central importance. However, a significant challenge in studies of the biological significance of protein sulfhydration is the lack of an approach to selectively detect sulfhydrated cysteines from other modifications (disulfide bonds, glutathionylated thiols and sulfienic acids) in complex biological samples. In this study, we introduced the BTA approach that allowed the quantitative assessment of changes in the sulfhydration of specific cysteines in the proteome and in individual proteins. BTA is superior to other reported methodologies that aimed to profile cysteine modifications, such as the most commonly used, a modified biotin switch technique (BST). BST was originally designed to study protein nitrosylation and postulated to differentiate free thiols and persulfides (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mustafa et al., 2009</a>). A key advantage of BTA over the existing methodologies is that the experimental approach has steps to avoid false-positive and negative results, as target proteins for sulfhydration. BST is commonly generating such false targets for cysteine modifications (<a href=\"#bib6\">Forrester et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sen et al., 2012</a>)."

A large number of protein targets have been discovered to undergo sulfhydration in \u03b2 cells by the BTA approach. Almost 1000 sulfhydrated cysteine-containing peptides were present in the cells under the chronic ER stress condition of treatment with Tg for 18\u2009hr. Combined with the isotopic-labeling strategy, almost 820 peptides on more than 500 proteins were quantified in the cells overexpressing ATF4. These data show the potential of the BTA method for further systematic studies of biological events. To our knowledge, the current dataset encompasses most known sulfhydrated cysteine residues in proteins in any organism. Our bioinformatics analyses revealed sulfhydrated cysteine residues located on a variety of structure\u2013function domains, suggesting the possibility of regulatory mechanism(s) mediated by protein sulfhydration.

The metabolic flux revealed that H<sub>2</sub>S promotes aerobic glycolysis associated with decreased oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria during ER stress in \u03b2 cells. The TCA cycle revolves by the action of the respiratory chain that requires oxygen to operate. In response to ER stress, mitochondrial function and cellular respiration are down-regulated to limit oxygen demand and to sustain mitochondria. When ATP production from the TCA cycle becomes limited and glycolytic flux increases, there is a risk of accumulation of lactate from pyruvate. One way to escape accumulation of lactate is the mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to oxalacetic acid (OAA) by pyruvate carboxylase. This latter enzyme was found to be sulfhydrated, consistent with the notion that sulfhydration is linked to metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis."

This metabolic switch has also been observed in many cancer cells characterized as the Warburg effect, which contributes to tumor growth. The Warburg effect provides advantages to cancer cell survival via the rapid ATP production through glycolysis, as well as the increasd conversion of glucose into anabolic biomolecules (amino acid, nucleic acid, and lipid biosynthesis) and reducing power (NADPH) for regeneration of antioxidants. This metabolic response of tumor cells contributes to tumor growth and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</a>). By analogy, the aerobic glycolysis trigged by increased H<sub>2</sub>S production could give \u03b2 cells the capability to acquire ATP and nutrients to adapt their cellular metabolism toward maintaining ATP levels in the ER (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vishnu et al., 2014</a>), increasing synthesis of glycerolphospholipids, glycoproteins and protein (<a href=\"#bib19\">Krokowski et al., 2013</a>), all important components of the ISR. Similar to hypoxic conditions, a phenotype associated with most tumors, the decreased mitochondria function in \u03b2 cells during ER stress, can also be viewed as an adaptive response by limiting mitochondria ROS and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. We therefore view that the H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated increase in glycolysis is an adaptive mechanism for survival of \u03b2 cells to chronic ER stress, along with the improved ER function and insulin production and folding, both critical factors controlling hyperglycemia in diabetes. Future work should determine which are the key proteins targeted by H<sub>2</sub>S and thus contributing to metabolic reprogramming of \u03b2 cells, and if and how insulin synthesis and secretion is affected by sulfhydration of these proteins during ER stress."

An increase of their levels by stimulants is expected to have similar effects on sulfhydration of proteins like the ATF4-induced CTH under conditions of ER stress. It is the levels of H<sub>2</sub>S under oxidative conditions that influence cellular functions. In the present study, ER stress in \u03b2 cells induced elevated CTH levels, whereas CBS was unaffected. The deregulated oxidative modification at cysteine residues by H<sub>2</sub>S may be a major contributing factor to disease development. In this case, it would provide a rationale for the design of therapeutic agents that would modulate the activity of the involved enzymes."

Protein content was determined by the BCA assay (BioRad). Mouse islet protein extracts were extracted in RIPA buffer. From approximately 100 islets the same amount of extracts determined by measuring DNA content with the Quant-iT dsDNA assay kit (Molecular Probes) and equal DNA amount was used for immunodetection. Western blotting was performed as described before (<a href=\"#bib19\">Krokowski et al., 2013</a>). Anti-Actin (ab 3280) antibodies were from Abcam. Anti-CTH (H00001491) and anti-CBS (H00000875) were from Abnova. Antibodies against: PERK (3192), phospho PERK (3179) and PKM2 (4053) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-ATF4 (sc-200), anti-GAPDH (sc-32233), anti-eIF2\u03b1 (sc-133227), and XBP1 (sc-7160) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (NB 110\u201356949) and Ero1\u03b1 (NB 100\u20132525) were obtained from Novus and anti-tubulin (T9026) serum was from Sigma-Aldrich."

Proteomics experiments are notorious for false positives. For example, two-thirds of all proteomics experiments, regardless of the design and the hypothesis tested, seem to identify GAPDH and some other proteins with redox Cys, such as peroxiredoxins. Appropriate controls could then be cells with inactive ATF4 or a parallel analysis of another redox modification. Another control could involve comparison of the dataset with CompPASS or other databases, which incorporate numerous experiments against which new datasets can be evaluated. Second, the dataset can be better analyzed for sequence and structural motifs and patterns, surface exposure, and protein abundance (more abundant proteins are more likely to be detected and are more likely to be involved in central metabolic processes). Gene enrichment analyses may be misleading and therefore require better statistical treatment."

First, a comment on controls is needed. Proteomics experiments are notorious for false positives. For example, two-thirds of all proteomics experiments, regardless of the design and the hypothesis tested, seem to identify GAPDH and some other proteins with redox Cys, such as peroxiredoxins. Appropriate controls could then be cells with inactive ATF4 or a parallel analysis of another redox modification. Another control could involve comparison of the dataset with CompPASS or other databases, which incorporate numerous experiments against which new datasets can be evaluated. Second, the dataset can be better analyzed for sequence and structural motifs and patterns, surface exposure, and protein abundance (more abundant proteins are more likely to be detected and are more likely to be involved in central metabolic processes). Gene enrichment analyses may be misleading and therefore require better statistical treatment.</i>"

GAPDH is one of the nitrosylated targets under nitrosative stress. We have thus examined if iNOS protein expression is induced in MIN6 cells treated with Tg, using Western blot analysis. We found that iNOS protein was not induced. Furthermore, we have performed the BTA and BST (Biotin Switch Technique) assays in parallel on the same lysate extracted from MIN6 cells treated with Tg for 18h in order to identify if NO nitrosylates GAPDH. We found an increase in GAPDH sulfhydration and not nitrosylation. It is known that the GAPDH activity is inhibited by nitrosylation or glutathionylation or other redox-based modifications. However, our data showed that GAPDH activity increases by ER stress. All together, our data support that sulfhydration and not other redox-based cysteine modifications, primarily occur on proteins in MIN6 cells during the time frame of chronic ER stress that was studied in this manuscript."

It has been reported recently, that increased insulin synthesis in pancreatic \u03b2 cells promotes proliferation in a manner that involves the induction of the Unfolded Protein Response (3). It is therefore possible that increased insulin synthesis in \u03b2 cells, causes induction of the UPR that acts as a protective mechanism in the continuing insulin synthesis and therefore proliferation. In contrast to this response, \u03b2 cells that do not induce the UPR, they cannot properly fold and handle the additional insulin and therefore cannot have positive effects of insulin on proliferation. Future studies can explore the involvement of H<sub>2</sub>S-metabolic responses in \u03b2 cells during the pre-diabetes state that \u03b2 cells increase insulin synthesis in response to peripheral tissue insulin resistance."

This should be acknowledged and discussed, as it is possible that some of the target proteins identified in the study have other modifications.</i>"
