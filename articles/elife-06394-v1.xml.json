Contributions of individual factors to the chromatin landscape in development is difficult to establish, as global surveys reflect multiple changes in regulators. Therefore, we studied the conserved Hairy/Enhancer of Split family repressor Hairy, analyzing histone marks and gene expression in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. This long-range repressor mediates histone acetylation and methylation in large blocks, with highly context-specific effects on target genes. Most strikingly, Hairy exhibits biochemical activity on many loci that are uncoupled to changes in gene expression. Rather than representing inert binding sites, as suggested for many eukaryotic factors, many regions are targeted errantly by Hairy to modify the chromatin landscape. Our findings emphasize that identification of active <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements must extend beyond the survey of prototypical chromatin marks. We speculate that this errant activity may provide a path for creation of new regulatory elements, facilitating the evolution of novel transcriptional circuits."

Contributions of individual factors to the chromatin landscape in development is difficult to establish, as global surveys reflect multiple changes in regulators. Therefore, we studied the conserved Hairy/Enhancer of Split family repressor Hairy, analyzing histone marks and gene expression in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. This long-range repressor mediates histone acetylation and methylation in large blocks, with highly context-specific effects on target genes. Most strikingly, Hairy exhibits biochemical activity on many loci that are uncoupled to changes in gene expression. Rather than representing inert binding sites, as suggested for many eukaryotic factors, many regions are targeted errantly by Hairy to modify the chromatin landscape. Our findings emphasize that identification of active <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements must extend beyond the survey of prototypical chromatin marks. We speculate that this errant activity may provide a path for creation of new regulatory elements, facilitating the evolution of novel transcriptional circuits."

In the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, localized transcriptional repressors provide essential patterning information that establishes the primary anterior-posterior and dorsal\u2013ventral axes of the organism. The action of transcriptional repressors is heterogeneous and can exhibit context effects; one of the most striking aspects involves the different classes of repressors that mediate distinct chromatin changes on target genes. Short-range acting proteins Snail and Knirps interfere with transcription only when their cognate binding sites are located within close range of the activator binding sites (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gray and Levine, 1996</a>). These proteins interact with evolutionarily conserved corepressors that possess chromatin modifying activities (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nibu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Payankaulam and Arnosti, 2009</a>). Paradoxically, these same cofactors are also recruited by another class of repressors, the long-range transcriptional repressors, exemplified by the Hairy factor (<a href=\"#bib40\">Paroush et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barolo and Levine, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Poortinga et al., 1998</a>). This protein is a founding member of the Hairy/Enhancer of Split (HES) transcription factors, which play essential roles in animal development, including segmental gene patterning in the early embryo and specification of neuronal differentiation in response to Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kageyama et al., 2007</a>). Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms of Hairy activity will shed light on a number of important gene circuits that are prominently represented in key developmental pathways. The biochemical function of Hairy is associated with long-range chromatin modifications, which endow this factor with the ability to interfere with multiple <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions, including activators bound over 1 kb distal to the Hairy binding sites. The long-range effect has been proposed to be due to the recruitment of the corepressor Groucho (Gro), that can oligomerize to spread over large areas of the genome, and colocalization of HDAC to the target genes resulting in deacetylation of specific lysine residues in histones H3 and H4 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Courey and Jia, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Martinez and Arnosti, 2008</a>). In our previous studies, we showed that Hairy induced extensive tracts of deacetylation on <i>ftz</i>, a segmental patterning gene expressed early in embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Arnosti, 2011</a>)."

Hairy was demonstrated to lack long-range effects on a distal RACE enhancer in the embryonic dorsal ectoderm, when Hairy binding motifs were situated in an element with activators that are restricted to mesoderm/neurectoderm regions. Furthermore, the Dorsal protein, when itself acting as a long-range repressor, is dependent on neighboring Cut and Dri transcription factor motifs to function, indicating that long-range repression complexes may require specific <i>cis</i>-regulatory grammar (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nibu et al., 2001</a>)."

Specific types of covalent histone modifications, such as H3 and H4 deacetylation, H3K9 trimethylation and H3K27 trimethylation are correlated with repressed genes, but there is still no general understanding of how important in a quantitative sense such modifications are for inhibition of transcription at specific genes. Context effects for a particular transcriptional repressor can influence what sort and how much of a response will be generated. At a genome-wide level, specific chromatin features correlate with transcriptionally repressed genes (e.g., H3K9 and 27 methylation, reduced levels of H3 and H4 acetylation, binding of HP1), however these marks are also found within highly active loci (<a href=\"#bib34\">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</a>). The epigenetic signature of transcriptional repression is thus context-dependent, consistent with a revised picture of the simple \u2018histone code\u2019 hypothesis. In the context of specific transcriptional repressors, we know little about how the context of distinct factors present at <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements shapes their action. Genome-wide information obtained from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments should provide information about molecular targets and action of transcription factors, however, in addition to <i>bona fide</i> regulatory targets, metazoan transcription factors typically associate with a large number of in vivo binding sites of unknown significance. Recent studies have suggested that these interactions represent off-target genomic interactions, driven by low binding specificity of transcription factors and a general affinity for open chromatin of active enhancers (<a href=\"#bib30\">MacArthur et al., 2009</a>). A survey of possible \u2018off target\u2019 binding elements suggested that these tend to be of lower affinity and are transcriptionally inert (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fisher et al., 2012</a>). As noted above, previous studies of Hairy suggested that the protein is unable to mediate transcriptional repression in the absence of other factors co-occupying regulatory elements (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nibu et al., 2001</a>)."

Molecular studies have demonstrated that the acquisition or loss of binding sites or entire regulatory modules appears to drive significant changes in gene expression that initiate critical evolutionary transitions, such as elaboration of novel limb structures (<a href=\"#bib24\">Khila et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pavlopoulos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tanaka et al., 2011</a>). Significantly, although relatively subtle changes have been linked to such important evolutionary innovations, it appears that functional conservation of gene expression is also compatible with major changes in the structure of transcription control regions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hare et al., 2008</a>). The constraints for reorganization of existing <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, or appearance of such elements de novo, are poorly understood; in some cases, the exact placement of multiple transcription factor motifs is essential for transcriptional function, while the composition of other genetic switches appears to be very loosely organized (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005</a>). The existence of a large fraction of \u2018off-target\u2019 binding sites both complicates the analysis of important functional links, and the interpretation of potential evolutionary changes. Thus, elucidation of the functional targets and chromatin effects of Hairy can provide important insights on the basic substance of evolutionary variation. In this study, we use genetic tools to mediate induction of Hairy on a short time scale, permitting us to identify direct regulatory targets and chromatin effects on a genome-wide level. In addition to identifying common features of Hairy repression mechanisms across many targets, we also show that this protein exerts pervasive biochemical activity to change chromatin states at many loci unlinked to gene expression, revealing a possible pathway to evolution of novel gene regulatory connections."

Hairy is first expressed in the <i>Drosophila</i> blastoderm embryo in a seven stripe pattern, which is important in controlling downstream pair rule genes that direct segmentation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ish-Horowicz and Pinchin, 1987</a>). Here, we express Hairy with a brief heatshock, throughout the embryo, which is sufficient to completely repress target genes such as <i>ftz</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We treated the control embryos identically to embryos carrying the inducible Hairy transgene to test for possible nonspecific effects of heat shock on gene expression and chromatin marks. In this system, heat shock alone has no effect on the expression patterns of the pair rule and other genes analyzed, and the chromatin marks in heat shocked control embryos were indistinguishable from chromatin patterns previously reported for untreated embryos (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Arnosti, 2011</a> and K Kok, data not shown).

To determine if these are general properties of Hairy, we compared all affected loci genome-wide. We observed that on a number of transcriptionally repressed target genes, H4 deacetylation is coupled with loss of the active marks H3K27Ac and H3K4me1. Widespread reduction of these active marks affecting &gt;1 kb blocks was observed on many genes repressed by Hairy, including <i>ftz</i> and other segmentally expressed genes such as <i>h</i> and <i>18w</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)<i>.</i> Notably, Hairy regulates its own transcription by chromatin alteration, consistent with autoregulatory mechanism of related mammalian HES proteins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kageyama et al., 2007</a>). In addition to removal of enhancer marks, repression on <i>h</i> and <i>18w</i> resulted in demethylation of the promoter mark H3K4me3. Furthermore, action of Hairy on another pair rule gene, <i>odd,</i> was limited to removal of acetyl marks on H4 and H3K27; methylation marks on H3K4 are untouched (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These results suggest that Hairy mediates coordinated sets of chromatin transitions. The chromatin changes did however exhibit heterogeneous characteristics; the sizes of altered chromatin domains varied on different repressed genes. For example, changes in levels of H4Ac involved blocks with a range of sizes; generally larger than 1 kb, with the average \u223c2.5 kb. Somewhat smaller chromatin blocks were associated with repression of the <i>HLHm7</i>, <i>gogo, pros</i> and <i>tup</i> genes, which showed just as robust regulation of transcription as those genes with large tracts of chromatin modification (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013H</a>)."

To determine the nature of changing chromatin states at different genomic loci, we compared the complete set of significant alterations in all measured chromatin marks observed after Hairy induction, regardless of transcriptional effects on the neighboring genes. We observed both loss and gain of these marks on hundreds of regions. Most frequently observed were changes in H4Ac, H3K27Ac, H3K4me1 and H3K36me3; changes in some chromatin marks were much more frequent than in others, indicating that there is some heterogeneity in the impact of Hairy on different regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The changes in levels of these marks is not simply due to increased or decreased histone density, as histone H3 levels generally were unchanged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The roughly equal abundance of regions showing loss or gain of acetylation and methylation would indicate that either secondary effects are common, or that Hairy may exert distinct biochemical activities on different loci. The correlation of Hairy-bound regions with repressed transcripts, as well as the association of Hairy binding with longer-range deacetylations, but not with increased acetylation, supports the idea that indirect effects are common. Indeed, focusing specifically on genes targeted by Hairy, we found that H4 histone deactylation was strongly enriched compared to acetylation gains, suggesting that deacetylations are direct effects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Further support comes from consideration of the actual Hairy occupancy of the chromatin blocks in question; there was significant correlation between Hairy binding and chromatin blocks exhibiting decreased, but not increased acetylation (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

These findings indicate that Hairy repression does not require H3K36me3 changes. Indeed, the direct effect of H3K36me3 on transcription is complex, as has been found for many other histone marks. For example, upregulation of KDM4A histone demethylase target genes in <i>Drosophila</i> occurs without increases in H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crona et al., 2013</a>). Similar studies with elongation factor Spt6 in <i>Drosophila</i> further indicate that <i>Hsp70</i> gene expression is not correlated to H3K36me3 levels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ardehali et al., 2009</a>). In fact, H3K36me3 may in some contexts contribute to gene silencing, due to its presence in heterochromatic domains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chantalat et al., 2011</a>) and in other cases, removal of H3K36me3 is required to promote transcriptional elongation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim and Buratowski, 2007</a>)."

Indeed, other studies have found that these marks are not always simply coupled to repression.

Thus, it is striking that the majority of chromatin changes are decoupled from any detectable effect on gene expression (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). For the many cases where chromatin effect was unlinked to changed gene expression, we observed extensive chromatin alterations associated with both silent and active genes. For example, chromatin transitions occur on transcribed genes not functionally repressed by Hairy, as seen on the <i>pyr</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In this case, the gene may remain active because the necessary <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements are located distally and are still able to interact with the promoter and activate it. In other cases, chromatin changes flank silent loci; <i>nht</i> undergoes widespread deacetylation and demethylation even though it is silent during this developmental stage of embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In some cases, binding and changing chromatin near inactive genes by Hairy in the blastoderm embryo may involve the interaction of Hairy with DNA elements that will become active at a later developmental stage, however, this seems unlikely in the case of <i>nht</i>, a testes-specific gene. Here, the physical binding by Hairy and subsequent impact on chromatin may represent \u2018errant targeting\u2019. Overall, chromatin changes were observed to correlate with over half of the regions bound by Hairy, suggesting that in most cases, this protein is biochemically active on chromatin, whether or not the changes lead directly to gene repression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To determine if such alterations are a general property of the repressor, we assessed the extent of coordination of modifications on all individual blocks of affected chromatin. Changes in H4Ac, H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 marks were significantly correlated at many loci (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Deacetylation events were also strongly correlated with loss of both H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, indicating that Hairy may form complexes containing both deacetylase and demethylase activities. Indeed, the CtBP cofactor is known to bind both of these classes of enzymes. However, Hairy is not mediating only one average type of transformation; removal of methyl groups from H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 is catalyzed by distinct classes of enzymes; Hairy is likely to interact with both, allowing for removal of H3K4me1 marks on distal sites and H3K4me3 at TSS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). A very similar pattern of correlations between acetylation marks, and between acetylation and methylation marks was observed for regions with increased acetylation and methylation. These elements may represent to a large extent indirect targets of Hairy, as no significant overlap between Hairy binding and these modified regions was found (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

By contrast, changes in the methylation marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K9me3 are found in the genomic regions where they are naturally enriched (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). For instance, H3K4me3 marks are enriched at TSS, as are the bulk of the altered chromatin sites. Hairy may thus have privileged sites on which it is more likely to induce chromatin changes; promoter regions may be in general more resistant to acetylation changes if strong activators are replenishing acetylation marks at these loci. In addition, transcriptional targets of Hairy are enriched in developmentally regulated genes, which typically possess larger <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions with multiple distal enhancers (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>)."

It has been suggested that repression through elongation control may cause no change in Pol II binding on <i>slp1</i> and <i>Hsp70</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ardehali et al., 2009</a>). Our previous analysis of <i>eve</i> repression by short-range repressor Knirps showed similar effects (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Arnosti, 2011</a>). Therefore, Hairy may interfere with gene expression at different steps of the transcription cycle, as also suggested for repression by the glucocorticoid receptor, indicating gene specific repression mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gupte et al., 2013</a>). An additional consideration is that genes featuring poised polymerase at the promoter in many or most nuclei, but are only expressed in a few nuclei, will have weak signals at the body of the gene. Therefore, the lack of change in Pol II levels on the gene body would reflect the inherently low signal, rather than a distinct biochemical mechanism. This explanation may account for a considerable number of affected genes where no changes in Pol II levels are observed after repression."

                                "text": "The complexity of chromatin transitions observed genome-wide in the wake of Hairy expression prompted us to ask which features best predict successful repression of a target gene, vs those genes with no chromatin responses or exhibiting errant targeting by Hairy. Here, we alter the expression of only one regulatory factor, rather than the many changes in regulatory factors observed over a developmental time course, therefore our data sets are enriched for direct action of Hairy, potentially simplifying the search space. We sought out correlations between dynamic histone marks, Pol II, Hairy, CtBP and Gro and the repression of targeted genes. Direct inspection reveals that occupancy by Hairy, Gro, and decreases in Pol II are strong predictors of repression, as are several histone marks, compared to genes unaffected or those activated (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). However, there are numerous loci that do not fit these simple generalizations. To more systematically assess the connections between these different observed states and transcriptional repression, we applied machine learning to analyze features that may be implicated in the activity of Hairy. We tested 41 features, including the number of observed peaks for Hairy, CtBP, and Gro; the number, width, and magnitude of altered chromatin blocks, and distance to TSS for 583 genes (241 repressed, 146 activated and 196 unaffected genes; activated and unaffected genes were grouped as nonrepressed genes). To identify the most informative features, four different feature selection algorithms were used to rank the information content of the 41 measured properties associated with the genes; the top twenty of these features were then used for predictions (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). We then tested four classifiers, using 90% of the data for training and 10% for predictions, with 10-fold cross-validation. Overall, each of the classifiers performed better than background, with Random Forests showing superior performance of \u223c75% accuracy for repressed and nonrepressed genes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Three of the feature selection algorithms used with this classifier employed very similar features to achieve this high level of accuracy (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>), indicating that certain features are most informative. The presence and properties of Hairy and Gro peaks are good indicators, although not sufficient information by themselves. RNA Pol II properties, transcript levels, and chromatin modifications, especially H3K4me1 and H4Ac, whether causal or not, are also a close reporter of gene activity. The overall performance differences in these methods are frequently observed in machine learning studies, and likely reflect the underlying data structure and types of features available for analysis. Genes that were correctly predicted as repression targets generally had the most differential features, including binding by Hairy and Gro, and changes in histone modifications. The genes that were least successfully called had one or no differential features, and may represent genes that are expressed in fewer cells and at lower levels where measurement of chromatin changes in a global population is difficult (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). The nonrepressed gene <i>pyr</i> was consistently called as \u2018repressed\u2019 by the machine learning algorithms, as it exhibited chromatin signatures similar to those found on genes that were actually repressed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In this case, we propose that the relevant enhancers lie outside of the chromatin regions affected by Hairy. Such genes may represent loci that are poised for capture in the Hairy regulatory network through stepwise acquisition of activator binding sites. Overall, this analysis indicates that from the perspective of Hairy biochemistry, there are intuitive and some non-intuitive combinations of chromatin dynamics that typify this protein's action in the context of transcriptional repression, rather than a \u2018practice\u2019 site, but other factors predominate in many instances. The missing information likely relates to the activity of bona fide <i>cis</i>- regulatory elements that are acting on genes in the vicinity of Hairy, which is partially but incompletely known from genome-wide studies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kvon et al., 2014</a>)."

Our previous studies indicated that Hairy modulated transcription independent of activator occupancy or SAGA co-activator occupancy (<a href=\"#bib32\">Martinez and Arnosti, 2008</a>). These previous observations raised the possibility that Hairy acts through entirely independent pathways from that employed by activators to block transcription. Our work here indicates that Hairy does indeed directly reverse chromatin marks associated with activators, and may therefore work through a dynamic competition with these activators, undoing their positive influence on the chromatin environment that would be necessary for RNA polymerase initiation and/or elongation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Indeed, Hairy repression is readily reversible, with genes showing reversion to an active state minutes after depletion of the overexpressed repressor (K Kok, unpublished results)."

Metazoan transcription factors typically interact with thousands of discrete sites in the genome, but only a small subset of these interactions correlate with observable effects on gene expression. In this study, we combined analysis of gene expression and chromatin dynamics in a way that allowed us to attribute effects directly to the induction of Hairy, inferences that would be difficult with a loss-of-function assay due to kinetics of depletion and secondary effects. In contrast, many other genome-wide data sets provide a static snapshot of the extant chromatin landscape or track complex changes through development, which represents the combined contributions of many activators and repressors. Previous studies have noted the presence of detectable but lowly-occupied sites, which have been suggested to reflect non-specific, non-functional interactions that are unavoidable by-products of proteins binding to large genomes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fisher et al., 2012</a>). Other studies have emphasized that transcription factors may have general nonspecific interaction with HOT sites that represent preferences for open chromatin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gerstein et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</a>). In general, the overall view is that whether or not these interactions are conserved, they may be of little functional consequence, and are not important for activity of GRNs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cusanovich et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, considering our finding that \u2018off-target\u2019 Hairy sites still appear to regulate chromatin structure, we should fundamentally reconsider how we interpret genome-wide data sets. Frequently, an increase in H3K27 acetylation is taken as an indication that the element is an active enhancer, without further functional tests (e.g., <a href=\"#bib52\">Villar et al., 2015</a>). Of course, correlated gene expression measurements indicate that such elements are likely to be enhancers in many cases, but genomic consideration of chromatin marking must not automatically equate changes in certain active marks with enhancers."

                        "text": "Our study provides a new perspective on these previous observations, in that essentially trivial biological interactions may have consequences in evolutionary time. We show that Hairy is engaged apparently in errant targeting of chromatin on many loci during the period when it is expressed, and demonstrate that in many cases, little distinguishes the types of chromatin effects observed on functionally repressed targets compared to \u2018non-functional\u2019 interactions on other loci (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). Thus, unlike an earlier model for Hairy action, in which the protein is active only when embedded in a previously active enhancer (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nibu et al., 2001</a>), our work demonstrates that Hairy is able to mediate biochemical activities in most bound regions, indicating that there is little context necessary for the protein to function. Therefore, Hairy may be relatively nonselective about where it can attract chromatin-modifying agents across the genome. Much molecular biology research has emphasized the high degree of cooperativity necessary for metazoan transcription factors to work well. Enhanceosomes, patterning elements and other enhancers give aberrant readouts if correct stoichiometries and spacings are not respected. These findings suggest that random individual sites are less likely to generate a suitable transcriptional readout. At least for repressors such as Hairy, the demands for generating biochemical activity are lower than anticipated, indicating that enhancers may have a lower threshold for formation that we might have expected. Although some of the targeted genes that are not transcriptionally affected may represent ectopic binding events of the induced Hairy protein, most sites are found in ChIP analysis of endogenous Hairy. The unresponsive genes may in some cases represent later targets of Hairy, may be already repressed by endogenous Hairy, or may have responses too small to measure in this system, however it is likely that there are hundreds of changed chromatin regions that not formally part of the functional Hairy GRN. Thus, a large fraction of the genomic interactions are likely to be with regions that are not strongly selected on an evolutionary timescale. As long as the induced chromatin changes are inconsequential, these effects will not be selected against during genomic evolution. This biochemical activity, however, may provide a unique molecular exaptation to generate novel edges between nodes of a standing GRN (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Most enhancers involve the combined action of transcriptional activators and repressors, thus errant targeting may facilitate formation of new modules with gain of a few activator binding sites (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gould and Vrba, 1982</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>)."

The genomic blocks detected as significantly altered by diffReps are annotated to closest TSS. We considered four features for each of the ChIP-seq data; number of blocks linked to the same gene, range of blocks, fold change of ChIP-seq signal at blocks, and distance of blocks to closest TSS. Four features from ChIP\u2013chip data sets of Hairy (<a href=\"#bib30\">MacArthur et al., 2009</a>), CtBP, and Gro (<a href=\"#bib36\">N\u00e8gre et al., 2011</a>) were used; number of peaks linked to the same gene, width of peaks, peak signal, and distance of peaks to closest TSS. In addition, expression of transcripts in wild-type embryos was included as a feature. In total, these 41 features were collected for 583 genes (241 repressed, 146 activated and 196 unaffected genes; activated and unaffected genes were grouped as nonrepressed genes) in this study. Differentially regulated genes and their fold changes are listed in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a> and randomly selected unaffected genes are listed in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 7</a>. Important features were first identified with four feature selection algorithms (Information Gain, Symmetrical Uncertainty, Chi Square and Relief). Then, to predict genes in the repressed and nonrepressed categories, four classifiers (Support Vector Machine (SVM), <i>k</i><span class=\"small-caps\"><i>-</i></span><span class=\"small-caps\">N</span>earest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes and Random Forests) were employed. To perform this analysis, we wrote Python and Java codes to partition our dataset into 10 parts to perform feature selection and 10-fold cross validation classification utilizing the Weka machine learning software (<a href=\"http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/\">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/</a>). To increase the robustness of our results we performed 50 iterations of the above procedure and combined the predicted classes for each gene to create a new aggregate predicted class for that gene. Here we took the class that has been predicted more than 50% of the 50 iterations as the predicted class of the gene. We have applied every combination of the four feature selection algorithms and four classification algorithms to the data to obtain the optimal classification methodology for our dataset. The results of our analysis are summarized in the main text."

For example, the claim that there is a significant association of Hairy binding with H4 deacetylation as compared with H4 acetylation as compared with the genome-wide changes in H4 acetylation state. This is based on the observation that, genome-wide, there are a roughly equal number of gains vs. losses of H4 acetylation, but there is a strong bias towards deacetylation in Hairy bound regions. However, it matters a lot what the distribution of H4 acetylation is in Hairy bound regions in controls. If Hairy bound regions tend to have relatively high levels of H4 acetylation, then, even if there is no association between Hairy binding and the change in H4 acetylation upon induction of Hairy-Ub, you would still expect to see Hairy-bound regions go down more often than up because of where they started. The lack of conditioning on the starting state of Hairy-bound regions (as well as possible differences in their size, etc.) is a serious problem with the analyses presented in the paper."

One of the main findings is that the effects of Hairy binding are context-dependent: some genes that are bound by Hairy are repressed, and many others are not. This is not surprising, in fact it is true of every transcription factor for which regulated genes and genomic binding sites have been compared (see the papers by Fisher and MacArthur cited in the manuscript, or any other ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq study). What is much more surprising is that the H3K36me and H3K9me3 modifications, which are typically strongly associated with actively expressed and silenced genes respectively, were not correlated with Hairy-induced changes in gene expression in this study. The authors suggest that Hairy works through non-canonical mechanisms to regulate gene expression without changing the characteristic markers of gene expression and repression. If so, this is by far the most novel and significant finding of the study, because it overturns the conventional view of the distribution of these histone modifications. However, the authors quickly leave this aspect of the analysis and return to the other modifications, some of whose changes make more conventional sense \u2013 assuming that, unlike H3K36me and H3K9me3, their presence or absence can be interpreted in the usual way."

It is possible that these targets are regulated post-transcriptionally (and therefore indirectly), so that transcription is unaffected (which would be consistent the lack of change in PolII, H3K36me and H3K9me3) but RNA levels are reduced (which would be consistent with the microarray data)?

The authors note that over 91% of Hairy-bound genes are not repressed, and a significant fraction of repressed genes (31%) are not bound by Hairy. They consider the 167 genes that are both bound and repressed to be directly repressed by Hairy, but this is probably a significant overestimate. Since the vast majority of Hairy binding sites are apparently nonfunctional, is it safe to assume that all of the Hairy sites in down-regulated genes are functional, especially since many other genes are regulated indirectly? How many of these binding sites in the 167 regulated genes are located within active enhancers? How many of the known direct target enhancers of Hairy (not the genes, the enhancers) are bound in this experiment? Compounding the uncertainty, the Hairy binding sites shown in the figures are not from the over-expressed hs-<i>hairy</i> used in this study: they are ChIP-chip data from the endogenous protein (<a href=\"#bib30\">MacArthur 2009</a>). Only 40% of peaks are shared between the MacArthur dataset and this study (subsection \u201cChIP-seq\u201d, last paragraph), suggesting that the distribution of over-expressed Hairy is very different from that of endogenous protein, not unexpectedly since hs-<i>hairy</i> is expressed in all cells of the embryo, most of which do not normally express Hairy. The measurements in this study, unavoidably, are averages across all cells of the embryo, so it is problematic to correlate a change in gene expression with a lack of change in chromatin modifications: these may be occurring in different cells."

The ChIP-seq analysis in comparison with the transcriptome analysis shows that Hairy binds to many more genes than it represses. Analysis of the chromatin landscape shows that repression is largely associated with histone deacetylation and H3K4me1 demethylation in regions that include the Hairy binding sites and spread from these sites. Perhaps surprisingly, however, genes that are not repressed by Hairy, but that bind Hairy, often show similar changes in the chromatin landscape (what the authors call futile cycles of modification). This shows that deaceylation and H3K4me1 demethylation are not sufficient for repression and even suggests that they could be a consequence as opposed to a cause of repression. Various machine learning protocols are used in an effort to determine what features might be most predictive of repression and some moderate success is achieved. The authors propose that these non-functional Hairy binding sites could facilitate the evolution of new <i>cis</i>-regulatory modules through the acquisition of additional transcription factor binding sites.

The variety of chromatin alterations induced by Hairy did not contain a simple pattern, such as magnitude of change or width of affected area, predictive of transcriptional repression. Clearly, the ability to repress or not might hinge on where activators are bound; we didn\u2019t measure the location of all activators, as this is not currently available knowledge. However, using machine learning, we did test the hypothesis that certain combinations of factors relating to position, size of chromatin block, magnitude of changes, occupancy of Pol II and other factors would tend to differentiate \u201creal\u201d regulatory events from \u201csimulations\u201d. The \u201cRandom Forests\u201d method, shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, was able to perform substantially better than random guessing for calling both \u201crepressed\u201d and \u201cnonrepressed\u201d genes (e.g. for repressed, 75% success, vs. 40% for random guesses), indicating that some special combination of certain features \u2013 as discussed in the Results \u2013 do provide a partial indication of where chromatin alterations are more likely to be associated with changes in gene expression. The overall success rate is still well below 100%, however. We changed the figure legend in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> to show on the heat map which level exceeds the performance of random guessing. Other machine learning approaches were able to make useful predictions, but were less successful; such differences in performance are routinely found for different sorts of datasets, and usually machine learning studies do not dwell on the weaker algorithms. We have revised this section to emphasize that there are at least two kinds of information relevant for interpreting \u201creal\u201d from \u201cbackground\u201d chromatin signatures, one of which is directly accessible from this sort of study. The importance of this point is that many genome-wide analyses simply assume that a particular set of modifications proves that there is a regulatory element at a locus \u2013 this is an erroneous and misleading way to approach genome-wide information. We address this this point with revised text in Results and Discussion."

We agree that this part of the argument was weak; removing the CtBP \u2013 related data allows us to focus directly on this point. We now present in the Discussion (and provide relevant background information in the Introduction) two major points; first, previous studies had suggested that Hairy as a repressor only functions in the context of an intact and active enhancer. Our work demonstrates that this protein is able to mediate its biochemical activity in most bound regions, indicating that there is little context necessary for the protein to go to work. Second, much molecular biology research has emphasized the high degree of cooperativity necessary for metazoan transcription factors to work well. Enhanceosomes, patterning elements and other enhancers give aberrant readouts if correct stoichiometries and spacings are not respected. These findings suggest that random individual sites are less likely to generate a suitable transcriptional readout. At least for the repressor side of the equation, we see here that the demands for generating biochemical activity are lower than anticipated \u2013 our work challenges our colleagues in the field to determine the generality of previous assumptions, and measure the independent potential for many activators binding to \u201coff target\u201d sites."

The reviewer notes that this would overturn the conventional view of how these histone modifications work, and asked why we didn\u2019t comment on this point. Indeed, our initial draft did not comment on this apparent discrepancy, an omission that we have now remediated in the revised Results. Although transcriptional review articles have pointed out general correlations between individual marks and gene expression, the actual literature clearly shows that such correlations are not strong, and there is considerable heterogeneity in how they are involved in gene expression. We now cite some of these studies; for example, upregulation of KDM4A target genes in <i>Drosophila</i> occurs without increases in H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crona et al. 2013</a>). Similar studies with Spt6 in <i>Drosophila</i> further indicate that H3K36me3 levels do not correlate with <i>Hsp70</i> gene expression (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ardehali et al. 2009</a>)<b>.</b> In fact, H3K36me3 may in some contexts contribute to gene silencing due to its presence in heterochromatic domains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chantalat et al. 2011</a>) and in other cases, removal of H3K36me3 is required to promote transcriptional elongation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim and Buratowski 2007</a>). Similarly, repressive marks such as H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are not always simply coupled to repression. For example, only a modest correlation between H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels and gene silencing was observed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barski et al. 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang et al. 2012</a>). In differentiation of T and B cells, a small fraction of repressed genes ever acquired H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang et al. 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McManus et al. 2011</a>). Interestingly, H3K9me3 was found to be enriched in many active promoters and associated with transcriptional elongation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Squazzo et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vakoc et al. 2005</a>). In summary, the simple correlations previously noted mask much more complex pictures that are revealed by analysis of genome-wide datasets, such as ours. We think that these complexities are themselves intriguing, and now have expanded our Discussion to provide more context."

The short time span from Hairy induction to collection of mRNA makes it less likely that posttranscriptional effects mediated through Hairy targets would account for this effect, however. We favor the second hypothesis offered by the reviewer, namely, that we measure transcription in embryos with heterogeneous nuclei. Genes that feature poised polymerase at the promoter in many or most nuclei, but are only expressed in a few nuclei will have strong Pol II promoter signals but weak signals at the body of the gene, as observed on the <i>gogo</i>, <i>pros</i>, and <i>tup</i> genes shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Therefore, in this view, the lack of change in Pol II levels on the gene body reflects the inherently low signal, rather than a biochemical mechanism. This explanation accounts for a considerable number of affected genes. In addition, Hairy is associated with many repressed genes with higher gene body signals where Pol II levels do decrease (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, Hairy is also associated with many repressed genes where Pol II levels can be measured on the gene body, and these levels are unchanged even as mRNA levels drop. These different observations suggest that depending on context, repression may differentially impact Pol II properties. Such mechanistic heterogeneity has been previously observed; in the revised Results, we cite several examples where reduction in gene expression does not result in loss of Pol II from the gene body (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al. 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ardehali et al. 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Arnosti 2011</a>).

The reviewer asked whether it is safe to assume that all of the Hairy sites in downregulated genes are functional. Indeed, to assume that every single bound site must be functional is unlikely, however, importantly, our study does not rest on that assumption, only that the large majority of target genes are bona fide Hairy targets based on the criteria below. 2. The reviewer asked how many of the Hairy binding sites on the 167 genes scored as direct targets overlap with active enhancers. High-quality data about validated enhancers remains to be determined for most of these genes, but if we use ChIP occupancy of transcription factors as a proxy for \u201cactive enhancer\u201d (which is an admittedly soft proposition), and map Hairy sites within these elements, we find that 163 of these 167 genes has Hairy associated with a putative regulatory module (data from <a href=\"#bib30\">MacArthur et al. 2009</a>; Kok unpublished observations)."

Most functional studies addressing enhancer interactions with Hairy have been performed with synthetic <i>cis</i> elements, however, Hairy direct regulation of <i>ftz</i> 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 enhancers has been reported, and we find that these enhancers are indeed bound by Hairy (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Arnosti 2011</a>). We also identify the <i>Sxl</i> promoter region as a direct target bound by Hairy; this gene has previously been characterized as a <i>deadpan</i> target, which has a similar bHLH DNA binding domain to Hairy, and Hairy is shown to regulate this gene (Dawson et al. 1995). There are no other reports of Hairy interacting with natural enhancers, where the role of Hairy has been described at a molecular level; our study provides the first elucidation of other possible targets. 4. The reviewer asked whether the use of ChIP data for non-overexpressed Hairy was suitable, as only 43% of our Flag epitope signals for the overexpressed Hairy protein overlapped with the ChIP-chip data. We selected the ChIP-chip data for our analysis because the Flag epitope gave low signals overall, although high-confidence functional targets such as <i>ftz, Impl2, odd, h, 18w, wg, tup, pros, nht,</i> and <i>en</i> were found. Practitioners of the trade know that there are often discrepancies in the exact sets of genes captured by ChIP studies, but the bulk of evidence from this study strongly supports the set of genes as a whole being likely Hairy targets; first, the overlap between repressed genes and genes bound in vivo is highly significant (p=3.8e-95), second, down-regulated genes are significantly enriched in classes consistent with known Hairy function (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplemental file 1</a>), including transcriptional regulation, cell fate commitment and neurogenesis (p&lt;3.7e-18), third, many of the predicted target genes including <i>odd</i>, <i>comm</i>, <i>comm2</i>, <i>edl</i>, <i>en</i>, <i>Impl2, prd</i>, and <i>18w</i> have striped expression patterns complementary to Hairy\u2019s, and fourth, several of these have been shown to be derepressed in <i>h</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ish-Horowicz and Pinchin 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bianchi-Frias et al. 2004</a>). In sum, we have good evidence that down-regulated genes are likely to be direct Hairy targets, and based our conclusions not on the activity of any individual gene but on the groups as a whole. Uncertainty about small numbers of genes would not significantly change the conclusions. We revised the Results to include information about the correspondence of the genetically confirmed Hairy targets and our molecular results."

We agree that, buoyed by the novelty of the findings, our description did indeed veer heavily into a speculative mode. We have made significant changes to the Abstract and Discussion to tone things down a bit and point out what we know and what the field should be investigating as possible leads. At this point, we do not have in hand an example where a Hairy bound \u201coff target\u201d site was subsumed into a novel <i>cis</i>-regulatory element. Studies that identify new enhancers have been carried out successfully in flies only to extent of showing how new genes (in male reproduction, for example) can pick up <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements from a variety of exapted ancestral or novel DNA elements. Alternatively, very beautiful individual cases have been described showing how subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions plays a role in evolution of gene expression. These studies fail to provide much information about which factors are present on individual elements, or how their activities may be relevant to generating the new element. Our study highlights the need to consider the activity of \u201coff target\u201d sites in generating novel elements, particularly because for Hairy at least (and likely other factors that employ the same cellular machinery) they are \u201cshovel ready\u201d and not constrained by complex <i>cis</i>-regulatory grammar. The new version of this manuscript provides a more balanced discussion of what we know and what we don\u2019t know, and now develops a second theme that was stimulated by considering your comments. That is, genomic consideration of chromatin marking must not equate changes in some active marks with enhancers \u2013 there appears to be a significant possibility for false positives if one relies on the simple correlations that are widely employed."

We agree that it is possible that some loci identified are not real Hairy targets, but only when the protein is overexpressed. However, for hundreds of the loci considered where chromatin changes are taking place, ChIP data from both Biggin as well as Kevin White confirm that Hairy can be found binding to these genomic regions. The early point in development selected for our study means that there are fewer cell-specific modifications, Polycomb repressed regions, and other markers of differentiated or senescent cells; thus the heterogeneity question is of lesser concern. We now do make a remark about this consideration in the Discussion, however."

There, the Reviewer asked if knockdown studies might indicate \u201chow many of the repression targets identified by overexpression are also identified by loss of function\u201d. We interpreted this point as asking whether the repressed genes found in our study were corroborated by other methods, and cited previous literature supporting the identification of a number of Hairy targets. In response, in the second round the reviewer noted that \u201cthis does not address the more important point that pertains to the genes that exhibit changes in the chromatin marks and yet show no repression upon hairy overexpression\u201d. Based on this comment, I think that we misinterpreted the thrust of the question in the first place, so here we address the question of the unaffected genes experiencing chromatin modification by Hairy. We have previously discussed data indicating that many of such elements are known to be occupied by endogenous Hairy. The reviewer asked that the behavior of this class be verified in loss-of-function studies. As previously addressed, the ChIP-seq/chromatin change studies require the quick kinetics that overexpression but not knockdown allow, but what might depletion of Hairy reveal? We thought about the possible mechanistic models possible in this case. 1) A gene normally bound by Hairy in the nuclei within the blastoderm stripes whose global expression is unaffected despite induction of Hairy may have separate enhancers that are far from Hairy sites. Even when Hairy binds in the interstripe nuclei, the enhancers would still escape regulation. 2) Alternatively, the gene may be silent, in which case Hairy binding to the gene in interstripe nuclei would not alter its silence. 3) A third possibility is that within the normal Hairy stripe regions, there are special activators that are only present in these stripes, but the endogenous Hairy is at high enough levels so that expressing more Hairy has no effect on transcription \u2013 the observed chromatin changes would come only from interstripe nuclei. Only in this last case would we mistakenly \u201ccall\u201d a gene as \u201cnot regulated transcriptionally\u201d but still having chromatin modifications. We think that there are few genes that fit this third category; known activators at this stage tend to be more broadly expressed, and loss of function <i>hairy</i> mutants show widened expression of target genes (stripes expand), consistent with broadly expressed activators. These scenarios are shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1</a>. We know that hundreds of genes we consider are broadly expressed, thus the conclusions drawn are based on this more general picture. To be frank, we had not considered all of the scenarios before this point was raised, and it is a useful one. We elaborated this point in the Discussion so that the readers are aware of these issues."
