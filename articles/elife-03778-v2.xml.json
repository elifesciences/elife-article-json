Overexpression of NEDD4L can also stimulate HIV-1 release but in this case the Gag protein lacks a PPXY motif, suggesting that NEDD4L may function through an adaptor protein. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular protein Angiomotin (AMOT) can bind both NEDD4L and HIV-1 Gag. HIV-1 release and infectivity are stimulated by AMOT overexpression and inhibited by AMOT depletion, whereas AMOT mutants that cannot bind NEDD4L cannot function in virus release. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that in the absence of AMOT assembling Gag molecules fail to form a fully spherical enveloped particle. Our experiments indicate that AMOT and other motin family members function together with NEDD4L to help complete immature virion assembly prior to ESCRT-mediated virus budding."

Overexpression of NEDD4L can also stimulate HIV-1 release but in this case the Gag protein lacks a PPXY motif, suggesting that NEDD4L may function through an adaptor protein. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular protein Angiomotin (AMOT) can bind both NEDD4L and HIV-1 Gag. HIV-1 release and infectivity are stimulated by AMOT overexpression and inhibited by AMOT depletion, whereas AMOT mutants that cannot bind NEDD4L cannot function in virus release. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that in the absence of AMOT assembling Gag molecules fail to form a fully spherical enveloped particle. Our experiments indicate that AMOT and other motin family members function together with NEDD4L to help complete immature virion assembly prior to ESCRT-mediated virus budding."

For example, a large number of enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, usurp the cellular ESCRT (<span class=\"underline\">E</span>ndosomal <span class=\"underline\">S</span>orting <span class=\"underline\">C</span>omplexes <span class=\"underline\">R</span>equired for <span class=\"underline\">T</span>ransport) pathway to bud from cells (for recent reviews, see <a href=\"#bib33\">Meng and Lever, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Votteler and Sundquist, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Weissenhorn et al., 2013</a>). Viral structural proteins typically use one or more short peptide motifs, termed \u2018late assembly domains\u2019, to bind and recruit early-acting ESCRT factors or ESCRT-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases to sites of viral assembly and budding. The three best characterized viral late assembly domains are: (1) the \u2018PTAP\u2019 motif (Pro-Thr/Ser-Ala-Pro), which binds the UEV domain of the TSG101 subunit of the ESCRT-I complex, (2) the \u2018YPX<sub>n</sub>L\u2019 motif (Tyr-Pro-X<sub>n</sub>-Leu, where X can vary in identity and sequence length), which binds the V domain of the ESCRT factor ALIX, and (3) the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motif (Pro-Pro-X-Tyr), which binds the WW domains of NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases. All three of these viral late assembly domains mimic cellular protein\u2013protein interactions that facilitate ESCRT-dependent vesiculation processes such as multi-vesicular body (MVB) biogenesis and ectosome formation."

Nevertheless, the release of \u2018crippled\u2019 HIV-1 Gag constructs that lack both of these late domains can still be stimulated by overexpression of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4L (also known as NEDD4-2) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Usami et al., 2008</a>). Humans express nine different NEDD4 protein family members (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib22\">Ingham et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bernassola et al., 2008</a>), but NEDD4L stimulates virus budding more potently than any other NEDD4 family member, implying that HIV-1 Gag preferentially engages this E3 ubiquitin ligase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Usami et al., 2008</a>)."

This NEDD4L isoform contains only the final 31 residues of the N-terminal C2 membrane binding domain, a central linker region that contains four WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase domain that forms Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim and Huibregtse, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weiss et al., 2010</a>).

The functional target(s) of Lys-63 poly-ubiquitylation has not been established definitively, but HIV-1 Gag itself is the leading candidate because functional virus budding correlates with Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitylation of Gag, and because NEDD4L truncation constructs that include the HECT domain can be functionally rescued by fusion to the HIV-1 Gag-targeting cyclophilin A domain (<a href=\"#bib55\">Weiss et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sette et al., 2013</a>).

AMOT p130 binds NEDD4 protein family members via interactions between the four central NEDD4 WW domains and three PPXY motifs located within the N-terminal extension that is unique to the AMOT p130 isoform (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). In good agreement with this report and with our affinity purification/mass spectrometry results, we found that AMOT p130 co-immunoprecipitated with exogenously expressed OSF-NEDD4L (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, panel 1, lane 2).

We therefore tested whether AMOT p130 also co-precipitated with OSF-NEDD4L proteins that carried inactivating Cys942Ala point mutations in the active site cysteine of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase domain (OSF-NEDD4L<sub>C942A</sub>). This mutation increased OSF-NEDD4L levels in the lysate and immunoprecipitate (panels 2 and 4 compare lanes 4 and 5 to lanes 2 and 3) and restored normal AMOT protein levels (panel 3, compare lanes 4, 5 and 1 to lane 2). Once again, AMOT p130 (and breakdown products) co-immunoprecipitated with OSF-NEDD4L<sub>C942A</sub> (panel 1, lane 4), but not with a protein that also contained inactivating WW domain mutations (OSF-NEDD4L<sub>\u0394WW/C942A</sub> panel 1, lane 5). AMOT p130 co-precipitation levels were higher with OSF-NEDD4L<sub>C942A</sub> than with wild type OSF-NEDD4L, presumably owing to the higher cellular levels of both OSF-NEDD4L and AMOT p130 (compare lanes 2 and 4)."

Secondly, endogenous AMOT p80, which lacks the N-terminal PPXY motifs, failed to co-immunoprecipitate with either OSF-NEDD4L or OSF-NEDD4L<sub>C942A</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, panel 1, lanes 2 and 4), even though AMOT p80 was present in the 293T cell extracts (panel 3, lanes 1\u20135). Thirdly, we observed that exogenously expressed, epitope-tagged NEDD4L and AMOT p130 co-localized well in HeLa-M cells, and this co-localization required both the AMOT PPXY and NEDD4L WW motifs (data not shown), in good agreement with previous reports that motins co-localize with other NEDD4 family members (<a href=\"#bib45\">Skouloudaki and Walz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2012</a>).

In control experiments, depletion of either of the well-characterized HIV-1 budding factors, ALIX and TSG101, reduced virus release and infectivity, although the effects were much greater for TSG101 depletion, as reported previously (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, right panels, compare lanes 2 and 3 to lane 1) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fujii et al., 2009</a>). AMOT depletion also significantly reduced both HIV-1 release and infectivity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, right panels, compare lane 4 to lane 1, eightfold reduction in infectivity and 2.5-fold reduction in release). The magnitudes of these effects were intermediate between those seen for depletion of TSG101 (20-fold reduction in infectivity and threefold reduction in virion release) and ALIX (1.5-fold reduction in infectivity and insignificant reduction in virion release). Importantly, the detrimental effects of AMOT p130 depletion were almost completely rescued by re-expression of wild type AMOT p130 (compare lanes 1, 4 and 5) but not by the mutant AMOT p130<sub>\u0394PPXY</sub> protein (lane 6). These experiments demonstrate that AMOT p130 is required for efficient release of wild type HIV-1 from 293T cells and mutations that abolish NEDD4L binding block the ability of AMOT p130 to function in virus release."

In contrast, HeLa cells reportedly express little or no AMOT mRNA, although they do express AMOTL2 mRNA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moleirinho et al., 2014</a>). We confirmed that endogenous AMOT protein levels are at least 10-fold lower in HeLa cells than in 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This observation begs the question of how HIV-1 can be released from a cell type that lacks AMOT, and this issue is particularly relevant because HeLa cells are commonly used to study HIV-1 assembly. We therefore tested the effects of AMOT p130 expression on HIV-1 release and infectivity in HeLa cells. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, AMOT p130 expression increased HIV-1 release from HeLa cells in a dose-dependent fashion, up to 15-fold at the highest levels of AMOT tested (right panel 1, compare lanes 1 and 5). Viral titers similarly increased with AMOT expression in a dose-dependent fashion, although the overall effects were less dramatic (right panel 2, compare lanes 1\u20135, threefold infectivity increase). Thus, HIV-1 release from wild type HeLa cells is suboptimal, and can be enhanced by expression of AMOT p130."

To determine whether AMOT p130 can function in virus release from Jurkat T cells, we tested whether expressing exogenous AMOT p130 expression stimulated HIV-1 release and infectivity. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, AMOT p130 expression increased HIV-1 release from Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent fashion, with up to 16-fold stimulation observed at the highest levels of AMOT p130 tested (panel 1, compare lanes 1\u20133). Viral titers similarly increased in a dose-dependent fashion (panel 2, compare lanes 1\u20133, sevenfold infectivity increase). Western blots confirmed that virus expression levels were the same in all cases (not shown), but AMOT p130 expression levels were below our detection limits in this cell type. We therefore also tested the effects of overexpressing the mutant AMOT p130<sub>\u0394PPXY</sub> protein. Unlike wild type AMOT p130, AMOT p130<sub>\u0394PPXY</sub> failed to stimulate virus release, and actually reproducibly <i>decreased</i> viral titers as compared to the untreated control (compare lanes 4 and 5 to lane 1). We speculate that this effect again reflects dominant inhibition of endogenous AMOT p130. Regardless, our data indicate that AMOT p130 also stimulates virus release and infectivity from T cells, which are natural targets of HIV-1 infection. Consistent with this conclusion, a global shRNA screen for host cofactors revealed that Jurkat T cells transduced with an shRNA that targeted AMOT were protected against HIV cytotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yeung et al., 2009</a>). This observation implies that AMOT contributes to HIV-1 replication in cultured Jurkat T cells, although the role of AMOT in HIV-1 replication was not characterized further in that study.

As expected, these effects were largely rescued by expression of exogenous siRNA-resistant AMOT p130 (right panels, compare lanes 2 and 3). Expression of either AMOTL1 or AMOTL2 also significantly rescued HIV-1 release and infectivity (right panels, compare lanes 4 and 5 to lanes 2 and 3). Hence, both AMOT-like proteins can facilitate HIV-1 release in the absence of endogenous AMOT p130. Neither AMOTL1 nor AMOTL2 was quite as effective as AMOT p130 in rescuing HIV-1 infectivity in this assay, possibly because these proteins are intrinsically less active than AMOT p130 and/or because they were expressed at lower levels (left panel 2, compare lanes 3\u20135)."

SEM imaging was initially performed because this method can survey the entire cell surface and thereby identify global changes in virion assembly and budding profiles. SEM analyses were performed on 293T cells that expressed HIV-1 and were treated with either: (1) a control siRNA, (2) an siRNA that depleted TSG101 (positive control), or (3) an siRNA that depleted AMOT. As expected, viruses budding from control siRNA-treated cells were detectable but rare (e.g., <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). In contrast, large numbers of assembling virions were visible on the surfaces of cells that lacked TSG101 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013F</a>) or that lacked AMOT (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013I</a>). We also observed that the arrested virions tended to cluster in the center of cells lacking AMOT, whereas they were more evenly distributed across the surfaces of cells lacking TSG101. The dramatic increase in the numbers of arrested budding virions implies that AMOT, like TSG101, must function following the initial stages of Gag assembly, but prior to viral membrane fission."

These measurements indicate that virion assembly intermediates (or possibly dead-end products) appreciably accumulate at two different stages, suggesting that either stage can be rate limiting. In cells lacking TSG101, budding-arrested virions were much more prevalent and they typically arrested at very late stages of assembly, with the maximal population exhibiting a Gag shell arc of \u223c320\u00b0. In cells lacking AMOT, arrested virions were again prevalent but they arrested at a much earlier stage, with the maximal population exhibiting a Gag shell arc of \u223c165\u00b0. The dramatic increases in numbers of budding virions induced by depletion of TSG101 or AMOT can explain how the assembly phenotypes could distribute as single peaks in these cases, whereas virions budding from wild type cells (which were much rarer) distributed into two peaks. Our experiments reveal that HIV budding arrests at an earlier stage in the absence of AMOT than in the absence of TSG101, implying that AMOT acts at an earlier stage of virion morphogenesis."

The AMOT depletion phenotype was distinct from the defect induced by the absence of ESCRT factors, where virus budding arrested at a \u2018lollipop\u2019 stage in which nearly complete immature virions remained tethered to the host cell via thin membrane stalks. Thus, cellular factors facilitate (at least) two distinct steps in virion morphogenesis, with AMOT required to complete assembly/envelopment and the ESCRT machinery required for membrane fission.

In cells, however, Gag appears to require additional activities to bend the membrane, extrude the particle, and sever the bud neck. The well-studied process of endocytic vesicle formation provides precedence for these additional requirements because clathrin alone can form spherical assemblies but nevertheless requires assistance from BAR domain-containing proteins to help bend membranes, and assistance from actin and dynamin to release the vesicle (<a href=\"#bib54\">Weinberg and Drubin, 2012</a>). It is intriguing that AMOT p130 also contains a candidate BAR-like domain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heller et al., 2010</a>) and can associate with F-actin (Ernkvist et al., 2006, <a href=\"#bib13\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chan et al., 2013</a>). The AMOT BAR-like domain can remodel membranes in vitro (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heller et al., 2010</a>), although it is not yet clear whether it functions as a classical or an inverse BAR domain. This distinction is mechanistically significant because classical BAR domains stabilize positive membrane curvature whereas inverse BAR domains stabilize negative curvature (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mim and Unger, 2012</a>), both of which are generated during enveloped virus assembly. In principle, the BAR domain could mediate AMOT p130 recruitment at the half-moon stage, once the nascent viral membrane has reached the proper degree of curvature. The BAR domain could also help drive the additional membrane curvature required to proceed to the lollipop stage. Similarly, F-actin recruitment and polymerization could help \u2018push\u2019 the virion toward the lollipop stage, although several recent studies argue strongly against an essential role for F-actin in HIV-1 assembly (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bharat et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rahman et al., 2014</a>)."

The clearest example is the D-type Betaretrovirus Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus (M-PMV), which forms spherical particles in the cytoplasm and then obtains its outer membrane and exits the cell by crossing the plasma membrane. M-PMV Gag contains two distinct late assembly domains that function non-redundantly: a PPPY motif that binds NEDD4 (and perhaps other NEDD4 family members), and a PSAP motif that binds TSG101/ESCRT-I (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gottwein et al., 2003</a>). PPPY and PSAP mutations induce strikingly different phenotypes: mutation of the PPPY motif causes virions to stack up against the plasma membrane where they fail to initiate membrane envelopment whereas virions lacking the PSAP motif acquire an envelope, but accumulate at the lollipop stage or are released as chains of membrane-tethered particles. These observations imply that Gag PPPY-NEDD4 complexes are required for early stages of membrane bending and envelopment, whereas Gag PSAP-ESCRT-I complexes recruit the ESCRT machinery to mediate membrane fission. Like other family members, NEDD4 binds AMOT (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moleirinho et al., 2014</a>), and we therefore speculate that M-PMV may also recruit AMOT to facilitate membrane bending and particle envelopment. This would imply that viruses can recruit NEDD4-motin complexes by binding either member of the complex. The deltaretrovirus HTLV-I is another case where a PPXY motif appears to be required for an early step in particle envelopment and a PTAP motif may function at a later membrane fission step ([<a href=\"#bib29\">Le Blanc et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blot et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Heidecker et al., 2004</a>], but also see reference [<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2004</a>]). Distinct roles for PPXY and PTAP motifs have not been delineated in other well-studied viruses that use both motifs, such as the gammaretrovirus Murine Leukemia Virus (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yuan et al., 2000</a>) or the filovirus Ebola Virus (<a href=\"#bib49\">Timmins et al., 2003</a>)."

                        "text": "Although many details of HIV-1 assembly and budding remain to be elucidated, our data are consistent with a stepwise pathway in which: (1) AMOT p130 is recruited at the half-moon stage of HIV-1 assembly, perhaps by binding cooperatively to Gag and to appropriately curved membranes, (2) AMOT p130 promotes further membrane curvature and recruits NEDD4L via PPXY-WW domain interactions, (3) NEDD4L builds Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains on the viral Gag protein (and/or other nearby substrates), (4) the juxtaposition of Gag late assembly domains and Lys-63-linked Ub chains creates high affinity binding sites for the early-acting ESCRT factors, TSG101 and ALIX, and (5) these factors then recruit the downstream ESCRT-III and VPS4 components required to effect membrane scission. This model is attractive because: (1) our work shows that AMOT functions upstream of the ESCRT pathway, (2) AMOT appears to function as a NEDD4L adaptor (see above), (3) ubiquitin transfer is required for efficient HIV-1 release (<a href=\"#bib30\">Martin-Serrano, 2007</a>), (4) NEDD4L builds Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains and can use HIV-1 Gag as a substrate (<a href=\"#bib55\">Weiss et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sette et al., 2013</a>), and (5) both TSG101/ESCRT-I and ALIX have ubiquitin binding activities. The ALIX activity is specific for Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dowlatshahi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Keren-Kaplan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pashkova et al., 2013</a>), and ESCRT-I complexes also have multiple ubiquitin binding sites, although linkage specificity has not been observed (<a href=\"#bib46\">Stefani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agromayor et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McCullough et al., 2013</a>). Cooperative binding to the late domains and ubiquitin could explain how ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I can be efficiently recruited, despite making intrinsically weak interactions with the p6<sup>Gag</sup> late assembly domains. The proposed sequence of events could also provide a \u2018timing\u2019 mechanism for recruiting (or activating) these early-acting ESCRT proteins to function at a late stage of virion assembly, although the precise timing of early-acting ESCRT recruitment remains to be clarified because published reports differ on this issue (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jouvenet et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ku et al., 2014</a>)."

Indeed, AMOTL1 has been shown to bind the M protein of PIV5 and to be required for the efficient, ubiquitin-dependent release of this virus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pei et al., 2010</a>). Motin family members therefore contribute to the assembly of at least two highly diverged enveloped viruses; the paramyxovirus PIV5 and the lentivirus HIV-1. This suggests that AMOT proteins, like the ESCRT machinery, may provide general activities required for the assembly and release of a variety of different enveloped viruses."

The hypothesis is that Nedd4L could be indirectly recruited to Gag via these AMOT proteins. This is an attractive hypothesis because it would explain earlier findings that \u201ccrippled\u201d HIV-1 Gag proteins lacking PTAP and YPXL late domains can be induced to function for budding by overexpression of Nedd4L, despite the lack of PPxY motifs in Gag, or any other obvious way to recruit Nedd4L to Gag protein. Functional budding assays demonstrate that AMOT and Nedd4L cooperate to stimulate budding of the crippled HIV-1 Gag, and that AMOT depletion reduces budding of wt HIV-1. Budding could be restored through re-expression of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 from plasmids. An extensive EM analysis of budding HIV-1 particles upon AMOT depletion was performed. AMOT depletion leads to a block in particle formation that is earlier (half-moon stage) than the one caused by Tsg101 depletion (lollipop stage)."

What is the importance of AMOT for virus budding in different cell types, and what is the status of HIV budding in HeLa cells that are naturally deficient for AMOT. Could AMOT be acting on something else which, in turn, facilitates assembly? Does AMOT play a role normally in assembly of HIV-1, or only when they have late domains missing? Is Amot functioning at the sites of assembly? What is the relative timing of AMOT and ESCRTs. What is the evidence that AMOT is a pre-requisite for recruitment of ESCRTs rather than being a parallel process? When AMOT is depleted in the HEK293 cells and the half-moon shapes are formed, is ESCRT recruited to these half-moon shapes?"

Authors as well demonstrate in one figure that overexpression of NEDD4 leads to decrease in total level of AMOT. However, in contradiction to this, they used NEDD4 overexpression in all experiments. One would expect that presence of AMOT negatively affects HIV release, by blocking access of NEDD4 and that overexpression of NEDD4 hence neutralizes overexpression of AMOT, by targeting it for the UPS degradation. How is than degradation of AMOT regulation during the HIV budding? Does presence of Gag neutralizes NEDD4 mediated degradation of AMOT? Could authors test this in their assays, and correlate the levels of AMOT in setting where NEDD4 is not overexpressed, and HIV budding is followed? In such setting both wt and dPTAP Gag should be tested, and compared."

Could authors provide TIRF images, showing recruitment of AMOT to HIV buds, and subsequent recruitment of ESCRT components, as they propose in the Ddiscussion. Currently there is no evidence that AMOT acts upstream of ESCRT beside the fact that AMOT binds NEDD4. Does ESCRT get recruited at all in case of AMOT deficient cells?

To address this shortcoming, we have now tested how altering AMOT p130 levels affects the release of infectious HIV-1 particles from Jurkat T cells. These experiments were performed by comparing the effects of overexpressing either wild type AMOT p130 or an inactive AMOT p130 mutant with point mutations in the three NEDD4-binding \u201cPPXY\u201d motifs (AMOT p130<sub>\u0394PPXY</sub>). As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, we find that overexpression of wild type AMOT p130 strongly stimulates HIV release and infectivity in a dose-dependent fashion, with maximal stimulations of 16-fold (virion release) and 7-fold (viral infectivity) vs. a transfected vector control. In contrast, overexpression of AMOT p130<sub>\u0394PPXY</sub> reproducibly reduced HIV-1 release and infectivity, presumably by dominantly inhibiting the functions of endogenous AMOT p130 proteins. We have confirmed that the levels of HIV-1 protein expression are comparable in all cases (not shown). AMOT expression levels in Jurkat T cells are beneath our detection limits, but we feel confident in concluding that AMOT stimulates HIV-1 release in this setting because the experiment is well controlled by the use of an inactive point mutant AMOT p130 construct, because the effects are dose dependent, and because we repeated the experiment three times with similar results."

Gratifyingly, the data from that screen also indicate that AMOT is important for HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T cells because an shRNA that targeted AMOT protected Jurkat cells against the cytotoxicity that occurs upon HIV infection (although the functional role of AMOT was not pursued further). Thus, there are now two independent lines of evidence that AMOT p130 is important for HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T cells (and we have, of course, now referenced <a href=\"#bib57\">Yeung et al, 2009</a>)."

We therefore repeated the experiment with a new, freshly repurified batch of siRNA. Importantly, this new AMOT p130 siRNA depleted both AMOT p130 and p80 even more efficiently than our previous batch of siRNA (see new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, panel 3, lane 4). As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, this siRNA treatment reduces viral titers by approximately 8-fold, and the inhibition of virion release is approaching the inhibition that we see for our best siRNA against TSG101 (right panels, compare lanes 3 and 4). We therefore conclude that most (or all) of the residual virus release and infectivity that we saw in previous experiments was due to incomplete silencing of AMOT p130 (and/or the residual presence of AMOT L1 and L2). These data indicate that AMOT p130 is (nearly) as important as TSG101 for HIV-1 release. Finally, we note that: 1) In addition to reducing viral budding, TSG101 depletion also reduces HIV-1 infectivity by inhibiting Gag processing and viral maturation, whereas AMOT depletion only appears to inhibit by blocking budding (see the data in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and the discussion below), and 2) the level of infectivity seen upon depletion of either AMOT p130 or TSG101 is significantly greater than the infectivity reduction seen upon depletion of the third known HIV budding factor, ALIX (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

We have now included such images for virions budding from control cells and from cells depleted of TSG101 and AMOT (new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

                    "text": "This is a good question. We (and others) generally observe a correlation between virion release and infectivity measurements, but the correlation is not perfect. This is why we believe it is important to measure both release and infectivity. One cause of these discrepancies is that budding defects can also induce defects in viral maturation and in virion contents. This is well characterized in the case of TSG101 depletion, where defective Gag processing and viral maturation contribute to loss of infectivity, even when virions are released. This effect is evident in the control experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>. Another effect that we have documented for TSG101 is that the released virions have reduced levels of reverse transcriptase. We believe that this is because even when virus budding does occur it is slow, and the processed RT proteins \u201cfloat away\u201d during the prolonged budding step. We envision that a similar effect probably occurs when AMOT depletion slows virus release, though we have not tested this directly. The important point is that aberrant kinetics of virion release appears to reduce infectivity, whereas any virions that eventually escape the cell will contribute to the signal in the release assay. Thus, treatments that disrupt (or restore) wild type virus budding kinetics can have differential effects on virion release and infectivity."
