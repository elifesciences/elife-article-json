An understanding of this network will benefit from systems such as <i>Drosophila</i> that have the ability to genetically manipulate neural activities. However, the fly's small size makes it challenging to analyze walking in this system. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed an optical method coupled with high-speed imaging that allows the tracking and quantification of gait parameters in freely walking flies with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using this method, we present a comprehensive description of many locomotion parameters, such as gait, tarsal positioning, and intersegmental and left-right coordination for wild type fruit flies. Surprisingly, we find that inactivation of sensory neurons in the fly's legs, to block proprioceptive feedback, led to deficient step precision, but interleg coordination and the ability to execute a tripod gait were unaffected."

An understanding of this network will benefit from systems such as <i>Drosophila</i> that have the ability to genetically manipulate neural activities. However, the fly's small size makes it challenging to analyze walking in this system. In order to overcome this limitation, we developed an optical method coupled with high-speed imaging that allows the tracking and quantification of gait parameters in freely walking flies with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using this method, we present a comprehensive description of many locomotion parameters, such as gait, tarsal positioning, and intersegmental and left-right coordination for wild type fruit flies. Surprisingly, we find that inactivation of sensory neurons in the fly's legs, to block proprioceptive feedback, led to deficient step precision, but interleg coordination and the ability to execute a tripod gait were unaffected."

Animals without limbs, such as snakes, move by generating by wave-like contractions along their bodies, whereas limbed animals, such as vertebrates and arthropods, walk by coordinating the movements of multi-jointed arms and legs. Locomotion in limbed animals involves bending each joint within each arm or leg in a coordinated manner, while also ensuring that the movements of all the limbs are coordinated with each other. In bipeds such as humans, for example, it is critical that one leg is in the stance phase when the other leg is in the swing phase. The rules that govern the coordination of limbs also depend on the gait, so the rules for walking are not the same as the rules for running."

Two general mechanisms are used to coordinate the firing of motor neurons. In one mechanism, local interneurons within the central nervous system coordinate motor neuron activities: in vertebrates these interneurons are found in the spinal cord. A second mechanism, termed proprioception, relies on sensory neurons that report the load and joint angles from the arms and legs back to the central nervous system, and thereby influence the firing of the motor neurons. Remarkably, both of these mechanisms, and also the types of neurons that comprise motor neuron circuits, are conserved from arthropods to vertebrates."

However, they do modify their neural circuits depending on their speed: indeed it appears that flies use subtly different neural circuitry for walking at slow, medium and fast speeds. Moreover, when genetic methods are used to block sensory feedback, the fly is still able to walk, albeit with reduced coordination and precision. Further, the data suggest that proprioception is less important when flies walk faster compared to when they walk more slowly. The next step in this research will be to combine this new method for analyzing locomotion in flies with the wide range of genetic tools that are available for the study of <i>Drosophila</i>: this will allow researchers to explore in greater detail the components of the motor neuron circuitry and their role in coordinated walking."

Locomotion is essential for animals to escape from predators, find mates, and search for food. One of the most common forms of terrestrial locomotion depends on the movement of multi-jointed legs. For this to occur, animal nervous systems face two main computational challenges. First, multiple leg joints must move rhythmically and in a precisely coordinated fashion to allow the stereotyped movements that occurs during the swing and stance phases of each step cycle. Second, these movements must be coordinated between legs, which number four in a typical tetrapod and six in a hexapod. Both challenges are met in part by interactions between central pattern generators (CPGs), neural networks within the central nervous system that have the capacity to generate rhythmic outputs (<a href=\"#bib37\">MacKay-Lyons, 2002</a>). When used for walking, individual CPGs result in the rhythmic and alternating activity of motor neurons that control the flexion and extension of single leg joints (<a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00e4ssler, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Strauss, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Borgmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">B\u00fcschges et al., 2011</a>). Leg movement coordination is also assisted by proprioceptive sensory inputs that report the load and position of leg joints (<a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00e4ssler, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Borgmann et al., 2009</a>). Other sensory modalities, such as visual, olfactory and gravitational, also modulate the activity of locomotor CPGs to allow animals to readily change their motor behavior in response to their environment (<a href=\"#bib22\">Frye, 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "An understanding of locomotion requires the identification of the neurons that comprise locomotor neural circuits. Given the complexity of these circuits, insects provide an attractive model to achieve this goal due to their relative simplicity, approachable physiology and availability of genetic tools. Moreover, adult insects share with vertebrates the same general principles of locomotion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pearson, 1993</a>). Nevertheless, despite many anatomical similarities, it is less clear how similar the neural circuitries underlying locomotion are in vertebrates and invertebrates. Groundbreaking studies in cockroaches, locusts and stick insects have identified many components and fundamental rules that regulate the walking apparatus, such as the definition of multiple gaits (<a href=\"#bib27\">Graham et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burrows, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zill et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ritzmann and B\u00fcschges, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">B\u00fcschges et al., 2008</a>). However, unlike in vertebrates, where gait transitions are discontinuous, it is less clear in which situations insects use distinct gaits and how they transition between them. Although theoretical considerations suggested the possibility that gait transitions may be more gradual than they are in vertebrates, this question has not been fully resolved (<a href=\"#bib27\">Graham et al., 1985</a>). Walking speeds in cockroaches, for example, cluster into two groups, but both rely on the tripod gait (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bender et al., 2011</a>). The stick insect tends to use a tetrapod gait at slower speeds and a tripod gait at faster speeds (<a href=\"#bib27\">Graham et al., 1985</a>). <i>Drosophila</i>, on the other hand, are reported to primarily use the tripod gait (<a href=\"#bib52\">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</a>). Similar questions arise with respect to the role of sensory feedback in coordinated walking. Although feedback is thought to be critical for coordination between legs (<a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00e4ssler, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Borgmann et al., 2009</a>) most studies address this question using electrophysiology readouts with tethered animals. In addition, with the exception of surgical ablation experiments (<a href=\"#bib56\">Usherwood et al., 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cruse et al., 1984</a>), it has been difficult to dissect the contribution of individual sensory modalities. Gaining further insights into these questions may benefit by the use of systems that use freely walking animals with access to genetic tools to identify and manipulate the individual components of locomotor circuits."

However, despite the availability of powerful genetic tools, there is a lack of quantitative and robust methods to analyze the consequences of manipulating locomotor circuits in the fruit fly. Consequently, many studies focus on relatively low-resolution locomotor assays such as monitoring the average speed of a population, walking trajectories, or the ability to fulfill simple motor tasks such as climbing a vertical surface (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ganetzky and Flanagan, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Branson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Slawson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Robie et al., 2010</a>).

Our fTIR-based method is similar in principle to that used for analyzing the gaits of larger animals (e.g. CatWalk (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vrinten and Hamers, 2003</a>); <a href=\"http://www.noldus.com/animal-behavior-research/products/catwalk/\">http://www.noldus.com/animal-behavior-research/products/catwalk/</a>), but differs significantly due to the small size and rapid walking speed of fruit flies. Using this approach, we are able to track the position of each footprint relative to the body at high spatial and temporal resolution as an untethered fly walks freely on a flat surface. Custom analysis software allows the extraction of many parameters of fly walking behavior, including gait, coordination between legs, and footprint positions. Using this method, we comprehensively characterized the walking behavior of wild type animals. Unlike walking in vertebrates, our data demonstrate that flies do not abruptly switch from one gait to another, but instead rely on a continuum of gait patterns that correlate with walking speed. However, several readouts suggest that flies may use distinct neural programs at slow, medium, and fast walking speeds. Genetic manipulations to specifically disrupt sensory feedback from the legs show that blocking proprioception results in altered step parameters and reduced walking precision, especially at slower speeds, but does not interfere with the ability of flies to execute a tripod gait. Together, these data reveal the underlying parameters of wild type walking in <i>Drosophila</i> and show that proprioceptive sensory feedback is important, but not absolutely required, for coordinated locomotion."

However, in smaller insects such as <i>Drosophila</i>, such a strategy becomes not only technically challenging but is also likely to disturb walking behavior and generate artifacts. Such challenges have precluded a more detailed examination of the components that comprise the fly's walking behavior. To overcome these obstacles, and to measure the biomechanical features underlying walking in <i>Drosophila</i> we turned to an optical effect known as <i>frustrated Total Internal Reflection</i> (fTIR) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhu et al., 1986</a>). Total Internal Reflection occurs when light traveling through a medium\u2014in this case optical glass\u2014hits an interface with another medium with a lower refractive index, such as air. If the angle of incidence is above the so-called critical angle (as compared to the normal of the surface), defined by Snell's Law (<a href=\"#bib33\">Katz, 2002</a>), the light is no longer refracted but is internally reflected. For a glass-air interface this corresponds to \u223c43\u00b0. However, if a denser material, such as the tarsus of an insect leg, contacts the surface of the glass, then the locally \u2018frustrated\u2019 total internal reflection will scatter the light, which can be recorded by a high-speed video camera (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sumriddetchkajorn and Amarit, 2006</a>).

For example, as <i>average speed</i> increases there is a small but noticeable decrease in <i>swing phase duration</i> in the forelegs when compared to other segments. In addition, compared to other leg segments, foreleg <i>swing speed</i> varies more linearly with <i>average speed</i>, as seen by a larger R value (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

From these data we can reconstruct the stance positions relative to the center of the body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In order to account for variations in body size, these plots are normalized to body length. Stance traces are generated as each leg contacts the glass. The onset of these traces is termed the <i>Anterior Extreme Position</i> (<i>AEP</i>), which corresponds to the position where the leg first contacts the glass after touchdown at the end protraction (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cruse, 1976</a>). The position at the end of the stance phase, just before the tarsi enter swing phase, corresponds to the <i>Posterior Extreme Position</i> (<i>PEP</i>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cruse, 1976</a>). <i>Stance traces</i> can be compared by their straightness, which is a measure of how much wobble there is in body position relative to each footprint, which are stationary. This parameter, the <i>stance linearity index</i>, is calculated by computing the average difference between an actual stance trace and a smoothed version of the trace (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Measuring this parameter, faster animals have straighter stance traces (lower <i>stance linearity indexes</i>) compared to slower animals. This trend is seen up to approximately 34 mm/s, after which this value stabilizes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

This parameter\u2014termed <i>footprint clustering</i>\u2014corresponds to the vector sum of standard deviations (STDs) from the mean for all <i>AEP</i>s or <i>PEP</i>s calculated for each leg (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). For example, a small <i>footprint clustering</i> value for the foreleg <i>AEP</i> means that the <i>AEP</i> coordinates (relative to the fly's body) were similar for all of the foreleg steps in a video. Using this parameter, we asked if there was a relationship between <i>footprint clustering</i> and <i>average speed</i>. For the reasons given above, we binned the speed values into three groups: &lt;20 mm/s; between 20 and 34 mm/s; and &gt;34 mm/s. For both <i>AEP</i> and <i>PEP</i>, the footprint clustering values were smaller for faster flies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>), suggesting that animals have more spatially restricted steps as they increase their speed. We also found that <i>AEP</i> clustering values are generally smaller than <i>PEP</i> clustering values (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), suggesting a tighter motor control at touchdown (<i>AEP</i>) compared to stance offset (<i>PEP</i>). Pooling the data for all legs, <i>AEP</i> clustering was smaller than <i>PEP</i> clustering in 61 out of 71 (86%) videos. This difference is largest for the forelegs and is very small for the hindlegs (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

At faster speeds, for all legs, <i>AEP</i> coordinates are shifted anteriorly, while <i>PEP</i> coordinates are shifted posteriorly. Interestingly, at faster speeds midleg <i>AEP</i> and <i>PEP</i> are also shifted laterally, perhaps to increase stability at higher speeds. In contrast, the hindlegs are positioned closer to the body at higher speeds, perhaps to allow for a stronger power stroke."

Consistent with the observations of Graham in the first instar stick insect (<a href=\"#bib26\">Graham, 1972</a>), peak speeds are observed midway through each stance phase when the retracting tripod reaches its maximum motor output. Conversely, minimum speeds are observed at the transition between phases, when the stance switches to a different set of legs.

To quantify these <i>gait maps</i> we plot the <i>gait index.</i> To calculate the <i>gait index</i> each frame is assigned a value (+1 for tripod, \u22121 for tetrapod and 0 for noncanonical) and these values are averaged for a sliding window of <i>n</i> frames; empirically, we find that <i>n</i> = 8 is most effective at distinguishing flies primarily using the tetrapod and tripod gaits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2034,B\u2034</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We define the <i>tripod</i> or <i>tetrapod indexes</i> as the fraction of frames in a video in which a leg combination matches one of these two gaits. As expected, faster flies spend a larger fraction of time in a tripod configuration, which presumably allows flies to maximize leg thrust (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The inverse relationship is seen for the tetrapod configuration, where slower animals display the highest proportion of this gait (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

First, there is not an abrupt transition between the tripod and tetrapod gaits at a particular speed. Instead, the proportion of time a fly spends using each gait varies gradually according to <i>average speed</i>. Second, the idealized tripod and tetrapod combinations only account for a subset of all stance configurations present in our data set. For example, the fastest flies in our data set had <i>tripod</i> and <i>tetrapod indexes</i> of \u223c70% and &lt;10%, respectively. Noncanonical leg configurations in which none or only one leg is in swing phase account for 48% to 21% of all combinations, depending on the <i>average speed</i> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Inspection of these videos reveals that these noncanonical combinations generally occur at the transitions between stances (data not shown and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2033</a>). Thus, slower animals spend less time using the tripod gait in part because they use the tetrapod gait more, but also because they spend a larger fraction of time in gait transitions, where noncanonical leg configurations play a dominant role. In addition, at slow speeds occasional short sequences of pentapod stances (\u22643 steps) fit the so-called \u2018<i>wave gait</i>\u2019 in which individual legs swing in a wave-like pattern from front to back (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wosnitza et al., 2012</a>)."

                                "text": "Typically for hexapods, leg touchdown occurs close to where the immediately anterior ipsilateral leg made contact, a behavior termed <i>follow-the-leader</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dean and Wendler, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cruse et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Song and Choi, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brunn and Dean, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sponberg and Full, 2008</a>). This behavior depends on sensory feedback and specialized intersegmental interneurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brunn and Dean, 1994</a>). One possible advantage of this behavior is to ensure that the animal places its legs on safe ground, particularly on rough terrain. As a consequence, mid and hindleg footprints fall close to where the foreleg was placed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We quantified this tendency by measuring the <i>footprint alignment</i> parameter, which corresponds to the mean standard deviation of the projection of the fore, mid, and hind footprints along the body's displacement axis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Accordingly, footprints that are more aligned have a smaller <i>footprint alignment</i> value (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, plotting <i>footprint alignment</i> as a function of speed revealed a non-linear relationship in which the data points cluster into three groups (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). At slow speeds (&lt;20 mm/s), <i>footprint alignment</i> values were relatively large while at fast speeds (&gt;34 mm/s) these values were much smaller, suggesting that <i>footprint alignment</i> is highly constrained. Notably, at intermediate speeds (between 20 and 34 mm/s), there was no correlation between speed and <i>footprint alignment</i>. The more aligned footprints observed in faster flies could assist the maintenance of static stability during tripod transitions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Song and Choi, 1989</a>). In support of this possibility, the <i>tripod index</i> increases with lower <i>footprint alignment</i> values (data not shown). The abrupt difference seen in alignment values between slow, intermediate, and fast flies suggests that the motor circuits controlling walking in these three speed groups may differ. Interestingly, one of the transitions in <i>footprint alignment</i> values occurs at speeds (\u223c20 mm/s) that are underrepresented in our data set, consistent with the existence of a possible gait transition at this speed."

Such coordination is seen when examining the phase differences between the contralateral and ipsilateral legs of the same segment. For example, during a tripod gait, contralateral legs within the same segment maintain a consistent phase value of 0.5 \u00b1 0.05 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Graham, 1972</a>). The FlyWalker software computes the phase values for contralateral legs within the same segment and between adjacent ipsilateral legs. We compared these values for the slow (&lt;20 mm/s) and fast (&gt;34 mm/s) groups of flies in our data set. In both groups, contralateral legs within the same segment display an average phase of approximately 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). However, slower animals display a higher degree of variability as seen by a shorter r vector in these radial plots. Examining hindlegs vs midlegs and midlegs vs forelegs revealed a decrease in the phase values for slower animals (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with an increased step period without a proportional increase in the step lag."

Different types of proprioceptor organs, positioned in different regions of the legs, report different aspects of the posture and terrain. For example, the tibial campaniform sensilla (or sensilla campaniformia) are mostly responsible for measuring body load while the femoral chordotonal organ (ChO) is a stretch sensor, reporting joint angles as the animal walks (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shanbhag et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zill et al., 2004</a>)."

First, we tested the inactivation of the leg ChO. The <i>nanchung</i> (<i>nan</i>) gene encodes for a cation channel subunit and is expressed exclusively in the sensory cilia of chordotonal organs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Loss of function alleles for <i>nan</i> display loss of sound perception, hygrosensation and negative gravitaxis defects, in addition to an \u2018uncoordinated\u2019 phenotype (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sun et al., 2009</a>). Second, we tested neuronal inactivation induced by the expression of tetanus toxin (TNT) in a large subset of sensory neurons in the legs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To restrict TNT expression to leg sensory neurons we relied on a intersectional approach using a <i>UAS-FRT-stop-FRT-TNT</i> line (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stockinger et al., 2005</a>), the pan-sensory driver <i>5-40-Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>), and a 567 base pair <i>cis</i>-regulatory enhancer fragment of <i>dachshund</i> (<i>dac</i>) to drive the FLP recombinase in the leg imaginal disc (<a href=\"#bib24\">Giorgianni and Mann, 2011</a>).

These flies also exhibited normal left-right and intersegmental coordination (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Strikingly, however, stance traces for <i>nan</i><sup><i>36a</i></sup> and <i>5-40</i><sup><i>Leg</i></sup><i>&gt;TNT</i> flies highlight several locomotion defects (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), which were quantified (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We observed an increase in the <i>step length</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>); a more wobbly body placement (reflected by an increase in <i>stance linearity</i>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>); and a larger variability in <i>footprint clustering</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure7D</a>). In addition, both <i>AEP</i> and <i>PEP</i> were altered, in part because of a longer stride, and midleg placement was farther from the body (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and data not shown). Both <i>swing</i> and <i>stance duration</i> increased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>) resulting in a longer <i>period</i>. The increase in <i>step length</i> reflects both overreaching (more anterior AEPs) and delayed swing onset (more posterior PEPs). However, <i>swing speeds</i> were minimally affected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>), suggesting that the motor neurons, themselves, were not compromised in proprioception deficient flies. <i>Footprint alignment</i> values also decreased in flies deprived of sensory feedback (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). This phenotype was partially a consequence of a longer stride but also because protraction was often completed when direct contact was made with the next anterior leg. Importantly, although both <i>nan</i><sup><i>36a</i></sup> and <i>5-40</i><sup><i>Leg</i></sup><i>&gt;TNT</i> affect sensory structures in the antennae, only an increase in <i>swing duration</i> was observed upon surgical removal of the antenna, arguing that all other phenotypes are a result of knocking out sensory feedback specifically from the legs (data not shown)."

It is also noteworthy that several of the trends observed in sensory-deprived flies (such as <i>AEP</i>, <i>PEP</i>, and <i>footprint alignment</i>) are the same as those observed in faster wild type flies. In addition, sensory deprived flies position their midlegs further from their bodies, similar to the trend seen in fast flies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3F and 7A</a>). These observations are consistent with the idea that flies walking at slow, medium, and fast speeds use distinct neural programs, and that flies walking at fast speeds are less dependent on sensory feedback."

Emerging and established tools have set the fruit fly as a valuable genetic system for studying many behaviors such as olfaction and courtship. Improved expression tools (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jenett et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jory et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Manning et al., 2012</a>), transgenic neuromodulators (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pulver et al., 2009</a>) and imaging of neuronal activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Seelig et al., 2010</a>), continue to improve the <i>Drosophila</i> toolkit. However, despite the growing collection of tools to disturb the circuit that regulates waking, <i>Drosophila</i> neurogenetics lacks a reliable method to measure the outcome of these manipulations. Here we fill this gap in the toolkit by describing an approach that unambiguously detects with high temporal and spatial resolution the kinematic behavior of freely walking fruit flies on a flat surface. A powerful and downloadable FlyWalker software tool allows the tracking of both the fly body and legs when they contact the ground as the animal moves forward."

In addition to corroborating earlier findings, the high degree of temporal and spatial resolution, coupled to the simultaneous tracking of the body allowed us to define several additional parameters, particularly those that address the spatial aspects of locomotion. Several observations also suggest the existence of previously unknown transitions that occur at \u223c20 mm/s and \u223c34 mm/s. For one, we find that flies walking at 20 mm/s are underrepresented in our data set. In addition, some parameters, such as <i>stance linearity</i> and <i>footprint alignment</i>, show striking differences in flies walking slower and faster than these speeds. These transitions do not, however, represent abrupt transitions in gait because the tripod gait was observed at all speeds, at gradually diminishing frequencies in slower flies. This scenario contrasts with abrupt gait transitions observed in many vertebrates, for example horses, where each gait is only observed in a defined range of speeds (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hoyt and Taylor, 1981</a>). Nevertheless, our data suggest that in flies modifications of a common neural circuit may regulate walking at these different speeds (<a href=\"#bib59\">Watson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sponberg and Full, 2008</a>). Because each leg muscle is targeted by multiple motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baek and Mann, 2009</a>), it is feasible that different subsets of MNs play a more or less dominant role at different speeds."

For example, using single leg preparations of the stick insect, it was found that for mid and foreleg steps to be out of phase (as they are in wild type walking), stimulation of sensory afferents in the midleg was required; without this stimulation, the CPGs for these legs fired in phase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borgmann et al., 2009</a>). These, as well as additional observations (<a href=\"#bib13\">B\u00fcschges et al., 2008</a>), argue that sensory feedback from legs in stance phase is required for interleg coordination."

In one set of experiments, we took advantage of a mutation that specifically disrupts the function of the ChOs while a second set of experiments used a combinatorial misexpression approach to inactivate the majority of sensory neurons in the leg, including the ChO, hair plates, campaniform sensilla and mechanosensory bristles. In both sets of experiments, gait parameters and interleg swing phases were largely normal when sensory feedback was impaired. These results suggest that in the fly interleg coordination is not dominated by sensory feedback. Instead, they suggest that communication between CPGs, perhaps by local interneurons, may be sufficient for coordination, a suggestion that is supported by recent studies in vertebrates ((<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiehn, 2011</a>) for review). In insects, interneurons have been implicated in interjoint coordination within individual legs and in footfall placement, but their role in interleg coordination has not been established (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brunn and Dean, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brunn, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Matheson, 2002</a>). The different requirements for sensory feedback observed here compared to electrophysiology studies in the stick insect may in part be because in our experiments leg sensory neurons were inactivated in all six legs (in the case of <i>5-40</i><sup><i>leg</i></sup><i>&gt;TNT</i>) or all ChOs in the animal (in the case of the <i>nan</i> mutant). We speculate that when all six legs are equally impaired, the flies resort to a CPG and interneuron-dominated system, which is sufficient to execute the tripod gait. Consistent with this notion, although interleg coordination was impaired upon amputation of a single hindleg in <i>Drosophila</i>, the flies were able to recover a partial tripod gait (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wosnitza et al., 2012</a>)."

This observation is consistent with the idea that when flies walk fast, they use a largely sensory-independent CPG-based system where individual CPGs communicate by local interneurons to achieve coordination. In contrast, in slower flies, sensory feedback would be invoked to allow animals to negotiate more complex terrains. These speculations are supported by our observations that several parameters measured here, most prominently <i>footprint clustering</i>, appear distinct at slow, medium, and fast walking speeds. Thus, although the tripod gait is used at all speeds, distinct neural programs may come into play that are more or less dependent on sensory feedback, depending on the speed."

Using this approach, we present many parameters that comprehensively describe walking by wild type flies. Our initial analysis of sensory-deprived flies reveal that proprioception, at least from the legs, is largely dispensable for coordinated walking and the tripod gait. In the future, additional expression tools will allow the targeting of other subsets of sensory and interneurons and the ability to carry out gain-of-function experiments. Moreover, the fTIR apparatus can be used with other arthropods as long as they, like <i>Drosophila</i>, possess adhesive structures on their tarsi (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gorb et al., 2007</a>). However, although footprints and body position can be readily identified with this method, our current setup does not provide the ability to follow individual leg joints, which can be done in larger insects such as the stick insect (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cruse and Bartling, 1995</a>). Nevertheless, the set of parameters measured here underscore the complex mechanisms and circuits regulating hexapod locomotion. Our approach, in combination with the growing collection of genetic tools available in <i>Drosophila</i> should open many additional opportunities to unravel the mechanism of locomotion in animals and improve bio-inspired machines."

The edges of the glass were scribed and broken so they would be clear, but not polished. The fourth edge of the glass was fixed to a filter mount and the whole system was attached to a bench plate by steel mounting posts (Edmund optics, Barrington, NJ). The LEDs were powered by a variable power supply (Tekpower, Montclair, CA). In order to minimize deflected light, the edges of the glass and the LEDs are covered with black ink or black cardboard. Consequently, most of the light from the LEDs enters the glass below the critical angle. To recycle light that reaches the edges of the optical glass, the remaining edges of the glass are covered with aluminum foil. Movies were acquired using a Photron (San Diego, CA) Fastcam MC2 camera using a 55 mm Computar (Commack, NY) telecentric lens, which has very little optical distortion. By measuring 1 mm intervals at multiple positions within the field of view we determined the optical distortion to be less than 4%. The lens aperture (f/2.8) was maximized in order to increase light sensitivity and minimize depth of field."

Consequently, when a leg is in stance phase it is detected by fTIR and the absence of signal indicates a swing phase. In addition, a small amount of reflected light illuminates the fly's body (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the center of the fTIR apparatus, a plexiglass tunnel limits the mobility of the fly and increases the chance it will move in a straight line (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This tunnel is slightly separated from the glass by a nylon string in order to minimize the contact between the plexiglass and optical glass, which would produce a fTIR signal. In order to trigger an optomotor response, two optical fibers connected to a UV light source are present at both ends of the tunnel (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Images are detected within a \u223c1.2 cm<sup>2</sup> area by a high-speed camera at a rate of 250 frames per second at f/2.8. This allows sufficient light to be detected per frame while permitting a high temporal resolution of 4 milliseconds per frame."

At both ends, a 1 mm diameter hole was made in order to accommodate an optical fiber. As a cover for the tunnel, a second piece plexiglass of equal size was glued on top. A 5 mm hole was drilled on the cover approximately 1 cm from the edge in order to insert the flies into the chamber. In order to raise the chamber slightly, two small holes 1 mm apart, were drilled at each of the four corners of the chamber. A nylon wire\u20140.48 mm diameter\u2014was inserted through the two holes to create a loop that functions as spacers to prevent the chamber from contacting the optical glass. Finally, the chamber was painted in black on the outside and the interior walls coated with Fluon AD-1 (www.entosupplies.com.au) mixed with black India ink in order to encourage walking on the optical glass (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Once the image sequence is loaded into the FlyWalker interface (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), its analysis becomes a two-step process. First, body and footprints are tracked automatically by the software based on sudden increases of brightness within preset thresholds, as well as information from preceding frames. Any fTIR signal present in frames prior to the appearance of the fly (due for example to dust) is subtracted from all subsequent frames to minimize false positive signals. Sequential frame comparison sets the displacement axis, which helps with the identification of each of the six footprints, for example the left and right fore (LF, RF), left and right mid (LM, RM), and left and right hind (LH, RH) legs. Second, the software allows the user to manually correct any mislabeled or missed footprints. A sample video of the processed fTIR effect can be seen in <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>. For each frame, the user can reject a mislabeled footprint or add a footprint that is visible, but was not included because it fell below the preset threshold. The script is optimized to minimize the time spent editing each video. A setup window allows the user to define auto-tracking parameters and which features to show on-screen (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For example, depending on the user-defined settings, the body trace and/or past footprints can be visualized (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Importantly, through the use of a calibration reticle, the user can input the pixel/\u03bcm ratio, which allows the program to introduce a scale bar (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), calculate distances and speeds."

Their automated optical method for tracking insect footfalls and analyzing the kinematic data are powerful and impressive. The data acquired is extensive and is mined for many pertinent locomotor parameters including interlimb coordination and gait. Data is presented that gait and some other characteristics, such as stance linearity and footprint alignment, are different in flies walking slower and faster speeds. There are not discrete transitions in gait, however: the typical tripod gait occurs at all speeds, but with diminishing frequency in slower flies. The normative data set is extensive and of real value for future analysis in this important genetic system. The most interesting aspect of the work involves inactivating sensory neurons of the legs; one set of experiments uses a mutation that specifically disrupts the function of chrodotonal organs, while a second set of experiments uses a combinatorial misexpression approach to inactivate the majority of sensory neurons in the leg."

Stance traces showed some defects, however: step length increased with a more wobbly body placement and a larger variability in footprint clustering. The surprise here comes because in the well-studied stick insect system, sensory inactivation of a leg disrupts proper interlimb coordination. The walking of sensory-deprived flies suggests that flies may be less dependent on sensory feedback when they walk fast because defects were more pronounced in slow flies. Stick insects walk very slowly and rarely on flat surfaces."

In addition to the technological innovation, the real scientific interest is the impetus to future work provided by the analysis of the sensory-deprived flies with FlyWalker.

Second, there is a dip in the number of flies walking at average speed values of \u223c20 mm/sec (Figure 2A). Third, the stance linearity data shown in Figure 3C argue that speeds &gt;34 mm/sec behave differently than speeds &lt; 34mm/sec. Fourth, normal probability plots are linear between \u223c20 and \u223c35 mm/sec, but show non-linearity above and below this range (see our response to comment 3d, below, to see this plot). Thus, the two speeds (\u223c20 and \u223c34 mm/sec) that define our three speed groups were chosen due to non-linear or discontinuous behaviors of the data derived from four independent readouts."
