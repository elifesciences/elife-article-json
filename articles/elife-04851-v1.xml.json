In this study, we demonstrate that direct TGF-\u03b2 signaling to CD4 T cells is important for the formation of influenza-specific Tfh cells, GC reactions and development of isotype-switched, flu-specific antibody responses. Early during infection, TGF-\u03b2 signaling suppressed the expression of the high affinity IL-2 receptor \u03b1 chain (CD25) on virus-specific CD4 T cells, which tempered IL-2 signaling and STAT5 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in Tfh precursor CD4 T cells. Inhibition of mTOR allowed for the differentiation of Tfh cells in the absence of TGF-\u03b2R signaling, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 insulates Tfh progenitor cells from IL-2-delivered mTOR signals, thereby promoting Tfh differentiation during acute viral infection. These findings identify a new pathway critical for the generation of Tfh cells and humoral responses during respiratory viral infections."
