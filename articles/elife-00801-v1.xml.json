Increases may indicate neural recruitment, while decreases may imply that a region became unimportant or developed a more efficient representation of the skill. These overlapping mechanisms make interpreting learning-related changes of spatially averaged activity difficult. Here we show that motor-skill acquisition is associated with the emergence of highly distinguishable activity patterns for trained movement sequences, in the absence of average activity increases. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants produced either four trained or four untrained finger sequences. Using multivariate pattern analysis, both untrained and trained sequences could be discriminated in primary and secondary motor areas. However, trained sequences were classified more reliably, especially in the supplementary motor area. Our results indicate skill learning leads to the development of specialized neuronal circuits, which allow the execution of fast and accurate sequential movements without average increases in brain activity."

Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that learning can lead to both activity increases and decreases in primary and secondary motor areas (for reviews, see <a href=\"#bib4\">Dayan and Cohen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Penhune and Steele, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hardwick et al., 2013</a>), these average activity changes remain hard to interpret. On the one hand, motor skill acquisition may lead to increased neural recruitment for trained behaviors, thereby increasing average activation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grafton et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Karni et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hazeltine et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Floyer-Lea and Matthews, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lehericy et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Penhune and Doyon, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Penhune and Doyon, 2005</a>). Alternatively, learning may result in the development of representations that produce the same behavior with higher neural efficiency, thereby reducing activity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jenkins et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Toni et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ungerleider et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Poldrack et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Xiong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Penhune and Doyon, 2005</a>). Finally, motor practice may induce simultaneous signal increases (due to increased neural recruitment) and signal decreases (due to more efficient encoding), making motor learning difficult to detect using traditional fMRI paradigms (<a href=\"#bib43\">Steele and Penhune, 2010</a>)."

Consider the neural activation patterns for two different finger sequences in areas with different types of movement representations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). A region that controls elementary hand movements independent of their sequential context may comprise five separate neuronal populations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), each of which a dynamical system (<a href=\"#bib1\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>), whose activation causes the production of an individual finger press. Because each sequence contains each finger once, the two sequences will activate the same cortical patches, albeit in a different temporal order. Due to the low temporal resolution of fMRI, in particularly when averaging, as done here, over three executions of the same sequence, the two sequences would be therefore associated with identical activity patterns."

The development of such neuronal populations with training is thought to underlie the faster production of trained sequences (<a href=\"#bib34\">Matsuzaka et al., 2007</a>). Importantly, the existence of such units would cause the two sequences to rely on partly separate neuronal populations, that is they should be associated with slightly different activity patterns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). After prolonged training, some neurons even appear to code for longer fragments, firing preferentially at the beginning of specific sequences (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tanji and Shima, 1994</a>). Areas containing many of such units would therefore activate even more distinct neuronal populations for particular trained sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

During one session participants performed the four trained sequences, and during the other four untrained sequences, in both cases with their left hand. The order of scans was counterbalanced between participants. Within each imaging run, the sequences were executed in pseudo-random order, with each trial lasting 13.5 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This design allowed us to measure repeatedly the activity pattern for each individual sequence. Using traditional univariate analysis, we first determined the regions that showed sequence-related activation increases compared to rest, average over the four sequences. As expected, we found significant activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) in contralateral primary motor (M1) and sensory cortices (S1). Additional bilateral activation was found in secondary motor areas, including dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd, PMv), supplementary motor areas (SMA/pre-SMA), in regions on the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and in the occipital-parietal junction (OPJ) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Culham and Valyear, 2006</a>). All activations were highly significant after correction for multiple tests. The pronounced ipsilateral activation during non-dominant hand movements is consistent with the suggested special role of the left hemisphere in complex movements (<a href=\"#bib48\">Verstynen et al., 2005</a>)."

One may argue that a region that contains neuronal populations that encode single finger movements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) may have been activated with slightly different time-courses for the different sequences, which may have been picked up by the classifier. This explanation, however, is unlikely for two reasons: first, the spatial distribution of classification accuracy for sequences differs substantially from that for single finger movements (<a href=\"#bib8\">Diedrichsen et al., 2012</a>), especially in the ipsilateral, left hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Here, single finger movements are represented close to the central sulcus, whereas sequences are represented more prominently in premotor and parietal areas. Secondly, to test the idea of different temporal activation profiles directly, we defined six bilateral regions of interest (ROIs; see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Within each region, we identified the main components of the temporal response (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The first component yielded the canonical activation profile, while the additional components described temporal variations around this mean time course (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Classification accuracy was highest when using the weight of the first temporal component for each voxel as input to the classifier. When we added the voxel-by-voxel weights for any further temporal component, classification accuracy reduced markedly, indicating that these components did not carry any additional information (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

First, classification accuracy for S1 was already above chance for the second TR, which was acquired 2.7\u20135.4 s after the onset of the number cue, <i>t</i>(15) = 3.335, p=0.002.

Thus, it is likely that the informative patterns were caused at least partly by instruction-related activity. Secondly, even areas such as OPJ and PMd exhibited sustained classification accuracy over the whole trial. Thus, these areas did not only represent the string of numbers presented on the screen; rather they exhibited a sustained representation of the sequence during the execution phase, during which the number cue was not visible anymore."

                                "text": "Importantly, our hypothesis predicted that each sequence would be associated with a unique spatial activation pattern. To investigate this directly, we employed a newly developed method that consists of a set of classifiers, each using a different number of informative spatial pattern components (<a href=\"#bib7\">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</a>). To illustrate this method, assume that each sequence activated a unique set of voxels. To describe the differences between these four patterns, one would need three linear components (or contrasts), each of which would capture an equivalent amount of variance. Thus, the patterns would be distributed evenly in the space spanned by the three pattern components (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, red dots). Consequently, classification accuracy should be highest when taking all three components into account. In contrast, if sequences could be distinguished because they differed on a single variable (e.g., difficulty), then they should be associated with a single activity pattern that is scaled in intensity by different amounts. The patterns would therefore mostly differ along a single pattern component (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, blue dots). In this case, classification accuracy should be highest when using only the most informative spatial component (one-dimensional simulation, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). While we have shown that this is indeed the case when the same movement is executed at different force levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</a>), we found here that all sequence representations showed the highest accuracy when using all three available linear components (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>, red line). This was the case in all ROIs and for both untrained sequences (all <i>t</i>(15) &gt; 2.496, p&lt;0.025) and trained sequence (all <i>t</i>(15) &gt; 5.261, p&lt;0.001).

Our data indicates that untrained sequences were associated with unique, but basically random activity patterns. This means that any two activation patterns exhibit some non-overlapping features, but also share a specific amount of shared activity. The predicted accuracy curve when classifying four simulated random patterns using 1\u20133 spatial components is shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a> (black line).

Furthermore, we tested whether the increase in discriminability of cortical activation patterns could have been caused by the reduced behavioral variability that normally accompanies learning. In considering this idea, it is important to keep in mind that classification accuracy is determined both by within-sequence variability and by between-sequences differences. To evaluate both together, we tested how well a linear classifier could discriminate between each set of four sequences based on MT, average force, or error rate, either considered in isolation or in any combination as separate features.

This, however, is an important distinction: when decomposing our activity patterns (<a href=\"#bib6\">Diedrichsen et al., 2011</a>), we found that 99% of the voxel-by-voxel variance was explained by a pattern component that is common to all trained sequences, with less than 1% being attributable to the sequence-specific component (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

For example, classification may have relied on populations of neurons that encode for the sequential transitions between pairs of fingers, many of which were shared between trained and untrained sequences. More likely, however, the unique activity patterns for untrained sequences relied on preexisting neuronal coding of sequential context: whether typing on a keyboard or playing an instrument, humans engage in many sequential motor behaviors, and such general representations would discriminate between trained and untrained sequences alike."

Some of these regions could represent the sequences phonologically as string of number during subvocal rehearsal (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hartwigsen et al., 2013</a>), abstractly in a spatial reference, or motorically in an intrinsic references frame (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keele et al., 1995</a>).

Furthermore, we could show that these training-related changes became most evident when looking at multiple spatial components of the activity patterns. This finding implies two things. First, it shows that the changes in classification accuracy were not due to larger between-sequence differences, or lower within-sequence variability, of a single behavioral factor\u2014otherwise the difference would have been apparent using a classifier that uses only the most informative spatial pattern component. Secondly, it shows that training leads to the formation of a unique spatial activity pattern for each sequence and therefore a more even spacing of the activity patterns in the space of possible patterns. While it is still possible that this observation reflects changes in a combination of multiple other behavioral variables, none of the possible combinations of the behavioral measures was able to explain the observed accuracy difference between trained and untrained sequences.

The latter finding is consistent with specialization of the left hemisphere for complex movements, executed with either the dominant or non-dominant hand (<a href=\"#bib48\">Verstynen et al., 2005</a>).

Involving larger populations of neurons in motor planning and execution may reduce neuronal noise and lead to less variable performance. Second, the recruited neurons likely become more specialized for specific trained behaviors. Therefore, fewer non-specialized units must be recruited, decreasing the activity for the majority of neurons in a region (<a href=\"#bib40\">Poldrack, 2000</a>).

Examining average activity alone, one might be tempted to conclude that many secondary motor areas play a reduced role in the production of highly trained skills, which may be encoded in a few execution-related areas such as the primary motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Penhune and Steele, 2012</a>). In contrast, our results indicate that skill learning generates increasingly specialized representations, which are distributed widely across both primary and secondary cortical motor areas."

Each functional scanning session consisted of 8 runs of 110 vol each. The first three images of each sequence were excluded from the analysis. We acquired 32 slices with 2.15-mm thickness in an interleaved sequence (0.15 mm gap, 2.3 \u00d7 2.3 mm<sup>2</sup> in-plane resolution) in an axial orientation. This arrangement covered the dorsal part of both cerebral hemispheres, but not the inferior temporal lobe or the cerebellum.

The input data (<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) consisted of 4 (sequences) \u00d7 8 (runs) activation estimates for the p<i>=</i>160 neighboring voxels. Using the data from seven runs, we calculated the mean activation vector for each sequence, and the average <i>PxP</i> within-class covariance matrix \u03a3, which was regularized by adding 1% of the diagonal mean to all diagonal elements. The activation vectors from the remaining eighth run were then classified by assigning them to the class with the highest likelihood <i>p</i>(x) (for details, see <a href=\"#bib6\">Diedrichsen et al., 2011</a>). By retraining and cross-validating the classifier with all possible training and test sets, we obtained an average classification accuracy. If the neural activation patterns did not differ systematically between sequences, accuracy should be 25% (guessing rate). Systematically higher classification rates indicate that a region showed differential activation patterns for the four sequences, and the size of the classification accuracy served as a measure of the strength of the sequence representation in that region. For between-subject analysis, we z-transformed the classification accuracies, using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution."

Using single value decomposition we then determined the main temporal components of the response for each anatomical ROI (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kay et al., 2008</a>). Instead of the beta-estimate for the canonical hemodynamic response, we submitted the component weights for each voxel and trial to the LDA classifier.

If the patterns only differ in the intensity scaling of a common pattern, then best classification accuracy should be achieved with a classifier that uses only the most informative pattern component of the training data set. If, however, the patterns are evenly distributed in the pattern space, classification accuracy should increase for each additional spatial dimension that the classifier uses. Simulations of classification accuracies under different assumptions are conducted so that the classification accuracies of the three-dimensional classifier matched those of the data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; for details, see <a href=\"#bib7\">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</a>)."

This means that the sequence-specific pattern expression was much weaker than the patterns shared across sequences. This should be emphasized more in the Abstract and Discussion.

For instance, while it is clear that sequence-specific decoding should emerge in well-documented areas like SMA or M1, the authors also report robust decoding in very posterior regions of the IPS as well as OPJ. This seems like a very important and novel finding as sequences have not been typically explored there (at least in the monkey neurophysiological literature). Yet, we could not find any discussion of these results in the paper. In addition, areas like PMd and even S1 show a set of interesting effects and these findings are not mentioned in the Discussion section. We believe that interesting questions can be asked of these regions. For instance, what type of \u201clearning\u201d do the authors think is taking place in S1 versus areas like OPJ? Given that no strict word limits are imposed by <i>eLife</i>, we would recommend that the authors seriously expand the scope of their Discussion to address many of these more novel findings."
