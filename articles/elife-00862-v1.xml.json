Whether distant relatives of the vertebrate TMEM16 families also form CaCCs is an intriguing open question. Here we report that a TMEM16 family member from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, Subdued (CG16718), is a CaCC. Amino acid substitutions of Subdued alter the ion selectivity and kinetic properties of the CaCC channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293T cells. This <i>Drosophila</i> channel displays characteristics of classic CaCCs, thereby providing evidence for evolutionarily conserved biophysical properties in the TMEM16 family. Additionally, we show that knockout flies lacking <i>subdued</i> gene activity more readily succumb to death caused by ingesting the pathogenic bacteria <i>Serratia marcescens</i>, suggesting that <i>subdued</i> has novel functions in <i>Drosophila</i> host defense."

Whether distant relatives of the vertebrate TMEM16 families also form CaCCs is an intriguing open question. Here we report that a TMEM16 family member from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, Subdued (CG16718), is a CaCC. Amino acid substitutions of Subdued alter the ion selectivity and kinetic properties of the CaCC channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293T cells. This <i>Drosophila</i> channel displays characteristics of classic CaCCs, thereby providing evidence for evolutionarily conserved biophysical properties in the TMEM16 family. Additionally, we show that knockout flies lacking <i>subdued</i> gene activity more readily succumb to death caused by ingesting the pathogenic bacteria <i>Serratia marcescens</i>, suggesting that <i>subdued</i> has novel functions in <i>Drosophila</i> host defense."

A series of positive reversal potentials (E<sub>rev</sub>) was obtained upon decreasing the external NaCl concentration, indicating anionic selectivity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> inset) , which describes experimentally obtained reversal potentials as a function of ion concentrations and their respective permeabilities (P<sub>x</sub>, where X is any ion in the system), P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> was calculated to be 0.16, indicating a small permeability for cations, as has been found for mammalian TMEM16A and B (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pifferi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yang et al., 2012</a>).

                                "text": "We hypothesized that since the knockout flies did not display prominent structural abnormalities in the alimentary canal, it was possible that the susceptibility to Db11 infection arose from defects in host defense. At 48 hr post-infection, whole flies were homogenized, and the homogenates were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates with antibiotic selection. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted on each plate to estimate the number of Db11 bacteria present in the whole fly. Since only live flies were homogenized, this assay reports on the active host response the flies mount against Db11 infection. Significantly higher amounts of Db11 were isolated from knockout flies compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To control for the possibility that the higher titers of bacteria isolated from knockout flies could arise from increased feeding, we performed a feeding assay in which a food dye was introduced into the bacteria/sucrose solution (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ha et al., 2009</a>). After 72 hr of feeding, flies were dissected to isolate the intact guts and crop, which were homogenized and analyzed for food dye content as a read-out for food consumption. Knockout fly guts did not contain more food dye and surprisingly, slightly but significantly less food dye was recovered from the guts of knockout compared to the wild-type flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, we surmised that the knockout flies are unlikely to consume more food than wild-type flies. Differences in whole animal bacterial titers are thus likely to result from disparities in host defense. To see if bacteria also accumulated more in the guts as well as the whole animal, homogenates obtained from the feeding assay described above were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates with antibiotic selection. Knockout fly guts had a significantly higher number of CFU of Db11 than wild-type flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Since it was reported that injection of latex beads into the hemocoel of Db11-fed flies to impair hemocytic phagocytosis causes significant Db11 proliferation in the hemocoel and adherence of Db11 to the gut wall (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nehme et al., 2007</a>), defective hemocoel defenses could also give rise to an apparent increase in the CFU counts from gut dissections. However, homogenate Db11 counts were greatly reduced upon feeding the flies with gentamicin (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This control reveals no significant contributions of hemocoel-resident Db11 to CFU counts from dissected guts. This result also rules out severe hemocoel defense impairment as an explanation for increased in vivo proliferation of Db11."

This could either reflect a true biophysical property of the channel or could be an indication that the non-native HEK 293T expression system used in our experiments lacks auxiliary subunits required for higher calcium sensitivity. It would be interesting to test if directed mutagenesis of Subdued can tune its calcium sensitivity within the realm of its mammalian and <i>Xenopus</i> counterparts."

A Y489H mutation affected the ionic selectivity of the channel, making it more permeable to Na<sup>+</sup>. This suggests that perhaps the Y489 residue is pore lining, or has an allosteric effect on the structure of the pore. The Y489H mutant also gave rise to smaller currents compared to the wild-type channel, a reflection of either decreased unitary channel conductance or decreased membrane expression. Additionally, a Q672K mutation produced a dramatic slowing of activation kinetics, a phenomenon also observed when mutating the corresponding residue in mammalian TMEM16F (<a href=\"#bib36\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). The observation that mutations to Subdued alter the properties of the currents strongly points to this protein as a pore-forming subunit of the recorded CaCCs."

In conclusion, as a distantly related TMEM16 family member, Subdued will be useful as a tool in structure/function studies to parse out conserved or divergent biophysical properties such as calcium- and voltage-dependent gating, permeation and ion selectivity."

This might arise from lower food consumption by knockout flies, but could also be an indication of increased gut tissue damage due to greater numbers of Db11 in the gut, leading to leakage and diffusion of food dye into the hemolymph. It remains to be determined if higher Db11 titers in the whole animal also result from defective immune responses within the hemolymph. Tissue-specific RNAi of <i>subdued</i> using gut or hemocytes drivers did not recapitulate the whole animal RNAi phenotype (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cronin et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that Subdued is likely to exert its protective function in a multitude of tissues."

This hypothesis is consistent with the abundant mRNA expression of <i>subdued</i> in various epithelial tissues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chintapalli et al., 2007</a>). The susceptibility observed in the <i>subdued</i> knockout flies could also be a consequence of a deficiency in dual oxidase (DUOX)\u2013mediated immunity. The DUOX system is reported to be critical in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <i>Drosophila</i> gut epithelia (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ha et al., 2005</a>). This study reported that strong antimicrobial ROS species are generated by the peroxidase homology domain (PHD) of <i>Drosophila</i> DUOX in a chloride-dependent manner. These ROS species are likely to be the highly reactive hypohalites OCl or OSCN, the in vivo production of which requires trans-epithelial anion transport. Additionally, the <i>Drosophila</i> DUOX system has also been shown to mobilize downstream of the G\u03b1q-coupled signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ha et al., 2009</a>), implicating other calcium-dependent responses in the <i>Drosophila</i> immune response. Following Db11 infection of <i>subdued</i> knockouts, it is possible that G\u03b1q receptor stimulation fails to elicit sufficient amounts of halide transport onto gut epithelia due to a deficiency in CaCCs, reducing PHD-mediated generation of antimicrobial hypohalites and leading to increased bacterial proliferation and higher lethality."

Dissecting about 20 guts per experiment (n=3), we observed a statistically non-significant trend (p=0.07, unpaired t-test) of reduced DUOX induction in the knockout flies. A feeding assay showed a slight trend towards higher feeding for the knockout flies (5 guts, n=3) (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a> below). Thus, even though the knockout flies may have consumed a greater amount of uracil, they appear to display less DUOX induction. However in our hands, high background fluorescence was observed from flies fed with only uracil and not the R19S dye. This occurred despite feeding the flies sucrose solution for a few days after eclosion and pre-starving them for 18 hr on water to reduce auto-fluorescence from normal food. Normalizing to this background, we were only able to observe less than half the number of ROS-positive guts as compared to what has been previously reported for the wildtype control (70%). This technical problem has rendered it difficult to ascertain a statistically significant reduction of DUOX induction by uracil in knockout flies. By retaining a discussion of the hypothesis of a requirement for Subdued in DUOX function, we hope to stimulate future studies that may yield more definitive assessments of this possibility."

An actin-Gal4 driver also produced this wing phenotype, but in this case it became impossible to distinguish actin-Gal4/RNAi from actin-Gal4/CyO progeny. The curly wing phenotype was not present in flies bearing deletion of the CG16718 gene and the neighboring CG6231 gene that were generated by crossing two overlapping deficiency lines (Bloomington stocks #7663 and #27,379), nor was the curly wing phenotype observed in the FLP-recombinase generated knockout fly reported in the main manuscript. This raised concerns of either off-target effects of the RNAi construct, or background mutations in the RNAi stock (VDRC #v37472), casting doubt on the reliability of further RNAi experiments."

Gal4 drivers for fat body, hemocyte, gut and Malpighian tubules were used. In an attempt to maximize Gal4 activity, the experiment was repeated with different pre-assay incubation temperatures (25 or 29\u00b0C) and times (2 or 4 days) for the flies, but the observed trends were qualitatively the same (representative figure shown below: <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 2</a>). Multiple enhancer trap lines for expression in different segments of the Malpighian tubules were used but none led to any significantly reduced survival, thus for simplicity a representative Gal4 line (that also drives gut expression) is shown in the figure below. The tubulin-Gal4/RNAi results showed consistent susceptibility relative to either tubulin-Gal4 or RNAi only control, indicating that we might be observing a true phenotype (hence we proceeded to generate a genetic knockout). From tissue-specific RNAi experiments, we surmised that either the gene exerts its protective function in a tissue type we did not anticipate, or that it functions in multiple sets of tissues with redundant functions in host defense, thus knocking it down in only one or two sets of tissues was insufficient to recapitulate the whole body phenotype."
