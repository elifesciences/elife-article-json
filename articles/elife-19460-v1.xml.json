Here, we present a circuit-inspired model of retinal ganglion cell computation, targeted to explain their temporal dynamics and adaptation to contrast. To localize the sources of such processing, we used recordings at the levels of synaptic input and spiking output in the in vitro mouse retina. We found that an ON-Alpha ganglion cell's excitatory synaptic inputs were described by a divisive interaction between excitation and delayed suppression, which explained nonlinear processing that was already present in ganglion cell inputs. Ganglion cell output was further shaped by spike generation mechanisms. The full model accurately predicted spike responses with unprecedented millisecond precision, and accurately described contrast adaptation of the spike train. These results demonstrate how circuit and cell-intrinsic mechanisms interact for ganglion cell function and, more generally, illustrate the power of circuit-inspired modeling of sensory processing."

Here, we present a circuit-inspired model of retinal ganglion cell computation, targeted to explain their temporal dynamics and adaptation to contrast. To localize the sources of such processing, we used recordings at the levels of synaptic input and spiking output in the in vitro mouse retina. We found that an ON-Alpha ganglion cell's excitatory synaptic inputs were described by a divisive interaction between excitation and delayed suppression, which explained nonlinear processing that was already present in ganglion cell inputs. Ganglion cell output was further shaped by spike generation mechanisms. The full model accurately predicted spike responses with unprecedented millisecond precision, and accurately described contrast adaptation of the spike train. These results demonstrate how circuit and cell-intrinsic mechanisms interact for ganglion cell function and, more generally, illustrate the power of circuit-inspired modeling of sensory processing."

The first comprises cells called photoreceptors, which absorb light and convert it into electrical signals. The photoreceptors transmit these signals to the next layer, the bipolar cells, which in turn pass them on to the final layer, the retinal ganglion cells. The latter are responsible for sending the signals on to the brain. Other cells in the retina inhibit the excitatory neurons and thereby regulate their signals."

In the phenomenon known as contrast adaptation, for example, ganglion cells become more sensitive during small variations in contrast (differences in color and brightness) and less sensitive during high variations in contrast."

The findings suggest that a key element shaping the response of ganglion cells is the interaction between two visual processing pathways at the level of the bipolar cells.

The model is constrained by recordings at two stages of processing: excitatory synaptic input and spike output, recorded in mouse retinal ganglion cells. We focused on ON-Alpha ganglion cells because they comprise a major input to lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and superior colliculus, and because they could be targeted routinely, in vitro, based on their large soma size. Furthermore, their spiking response to contrast modulation is mediated predominantly by synaptic excitation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Murphy and Rieke, 2006</a>). We devised a tractable model of excitatory currents that incorporates a nonlinear structure based on realistic circuit elements. In particular, we allowed for divisive suppression acting on a ganglion cell\u2019s excitatory inputs to capture the computations implemented by presynaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Franke et al., 2016</a>) and synaptic depression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jarsky et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ozuysal and Baccus, 2012</a>) at bipolar cell terminals. Ganglion cell firing, further shaped by spike generation mechanisms, could be predicted by the model with millisecond precision. Our study establishes a unified model of nonlinear processing within ganglion cells that accurately captures both the generation of precise firing events and fast contrast adaptation. Similar circuit-inspired modeling could be applied widely in other sensory systems."

At low contrast, the coherence of the excitatory current matched that of the LN model prediction, whereas at high contrast the coherence of the current extended to finer time scales (i.e., higher frequencies) and hence exceeded the precision predicted by the LN model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

Indeed, a model of ganglion cells that explicitly implements synaptic depression, the linear-nonlinear-kinetic model (LNK model) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ozuysal and Baccus, 2012</a>) can also predict the temporal features of ganglion cell intracellular recordings across contrast. The LNK model fits a single LN filter (analogous to the excitatory <b>k</b><i><sub>E</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>E</sub></i>(.) of the DivS model; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), with additional terms that simulate use-dependent depletion of output (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This depletion depends on the\u00a0previous output of the model (recovering over one or more time scales), and divisively modulates the output of the LN filter.

Indeed, suppression in the LNK model arises from excitation, and thus the two components share the same spatial profile (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2</a>). This can be demonstrated not only with simulations of the LNK model, but also more complex models with separate synaptic depression terms in center and surround (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In all cases, application of the DivS model to data generated by these synaptic-depression-based simulations revealed that the suppressive term roughly matched the spatial profile of excitation, which is inconsistent with the observed data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). While these analyses do not eliminate the possibility that synaptic depression plays a role in shaping the ganglion cell response (and contributing to the suppression detected by the DivS model), the strength of surround suppression detected by the DivS model suggests that synaptic depression alone cannot fully describe our results."

Data were used to fit model parameters and evaluate different hypotheses of how the retinal circuit processed visual stimuli. The resulting model explained both high precision firing and contrast adaptation with unprecedented accuracy. Precise timing was already present in the excitatory synaptic inputs, and can be explained by divisive suppression, which likely depends on a combination of mechanisms: presynaptic inhibition of bipolar terminals from amacrine cells and synaptic depression at bipolar cell synapses. The interplay between nonlinear mechanisms, including divisive suppression, spike refractoriness and spiking nonlinearity, accurately captured the\u00a0detailed structure in the spike response across contrast levels."

The presence of nonlinearities that are fit to data in the context of multiplicative interactions distinguishes this model from multi-linear models (i.e., two linear terms multiplying) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahrens et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Williamson et al., 2016</a>), as well as more generalized LN models such as those associated with spike-triggered covariance (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fairhall et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Samengo and Gollisch, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schwartz et al., 2006</a>).

Ultimately, it will be important to combine these two approaches, to capture nonlinear processing within spatial \u2018subunits\u2019 of the ganglion cell receptive field, and thereby predict responses at both high temporal and spatial resolutions to arbitrary stimuli. Such an approach would require a large number of model parameters and consequently a larger amount of data than collected here. Our intracellular experiments were useful for deriving model architecture \u2013 discerning the different time courses of excitation, suppression, and spike refractoriness \u2013 but ultimate tests of full spatiotemporal models will likely require prolonged, stable recordings of spike trains, perhaps using a multielectrode array."

The same suppression mechanism also likely underlies high temporal precision of LGN responses, which can be captured by a model with delayed suppression (<a href=\"#bib18\">Butts et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, recordings of both LGN neurons and their major ganglion cell inputs suggest that precision of LGN responses is inherited from the retina and enhanced across the retinogeniculate synapse (<a href=\"#bib16\">Butts et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Carandini et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Casti et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rathbun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wang et al., 2010b</a>).

Because the suppressive nonlinearity has a\u00a0very different shape than the excitatory nonlinearity, divisive suppression has a relatively strong effect at high contrast and results in a decrease in measured gain. Moreover, the same divisive suppression mechanism may also explain nonlinear spatial summation properties of ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shapley and Victor, 1979</a>), because suppression generally has broader spatial profiles than excitation."

As a result, the accumulated effect of spike refractoriness was stronger within each response event. Note that the effect of the spike-history term was highly dependent on the ability of the model to predict fine temporal precision at high contrast, which largely originates from the divisive suppression term as discussed earlier. Therefore, the two nonlinear properties of retinal processing, contrast adaptation and temporal precision, are tightly related and can be simultaneously explained by the DivS model."

Divisive suppression underlying synaptic inputs to ganglion cells cannot be attributed to fluctuations in membrane potential or shunting inhibition since we recorded synaptic currents under voltage-clamp conditions that minimize inhibitory inputs. Although synaptic depression could also explain fast transient responses and contrast adaptation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ozuysal and Baccus, 2012</a>), synaptic depression will generally result in excitation and suppression that have the same spatial profiles (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2</a>), whereas we show that excitation and suppression have distinct spatial profiles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Therefore, the divisive suppression in our model likely depends partly on presynaptic inhibition from amacrine cells, which can extend their suppressive influence laterally (<a href=\"#bib27\">Euler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Franke et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Schubert et al., 2008</a>). This was somewhat surprising, because earlier studies had shown that contrast adaptation persisted in the presence of inhibitory receptor antagonists, suggesting that adaptation depended primarily on mechanisms intrinsic to the bipolar cell (e.g., synaptic depression), independent of synaptic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beaudoin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Brown and Masland, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rieke, 2001</a>). Indeed, synaptic depression was likely the primary mechanism for adaptation in conditions with inhibition blocked, but the present results suggest that lateral inhibitory mechanisms also play a role in generating adaptation under conditions with inhibition intact, at least for some retinal circuits."

Consequently, the average excitatory synaptic input would change less during contrast modulation compared to a ganglion cell that received a lower rate of glutamate release.

The center and surround stimuli were independently modulated with Gaussian noise (60-Hz update rate). A spot covered the receptive field center (e.g., 0.3\u2009mm), and an annulus extended into the surround (e.g., inner/outer diameters of 0.35/1.0\u2009mm). We recorded 7 ON-Alpha cells in this condition. For a subset of the recordings (<i>n</i>=5), we explored a range of inner/outer diameters, and selected the diameters that maximized the difference between the spatial footprints of excitatory and suppressive terms of the DivS model (see below)."

This model involves the estimation of an LN model in combination with a first-order kinetics model that governs the dynamics of signaling elements in resting state (R), active state (A) and inactivated states (I). Note that we have omitted the fourth state of the original LNK model that explains slow adaptation, because it did not improve model performance due to the small magnitude of slow adaptation we\u00a0observed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The kinetics rate constants reflect how fast the signaling elements transition between states. Model parameters are fitted to the data using constrained optimization. We adapted this model to fit the spot-annulus data by extending the linear filter of the LN model into separate temporal filters for center and surround processing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Note that parameters for more complex forms of the LNK model (e.g., those considered in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) cannot be tractably fit to data, and we chose the parameters of these models and simulate their output, as described in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>."

We first separately performed LN analysis for each contrast level, establishing the filter by reverse correlation and then using the filter output at each contrast to separately estimate each nonlinearity. The nonlinearities were then aligned by simultaneously estimating a scaling factor for the x-axis and an offset for the y-axis to minimize the mean squared deviation between them. The associated scaling factor was incorporated into the linear filters such that contrast gain was attributable entirely to changes in the linear filter (<a href=\"#bib23\">Chander and Chichilnisky, 2001</a>). While the offset parameter was not used in (<a href=\"#bib23\">Chander and Chichilnisky, 2001</a>), we found it was necessary to fully describe the changes in the nonlinearities associated with the synaptic current (but not spiking) data (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Specifically, events were first defined in the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) as times of firing interspersed with periods of silence lasting \u2265 8 ms. Each resulting event was further analyzed by fitting the PSTH with a two-component Gaussian mixture model. An event was broken into two events if the differences of means of the two Gaussian components exceed two times the sum of standard deviations. Event boundaries were defined as the midpoint between neighboring event centers and were used when assigning event labels to simulated spikes. Events were excluded from further analysis if no spike was observed on more than 50% of the trials during the event window. This criterion excluded spontaneous spikes that occurred on few trials. Event analysis was first performed on responses at high contrast. Events at low contrast were defined using the event boundaries obtained from high contrast data. These particular methods were chosen because they gave the most reasonable results with regards to visual inspection, but the results presented here do not qualitatively depend on the precise methods."

Finally,\u00a0the event Fano factor measured the ratio between the variance of spike count and the mean spike count in each event."

The model is an abstract model consisting of two pathways, with one influencing the other, which is one of a general class of known models with multiple pathways followed by a nonlinear static (time-independent) interaction. It is shown that the model accurately captures the response and some properties of contrast adaptation. An argument is made why the model can be interpreted to show that inhibition underlies contrast adaptation. Other aspects of the model such as the source of precise firing are discussed. Currently the claim of the role of inhibition is not well supported, and the result that a more simple model of a known type fits the data for one type of ganglion cell is interesting, but mainly to the community of people that fit models of the retina."

This claim is in conflict with other studies, including one from the Demb lab (Brown & Masland, Manookin & Demb 2006). The current evidence for this claim is not sufficient, and a pharmacological experiment blocking inhibition has to be done for this claim to be supported. If it turns out that blocking inhibition abolishes adaptation and changes the response of the model in the expected way, then this should be the main focus of the paper, and the model should be used to support this main claim. In doing this experiment, the primary concern will be that without inhibition, the retina is put in a different state, where adaptation does not occur, even though inhibition is not really involved. For example, without inhibition, neurons will depolarizes and synapses may be depressed even at low contrast. So care must be taken to avoid this issue. In particular, the expectation is that the excitatory direction changes little, but the suppressive direction disappears. Because the low contrast is 10% (which is still fairly strong) it may be useful to use a lower contrast."

It is quite suspicious that the suppressive direction (temporal filter) in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> looks exactly like a delayed version of the excitatory temporal filter. This seems to imply that the suppressive direction might indeed be from negative feedback \u2013 though admittedly such negative feedback could from synaptic depression or inhibition. The results presented are consistent with the current model of synaptic depression (not inhibition) underlying adaptation, except for <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, which relies on a questionable assumption (discussed below). That's why the pharmacological test is critical."

This brings a new level of complexity is not properly addressed. When space is considered, we know that bipolar cells have a receptive field center and surround with different temporal filters. Bipolar cells form nonlinear subunits, each with a threshold (Schwartz et al., 2012 for mouse \u03b1 cells). Each of these small subunits show local adaptation (Brown &amp; Masland, 2001) and then there is global adaptation in the ganglion cell from spike generation (Zaghloul et al. 2005). The logic the authors use is the suppressive direction should be the same as the excitatory direction if inhibition is not involved. It is not clear whether this is true when the more complex system is considered. The 'excitatory' and 'suppressive' directions are just the two directions in stimulus space that influence the response, and the suppressive direction will be influenced by feedback at bipolar cell synapses and in the ganglion cells. The surround time course is more delayed, and may match the delayed suppression from negative feedback more closely. Thus it is not clear whether the simple DivS model will mix inputs in unexpected ways. The fact that the suppressive and excitatory directions are different is not conclusive without further consideration of the known sites of nonlinearities and adaptation."

The entire 20 s stretch of recording should be shown of the data, so it can be properly evaluated what aspects of the response cannot be fit by the model. Furthermore, the claims about the accuracy of the model should be qualified in terms of the aspects of adaptation that it does not capture."

If in fact there are only two stimulus directions that are important as is claimed, than the DivS model is equivalent to a model that can be created using standard Spike-Triggered Covariance (STC) analysis (Fairhall et al., 2006), which can equivalently be done with continuous currents. So it should be pointed out that this model is not a new type of model, but an example of a known type of model. In (Fairhall, 2006) there are multiple types of ganglion cells reported with different types of responses in the two-D feature space, yet contrast adaptation is widespread among ganglion cells, so it is likely that the interpretations of the current paper won't apply generally. It is ok to study one type of cell, but the fact that the model presented is one of a known class of models should be made clear."

For example, mean squared error was not used as an error metric. If the method of fitting was suboptimal, then the interpretation of the comparison between models is not clear. Also, more detail needs to be given for the spatial LNK model. Because there are two different spatial regions, each one should have independent adaptation, and each spatial region should have a center-surround linear receptive field. This would be a new type of model, so it's not clear whether this model can be properly optimized."

Shoudn't a model that takes the response as an input be able to produce the response? (It seems like cheating.) In fact, some studies that use the spike history in the way have shown that using the spike history is either the most important predictor of the response, or that the spike history alone can be used to predict the response (Kraus et al., 2015, Figure S4; Trucculo, et al., 2010). If this is really what was done, this approach differs from other models which use a spike-history term such as a generalized linear model (GLM) (Pillow et al., 2008) but that generate its own spikes rather than taking the actual response as an input. This needs to be made more clear, and also justified as to why this is useful. This approach may be useful for understanding the source of precision as the authors do, but it doesn't seem impressive that this model can fit the data if it really takes the actual response as an input."

A better approach would be to model noise sources and put them in each different model, like an LNP model."

The DivS models was allowed to have two pathways, each with a different weighting from the center and surround, but the LNK model does not have such a mixture for each pathway. A model should be tested where each of the two pathways of the LNK model have a weighting of center and surround. To be clear, one pathway should represent bipolar cells in the center, and should have a stronger weighting from the center than the annulus. The other pathway should represent bipolar cells whose receptive field center is under the annulus region, and should have a stronger weighting from the annulus than the central spot. This fits most with known circuitry, because bipolar cells have center-surround linear receptive fields.

But the new result would be that the older concept of modulation works better, especially when one considers the spatial stimulus. To make this comparison and state this conclusion, it makes more sense to restrict 'divisive suppression' to mean modulation, and thus the question becomes one of Suppression vs. Depression, rather than saying depression is one type of suppression."

Our <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows that a component of divisive suppression primarily originates in surround regions of the receptive field, whereas excitation primarily originates within the center region. The incomplete overlap between excitation and suppression is a novel finding, which we clarified through further material and revisions (see point E below). However, we realize that this observation does not rule out a combination of mechanisms for suppression, including both synaptic depression and a circuit mechanism for lateral inhibition. We now make this clear in the manuscript. We have a longer-term interest in delving further into the synaptic mechanism, but have chosen to keep the focus in this manuscript on the computation. Pharmacological experiments are not straightforward, because (i) blocking all [GABAergic + glycinergic] inhibition results in severe changes in mouse retinal function (Toychiev et al., 2013; our unpublished observations) and (ii) blocking receptors can alter the release of glutamate, which can in turn affect synaptic depression as well other effects on network function. We do hope the modeling approach presented in this manuscript can be used in tandem with such pharmacology to analyze underlying synaptic mechanisms in future studies. In this manuscript, we have therefore focused on the computational description of suppression and tempered the conclusions regarding specific synaptic mechanisms."

Our analysis shows that covariance analysis can identify the feature space that drives the ganglion cell response (consistent with previous STC analyses of spikes), but it does not identify the critical divisive interaction identified by the DivS model. Likewise, while the covariance model coupled with a 2-D nonlinearity can generate nearly as good predictions of synaptic currents, the number of parameters it requires, as well as its inability to fit simultaneously with spike-refractoriness, make it unable to be used for accurate predictions of spikes. By comparison our spike responses (~1 minute of unique data at each contrast) could routinely be fit by the DivS model, yielding unprecedented accuracy of any spike-based model of sensory neurons. We believe that our new analysis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) makes a valid and important comparison between STC and DivS models, and shows the advantages of the DivS model.

In doing this experiment, the primary concern will be that without inhibition, the retina is put in a different state, where adaptation does not occur, even though inhibition is not really involved. For example, without inhibition, neurons will depolarizes and synapses may be depressed even at low contrast. So care must be taken to avoid this issue.

Bipolar cells form nonlinear subunits, each with a threshold (Schwartz et al., 2012 for mouse \u03b1 cells). Each of these small subunits show local adaptation (Brown &amp; Masland, 2001) and then there is global adaptation in the ganglion cell from spike generation (Zaghloul et al. 2005). The logic the authors use is the suppressive direction should be the same as the excitatory direction if inhibition is not involved. It is not clear whether this is true when the more complex system is considered. The 'excitatory' and 'suppressive' directions are just the two directions in stimulus space that influence the response, and the suppressive direction will be influenced by feedback at bipolar cell synapses and in the ganglion cells. The surround time course is more delayed, and may match the delayed suppression from negative feedback more closely.

Other modeling approaches, including the LNK model as well as covariance-based models, cannot currently scale to capture the multiple interactions in this complex model, due to the lack of convexity (which the reviewer refers to below in point 6 for the LNK model) and the dependence on response-weighted averaging for covariance-based models.

By comparison, the DivS model is relatively well-behaved (including requiring a fraction of the fitting time), and is much more flexible in describing both simulated data generated by more complex combinations of nonlinearities (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) as well as actual ganglion cell recordings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

The STC model is an LN model, where the \u2018N\u2019 can be a multi-dimensional nonlinearity, and in practice usually cannot be fit. The DivS model for synaptic currents is an LNxLN model, and for spikes has an additional (LNxLN)LN form. These are by definition distinct mathematical forms, and in addition require different methods to estimate their parameters. Because the DivS model has different mathematical form with completely different means to estimate, it seems a reasonable bar to highlight this distinction from STC. Importantly, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> demonstrates that STC cannot reveal the underlying LNxLN model. It furthermore cannot take into account the spike history (which we show in later figures to be necessary to understand the spike response), and thus cannot replicate the form of the spiking DivS model either."

In previous work (Butts et al., 2011; McFarland et al., 2013), we have perfromed additional analysis of STC-based solutions relative to other modeling forms, including its probabilistic cousin that we have been referring to as a GQM (generalized quadratic model; presented initially in Park and Pillow, NIPS, 2011). We routinely use such models to achieve independent estimates of the filters spanning the stimulus subspace, and its use in this manuscript is not intended to show any disrespect to STC. Rather, its presentation illustrates how the DivS model is distinct, and how it is necessary to reveal the main results presented in this manuscript: namely the divisive interactions underlying ganglion cell computation. We also use <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> to demonstrate that STC correctly identifies the filter subspace (consistent with our previous work, but now applied to current recordings rather than spikes), and thus remains a useful analysis tool."

There are in fact two barriers to fitting the STC to spiking data: one being the number of parameters, as the reviewer suggests. The second \u2013 which prevents STC from discovering the full computational structure of ganglion cell responses \u2013 is its inability to simultaneously fit spike-history terms. With enough spike data, the methods we present here might still be able to measure a 2-D nonlinearity, but such a nonlinearity would mix the divisive and spike-history effects together.
