                    "text": "During eukaryotic evolution, genome size has increased disproportionately to nuclear volume, necessitating greater degrees of chromatin compaction in higher eukaryotes, which have evolved several mechanisms for genome compaction. However, it is unknown whether histones themselves have evolved to regulate chromatin compaction. Analysis of histone sequences from 160 eukaryotes revealed that the H2A N-terminus has systematically acquired arginines as genomes expanded. Insertion of arginines into their evolutionarily conserved position in H2A of a small-genome organism increased linear compaction by as much as 40%, while their absence markedly diminished compaction in cells with large genomes. This effect was recapitulated in vitro with nucleosomal arrays using unmodified histones, indicating that the H2A N-terminus directly modulates the chromatin fiber likely through intra- and inter-nucleosomal arginine\u2013DNA contacts to enable tighter nucleosomal packing. Our findings reveal a novel evolutionary mechanism for regulation of chromatin compaction and may explain the frequent mutations of the H2A N-terminus in cancer."

However, it is unknown whether histones themselves have evolved to regulate chromatin compaction. Analysis of histone sequences from 160 eukaryotes revealed that the H2A N-terminus has systematically acquired arginines as genomes expanded. Insertion of arginines into their evolutionarily conserved position in H2A of a small-genome organism increased linear compaction by as much as 40%, while their absence markedly diminished compaction in cells with large genomes. This effect was recapitulated in vitro with nucleosomal arrays using unmodified histones, indicating that the H2A N-terminus directly modulates the chromatin fiber likely through intra- and inter-nucleosomal arginine\u2013DNA contacts to enable tighter nucleosomal packing. Our findings reveal a novel evolutionary mechanism for regulation of chromatin compaction and may explain the frequent mutations of the H2A N-terminus in cancer."

                        "text": "Genome size, defined as the haploid DNA content of a cell, has increased as eukaryotes evolved from single-cell species to more complex, multicellular organisms. Within the same evolutionary timeframe, nuclear volume has also increased but at a slower rate than genome size expansion (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maul and Deaven, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Olmo, 1982</a>). While the ratio of nuclear to cell size has remained essentially constant in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cavalier-Smith, 2005</a>), the disproportional increase in genome size relative to the nuclear volume has required organisms with larger genomes to compact their chromatin to greater extents than organisms with small sized genomes. Indeed there is a positive correlation between genome size and native chromatin compaction as measured by dye incorporation into chromatin (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vinogradov, 2005</a>). In most eukaryotes, the genome is organized into chromatin by the repeating nucleosomal structure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Luger et al., 1997</a>). The nucleosomes stack and fold into higher order structures, serving to systematically compact the genome (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Duan et al., 2010</a>) and to regulate molecular processes that are based on DNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Celeste et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vogelauer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fischle et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fussner et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "The surface of the histone octamer has 14 DNA interaction sites. Each interaction is mediated by an arginine residue that intercalates into the minor groove of the DNA to stabilize the nucleosomal structure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Luger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">West et al., 2010</a>). Arginine is the most commonly used amino acid for interaction with DNA due to its positive charge and the lower energetic cost compared to lysine for displacing water when intercalating into the minor groove (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rohs et al., 2009</a>). Nucleosomes mediate chromatin compaction through a variety of mechanisms. For instance, nucleosomes form higher order structures through inter-nucleosomal contacts between the histone H4 N-terminal domain (NTD) and the acidic patch of H2A and between two H2B C-terminal domains (CTD) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Luger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dorigo et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gordon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schalch et al., 2005</a>). Histone variants, such as H2A.Z or H2A.Bbd, as well as post-translational modifications of histones, such as H4K16ac, can further regulate the degree of compaction (<a href=\"#bib63\">Suto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chandrasekharan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fierz et al., 2011</a>). Polycomb complexes compact large domains of chromatin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eskeland et al., 2010</a>) and are important for proper development. Histones of the H1 family promote additional compaction by binding between nucleosomes to linker DNA near the DNA entry/exit site on nucleosomes and stabilize the intrinsic ability of nucleosomal arrays to fold in vitro (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carruthers et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Robinson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Szerlong and Hansen, 2010</a>). Linker histones may affect chromatin compaction globally (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fan et al., 2005</a>), at specific stages of the cell cycle such as mitosis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Maresca et al., 2005</a>) or at specific regions of the genome (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2012</a>). In contrast to canonical histones, the linker histones are much less conserved (<a href=\"#bib7\">Caterino and Hayes, 2010</a>), and ectopic expression of human linker histones in the budding yeast even at low levels is lethal for the cell (<a href=\"#bib46\">Miloshev et al., 1994</a>). Finally, structural proteins such as condensin also contribute to chromatin condensation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tada et al., 2011</a>). Many of these modulatory mechanisms are dynamic in nature (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luger et al., 2012</a>) and may help explain why multicellular organisms can compact chromatin to different degrees in different cell types. However, despite the existence of these mechanisms for genome compaction in higher eukaryotes, it has not been known whether the canonical histones themselves have evolved sequence features that also contribute to the generally increased chromatin compaction observed in organisms with larger genomes."

Although increases in genome size are associated with phylogenetic evolution from protozoa to fungi to more complex plants and animals, we present genetic and molecular evidence from the budding yeast and human cells as well as in vitro biochemical data to demonstrate that the evolutionary changes in H2A directly regulate chromatin compaction in vivo and in vitro with consequences for the nuclear volume. The evolutionary changes in H2A regulate chromatin compaction in yeast and human cells, revealing a surprising flexibility in the dynamics of the chromatin fiber that has been conserved across distant eukaryotes. This previously unrecognized structural feature of the nucleosome has evolved to enable greater chromatin compaction when genome size is disproportionately larger than the nuclear volume. Our findings also suggest that the reported mutations in the histone H2A NTD may contribute to the altered chromatin compaction that is commonly observed in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zink et al., 2004</a>)."

The canonical histone proteins for each organism were defined based on at least 90% overlap and 35% identity with the histone fold domain of the corresponding human sequence (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

For instance, the human H2A NTD contains arginine residues at positions 3 and 11 that are absent in yeast and at position 20 which is correspondingly a lysine in yeast (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, the human sequence lacks S10 and S15 that are observed in the yeast H2A NTD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Alignment of all H2A NTD sequences also revealed similar trends across all eukaryotes studied here. The heat map in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> shows the occurrence of arginines and serines/threonines in the H2A NTD as a function of genome size (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> for raw data and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> for statistical analysis). At position 3, an arginine (R3) is predominantly present in medium and large species but is lacking in small species. At position 11, a lysine (K11) is observed in species with medium genomes that evolves to an arginine (R11) mainly in organisms with large genomes. R17 is present in most organisms examined, suggesting a very conserved function for this residue (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zheng et al., 2010</a>). At position 20, small genomes contain predominantly a lysine residue, which converts to arginine in medium and large genomes. In contrast, serines/threonines at positions 10 and 15 are found primarily in organisms with small genomes and much less so in organisms with medium and large genomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Additionally, each of the four H2A NTD arginines is surrounded by a conserved motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The residues surrounding R3 and R17 are mainly glycine and serine, respectively. At position 11, the motif varies based on genome size. Species with medium-sized genomes contain VKG and those with large genomes contain ARA. The same is true of position 20, where AKA is present in organisms with small genomes and (S/T)RA in larger genome species (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

When counting conventionally from the N-terminus, amino acids R11, R17, and R20\u2014which are numbered based on the human sequence\u2014were not observed consistently at the same positions in other organisms. However, these residues are respectively 12, 6, and 3 amino acids away from the histone fold in most species (note the vertical axes in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). S10 and S15\u2014which are numbered based on the yeast sequence\u2014also show more uniform positioning when counted from the histone fold. Altogether, as genome size increases, arginines appear in conserved positions within the H2A NTD relative to the histone fold, and serines and threonines are lost."

The probes were differentially labeled and visualized by confocal microscopy. The distance between the probes was measured in a single plane in which both probes were present within each nucleus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bystricky et al., 2004</a>). When compared to the isogenic wild type (WT), addition of a single arginine at position 3 (R3) or 11 (R11) to the H2A NTD was sufficient to significantly decrease the average interprobe distance by 18% and 15%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The average interprobe distance was further decreased by 22% when both arginines were present (R3R11) and even more so (30%) in R3(\u0394GS10)R11. Deleting G9S10 (\u0394GS10) alone caused slightly increased compaction with low statistical significance (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The largest decrease in interprobe distance (41%) was observed in the R11\u0394S15 mutant, which places R11 12 amino acids from the histone fold, the same position as in organisms with large genomes. Removal of S15 (\u0394S15) alone had no effect. The effect of arginines was not simply due to increasing the positive charge of the H2A NTD, as insertions of lysines at positions 3 and 11 did not significantly affect the interprobe distances (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Although lysines are found at these positions in certain species (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), the lack of potential compaction by lysines may be due to the absence of other evolutionary changes in yeast histones (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Additionally, R17K or K20R mutations did not affect compaction, nor did a randomly inserted arginine at position 6 (R6) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), suggesting that not every arginine in the H2A NTD contributes to chromatin compaction."

The level of compaction seen in our WT strain is similar to what has been previously reported in yeast using a different strain background (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bystricky et al., 2004</a>). The interprobe distances for all probe sets were significantly decreased in R11 compared to WT and even more so in R11\u0394S15 but not \u0394S15 alone (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Plotting the physical vs genomic distances for all probe sets revealed uniform compaction across large genomic distances (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The effect of R11 on chromatin compaction was not strain-specific as H2A R11 and R11\u0394S15, but not \u0394S15, caused chromatin compaction in a different strain background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>).

We tagged a nuclear pore protein, Nup49, in its chromosomal locus with GFP to visualize the nuclear membrane and used confocal microscopy to capture three-dimensional images of the nucleus to quantify volumes of \u2265150 cells per H2A mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for volume calculations). As compared to WT cells, H2A mutants containing R11 or R3R11, both of which contain more compact chromatin, displayed significantly decreased nuclear volumes. The average nuclear volume in the R3 mutant was also less than WT but did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, H2A mutants from which serines 10 and 15 were removed displayed larger nuclear volumes. Simultaneous insertions of arginines into these strains (R3(\u0394GS10)R11 and R11\u0394S15) decreased their nuclear volume (R11\u0394S15 p&lt;0.001 compared to \u0394S15), restoring them to levels similar to WT. The control strains with either lysines or R6 had nuclear volumes similar to or larger than WT. Neither arginines nor serines had any effect on total cell size as measured by concanavalin A staining (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). In the FY406 strain background, \u0394S15 did not cause an increase in nuclear volume; and thus both R11 and R11\u0394S15 strains exhibited smaller nuclear volumes than isogenic WT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). These data suggest that modulation of chromatin compaction through the H2A NTD, especially in the presence of R11, affects the nuclear volume but this effect may be indirect (see human data below)."

To test this prediction, we ectopically expressed WT or mutant H2A in several human cell lines and measured the distances between probes 0.49 Mbp apart on chromosome 1 by FISH, as well as the largest nuclear cross-sectional areas (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The H2A gene was HA-tagged and mutated to remove R3 (\u0394R3), to replace R11 with alanine (R11A) or lysine (R11K), or to combine two mutations (\u0394R3R11A). The H2A constructs were overexpressed using the strong CMV promoter in the normal human IMR90 fibroblasts, the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453, or the HEK293 cells. Cells overexpressing \u0394R3, R11A, or \u0394R3R11A H2A mutants had increased interprobe distances, indicating de-compaction of chromatin. Expression of H2A R11K had modest effects on chromatin de-compaction with marginal statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>).

Equal degrees of overexpression were confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis with an anti-HA antibody and detection of HA-H2A by western blotting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Ectopic expression of a C-terminally FLAG-tagged H2A mutant missing residues 1\u201312 (\u03941\u201312) also caused significant de-compaction of chromatin and increased nuclear area despite being expressed at a lower level than WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). These data demonstrate that, consistent with our predictions, the H2A NTD, especially arginines 3 and 11, function to compact chromatin in human cells."

We used step-wise salt dialysis to assemble nucleosomal arrays with a DNA template containing 12 copies of the 177 bp \u2018601\u2019 nucleosome positioning sequence (601-177-12) and recombinant <i>Xenopus laevis</i> histone octamers that contain either WT H2A or one with R11 deleted (\u0394R11). We assembled nucleosomal arrays at different octamer-to-template ratios (0.9, 1, and 1.1 octamer to 1 template) and monitored the quality of the arrays by MgCl<sub>2</sub> precipitation and restriction digest analysis using ScaI. We found that a 1:1 octamer-to-template ratio gave the best results as the ScaI digest demonstrated well-assembled arrays compared to the 5% free DNA loaded as a comparison (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We used analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the sedimentation velocity combined with van Holde\u2013Weischet analysis (<a href=\"#bib70\">Weischet et al., 1978</a>) to ascertain the distribution of sedimentation coefficients (S) for each nucleosomal array in the absence or presence of 0.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, a concentration of the divalent cation that promotes intra-molecular folding of nucleosomal arrays (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schwarz and Hansen, 1994</a>). In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, arrays containing WT H2A sedimented with a coefficient of 33.1, which is a value that has been previously shown for similar arrays (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dorigo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, arrays missing R11 adopted a more extended conformation with a smaller sedimentation coefficient of 31.0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased compaction of both arrays and shifted the sedimentation coefficients to 39.3 and 37.4 for WT and \u0394R11 H2A, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). A second independent chromatin assembly and ultracentrifuge analysis confirmed these results (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, in the absence of R11 in the H2A NTD, nucleosomal arrays adopt a less compact conformation even in the presence of divalent cations, showing that R11 directly increases chromatin compaction."

A survey of the COSMIC database (<a href=\"#bib25\">Forbes et al., 2011</a>), as of the time of writing, revealed 41 documented missense mutations within the H2A NTD with 29 (71%) affecting a residue within one of the four arginine motifs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). R11, which had the strongest effect of any single arginine residue on chromatin compaction, is the most commonly mutated residue in the H2A NTD. We tested the effects of three of these mutations, R11C, H, and P and found that ectopic expression of each in normal human fibroblasts decreases chromatin compaction significantly with R11P having the strongest effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). These cancer mutations have little effect on increasing nuclear area, however (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>), in contrast to R11A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). It is unclear to what extent the H2A mutants have to be expressed in cancer cells relative to the 17 canonical H2A genes in the human genome to affect chromatin compaction. But our data suggest that over-expression of an H2A mutant has the potential to disrupt chromatin compaction in cancer."

This mechanism is distinct from several other known chromatin compaction mechanisms in higher eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bednar et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dorigo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fierz et al., 2011</a>) in that it involves the histone proteins themselves. The H2A-mediated chromatin compaction thus provides a novel but potentially complementary mechanism for genome compaction. Organisms with small genomes but also very small cell size may face similar physical constraints as those with larger genomes, and may therefore use arginine-containing H2A as a means for chromatin compaction. For instance, <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> which possesses an R3-containing H2A, is a free-living unicellular algae that has a very small genome of 12.6 Mbp but a cell diameter of 0.8 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib50\">Palenik et al., 2007</a>). <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, which does not contain an H2A with R3, has a similarly sized genome but has a cell diameter that is approximately five times larger. Furthermore, certain organisms such as <i>Oikopleura dioica</i>, which has one of the smallest genomes in animals, have distinctive life cycles and possess H2A genes with and without arginines, which may enable them to dynamically regulate genome compaction at different stages of their life cycles (<a href=\"#bib47\">Moosmann et al., 2011</a>) (for species with H2A isoforms, see attached spreadsheet). So, the H2A arginines may have evolved in circumstances when the genome size became disproportionately large compared to nuclear volume. Interestingly, the toad, <i>Bufo gargarizans</i>, which has a genome size that is twice as large as the human genome, possesses an H2A gene with not only R3 and R11 but also glutamine 6 replaced with an arginine, suggesting that additional arginines in the H2A tail may enable further compaction in organisms with even larger genomes."

Interestingly, while R17 and R20 are more buried within the octamer, R3 and R11 are situated close to the DNA backbone. R3 is at 2.87 \u00c5 from the DNA and could potentially bind the DNA gyre as the DNA wraps around the histone octamer. R11 forms close contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone of self and neighboring nucleosomes (4.09, 2.90 \u00c5, respectively). Although these interactions may have helped form the crystal lattice, they also suggest a possible mechanism for tighter nucleosomal stacking in vivo through shielding of the DNA negative charge (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Davey et al., 2002</a>). Thus, the evolutionary appearance of arginines in the H2A NTD sequence at positions 3 and 11 corresponds to strategic positioning of R3 and R11 within the nucleosome structure that may enable interactions with the DNA, leading to more compact chromatin."

                        "text": "Our in vivo data in yeast cells demonstrate that interprobe distances shorten in the presence of the H2A arginines R3 and R11. While the mechanism of this shortening is still unknown, the two most likely explanations are due to linear chromosomal compaction or increased chromatin looping (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bohn and Heermann, 2010</a>). However, our data are more consistent with increased linear compaction due to several reasons. First, our analysis of multiple probes along Chr XVI in yeast demonstrates a uniform compaction between all probe pairs examined. Second, our in vivo data with human cell lines shows de-compaction of chromatin in the absence of R11. If chromatin looping was the mechanism, loops would have to be disassembled in human nuclei independent of factors such as CTCF and condensin. Third, our in vitro data show that R11 alone affects chromatin compaction even in absence of divalent cations. Because the in vitro experiments were performed with unmodified histones in arrays with equal linker lengths, this strongly points to a direct effect of H2A NTD arginines on chromatin compaction that occurs in short arrays. Both R3 and R11 are at contact distances from the DNA, and R11 may also contact the DNA backbone of the neighboring nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These intra- and inter-nucleosomal interactions with the arginines and the DNA may serve to neutralize the negative charge of the DNA backbone, leading to enhanced stacking of nucleosomes and hence increased compaction. Consistent with this model, the other two arginine residues in the H2A NTD, R17 and R20, which are more buried from the surface, do not affect compaction by themselves. However, their functions may be to modulate the effects of the surrounding residues. Although all canonical H2A genes contain R3 and R11 in humans, the cell may still be able to dynamically regulate chromatin compaction by these arginines. For instance, arginines may be subject to posttranslational modifications, such a methylation which makes the arginine residue bulkier, or citrullination which removes the positive charge (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hagiwara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Di Lorenzo and Bedford, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Waldmann et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, the H2A NTD is situated in close proximity to the H2B CTD which when ubiquitylated, disrupts chromatin compaction in vitro (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fierz et al., 2011</a>), lending support to the ability of this region of the nucleosome to modulate chromatin compaction."

                        "text": "The inability of lysines, especially at position 11, to increase chromatin compaction suggests exquisite structural constraints for H2A-mediated chromatin compaction. Although lysines and arginines both are positively charged, the positive charge of arginine is due to the presence of a guanidinium group that is structurally different from the positive charge of an amino group of a lysine residue. In this regard, it is interesting to note that only arginines contact DNA as it wraps around the nucleosome core (<a href=\"#bib42\">Luger et al., 1997</a>); and arginines preferentially bind the minor groove of DNA compared to lysines (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rohs et al., 2009</a>). The context in which lysines appear in evolution may be important as well. We did not observe a lysine at position 3 in our list of organisms, and K11 was present in organisms with medium-sized genomes and surrounded mainly by the motif VKG (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). When tested in our <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains, K11 was in the context of AKA. So, it is conceivable that additional amino acid changes would be required for lysines in the H2A NTD to increase genome compaction."

Non-chromatin components such as nuclear import factors from the cytoplasm may also modulate nuclear size (<a href=\"#bib36\">Levy and Heald, 2010</a>). Our data suggest that in particular cases, the effects of H2A NTD mutations on chromatin compaction are linked to nuclear volume, although not in a straightforward relationship. While arginines at positions 3 and 11 increase chromatin compaction and reduce nuclear volume, lysines at the same positions have no effect on chromatin compaction yet increase nuclear volume. Removal of serines at positions 10 or 15 has little effect on compaction but also increase nuclear volume. In human cells, expression of all R11 mutants (R11A, C, H, and P) decreased compaction but only R11A also affected nuclear area. Although we do not observe a clear-cut relationship between nuclear volume and chromatin compaction, our data identify a region of the nucleosome that is directly or indirectly linked to nuclear volume control mechanisms."

These data raise the possibility that H2A-mediated compaction of chromatin may have evolved as a mechanism to enable regulation of chromatin compaction without having to make compensatory changes to all other processes that are also based on DNA such as transcription. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined what molecular or cellular processes govern the optimal level of chromatin compaction and nuclear volume for an organism. The stable alterations of chromatin compaction in eukaryotic model organisms through genetic manipulation of H2A should facilitate further experiments to uncover these processes."

The authors found a strong correlation between the number of arginine residues in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of histone H2A and genome size. This observation led them to postulate that the NTD arginines promote chromatin compaction and a consequent reduction in the nuclear volume. A variety of substitution, insertion, and deletion mutations were constructed in the NTDs of yeast and human H2A. A good correlation between NTD arginines and chromatin compaction was observed. There was not, however, a strong correlation between chromatin compaction and nuclear volume. This study was based on an innovative idea and contains information that will be of interest to chromatin biologists. This work could be appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i> if the following points are suitably addressed."

Also, R11K did increase the average nuclear area. These data suggest that R11K may have subtle effects on chromatin compaction that would be more apparent if more than one region of the genome was analyzed.
