We showed previously that adult forebrain stem cell function declines during aging because of increased expression of <i>let-7</i> microRNAs, evolutionarily conserved heterochronic genes that reduce HMGA2 expression. Here we asked whether <i>let-7</i> targets also regulate changes between fetal and adult stem cells. We found a second <i>let-7</i> target, the RNA binding protein IMP1, that is expressed by fetal, but not adult, neural stem cells. IMP1 expression was promoted by Wnt signaling and Lin28a expression and opposed by <i>let-7</i> microRNAs. <i>Imp1</i>-deficient neural stem cells were prematurely depleted in the dorsal telencephalon due to accelerated differentiation, impairing pallial expansion. IMP1 post-transcriptionally inhibited the expression of differentiation-associated genes while promoting the expression of self-renewal genes, including <i>Hmga2</i>. A network of heterochronic gene products including Lin28a, <i>let-7</i>, IMP1, and HMGA2 thus regulates temporal changes in stem cell properties."

We showed previously that adult forebrain stem cell function declines during aging because of increased expression of <i>let-7</i> microRNAs, evolutionarily conserved heterochronic genes that reduce HMGA2 expression. Here we asked whether <i>let-7</i> targets also regulate changes between fetal and adult stem cells. We found a second <i>let-7</i> target, the RNA binding protein IMP1, that is expressed by fetal, but not adult, neural stem cells. IMP1 expression was promoted by Wnt signaling and Lin28a expression and opposed by <i>let-7</i> microRNAs. <i>Imp1</i>-deficient neural stem cells were prematurely depleted in the dorsal telencephalon due to accelerated differentiation, impairing pallial expansion. IMP1 post-transcriptionally inhibited the expression of differentiation-associated genes while promoting the expression of self-renewal genes, including <i>Hmga2</i>. A network of heterochronic gene products including Lin28a, <i>let-7</i>, IMP1, and HMGA2 thus regulates temporal changes in stem cell properties."

First, neural stem cell specific knockdown of <i>Imp1</i> in a small percentage of cells in the developing telencephalon reduced cell proliferation and accelerated differentiation in a cell autonomous way (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) .Second, all of our experiments demonstrating neural stem/progenitor cell phenotypes in <i>Imp1</i> deficient (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2F\u2013I and 4</a>), <i>Lin28 transgenic</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013I</a>) or <i>ilet-7</i> transgenic mice (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>) involved studies of individual isolated neural stem cells in culture.

Finally, we observed a correlation between <i>Imp1</i> expression and function within the telencephalon: the phenotypes observed in <i>Imp1</i> deficient mice were consistently more profound in the dorsomedial telencephalon, where <i>Imp1</i> expression was high, than in the dorsolateral telencephalon, where <i>Imp1</i> expression was low (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2E and 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

However, there was a major concern with your conclusion that <i>Imp1</i> was cell-autonomously required for NSC self-renewal, both in vitro and in vivo. You used the gene trap <i>Imp1-\u03b2geo</i> knockout mouse, which shows overall growth defects throughout the embryo (and the placenta) by E17.5. Given that <i>Imp1\u03b2geo/\u03b2geo</i> neurospheres only showed self-renewal defects in vitro when isolated at E18.5 and not E12.5, this raises the possibility that the effects could be secondary. E18.5 is a time-point where the severe growth defects could have already affected the NSCs non-cell autonomously before isolation, perhaps due to a systemic reduction in IGF2 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hansen et al., 2004</a>). Given that WT <i>Imp1</i> expression is highest at E12.5, but nearly extinguished in the WT brain by E17.5, one might have expected that defects would have been more likely in the early rather than the late neurospheres. The fact that you only observed NSC defects at E18.5 in <i>Imp1\u03b2geo/\u03b2geo</i> mice, in vitro and in vivo throughout the manuscript, leaves open the possibility that the effects could be completely explained by non-cell autonomous effects. In order to prove cell-autonomy, neural-specific deletion of a floxed <i>Imp1</i> allele would be required. If you can undertake these experiments, this would strengthen your conclusions. If this experiment does not work, you would have to modify your claim of cell-autonomy. We understand that these experiments would take longer than two months unless you have already initiated the crosses."

The first important point is that although <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> showed that neurospheres had self-renewal defects at E18.5 and not at E12.5, this should not be taken to mean that neurospheres did not exhibit defects prior to E18.5. We simply had not tested cultured neurospheres at intermediate time points because we focused our analyses on more definitive in vivo experiments at the intermediate time points. To address this we performed two experiments in which we examined the frequency and self-renewal of multipotent neurospheres cultured from E15.5 <i>Imp1</i> deficient and control telencephalon. We observed declines in the frequency and self-renewal of <i>Imp1</i> deficient neurospheres in both experiments. We have added these new data to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G and H</a>."

Its expression is extinguished neonatally. The manuscript shows IMP1 expression in the VZ of the dorsal telencephalon at E14.5, E16.5 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A, B</a>) and in neurospheres cultured from the E18.5 dorsomedial telencephalon (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>).

A number of figures in our manuscript show that we observed significant neural stem cell defects in vivo beginning at E12.5. These defects were associated with significant changes in the numbers of Tbr2+ progenitors beginning at E12.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), the numbers of TuJ1+ neurons beginning at E12.5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), the number of Pax6+ stem cells beginning at E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), the frequency of dividing cells beginning at E16.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), and the cortical surface length beginning at E16.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The in vivo data demonstrate evidence of premature stem cell differentiation in vivo beginning at E12.5 and continuing throughout fetal development. There is no disconnect between the timing of <i>Imp1</i> expression in these cells and the timing with which premature differentiation is observed in vivo."

Since Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors are themselves dividing, this delays the onset of defects in proliferation and cortical growth, which were not observed until E16.5."

To address this we have instead injected virus bearing an shRNA against <i>Imp1</i> into the forebrain of fetal mice developing in utero. We confirmed that this shRNA profoundly reduced <i>Imp1</i> expression in cultured neurospheres (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By transilluminating the uterus we were able to inject virus into the E12.5\u2013E14.5 telencephalic ventricle, infecting a small minority of stem cells in the dorsal telencephalon. At E15.5\u2013E17.5, we compared Ki67, Pax6, Tbr2, and Tuj1 staining by cells infected (GFP+) with the <i>Imp1</i> shRNA versus a control scrambled shRNA. Cells infected with the <i>Imp1</i> shRNA were significantly less likely to express Pax6 or Ki67 and significantly more likely to express Tbr2 or Tuj1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C-F</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This demonstrates that IMP1 acts cell autonomously within stem cells in the dorsal telencephalon to promote the maintenance of an undifferentiated state."
