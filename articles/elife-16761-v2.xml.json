Many of these originated in a non-repetitive context as cofactors of RNA-based replication and catalysis, and required the RNA to assume their active conformation. In search of the origins of one of the most widespread repeat protein families, the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), we identified several potential homologs of its repeated helical hairpin in non-repetitive proteins, including the putatively ancient ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), which only becomes structured in the context of the ribosome. We evaluated the ability of the RPS20 hairpin to form a TPR fold by amplification and obtained structures identical to natural TPRs for variants with 2\u20135 point mutations per repeat. The mutations were neutral in the parent organism, suggesting that they could have been sampled in the course of evolution. TPRs could thus have plausibly arisen by amplification from an ancestral helical hairpin."

Many of these originated in a non-repetitive context as cofactors of RNA-based replication and catalysis, and required the RNA to assume their active conformation. In search of the origins of one of the most widespread repeat protein families, the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), we identified several potential homologs of its repeated helical hairpin in non-repetitive proteins, including the putatively ancient ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), which only becomes structured in the context of the ribosome. We evaluated the ability of the RPS20 hairpin to form a TPR fold by amplification and obtained structures identical to natural TPRs for variants with 2\u20135 point mutations per repeat. The mutations were neutral in the parent organism, suggesting that they could have been sampled in the course of evolution. TPRs could thus have plausibly arisen by amplification from an ancestral helical hairpin."

In many cases, these prototypes can be traced back to the root of cellular life and have since acted as the primary unit of protein evolution (<a href=\"#bib6\">Anantharaman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Apic et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Koonin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Kyrpides et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Orengo and Thornton, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Ponting and Russell, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Ranea et al., 2006</a>). The mechanisms by which they themselves arose are however still poorly understood. We have proposed that the first folded domains emerged through the repetition, fusion, recombination, and accretion of an ancestral set of peptides, which supported RNA-based replication and catalysis (the RNA world <a href=\"#bib12\">Bernhardt, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Gilbert, 1986</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alva et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Lupas et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">S\u00f6ding and Lupas, 2003</a>). Repetition would have been a particularly prominent mechanism by which these peptides yielded folds; six of the ten most populated folds in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Murzin et al., 1995</a>) \u2013 including the five most frequent ones \u2013 have repetitive structures. In all cases, their amplification from subdomain-sized fragments can also be retraced at the sequence level in at least some of their members."

This was originally identified as a repeating 34 amino-acid motif in Cdc23p of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib107\">Sikorski et al., 1990</a>) \u2013 hence its name. Since then, TPR-containing proteins have been discovered in all kingdoms of life, where they mediate protein-protein interactions in a broad range of biological processes, such as cell cycle control, transcription, protein translocation, protein folding, signal transduction and innate immunity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cortajarena and Regan, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Dunin-Horkawicz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Katibah et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Keiski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Kyrpides and Woese, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Lamb et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Sikorski et al., 1990</a>). The \ufb01rst crystal structure of a TPR domain (<a href=\"#bib29\">Das et al., 1998</a>) showed that the repeat units are helical hairpins, stacked into a continuous, right-handed superhelical architecture with an inner groove that mediates the interaction with target proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Forrer et al., 2004</a>). The hairpins interact via a specific geometry involving knobs-into-holes packing (<a href=\"#bib26\">Crick, 1953</a>) and burying about 40% of their surface between repeat units. This tightly packed, superhelical arrangement of a repeating structural unit is typical of all \u03b1\u03b1-solenoid proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Di Domenico et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Kajava, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Kobe and Kajava, 2000</a>)."

Nevertheless, almost all known TPR-containing proteins can be detected using a single sequence pro\ufb01le (<a href=\"#bib56\">Karpenahalli et al., 2007</a>), underscoring their homologous origin. As their name implies, TPR proteins generally contain at least two unit hairpins in a repeated fashion. The few that have only one hairpin, notably the mitochondrial import protein Tom20 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abe et al., 2000</a>), are clearly not ancestral based on their phylogenetic distribution and functionality, implying that the ancestor of the superfamily already had a repeated structure. In searching for the origin of TPRs, we hypothesized that the hairpin at the root of the fold might either have been part of a different, non-repetitive fold or have given rise to both repetitive and non-repetitive folds at the origin of folded domains. Either way we hoped that we might find \u03b1-hairpins in non-repetitive proteins that are similar in both sequence and structure to the TPR unit, suggesting a common origin. Here we show that such hairpins are detectable and that one of them, from the ribosomal protein RPS20 (<a href=\"#bib100\">Schluenzen et al., 2000</a>), can be customized to yield a TPR fold by repetition, with only a small number of point mutations that are neutral for the parent organism. Ribosomal proteins most likely constitute some of the oldest proteins observable today and are still intimately involved in an RNA-driven process: translation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Fox, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Hsiao et al., 2009</a>). They are mostly incapable of assuming their folds outside the ribosomal context (<a href=\"#bib92\">Peng et al., 2014</a>) and thus belong to a class of intrinsically disordered proteins that become structured upon binding to a macromolecular scaffold (<a href=\"#bib37\">Dyson and Wright, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Habchi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Oldfield and Dunker, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Peng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Varadi et al., 2014</a>). This hairpin therefore plausibly retains today many of the properties likely to have been present in the ancestral peptide that gave rise to the TPR fold."

In these proteins, the units are more similar to each other than to any other unit in the protein sequence database, showing that they were recently amplified. In a detailed study of \u03b2-propellers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Chaudhuri et al., 2008</a>), we found that this process of amplification and differentiation has been ongoing since the origin of the fold. TPR proteins show a similar evolutionary history. In some proteins, most of the repeats can be seen to have been amplified separately and to a different extent in each ortholog, pointing to their recent origin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>); in others, the amplification must have occurred much earlier, as their ancestor already had fully differentiated repeats (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). In recently amplified proteins, such as the ones shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>, within which repeats frequently have &gt;80% pairwise sequence identity, tracking the probable \u03b1-hairpin at the root of the amplification is a fairly straightforward proposition. We wondered, however, whether it might be possible to go much further back in time and track the original \u03b1-hairpin from which the first TPR protein was amplified. We therefore searched for TPR-like \u03b1-hairpins in non-repetitive proteins as present-day descendants of the original hairpin."

Since evolutionary reconstructions are subject to Occam\u2019s razor and reflect the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions, we have postulated here one amplification event from one precursor hairpin.

Here, in a first step, we used TPRpred to scan protein sequences in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Berman et al., 2000</a>) for peptides that share statistically significant similarity to the TPR sequence profile and yet have not been annotated as TPR in Pfam (<a href=\"#bib41\">Finn et al., 2014</a>); we used a p-value cutoff\u00a0=\u00a01.0e\u22124, which leads to an estimated false discovery rate of 1.0%, see Materials and methods. We ignored tandem repeats in the hit list and focused only on the singleton cases. Subsequently, we compared the structures of these helical hairpin singletons to the average TPR hairpin and removed non-hairpin-like structures. This yielded 31 helical hairpins that are similar to the TPR unit with respect to both sequence and structure. Among them, 22\u00a0are part of solenoid-like structures and were discarded. The remaining nine hits belong to three families: (I) mitochondrial import receptor subunit Tom20; (II) microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domain including katanin (<a href=\"#bib51\">Iwaya et al., 2010</a>); and (III) 30S ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

To further explore the similarity between the helical hairpin in RPS20 (in short, RPS20-hh) and TPR, we used TPRpred to rank the RPS20 sequences in Pfam (<a href=\"#bib41\">Finn et al., 2014</a>). The top-scoring hit was RPS20-hh from <i>Thermus aquaticus</i> (NCBI accession number\u00a0=\u00a0WP_003044315.1, UniProt id\u00a0=\u00a0B7A5L8_THEAQ), which matches the TPR unit sequence pro\ufb01le at a p-value of 5.4e\u221207, almost an order of magnitude better than the second hit (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>). Furthermore, we examined the surface residues of RPS20-hh fragments to assess their suitability to occur in a tandem repeat mode, as in TPRs. To this end, we first defined five interface positions on the TPR helical hairpin and transferred the definition to RPS20-hh according to their structure alignment (positions 3, 7, 10, 21 and 28 using TPR unit numbering). Then, we searched for RPS20-hhs with as many hydrophobic residues as possible at these interface positions. We found 42 RPS20-hhs that contain at least three hydrophobic residues out of the five interface positions. Among them, the only RPS20-hh predicted to match the TPR unit pro\ufb01le above a p-value of 1.0e\u22124 was again the RPS20 from <i>T. aquaticus</i>, in which three of the \ufb01ve interface residues are hydrophobic (L10, I21 and V28). We therefore chose this helical hairpin (RPS20-hhta) to construct a TPR-like solenoid by amplification (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

For instance, 18 of the 54 non-identical TPR domains in the extended Structural Classification of Proteins database (SCOPe v2.05) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Fox et al., 2014</a>) have three repeats. A previously designed three-repeat TPR protein, CTPR3, was also demonstrated to be highly stable, even more so than natural three-repeat TPR proteins (<a href=\"#bib78\">Main et al., 2003b</a>). We concatenated three copies of RPS20-hhta as an initial construct, connected by the TPR consensus loop sequence (DPNN). We annotate the two helices in each repeat unit as helix <i>Ai</i> and <i>Bi</i>, where <i>i</i> is the index of the repeat unit (<i>i\u00a0=\u00a01, 2 or 3</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

We therefore introduced point mutations into the sequence of RPS20-hhta, aimed at favoring the target structure. Here, we followed the principle of consensus design (<a href=\"#bib42\">Forrer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Main et al., 2003a</a>), which requires the mutation positions to be occupied by the most commonly observed residues in homologous proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Forrer et al., 2004</a>). Consensus design methods have been successful in engineering several different repeat proteins with solenoid folds, including ankyrin repeats (<a href=\"#bib14\">Binz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Kohl et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Mosavi et al., 2002</a>), TPRs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Doyle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kajander et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Main et al., 2003b</a>), pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Coquille et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Shen et al., 2016</a>) and leucine rich repeats (<a href=\"#bib95\">R\u00e4misch et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Stumpp et al., 2003</a>). Following these principles, four different sites of mutation (L4W, K7L/R, V9N, I23D/Y, see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) were considered to improve interface hydrophobicity or preserve coevolved positions observed in TPRs (<a href=\"#bib99\">Sawyer et al., 2013</a>) (see Materials and methods). Furthermore, as natural TPR proteins tend to exhibit zero net charge (<a href=\"#bib75\">Magliery and Regan, 2004</a>), four positively charged residues were also targeted (K2E, K6N, K22E, R25Q/E, see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This resulted in a set of eight candidate mutation sites. In order to preserve the character of the RPS20-hhta sequence, we restricted the number of mutations in any repeat unit to be at most five."

Three proteins (M0, M4RD and M5) could be purified from soluble extracts; the other constructs were insoluble and were refolded from inclusion bodies. In far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra, all proteins displayed a strong alpha-helical pattern, except M0 and M4RD, which appeared to be unfolded, but not prone to aggregation and precipitation, even at high concentrations. When we studied the melting curves, M4N showed cooperative unfolding with a T<sub>m</sub> of 77\u00b0C (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>), while the unfolding of M2, M4E and M5 did not conform to a classical two-state transition, consistent with an unstable molten globule-like state. On the other hand, non-cooperative unfolding processes have been demonstrated for perfectly stable TPR repeats and suggested to be common for various types of repeat proteins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cortajarena and Regan, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kajander et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Stumpp et al., 2003</a>). To clarify this point, urea-induced unfolding transitions were monitored by CD. Like M4N, the three variants M2, M4E and M5 yielded typical cooperative denaturation curves, indicative of folded polypeptides (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The \u2206G<sub>U-F</sub><sup>H2O</sup> values agree well with those reported for other designed TPRs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Main et al., 2005</a>). In line with these findings, M5, the only protein containing tryptophan residues, had a \u03bb<sub>max</sub> of 336 nm in fluorescence emission spectra, as expected for partially shielded aromatic residues. We conclude that four of the five designed TPR variants, M2, M4E, M4N and M5, result in well-folded repeat proteins. To determine the oligomeric state of our folded proteins, we performed static light scattering experiments.

Like many other ribosomal proteins, it is not expected to adopt a stable structure in isolation. Indeed, it has a biased amino acid composition and is predicted to be largely unstructured by many prediction programs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, see also <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1J</a>). It had been shown previously that isolated RPS20 exhibits only one third helical content by CD (<a href=\"#bib91\">Paterakis et al., 1983</a>). For <i>Thermus</i> RPS20 specifically, simulations predict a flexible conformation in solution (<a href=\"#bib19\">Burton et al., 2012</a>). We cloned RPS20 from <i>T. aquaticus</i> and its close relative <i>T. thermophilus</i>. Upon expression, both proteins were insoluble and had to be refolded. In static light scattering measurements, both proteins behaved as monomers (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>). Based on CD spectra, which showed a high proportion of random structure, and the absence of defined melting and urea-denaturation curves (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>), we conclude that RPS20 indeed exhibits considerable conformational variation in solution."

We obtained crystals and solved the structure of M4N to a resolution of 2.2\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). The asymmetric unit (ASU) contains three polypeptide chains of almost identical structure (all pairwise C<sub>\u03b1</sub> RMSD values below 1.4\u2009\u00c5). Notably, all three chains exhibit the desired TPR architecture with three repetitive hairpins, which interact via knobs-into-holes packing between helices Ai and B(i-1), as is characteristic of TPR hairpins. A superposition to the CTPR3 structure yields C<sub>\u03b1</sub> RMSD values below 2.6\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">supplementary file 1I</a>). An unexpected difference to the\u00a0canonical TPR structure is that the stop helix of M4N is not resolved in any of the three chains. However, this missing helix is compensated for by a specific dimerization mode of two M4N protomers. Therein, the C-terminal TPR units of the two protomers form a tight interface, in which the B3 helix of each chain substitutes for the stop helix of the other, mimicking the capping effect of the stop helix (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). A superposition of this mimicry to the last TPR unit and stop helix of CTPR3 yields C<sub>\u03b1</sub> RMSD values as low as 1.2\u2009\u00c5 over 44 residues. The third chain of the ASU, however, was found as a monomer, capping its C-terminal TPR unit in a more unspecific manner by packing it orthogonally against the two A1 helices of the dimer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>)."

Although we did not observe proteolysis in the other folded constructs (M2, M4E and M5), which were also all dimeric, we analyzed whether proteolysis might have favored the dimerization of M4N. Extending the stop helix with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag prevented proteolysis, but did not affect stability or dimerization (M4N-His; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>). We conclude that in the amplified constructs, the observed interactions are more favorable than the interaction with the native stop helix, releasing it and rendering it prone to degradation. This led us to ask whether this helix is in fact dispensable. Indeed, an M4N\u0394C construct, which terminates with the B3 helix, showed the same stability and dimerization as M4N. We obtained two structures for M4N\u0394C from different crystal forms at 2.0\u2009\u00c5 and 1.7\u2009\u00c5 resolution, respectively, the first (CF I) with two dimers in the ASU and the second (CF II) with a single chain in the ASU, for which we constructed the dimer by crystallographic symmetry.

Since we cannot reconstruct the ancestor and do not know what its function was beyond a general expectation of RNA binding, we decided to test whether the mutations we introduced impaired the interaction between RPS20 and its cognate RNA, as an indication of their compatibility with RNA interaction. Each mutation in M2 and M4N occurs in natural RPS20 sequences (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), but no RPS20 sequence has all four mutations simultaneously and we therefore tested if they can be tolerated in vivo.

This folding process is complicated and easily disrupted, witness the elaborate systems for protein folding, quality control and degradation universal to all living beings. Despite the\u00a0widespread problems to reach and maintain the folded state, natural proteins nevertheless form a best-case group, since the overwhelming majority of random polypeptides do not appear to have a folded structure (<a href=\"#bib58\">Keefe and Szostak, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Wei et al., 2003</a>). It thus seems impossible that, at the origin of life, the prototypes for the folded proteins we see today could have arisen by random concatenation of amino acids. We have proposed that folding resulted from the increasing complexity of peptides that supported RNA replication and catalysis, and that these peptides assumed their structure through the interaction with the RNA scaffold (<a href=\"#bib74\">Lupas et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">S\u00f6ding and Lupas, 2003</a>). In this view, protein folding was an emergent property of RNA-peptide coevolution. We have recently described 40 such peptides whose conservation in diverse folds suggests that they predated folded proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alva et al., 2015</a>). These peptides are enriched for nucleic-acid binders, particularly in the context of the ribosome."

Thus, core ribosomal proteins offer a window into the time when proteins were acquiring the ability to fold. Those close to the catalytic center almost entirely lack secondary structure. Further away from the center, their secondary structure content gradually increases and at the periphery, these secondary structure elements become arranged into topologies that parallel those seen in cytosolic proteins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Hsiao et al., 2009</a>). Collectively, the structures of ribosomal proteins chart a path of progressive emancipation from the RNA scaffold. Even the peripheral proteins, however, still mostly assume their structure only in the context of the ribosomal RNA, as exemplified by RPS20 in our study (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>, see also <a href=\"#bib91\">Paterakis et al., 1983</a>)."

The dominant role of repetition in the genesis of protein folds has been documented in many publications since the 1960s (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alva et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Blundell et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Broom et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Eck and Dayhoff, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Kopec and Lupas, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Lee and Blaber, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">McLachlan, 1972</a>, <a href=\"#bib80\">1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Remmert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">S\u00f6ding et al., 2006</a>). As a test of this mechanism, we explored whether a peptide originating from a ribosomal protein that is disordered outside the context of the ribosome, could form a folded protein through an increase in complexity afforded by repetition. For this, we chose a present-day representative of one of the 40 fragments we reconstructed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alva et al., 2015</a>); this fragment is naturally found in a\u00a0single copy in several different folds, including that of ribosomal protein RPS20, and repetitively in one fold, TPR. Simple repetition was not sufficient in our case, but the repeat protein was so close to a folded structure that only two point mutations per repeat were necessary to allow it to fold reliably. The mutations needed for this transition did not appear to affect negatively the interaction with the RNA scaffold, raising the possibility that they could have been among the variants sampled multiply in the course of evolution."

These experiments represent a proof of concept, starting with a modern peptide likely to still retain many features of an ancestral \u03b1\u03b1-hairpin that gave rise to a number of folds, including TPR. Rather than proposing proto-RPS20 as the parent of TPR domains, we see it as one of many proteins emerging from this ancestral hairpin. Given the ease with which repetition of the RPS20 hairpin yielded a TPR-like fold, we consider it likely that the hairpins belonging to the ancestral group were amplified many times during the emergence of folded proteins to yield a range of TPR-like offspring, of which only one may have survived to this day (but see also the figure legend to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The reason for this limited survival may lie in the fact that a\u00a0structure is a prerequisite for protein function, but it is the function that is under biological selection. It could be that the newly emerged TPR-like folds required many additional changes to achieve a useful activity and that therefore only very few \u2013 possibly just one \u2013 survived. We consider a different scenario more probable, however. All present-day TPR domains whose function has been characterized mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to linear sequence motifs in unstructured polypeptide segments (<a href=\"#bib28\">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib119\">Zeytuni and Zarivach, 2012</a>). This activity would have been particularly relevant at a time of transition from peptides dependent on RNA scaffolds for their structure, to autonomously folded polypeptides. Functions relevant in this context would have been to prevent aggregation and increase the solubility of newly emerging (poly)peptides, to promote autonomous folding, to serve as assembling factors for RNA-protein and protein-protein complexes, and to recognize targeting sequences in the emerging cellular networks. It therefore seems likely to us that many of the newly evolved TPR-like folds became established in one or the other of these activities, only to be subsequently displaced by folding becoming a general property of cellular polypeptides and by more advanced, energy-dependent folding factors, which offered much better regulation. Exploring the extent to which our new TPR protein could fulfill such functions represents the next frontier in our studies."

The secondary structure of the TPR unit is helix (13 aa) \u2013 loop (3aa) \u2013 helix (14 aa) \u2013 loop (4aa), while the secondary structure of the RPS20-hhta identi\ufb01ed to be homologous to TPR unit is helix (13 aa) \u2013 loop (3 aa) \u2013 helix (18 aa) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). The last four residues may have been included in the prediction by TPRpred merely to ful\ufb01ll the size requirement of TPR repeat (34 aa). Indeed, when we scanned RPS20-hhta sequence using the hidden Markov model constructed for Pfam family <i>TPR_1</i>, only positions 2\u201328 were found to be similar to the <i>TPR_1</i> pro\ufb01le using HMMER 3.0 (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005305\">SCR_005305</a>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Eddy, 2009</a>), even if all filters were switched o\ufb00.

Helix B3 and the stop helix in our designed protein are different from natural TPRs, but more similar to natural RPS20s. So we also used a RPS20 protein as the structure template for the last repeat and the stop helix. The structure of RPS20 from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> HB8 (PDB id: 2vqe, chain T) was used because it was the structure with the best resolution (2.5\u2009\u00c5). The C-terminal loop in 2vqeT was discarded. The two structures 1na0A and 2vqeT were merged into a hybrid template based on the superposition of their homologous helical hairpins: the third TPR unit in 1na0A and the RPS20-hh in 2vqeT (the very C-terminal four residues were not used). We then modeled the designed TPR sequences using RPS20-hhta onto the hybrid structure template using Rosetta programs <i>fixbb</i> and <i>relax</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Das and Baker, 2008</a>). The Rosetta \ufb01xed backbone design application <i>\ufb01xbb</i> was used to make the initial model.

We did not wish to imply a scenario where RPS20 was the ancestor of the TPR fold, but rather one of common descent of RPS20 and TPR from an ancestral hairpin, which also gave rise to a number of other folds. For our study, we used RPS20 because we consider it the oldest still surviving descendant of this ancestral hairpin and, due to its slow rate of evolution, also the one most likely to reflect ancestral properties. In the process, we hoped to find that repetition is a sufficiently powerful mechanism to allow the emergence of a folded protein from an unstructured parent (note that the entire RPS20 is unstructured in the absence of ribosomal RNA, not just the isolated helix hairpin)."

We have changed the title to use the term \u201cdisordered\u201d, which is the generally used term (rather than \u201cunfolded\u201d, which we had used before as a contrast to the \u201cfolded\u201d repeat protein) and have added a sentence to the Introduction to explain why we refer to ribosomal proteins as intrinsically disordered, also providing references to recent high-profile reviews that can further illuminate this point. We have further added material to section 2.4 and the Methods in order to substantiate that the sequence of RPS20 is in fact similar to that of intrinsically disordered proteins as judged by many disorder predictors, and with a biased residue distribution seen as low-complexity by the program SEG."

Specifically, we performed pulldowns with soluble cell extracts from <i>T. aquaticus, T. thermophilus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> using M4N\u0394C and M5\u0394C, but were unable to discover interactors of even moderate affinity. Since TPR domains typically recognize linear sequence motifs in unstructured segments, we also screened a peptide library against M4N\u0394C and M5\u0394C, using phage display with the Ph.D.-12 Library (NEB) containing ca. 10<sub>9</sub> 12-mers, but again, so far, no peptides could be identified (these experiments are still ongoing). This inability to identify protein or peptide ligands binding to our TPR domains may well be due to the dimerization of the protein, which obstructs the ligand-binding face common to TPR proteins. We are therefore now exploring whether we can disrupt dimerization by single mutations in the C-terminal helices before resuming these screens."

We did not wish to imply that TPR proteins arose from a proto-RPS20 in a fully formed cell (such as Thermus is today); rather, we think that they arose from a precursor form that, like RPS20, interacted with RNA, but in a much more primitive cell-like environment. The reason for the in vivoexperiments was to establish that the mutations necessary for folding are neutral with respect to RNA interaction in our model system. We take this finding to suggest that these (and other fold-promoting) mutations could have been sampled by neutral drift also in the ancestral hairpin. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that in a more primitive, less networked and less integrated setting, many more mutations would have been (largely) neutral than in the Thermus cytosol. A further corollary of the evolutionary steps happening in a pre-cellular environment is that, in the absence of performant control and repair mechanisms, the frequency of all kinds of genetic mutations would have been much higher."
