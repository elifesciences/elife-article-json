Conversely, stress fibers that were not under tension were decorated by proteins that promote the disassembly of actin filaments. This subsequently led to the disappearance of these fibers."

Cell migration is driven by assembly and disassembly of protrusive and contractile actin filament structures. The force in protrusive actin filament structures, including lamellipodium and filopodia at the leading edge of cell, is generated through actin polymerization against the plasma membrane. In contractile actin filament bundles, such as stress fibers, the force is generated by sliding of bipolar myosin II bundles along actin filaments. Notably, whereas the assembly-mechanisms of protrusive actin filament structures are relatively well understood, general principles underlying the assembly of contractile actomyosin bundles have remained elusive (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bugyi and Carlier, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Michelot and Drubin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Burridge and Wittchen, 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "The most prominent contractile actomyosin structures in most cultured non-muscle cells are stress fibers. Beyond cell migration, stress fibers guide adhesion, mechanotransduction, endothelial barrier integrity, myofibril assembly, and receptor clustering in T-lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burridge and Wittchen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wong et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sanger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Tojkander et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yi et al., 2012</a>). Due to their intrinsic properties, stress fibers have become an important model system for studying the general principles by which contractile actomyosin bundles are assembled in cells. Stress fibers can be divided into three main categories based on their protein compositions and interactions with focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib62\">Small et al., 1998</a>). <i>Dorsal (radial) stress fibers</i> are connected to focal adhesions at their distal ends and rise towards the dorsal surface of the cell at their proximal region (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>). They elongate through vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions (i.e. coordinated polymerization of actin filaments, whose rapidly elongating barbed ends are facing the focal adhesion, is responsible for growth of dorsal stress fibers). These actin filament bundles do not contain myosin II, and dorsal stress fibers are thus unable to contract (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cramer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tojkander et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Oakes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tee et al., 2015</a>). However, dorsal stress fibers interact with contractile <i>transverse arcs</i> and link them to focal adhesions. Transverse arcs are curved actin bundles, which display periodic \u03b1-actinin \u2013 myosin II pattern and undergo retrograde flow towards the cell center in migrating cells. They are derived from \u03b1-actinin- and tropomyosin/myosin II- decorated actin filament populations nucleated at the lamellipodium of motile cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tojkander et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Burnette et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">2014</a>). In fibroblasts and melanoma cells, filopodial actin bundles can be recycled for formation of transverse arc \u2013like contractile actomyosin bundles (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nemethova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2008</a>). <i>Ventral stress fibers</i> are defined as contractile actomyosin bundles, which are anchored to focal adhesions at their both ends. Despite their nomenclature, the central regions of ventral stress fibers can bend towards the dorsal surface of the lamellum (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schulze et al., 2014</a>). Migrating cells display thick ventral stress fibers that are typically oriented perpendicularly to the direction of migration, and thinner ventral stress fibers that are often located at the cell rear or below the nucleus. At least the thick ventral stress fibers, which constitute the major force-generating actomyosin bundles in migrating cells, are derived from the pre-existing network of dorsal stress fibers and transverse arcs. However, the underlying mechanism has remained poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burridge et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>)."

Stress fibers are typically present only in cells grown on rigid substrata and they disassemble upon cell detachment from the matrix (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mochitate et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Discher et al., 2005</a>). Furthermore, after applying fluid shear stress, stress fibers align along the orientation of flow direction in endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sato and Ohashi, 2005</a>). Also focal adhesions develop only on rigid surfaces, and applying external tensile force promotes their enlargement (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pelham et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Riveline et al., 2001</a>). Focal adhesions contain several mechano-sensitive proteins, including talin, filamin and p130Cas, whose activities and interactions with other focal adhesion components can be modulated by forces of ~\u223c10\u201350 pN range (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sawada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">del Rio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ehrlicher et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the protein compositions of focal adhesions are regulated by tension supplied by myosin II activity and external forces applied to the cell (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kuo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schiller et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, despite wealth of information concerning mechanosensitive focal adhesion proteins, possible effects of tensile forces on actin filament assembly at focal adhesions have remained elusive. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which tension contributes to the alignment of stress fibers and actin dynamics within these actomyosin bundles have not been reported."

We show that arc fusion during centripetal flow is accompanied by increased contractility that inhibits vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions through AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of VASP, thus insuring formation of ventral stress fibers. Conversely, activation of AMPK allows generation of contractile ventral stress fibers in cells growing on compliant matrix, where their formation is normally prevented. Furthermore, we provide evidence of mechanosensitive actin filament disassembly by ADF/cofilins during stress fiber assembly. These data provide support to a new mechanobiological model explaining the principles of assembly and alignment of ventral stress fibers in migrating cells."

This network, consisting of several non-contractile dorsal stress fibers and multiple thin arcs, flows towards the cell center and maturates to thick, contractile ventral stress fibers through a mechanism that has remained poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>). Interestingly, proper stress fiber network does not form in cells grown on compliant matrix (<a href=\"#bib21\">Discher et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2011</a>), but whether the assembly of all above-mentioned stress fiber categories, or only a specific one, is mechanosensitive has not been reported. By plating U2OS cells on soft (0.5 kPa) and stiff (64 kPa) substrata, we revealed that dorsal stress fibers and arcs are also present in cells grown on compliant matrix. In contrast, ventral stress fiber assembly is compromised under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). While 89% of cells plated on 64 kPa matrix contained ventral stress fibers, only 10% of cells plated on 0.5 kPa matrix exhibited ventral stress fibers as defined by presence of straight, contractile actin bundles connected to focal adhesions at each end. Thus, generation of ventral stress fibers appears to be the mechanosensitive phase in the formation of the stress fiber network."

These experiments revealed that the \u2018distal\u2019 focal adhesions, linked via dorsal stress fibers to the ends of the arc, turned and aligned along the direction of arc. In contrast, focal adhesions linked to the central region of the arc did not display similar alignment during the process.

Fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching (FRAP) was first applied to visualize the recovery of GFP-actin signal within actin filament bundles of dorsal and ventral stress fibers. Region of interest was chosen beneath focal adhesions to exclude other focal adhesion associated actin filament populations that are not directly involved in vectorial actin polymerization and elongation of stress fibers. As previously reported, elongation of a bright actin filament bundle (with a rate of \u223c0,26 \u03bcm/min) from focal adhesions located at the distal ends of dorsal stress fibers was observed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>). Importantly, when a FRAP analysis was performed on a corresponding ventral stress fiber region, only very slow elongation (\u223c0,02 \u03bcm/min) of a bright actin filament bundle from the adhesion was observed. Instead, we mainly detected recovery of GFP-actin fluorescence evenly along the photobleached region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C-E</a>). As an alternative approach, we utilized photoactivatable (PA)-GFP-actin to follow its incorporation into dorsal and ventral stress fibers. In both cases, significant fraction of activated PA-GFP-actin remained at/close to focal adhesions, probably corresponding to actin filament pools associated with focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tojkander et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, PA-GFP-actin displayed centripetal flow along the actin filament bundle from focal adhesions in dorsal stress fibers, while similar flow of PA-GFP-actin was not detected from focal adhesions located at the tips of ventral stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

Similarly, disruption of contractile stress fibers by ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, or by over-expression of dominant inactive Rif GTPase (Rif-TN), which prevents assembly of contractile arcs (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tojkander et al., 2011</a>), led to formation of abnormally long dorsal stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A and B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Importantly, live-imaging of GFP-actin expressing cells revealed that the abnormally long dorsal stress in Rif-TN transfected cells continued to elongate throughout the entire observation period. During their uncontrolled elongation, the dorsal stress fibers of Rif-TN expressing cells occasionally bent or fused with another elongating dorsal stress fiber initiated from the opposite side of the cell (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>)."

Previous studies demonstrated zyxin-mediated recruitment of VASP to the sites of stress fiber repair and remodelling (<a href=\"#bib64\">Smith et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hoffman et al., 2012</a>) and mechanosensitive recruitment of VASP to epithelial zonula adherens (<a href=\"#bib41\">Leerberg et al., 2014</a>).

Therefore, regulation of VASP localization does not offer an explanation for the lack of vectorial actin polymerization at the tips of ventral stress fibers. Interestingly, previous work demonstrated that phosphorylation of specific residues (Ser239 and Thr278) of VASP inhibit its actin filament binding and polymerization activities (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harbeck et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Benz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To study the possible role of VASP phosphorylation in actin filament assembly at focal adhesions, we first examined the localization of phosphorylated VASP in U2OS cells. From several VASP phospho-Ser239/Thr278 antibodies tested, only 16C2 (Millipore) worked in immunofluorescence experiments. Although the signal with this antibody was weak, it specifically stained focal adhesions located at the tips of ventral stress fibers, whereas enrichment of phospho-Ser239 VASP to adhesions at the tips of dorsal stress fibers was not detected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D, E and F</a>). To confirm this result by an alternative approach, we examined by Western blotting phospho-Ser239 and phospho-Thr278 VASP levels in control cells and in cells where the assembly of contractile ventral stress fibers was stimulated or inhibited by over-expression of dominant active RhoA or by plating cells on compliant matrix, respectively. In line with the data presented above, both phospo-Ser239 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G and H</a>) and phospho-Thr278 (data not shown) levels were &gt;2-fold elevated in the cell population transfected with a construct expressing dominant active RhoA, whereas phospo-Ser239 levels were \u223c5-fold diminished in cells plated on soft matrix and unable to form contractile ventral stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I and J</a>). Thus, VASP phosphorylation in focal adhesions correlates with increased contractility of stress fibers."

Interestingly, ADF/cofilins were recently shown to preferentially bind and disassemble flexible actin filaments in vitro. ADF/cofilins did not localize to contractile stress fibers in intact cells, but translocated to stress fibers when pre-stretched elastic substratum was relaxed (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hayakawa et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, ADF/cofilins affect the actin filament bending mechanics (<a href=\"#bib43\">McCullough et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Elam et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we examined whether ADF/cofilins could be responsible for specific disassembly of those dorsal stress fibers that are not under tension in migrating U2OS cells. The major ADF/cofilin isoform, cofilin-1, is highly abundant protein in non-muscle cells where it displays mainly diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, endogenous cofilin-1 and flag-tagged cofilin-1 also localized to dorsal stress fibers in U2OS cells, whereas contractile ventral stress fibers and thick arcs did not exhibit detectable enrichment of cofilin-1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A and B</a>; <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A, B and C</a>). Furthermore, cofilin-1 localized to the \u2018curly\u2019 actin filament bundles that were occasionally present in cells over-expressing Ser239Ala;Thr278Ala mutant VASP (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

Here we have revealed several new aspects concerning the mechanisms underlying the assembly of contractile ventral stress fibers. We provide evidence that: (1) Formation of ventral stress fibers from their precursors (arcs and dorsal stress fibers) is a mechanosensitive process. (2) Arcs fuse with each other during centripetal flow to form thicker and more contractile actomyosin bundles, which apply tension to focal adhesions located at their ends. (3) This tension activates AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of VASP that leads to inhibition of vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions. (4) AMPK-mediated VASP phosphorylation is necessary for assembly and proper alignment of contractile ventral stress fibers. Conversely, activation of AMPK can bypass the need of stiff matrix for ventral stress fiber assembly. (5) ADF/cofilin\u2013mediated disassembly of non-contractile dorsal stress fibers is important for the proper maturation of the stress fiber network. We propose that similar mechanosensitive actin filament assembly and disassembly may have general role in formation and alignment of diverse contractile actomyosin bundles in different cell-types."

Nascent adhesions appear at the lamellipodium of migrating cell and a fraction of them matures to focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burnette et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Choi et al., 2008</a>). Dorsal stress fibers are initiated from focal adhesions located at the leading edge of cells, and elongate through \u2018vectorial\u2019 actin polymerization at focal adhesions, mediated at least by VASP and Dia1 formin (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hotulainen and Lappalainen, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Watanabe et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gateva et al., 2014</a>). Similarly to filopodia, where VASP localizes at the tip-complex and promotes assembly of unipolar actin filament bundles, VASP at focal adhesions is expected to catalyse polymerization of an unipolar actin filament bundle towards the cell center. Elongating dorsal stress fibers associate with multiple myosin II containing arcs, which are derived from the lamellipodial actin structures (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). During centripetal flow of this spider-net like structure, arcs fuse with each other to generate a thicker, more contractile bundle (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B and C</a>). As a result, those focal adhesions that are attached via dorsal stress fibers to the ends of the contractile arc sense strong myosin II-generated tension, leading to their enlargement and turning along the direction of the arc. In support to this, ventral stress fibers apply strong traction forces to the substrate through their terminally located focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#bib45\">M\u00f6hl et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, tension-mediated maturation of terminal focal adhesions leads to inhibition of vectorial actin polymerization, which is at least partially mediated by phosphorylation of VASP (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). However, because VASP-depletion did not result in a compete inhibition of vectorial actin polymerization after releasing the tension in ventral stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), other proteins are also likely to contribute to vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions. It is also important to note that, although the actin polymerization activity of VASP is inhibited at focal adhesions under high tension, VASP protein is still present in that location. Thus, VASP may contribute to integrity of the adhesions at the tips of ventral stress fibers through its other activities, including actin filament bundling (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bear and Gertler, 2009</a>). Furthermore, VASP phosphorylation is not expected to inhibit all actin dynamics in focal adhesions, because VASP appears to specifically contribute to vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions, whereas other proteins such as formins may promote the turnover of other focal adhesion-associated actin filament populations."

Finally, we propose that mechanosensitive binding of cofilin-1 to those dorsal stress fibers and dorsal stress fiber regions, which are not under myosin II-applied tension, leads to disassembly of these \u2018non-productive\u2019 regions of the stress fiber network. Consequently, the focal adhesions located at the distal ends of \u2018central\u2019 dorsal stress fibers, which are oriented perpendicularly to the contractile arcs and hence do not sense strong myosin II\u2013derived tension, diminish in size and disappear. On the other hand, contractile arcs and mature ventral stress fibers are protected from ADF/cofilin-mediated actin filament disassembly (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D and E</a>). Consistent with this model, dorsal stress fibers and arcs form in cells grown on soft substrata, whereas contractile ventral stress fibers fail to assemble in compliant matrix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

                        "text": "Focal adhesions are mechanosensitive structures (e.g. <a href=\"#bib34\">Iskratsch et al., 2014</a>). Their maturation from nascent adhesions and maintenance require relatively small forces that can be generated by retrograde actin flow without myosin II-driven contractility (<a href=\"#bib47\">Oakes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Stricker et al., 2013</a>). However, focal adhesions mature into larger, elongated adhesions under stronger, myosin II-derived tension (<a href=\"#bib25\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>). Myosin II -generated force also affects the protein composition and dynamics in focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kuo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schiller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wolfenson et al., 2011</a>). Here, we provide evidence that vectorial actin polymerization, which drives elongation of stress fibers, is strictly controlled in focal adhesions. Thus, different force regimes seem to have distinct effects on actin dynamics and molecular composition of focal adhesions. While weak forces exerted by retrograde actin flow appear to be required for VASP recruitment and to promote vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions, stronger force applied by contractility of the myosin II-containing ventral stress fiber efficiently inhibits actin polymerization at focal adhesions. Importantly, during this process VASP is phosphorylated by AMPK, whose activity at least in muscle cells can be controlled by tension through a currently uncharacterized mechanism (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blair et al., 2009</a>). It is likely that activities or localizations of additional actin-polymerization associated proteins in focal adhesions are regulated by contractility. Indeed, an interaction partner of VASP, palladin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gateva et al., 2014</a>), as well as tropomyosins Tm1 and Tm5NM1 (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) are enriched in focal adhesions located at the tips of dorsal stress fibers, but absent from adhesions at the tips of ventral stress fibers. Furthermore, formins contribute to actin filament nucleation and/or processive polymerization in focal adhesions, and it is likely that also their activities are regulated during this process. Recent studies demonstrated that low-regime forces (&lt;3 pN) increase the actin polymerization activity of formins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Courtemanche, et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">J\u00e9gou et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, the activity of formins can be controlled by a local increase in G-actin levels (<a href=\"#bib29\">Higashida et al., 2013</a>). In the future, it will be interesting to examine the effects of imposed external forces, comparable in magnitude to tension applied by a myosin II-containing ventral stress fiber, on formins. However, similar to shown here for VASP, we propose that possible regulation of formin activity in focal adhesions is more likely controlled through biochemical signalling cascades than direct mechanical regulation of the formin molecule. This is because culturing cells on hyaluronic acid containing soft gels can produce a similar formation of ventral stress fibers that is otherwise observed only in cells cultured on rigid substrates (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chopra et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, several tyrosine kinases play an important role in focal adhesion mechanosensing, and their inactivation can shift the stiffness regime for assembly of large focal adhesions and ventral stress fibers (<a href=\"#bib51\">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2011</a>)."

However, arc fusion and formation of focal adhesion\u2013attached ventral stress fibers can occur also in VASP-depleted cells, which either do not contain dorsal stress fibers or where these actin filament bundles are very thin and fragile (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>).

Using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI6000), images of cells and of the fluorescent microspheres directly underneath the cells were imaged during the experiment and after cell detachment with trypsin. By comparing the fluorescent microsphere images before and after cell detachment, we computed spatial maps of cell-exerted displacement. With knowledge of the displacement field and that of the substrate stiffness, we computed the traction field using the well-established method of constrained fourier transform traction microscopy (<a href=\"#bib12\">Butler et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Krishnan et al., 2009</a>).

The mechanosensitivity of VASP phosphorylation and vectorial growth is mostly based on comparison of cell behaviors on substrates of different stiffness. This is rather indirect. A key experiment would be to directly show that decreasing of increasing tension affects actin assembly dynamics at vsf. Could the authors more directly perturb the forces exerted on focal adhesions by vsf, e.g. with local relaxation of tension by laser ablation or local increase in tension by pulling on the cell (like in Riveline et al for instance)? Would such perturbations affect vectorial growth, as visualized with photoactivation of actin-GFP? To further support mechanosensitivity, the authors show that myosin inhibition leads to defects in vsf formation and longer dorsal stress fibers. But shouldn't decreasing tension rather result in longer vsf, as vectorial growth would not be inhibited anymore?"

The new ablation experiment provides some support (if statistics and clarification on the quantifications are provided, see comments in reviews below), however it does not by itself support a mechanosensitive mechanism. After extensive discussion, the reviewers concluded that the authors should quantify forces if they want to claim mechanosensitivity, and quantitatively assess the relation between forces exerted and actin assembly rates. Furthermore, it is unclear if resumed vectorial polymerization upon ablation actually depends on VASP. This needs to be addressed to rule out other possible explanations.

More importantly, the authors state that they did not find any differences in actin turnover (by GFP-actin recovery) when bleaching adhesions located at the ends of dorsal vs ventral stress fibers. This confirms what I had proposed/feared in my review, which is that actin polymerization rates in adhesions anchoring dorsal vs ventral stress fibers are not significantly different.

The Western blot of VASP phosphorylation after AICAR treatment, which was suggested in another part of the reviewers' comments, is indeed important (though the original Western should be shown in addition to the quantification). However it does not directly link VASP phosphorylation or activity, to tension. This could be addressed by e.g. testing if vectorial growth after laser ablation depends on VASP.

The actin signal is very dim on the image displayed, was the speed of growth quantified by hand or in an unbiased (automated) manner? If one were to draw a line along the stronger/less patchy actin signal, the speed of growth would be much lower than suggested by the dotted line in the figure. Given the low signal in the figure, providing a movie might also help assess the resumed actin polymerization. Furthermore, the text indicates a mean speed of resumed assembly, but the number of cells or experiments does not seem to be reported. While indeed the option of more extensively using traction forces was only suggested in the initial round of review, given the important of the mechanosensitivity statement, it would considerably strengthen the conclusions of the laser ablation experiment if tractions force microscopy was used to show that it indeed releases tension in the stress fiber."

Demonstrating these two points would provide a biophysical mechanism of interest to the broad readership of</i> eLife. <i>Additional evidence is needed to demonstrate that the events described are actually mechanosensitive. The mechanosensitivity of VASP phosphorylation and vectorial growth is mostly based on comparison of cell behaviors on substrates of different stiffness. This is rather indirect.

Could the authors more directly perturb the forces exerted on focal adhesions by vsf, e.g. with local relaxation of tension by laser ablation or local increase in tension by pulling on the cell (like in Riveline et al for instance)? Would such perturbations affect vectorial growth, as visualized with photoactivation of actin-GFP?

Concerning the mechanosensitivity of vectorial actin polymerization, our data (traction force, FRAP and photoactivation experiments) already demonstrated that adhesions at the ends of dorsal stress fibers, which undergo vectorial polymerization, are under lower tension compared to the ones at the ends of ventral stress fibers, which do not undergo vectorial actin polymerization.
