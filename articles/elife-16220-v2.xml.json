                    "text": "Although it is clear that trisomy 21 causes Down syndrome, the molecular events acting downstream of the trisomy remain ill defined. Using complementary genomics analyses, we identified the interferon pathway as the major signaling cascade consistently activated by trisomy 21 in human cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that trisomy 21 activates the interferon transcriptional response in fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines, as well as circulating monocytes and T cells. Trisomy 21 cells show increased induction of interferon-stimulated genes and decreased expression of ribosomal proteins and translation factors. An shRNA screen determined that the interferon-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 suppress proliferation of trisomy 21 fibroblasts, and this defect is rescued by pharmacological JAK inhibition. Therefore, we propose that interferon activation, likely via increased gene dosage of the four interferon receptors encoded on chromosome 21, contributes to many of the clinical impacts of trisomy 21, and that interferon antagonists could have therapeutic benefits."

Using complementary genomics analyses, we identified the interferon pathway as the major signaling cascade consistently activated by trisomy 21 in human cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that trisomy 21 activates the interferon transcriptional response in fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines, as well as circulating monocytes and T cells. Trisomy 21 cells show increased induction of interferon-stimulated genes and decreased expression of ribosomal proteins and translation factors. An shRNA screen determined that the interferon-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 suppress proliferation of trisomy 21 fibroblasts, and this defect is rescued by pharmacological JAK inhibition. Therefore, we propose that interferon activation, likely via increased gene dosage of the four interferon receptors encoded on chromosome 21, contributes to many of the clinical impacts of trisomy 21, and that interferon antagonists could have therapeutic benefits."

The extra copy of chromosome 21 (chr21) impacts human development in diverse ways across every major organ system, causing the condition known as Down syndrome (DS). One of the most intriguing aspects of T21 is that it causes an altered disease spectrum in the population with DS, protecting these individuals from some diseases (e.g. solid tumors, hypertension), while strongly predisposing them to others (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s disease, leukemia, autoimmune disorders) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sobey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bratman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Roberts and Izraeli, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Anwar et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Malinge et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hasle et al., 2016</a>). Despite many years of study, the molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms driving both the protective and deleterious effects of T21 are poorly understood. A few chr21-encoded genes have been implicated in the development of specific comorbidities, such as <i>APP</i> in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib84\">Wiseman et al., 2015</a>), and <i>DYRK1A</i> and <i>ERG</i> in hematopoietic malignancies (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stankiewicz and Crispino, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Malinge et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, research in this area could inform a wide range of medical conditions affecting not only those with DS, but also the typical population."

Even conserved features, such as cognitive impairment, display wide quantitative variation (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Sola et al., 2015</a>). Collectively, our understanding of the mechanisms driving such inter-individual variation in the population with DS is minimal. More specifically, it is unclear what gene expression changes are consistently caused by T21, versus those that are context-dependent. Integrated analyses of a large body of studies have indicated that the changes in gene expression caused by T21 involve various signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib57\">Scarpato et al., 2014</a>), however, these studies vary widely in cell type, number of samples, and even analysis platform, among other variables (<a href=\"#bib77\">Volk et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Costa et al., 2011</a>). More recently, gene expression analysis of cells derived from discordant monozygotic twins, only one of which was affected by T21, concluded that global gene expression changes in T21 cells are driven by differences in chromatin topology, whereby affected genes are clustered into large chromosomal domains of activation or repression (<a href=\"#bib35\">Letourneau et al., 2014</a>). However, independent re-analysis of these data has challenged this conclusion (<a href=\"#bib16\">Do et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, there remains a clear need to identify the consistent gene expression changes caused by T21 and to characterize how these programs are modified across cell types, tissue types, genetic backgrounds, and developmental stages."

Our RNA-seq transcriptome analysis identified <i>consistent</i> gene expression signatures associated with T21 in all cell types examined. Interestingly, the fraction of this gene expression signature that is not encoded on chr21 is dominated by the interferon (IFN) transcriptional response, an observation that is reproducible in skin fibroblasts, B cell-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines, as well as primary monocytes and T cells. In parallel, we performed a kinome-focused shRNA screen that identified the IFN-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 as strong negative regulators of T21 cell proliferation in fibroblasts. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of JAK kinases improves T21 cell viability. Taken together, our results identify the IFN pathway as <i>consistently</i>\u00a0activated by T21, which could merely be a result of increased gene dosage of four IFN receptor subunits encoded on chr21. We hypothesize that IFN activation could contribute to many of the effects of T21, including increased risk of leukemia and autoimmune disorders, as well as many developmental abnormalities also observed in interferonopathies (<a href=\"#bib86\">Yao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zitvogel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Crow and Manel, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McGlasson et al., 2015</a>)."

T21 was confirmed by PCR analysis of the chr21-encoded <i>RCAN1</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We included samples from different genetic backgrounds, ages, and genders, in order to avoid identifying differences that are specific to a particular pair of isogenic or genetically related cell lines and which would not withstand the effects of inter-individual variation. To illustrate this point, comparison of one pair of disomic male individuals of similar age yielded thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with similar numbers of upregulated and downregulated DEGs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>, Male 1 vs. Male 2). However, when the 12 samples are divided into two groups with roughly balanced age, sex, and T21 status, very few consistent changes were identified, thus demonstrating the impact of inter-individual variation within our sample set (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, Group 1 vs. Group 2). In contrast, comparison of all T21 versus all D21 cells identified 662 consistent DEGs, with a disproportionate number of these upregulated in T21 cells (471 of 662, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, T21 vs. D21, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). We also observed an uncharacteristic spike of DEGs at ~1.5-fold overexpression in T21 cells on a volcano plot, consistent with many chr21 genes being overexpressed solely due to increased gene dosage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). For comparison purposes, we also analyzed samples by sex which expectedly yielded DEGs encoded on chrX (e.g. <i>XIST</i>) and chrY (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1 A\u2013B</a>; Female vs. Male). Sex\u00a0causes fewer significant changes than T21, with roughly equal numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes. Taken together, these data indicate that T21 produces consistent changes in a gene expression signature that withstands differences in genetic background, age, sex, and site of biopsy. Of note, when we performed RNA-seq analysis using increasing numbers of T21 vs. D21 pairs, the fraction of chr21-encoded DEGs increased steadily with sample size, accounting for ~12% of the core gene expression signature in the 12 cell line panel. However, 88% of DEGs are located on other chromosomes, indicating the existence of conserved mechanisms driving these genome-wide changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Thus, we next asked where the ~88% of core DEGs not encoded on chr21 are located across the genome. This exercise revealed broad distribution across all chromosomes, with no obvious contiguous domains of up- or downregulation (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> for a whole genome Manhattan plot, and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> for individual chromosomes). In fact, mere visual analysis of DEGs from the individual chromosomes previously claimed by Letourneau et al. to harbor large dysregulated domains (e.g. chr3, chr11, chr19) did not reveal such domains in our dataset, showing instead obvious regions of overlapping activation and repression (shaded gray boxes in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, our analysis is more consistent with the report that re-analyzed the data in Letournaeu et al. and questioned the existence of these chromosomal domains (<a href=\"#bib16\">Do et al., 2015</a>). In fact, the only region of the genome at which there was clear contiguous upregulation of DEGs was chr21 itself (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>)."

Several lines of evidence indicate that, while chr21 DEGs are regulated mostly by increased gene dosage, non-chr21 DEGs may be driven by specific pathways that are subject to signal amplification, with a bias toward upregulation, and greatly affected by inter-individual variation. First, violin plots display the relatively small number of chr21 DEGs, showing mostly upregulation clustered around 1.5 fold, versus a much larger number of non-chr21 DEGs, showing both up- and downregulation with no obvious clustering of fold changes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Second, the obvious effect of gene dosage on the expression of chr21 DEGs is apparent in the violin plots and heatmaps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>), where the median fold change centers around 1.5 fold (e.g. <i>APP, ETS2</i>), while a few genes show greater induction (e.g. <i>MX1, MX2</i>). In fact, chr21 genes exhibit more than an 80% probability of a ~1.5-fold change as calculated by kernel density estimation analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Third, the bias toward upregulation among non-chr21 DEGs is evident in the violin plots, heatmaps, and density estimation analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>), where a larger fraction of these genes is upregulated. Finally, we measured the inter-individual variation of chr21 DEGs versus non-chr21 DEGs by calculating the standard deviation for each DEG across each age- and gender-matched pair of fibroblasts. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, the median standard deviation for chr21 DEGs is much smaller than for all DEGs."

This analysis tool includes both a hypergeometric test for overlapping sets of genes and a directional component to predict activation or inactivation of factors that control gene expression (e.g. transcription factors, protein kinases) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kr\u00e4mer et al., 2014</a>). We confirmed the effectiveness of this tool using published RNA expression datasets from our lab for cells treated with an inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction, hypoxia, and serum stimulation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sullivan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Donner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Galbraith et al., 2013</a>). IPA effectively identified p53, the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1A (HIF1A), and growth factor receptors and downstream kinases (PDGF, ERK) as the top upstream regulators in each scenario, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Strikingly, the top 13 upstream regulators predicted to be activated in T21 cells are all IFN-related factors, including IFN ligands (e.g. IFNA2, IFNB, IFNG) and IFN-activated transcription factors (e.g. IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, STAT1) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Importantly, most of these signals are derived from non-chr21 DEGs, and would be missed by analyses focused specifically on chr21-encoded genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This analysis also identified two known repressors of IFN signaling, MAPK1 and TRIM24, as upstream regulators inactivated in T21 cells, consistent with activation of the IFN pathway (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tisserand et al., 2011</a>). As an example of how the RNA-seq data supports the upstream regulator prediction by IPA, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows the gene network centered on the ligand IFNA2 as a potential driver of consistent gene expression changes.

Using a combination of IPA upstream regulator predictions and our RNA-seq data, we clearly identified the canonical IFN pathways \u2013from ligands through receptors and kinases and down to transcription factors and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)\u2013 as activated in T21 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Whereas IFN receptors are upregulated ~1.5 fold with relatively low levels of inter-individual variation, as expected for increased gene dosage in T21 cells, the downstream ISGs exhibit larger fold changes, greater variation between samples, and tend to have low expression levels in D21 cells, in accord with activation of IFN only in T21 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We confirmed the elevated basal expression of three of the IFN receptors (IFNAR1, IFNGR2, and ILR10RB), enhanced basal phosphorylation of STAT1, as well as increased basal expression of several ISGs at the protein level in T21 cells, with noticeable inter-individual variation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Shuai et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Waddell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schoggins et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

This assay confirmed elevated protein levels for many of the IFN-related genes found to be induced at the mRNA level in the RNA-seq experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Finally, we examined the fraction of our upregulated DEGs linked to IFN signaling using IPA, Pathway Commons, and a list of 387 validated ISGs curated by Schoggins and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schoggins et al., 2011</a>). Our analysis revealed that 21% (101/471) of DEGs upregulated in T21 cells are linked to IFN signaling, with contributions from both chr21 (17%, 14/81) and non-chr21 (22%, 87/390) DEGs, pointing to IFN activation as a potential mechanism for the larger number of upregulated versus downregulated DEGs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Altogether, these results indicate that the IFN pathway is consistently induced by trisomy 21 in fibroblasts, and that the IFN transcriptional response accounts for a considerable fraction of the transcriptome changes caused by trisomy 21 across the genome."

To test this, we treated three pairs of fibroblasts \u2013roughly matched by age and sex\u2013 with various doses of the Type I ligands IFN-\u03b1 or -\u03b2, or with the Type II ligand IFN-\u03b3, and monitored the\u00a0expression of key ISGs via western blot. We also monitored phosphorylation of STAT1. Overall, these efforts revealed that trisomy 21 cells show stronger induction of ISGs upon treatment with all three ligands, albeit with variation across specific cell lines and ligands (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For example, stimulation with IFN-\u03b1 led to stronger induction in the T21 cell line for MX1 in pairs 1 and 2, stronger induction of IDO1 in pairs 1 and 3, and stronger induction of ISG15 in pairs 1 and 2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Similar results were observed for the other Type I ligand, IFN-\u03b2. However, ligand-specific differences were also observed. For example, IDO1 was more strongly induced by IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 in the T21 cell line in pair 1, but this was not the case when using IFN-\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Thus, these results confirm the notion of strong inter-individual variation in the downstream signaling effects of T21. Of note, all three IFN ligands consistently induced STAT1 phosphorylation (pSTAT1) both in D21 and T21 cells, but the levels of pSTAT1 did not correlate precisely with the expression levels of the various ISGs. For example, the obviously different levels of ISG15 in pair 2 upon treatment with the three ligands do not correlate with dissimilar levels of pSTAT1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). This suggests that STAT1 phosphorylation is not a robust predictor of ISG expression, which is ultimately defined by the orchestrated action of multiple IFN-activated transcription factors."

                                "text": "In a parallel unbiased approach to identify signaling cascades deregulated by T21, we employed an shRNA screen to identify protein kinases that may have a differential impact on the viability (i.e. proliferation and/or survival) of T21 cells relative to D21 cells. We hypothesized that core gene expression changes in T21 cells lead to a rewiring of signaling cascades, creating differential requirements for specific kinases during cell survival and proliferation. In order to identify such kinases, we introduced a library of 3,075 shRNAs targeting 654 kinases into each of the 12 fibroblast cell lines we subjected to transcriptome analysis. We then propagated these cells for 14 days to allow for selection of cells harboring shRNAs targeting kinases that differentially affect survival and/or proliferation of T21 cells versus D21 cells, henceforth referred to as DM<sup>T21</sup> kinases (Differential Modulators of T21 cells) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In this screen, relative enrichment of a given shRNA in the T21 population could result from the targeted kinase being a negative regulator of T21 cellular fitness, a positive regulator of D21 cellular fitness, or a combination of both. To minimize the possibility of shRNA off-target effects, we required at least three independent shRNAs targeting a given kinase to score as significantly enriched or depleted, with no more than one shRNA against each kinase scoring in the opposite direction (see Materials and methods for details). This analysis identified a total of 25 and 15 kinases that negatively and positively affect the fitness of T21 cells relative to D21 cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). The top scoring enriched kinase was mTOR, indicating that this kinase differentially decreases the fitness of T21 cells (and/or differentially increases the fitness of D21 cells). This could be consistent with previous reports showing hyperactivation of mTOR signaling in the brains of individuals with DS and mouse models of trisomy 21 and consequent impairments in autophagy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Perluigi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Troca-Mar\u00edn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Iyer et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, among DM<sup>T21</sup> kinases predicted to hinder T21 cell viability were the IFN-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 (<a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcller et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stahl et al., 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). To confirm that JAK1 signaling negatively affects the relative viability of T21 cells, we treated two pairs of D21/T21 fibroblasts with increasing doses of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tefferi et al., 2011</a>). Rux treatment led to decreased levels of pSTAT1, decreased protein expression of MX1 \u2013an ISG encoded on chr21\u2013, and decreased mRNA expression of several ISGs found to be upregulated in T21 fibroblasts in our RNA-seq experiment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). To assess the impact of Rux treatment on cell viability, we seeded equal numbers of D21 and T21 fibroblasts in the absence or presence of increasing doses of the inhibitor, and counted the number of viable cells 3 days post-seeding. Notably, the number of viable T21 cells was much lower in all conditions tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). However, whereas Rux treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in the number of viable T21 cells, it also produced a decrease in the number of viable D21 cells at the highest concentration. When the cell counts are represented as T21/D21 ratios, it is clear that JAK inhibition has a differential effect on cell proliferation between T21 and D21 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). This is consistent with shRNAs targeting JAK1 (and TYK2) being differentially enriched in T21 cells during the 14-day course of the screen. Ultimately, these data support the notion of differential signaling requirements in T21 relative to D21 cells and identify two IFN-related kinases as negative regulators of T21 fibroblast viability."

                                "text": "To test whether consistent changes in gene expression programs elicited by trisomy 21 are conserved across cell types, we performed RNA-seq on a panel of six age-matched, female lymphoblastoid cell lines from D21 and T21 individuals (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). These cell lines were generated by immortalizing B cells with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), thus enabling us to compare a cell type of lymphocytic origin with the fibroblasts of mesenchymal origin. Analysis of DEGs associated with T21 identified 1538 genes both up and downregulated with more upregulated DEGs (861 out of 1538), as was seen in the fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Similarly, a peak of highly significant DEGs with ~1.5-fold change, comprised of chr21-encoded genes, is observed in a volcano plot (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, most DEGs are distributed across the genome, and not arranged into obvious chromosomal domains outside of chr21 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). IPA revealed that the top upstream regulators of the consistent gene expression signature driven by T21 in lymphoblastoids are also IFN-related, and that this prediction is powered by non-chr21 DEGs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Comparison of DEGs from fibroblasts and lymphoblastoids demonstrates that many of the same upstream regulators are predicted to be activated and are IFN-related factors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). All four chr21-encoded IFN receptors are significantly upregulated in lymphoblastoids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), as they are in fibroblasts. In fact, the most significant DEG encoded on chr21 is <i>IFNAR1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Increased basal protein expression was confirmed by western blot for IFNAR1 and IL10RB, as well as for the interferon-related genes TBX21, GBP5 and BCL2L11 (BIM) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). STAT1 phosphorylation was also elevated in the T21 lymphoblastoids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>)."

However, a unique feature of the primary cell types -monocytes and T cells- is a predicted inactivation of the gene expression program driven by the transcription factor MYCN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Comparison of the canonical pathways deregulated in all four cell types confirms that IFN signaling is the top activated pathway, but also reveals that monocytes and T cells, and to a lesser degree lymphoblastoids, show strong repression of the EIF2 pathway (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

Mechanistically, it has been shown that IFN signaling impairs processing of rRNAs and controls the activity and/or expression of specific translation factors (<a href=\"#bib79\">Walsh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Maroun, 1978</a>). On the other hand, the MYC family of transcription factors are known drivers of ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and cell growth (<a href=\"#bib76\">van Riggelen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boon et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Arabi et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, the EIF2 pathway is a key driver of protein translation, with eIF2 itself being an essential translation initiation factor (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hinnebusch, 2014</a>). Analysis of the gene signatures identified by IPA that predicted inactivation of both the MYCN transcriptional program and the EIF2 pathway showed a substantial degree of overlap (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). In monocytes and T cells, the genes common between the two repressed programs encode components of both the small and large ribosome subunits (i.e. RPS proteins in the 40S complex and RPL proteins in the 60S complex) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">2</a>). Genes exclusive to the MYCN signature are enriched for metabolic enzymes and translation elongation factors (EEFs). Genes exclusive to the EIF2 signature are enriched for translation initiation factors (EIFs) and additional ribosomal proteins. Examples of RPSs, RPLs, EEFs and EIFs downregulated in trisomy 21 cells are shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B and D</a> (see also <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">2</a>). This result is consistent with reports that interferon treatment results in a\u00a0global decrease in expression of the translation machinery in primary PBMCs (<a href=\"#bib71\">Taylor et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gupta et al., 2012</a>). Altogether, these results indicate that T21 causes a general downregulation of dozens of components of the protein synthesis machinery in circulating monocytes and T cells."

                                "text": "Having performed transcriptome analysis of cell types of different origins, we investigated to what degree the gene expression changes caused by T21 are affected by cell type-specific regulatory landscapes. A principal component analysis (PCA) shows the fibroblast transcriptomes segregating strongly (PC1 80.5%) from those of the cell types of hematopoietic origin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). B cell-derived lymphoblastoids and T lymphocytes cluster together, yet they segregate away from the monocytes of myeloid origin (PC2, 11.3%). Within this background, the global impact of the trisomy on the transcriptome is secondary to the effects of the cell type of origin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Next, we asked to what degree genes encoded on chr21 could be affected by these cell type-specific regulatory landscapes. Indeed, it was easy to identify many chr21 genes displaying obvious differences in relative expression among cell types. For example, <i>APP</i> is relatively more highly expressed in fibroblasts, <i>U2AF1</i> more highly expressed in lymphoblastoids, <i>ETS2</i> more highly expressed in monocytes, and <i>DYRK1A</i> more highly expressed in T cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>). The IFN receptors on chr21 also showed some degree of cell type-specific expression (e.g. <i>IFNAR2</i> lowly expressed in fibroblasts, <i>IFNGR2</i> lowly expressed in T cells, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Furthermore, relative differences in cell type-specific expression is also evident for canonical ISGs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These observations led us to ask to what degree the IFN transcriptional response elicited by T21 is conserved across cell types. To address this, we compared the DEGs comprising the T21-induced <i>Interferon alpha</i> signature identified by IPA in each cell type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Remarkably, this exercise revealed a large degree of cell type-specificity, with most IFN-related genes being differentially expressed in only one cell type (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). In fact, the only common genes among all four signatures are three IFN-\u03b1-related genes encoded on chr21: <i>IFNAR1, IFNAR2</i>, and <i>MX1</i>. Expectedly, lymphoblastoids and T cells showed a greater degree of overlap than other pairwise comparisons. Overall, these results indicate that while T21 operates within, and is modulated by, cell type-specific regulatory landscapes, it nonetheless activates the IFN transcriptional response consistently by inducing different gene sets within this program. This is in stark contrast to the notion that T21 affects gene expression either stochastically or through large rearrangements of chromatin domains. In fact, Manhattan plots of the DEGs in monocytes and T cells derived from the same individuals not only confirm the absence of large domains of chromatin deregulation, but also highlight the high degree of cell type-specific changes caused by the trisomy (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>)."

                        "text": "The link between IFN signaling and T21 is not entirely unprecedented. More than 40 years ago, it was found that human T21 fibroblasts, but not those trisomic for chr13 or chr18, have increased sensitivity to IFN exposure and are more resistant to viral infection (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tan et al., 1974a</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">1974b</a>). In fact, somatic cell hybrid experiments showed that chr21 is sufficient to confer sensitivity to human IFN in mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">Slate et al., 1978</a>). Pioneering work by Maroun and colleagues using an early mouse model of DS carrying an extra copy of chr16 that harbors orthologues of many human chr21 genes, including the four IFN receptors, clearly implicated IFN as a contributor to the deleterious effects of the trisomy. For example, treatment of pregnant female mice with anti-IFN antibodies resulted in the\u00a0partial rescue of embryonic growth defects and embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maroun, 1995</a>). Furthermore, partial normalization of gene dosage for the IFN receptor subunits via gene knockout was shown to improve embryonic development and survival of T21 cortical neurons in vitro (<a href=\"#bib43\">Maroun et al., 2000</a>). More recently, a study found global disruption of IFN-related gene networks in the brains of the Ts1Cje mouse model of DS, which also carries triplication of the IFN receptor subunits (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ling et al., 2014</a>). However, deeper investigations of IFN signaling in human T21 cells and tissues are largely absent from the literature of the past 30 years, with a few exceptions, such as the description of IFN signaling as a contributor to periodontal disease in DS (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tanaka et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iwamoto et al., 2009</a>). Collectively, these reports and the genomics analyses reported here demonstrate that activation of the IFN pathway in T21 cells is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in diverse tissues, and that is relevant to human Down syndrome as well as the various mouse models of DS with triplication of IFN receptors."

                        "text": "Constitutive activation of IFN signaling could conceivably explain a large number of comorbidities associated with DS, such as the increased risk of transient myeloproliferative disorder, diverse leukemias, several autoimmune disorders (<a href=\"#bib55\">Richardson et al., 2011</a>), and perhaps even the lower rate of solid tumors (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zitvogel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hasle et al., 2016</a>). Importantly, several JAK inhibitors are either approved or being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of several conditions associated with DS \u2013albeit in the typical population\u2013, including myeloproliferative, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, as well as leukemia (<a href=\"#bib51\">Padron et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Spaner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tefferi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Quint\u00e1s-Cardama et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Keystone et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jabbari et al., 2015</a>). It should be noted, however, that the dose limiting toxicities of JAK inhibitors, like ruxolitinib, are anemia and thrombocytopenia (<a href=\"#bib47\">McKeage, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Plosker, 2015</a>). Therefore, rigorous clinical investigations will be required to define if there is a therapeutic window in which these drugs would benefit individuals with DS before the appearance of toxicity. Additional research will also be required to elucidate the interplay between hyperactive IFN signaling in DS with other important factors encoded on chr21 (e.g. <i>DYRK1A, APP</i>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Malinge et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wiseman et al., 2015</a>) or elsewhere in the genome, that have been involved in the\u00a0development of the specific comorbidities. For example, the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway has been implicated in the etiology of structural and cognitive defects in a mouse model of DS, including cerebellar atrophy (<a href=\"#bib14\">Das et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, IFN signaling has been shown to crosstalk with the SHH pathway, and cerebellar atrophy is also a hallmark of Type I Interferonopathies (<a href=\"#bib49\">Moisan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McGlasson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Crow and Manel, 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Increased JAK/STAT signaling has been postulated to contribute to some of the neurological features of DS (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2016</a>). Notably, it has been reported that therapeutic exposure to interferons can produce diverse types of neurological dysfunction, including depression, cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wichers et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grether et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">W\u00f6rle et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barlow et al., 1998</a>). Furthermore, a large number of neurological conditions have been linked to deregulated IFN signaling, most prominent among them the so called Type I Interferonopathies (<a href=\"#bib46\">McGlasson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Crow and Manel, 2015</a>). Therefore, we propose that constitutive activation of the IFN pathway in the central nervous system of individuals with DS is responsible for many of the neurological problems caused by the trisomy. In particular, IFN-mediated activation of microglia could lead to neurotoxicity by several mechanisms, including serotonin depletion, generation of reactive oxygen species, and excitatory toxicity, which could potentially be ameliorated with inhibitors of the IDO1 enzyme, a key ISG (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wichers and Maes, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wichers et al., 2005</a>). Although much research remains to be done, it is now possible to envision early intervention strategies to ameliorate the variable ill effects of T21 by using pharmacological inhibitors of the IFN pathway."

                                "text": "The library preparation strategy uses genomic DNA and two rounds of PCR in order to isolate the shRNA cassette and prepare a single strand of the hairpin for sequencing by means of an XhoI restriction digest in the stem loop region. This is critical as the hairpin secondary structures of shRNAs are not amenable to NGS and the TRC shRNAs do not have a long enough loop to allow PCR amplification of one shRNA arm in a single step. The first step in sequencing library preparation is to calculate how much genomic DNA must be used for PCR1 which isolates and amplifies the shRNA cassettes from genomic DNA using Phusion Polymerase. The oligonucleotides for PCR1 anneal to regions inside of the LTRs that are common to all clones in the library and should, therefore, amplify all shRNA cassettes with equal efficiency. Each reaction mixture for PCR1 consisted of 10\u2009\u03bcL 5X Phusion <i>HF</i> buffer, 1\u2009\u03bcL dNTPs (10\u2009mM each), 2.5\u2009\u03bcL pLKO Forward and Reverse primers (10\u2009\u03bcM), 1\u2009\u03bcL of 2 unit/\u03bcl Phusion Polymerase, 500 ng genomic DNA, and dH2O to 50\u2009\u03bcL. The cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 98\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, 15 to 25 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 70\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 72\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, and 1 cycle of 72\u00b0C for 7\u2009min. 5\u2009\u03bcL of each PCR1 were run on a 2% TAE agarose gel in order to visualize the expected band of 497 bp. It should be noted that the\u00a0optimal PCR1 cycle number must be empirically determined for each library and to limit cycle numbers to minimize the effects of amplification bias. The correct product of PCR1 is 497 bp; however, excessive cycle numbers can result in the appearance of a slower migrating band. This band represents an annealing event between two amplification products with different shRNA sequences. As the majority of the 497 bp amplicon is common to all products, denatured PCR products can anneal to one another when not out-competed by an excess of primer in later cycles. This aberrant product does not correctly anneal within the central shRNA-containing sequence, therefore disrupting the double-stranded XhoI site required for the subsequent restriction digestion. Carefully determining the appropriate number of cycles prevents the appearance of this undesired product. After establishing an\u00a0optimal cycle number, we performed 12 identical PCR1 reactions in order to amplify sufficient amounts of genomic DNA and pooled them all prior to cleanup with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit."

Digest reactions consisted of 3.5\u2009\u03bcL 10X FD buffer, 1\u2009\u03bcL of 20,000 units/mL XhoI, 1\u2009\u03bcg of DNA and dH2O to 35\u2009\u03bcL. Heat inactivation of XhoI is not recommended, as the high temperatures result in reappearance of the spurious annealing products mentioned above, leading to a disruption of the XhoI overhang required for ligation. For the TRC1 and TRC1.5 libraries, there are two XhoI sites within the product of PCR1, resulting in fragments of 271, 43 and 183 bp. In order to purify the desired fragment, the entire digest was run on a 2% TAE agarose gel and purified the 271 bp fragment using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Once the band was excised, three volumes of buffer QG were added and the mixture heated at 30\u00b0C to dissolve the agarose. Lower melting temperatures are recommended so as not to denature the complementary double-stranded shRNA cassettes, which may not reanneal to their cognate strand. After the agarose was dissolved, one volume of isopropanol was added and protocol resumed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions including the optional addition of NaOAc."

The mixture was heated to 94\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and gradually cooled to ensure proper annealing. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were removed from annealed oligonucleotides using Illustra MicroSpin G-25 columns. The sense (S1-S4) oligonucleotides are 5\u2019-phosphorylated and the antisense oligonucleotides (AS1-AS4) each contain a single phosphorothioate bond at the 3\u2019 end to stabilize them and are designed to prevent the reformation of a functional XhoI site. The barcodes within these linkers are used for multiplexing and their length ensures they are compatible with the Illumina HiSeq 2000. Shorter barcode sequences may be compatible with other sequencing platforms. The selected barcoded linkers were added to ligation reactions with 100 ng of each purified 271 bp XhoI fragment, 3.5\u2009\u03bcL 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer, 4\u2009\u03bcL of 1\u2009\u03bcM barcoded linker, 1\u2009\u03bcL T4 DNA ligase and dH<sub>2</sub>O to 35\u2009\u03bcL.

We utilized a multiplexing strategy consisting of four different barcodes with each nucleotide represented at each position of the barcode, allowing us to sequence four samples in each lane on a HiSeq 2000 Illumina instrument. To accomplish this, each sample was quantified and mixed together at a final concentration of 10 ng/\u03bcL and using Illumina-specific oligonucleotides and qPCR, we determined the cluster formation efficiency (i.e. effective concentration) of our library to be slightly greater than that of a known library. Accordingly, we loaded the flow cell at 5 pM and included a 10% \u03a6X-174 spike-in, which aids in quality control of cluster formation and sequencing on the Illumina platform. Cluster formation efficiency and the concentration of library to be loaded on the flow cell needs to be determined empirically for each library preparation. These loading conditions yielded cluster densities between 733,000 clusters/mm<sup>2</sup> and 802,000 clusters/mm<sup>2</sup> and between 203 and 222 million reads per lane."

The study raises the interesting possibility of using ruxolitinib to treat DS phenotypes. The paper also convincingly supports the conclusions of Do et al. (2015) that changes in gene expression in cells with trisomy 21 occur throughout the genome and are not confined to specific domains. The paper was viewed enthusiastically by a member of the BRE and two additional referees. The BRE commented, 'These findings have important implications for understanding the basic nature of, and individual variation in, the diverse phenotypes of people with Down's syndrome'. One referee noted, 'Overall the paper is an interesting and significant study that provides important new insights into the differences in gene expression between D21 and T21 cells'. The second referee commented, 'In principle, the findings are tremendously exciting and present a novel view of the pathology associated with trisomy 21.'"

There may be a therapeutic index in which the drug will have a therapeutic benefit in DS individuals and not be toxic, but there may not be one.

Similar to our initial work using cell lines, we made sure to obtain samples from individuals of both genders, different ages, and different genetic backgrounds. We then processed the blood samples to purify monocytes, T cells, and B cells. We discarded the possibility of simply looking at peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) because there is ample evidence in the literature that individuals with trisomy 21 display changes in the numbers of various blood cell types, which could confound the interpretation of any gene expression changes observed as driven by cell type abundance rather than actual gene regulation. Hence, we opted to analyze more defined cell populations within the hematopoietic system. Due to the limited volume of blood available, we maximized our chances to detect consistent gene expression changes caused by trisomy 21 by performing a combination of assays to analyze both RNA and protein expression. Given the high sensitivity of transcriptome analyses via next-generation sequencing, we decided to analyze monocytes and T cells with RNA-seq. B cell populations were used for Western blot and flow cytometry assays. The RNA-seq experiments were very successful, producing high quality data, and demonstrated unequivocally that IFN signaling is constitutively activated in both monocytes and T cells. As previously observed in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, the gene expression signature associated with trisomy 21 has clear signs of activation of the interferon transcriptional response. Very interestingly, in addition to the expected upregulation of the IFN receptors and many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), transcriptome analysis of blood cell types revealed another hallmark of IFN hyperactivation that was not obvious in the analysis of in vitro cell cultures: strong downregulation of the translation machinery. It is well established that a key consequence of the IFN response is to prevent synthesis of viral proteins (Walsh et al. 2013; Gupta et al. 2012; Ivashkiv &amp; Donlin 2014). However, the mechanisms by which IFN signaling affects translation are not well understood. RNA-seq analysis of monocytes and T cells revealed downregulation of dozens of translation initiation and elongation factors, as well as ribosomal proteins in both the small and large ribosome subunits. The importance of this result cannot be overstated, as repression of protein synthesis in tissues from individuals with Down syndrome could contribute to many of the ill effects of trisomy 21. We decided that this important result should occupy a central place in the manuscript, and hence created a new main figure with two supplements to clearly explain these results (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">2</a> in the revised manuscript). Unfortunately, our efforts using western blot for analysis of B cells were not successful, due mostly to the limited amount of protein obtained, but we did manage to measure surface expression of four IFN receptors -three encoded on chr21 (IFNAR1, IFNGR2, IL10RB) and one not encoded on chr21 (IFNGR1)- using flow cytometry for all 17 samples. Expectedly, these experiments revealed a modest but reproducible increase in the expression of the three IFNRs encoded on chr21 (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As described below, our western blot efforts produced very clear results when employing cell lines, which could be grown in large amounts."

As suggested by Reviewers, we employed conditions of both basal and stimulated IFN signaling. These efforts resulted in the inclusion of 59 western blot panels analyzing 90 different protein extracts in the revised manuscript. Analysis of basal protein expression in 12 fibroblast cell lines and 6 lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated that the IFN receptors are indeed upregulated at the protein level, along with increased levels of phospho-STAT1 and several ISGs, with the expected inter-individual variation observed during the transcriptome analysis (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> for basal expression in fibroblasts and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> for basal expression in lymphoblastoids). Furthermore, we analyzed protein lysates from the 12 fibroblast cell lines using SOMAscan technology, which employs DNA aptamers to monitor protein abundance (Hathout et al. 2015). This effort confirmed induction of many interferon-related genes at the protein level (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Additionally, we performed a battery of dose-response experiments with three IFN ligands (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3) on three different pairs of euploid/trisomy 21 fibroblast cell lines. This effort clearly demonstrated that the induced expression of the ISGs tested (MX1, IDO1 and ISG15) is also greater in trisomy 21 cells at the protein level, with signs of inter-individual variation for specific genes, as predicted by the RNA-seq experiments. This comprehensive analysis of protein expression is shown in a new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>."

We chose to use the Dp16 strain, which carries triplication of only genes found on human chr21. The Ts65DN model proposed by the reviewers has triplication of many genes not on chr21. Of note, the chromosome fragment triplicated in the Dp16 strain contains the four IFN receptors found on human chr21 (Li et al. 2007). RNA-seq analysis of LSK (Lineage negative, Sca1 positive, c-Kit positive) cells confirmed that the IFN receptors are overexpressed in Dp16 mice relative to disomic littermates, as well as several canonical ISGs.

The revised manuscript addresses this comment in several ways. First, we have expanded the description of the screen and the interpretation of the results in the Results section. Second, we performed additional experiments to investigate in more detail the effects of JAK inhibition. Third, we displayed the results in a more accessible fashion. The revised Figure (now <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), displays the results of analyzing two pairs of euploid/trisomic fibroblasts during a dose-response of Ruxolitinib. Expectedly, pharmacological JAK inhibition leads to decreased phospho-STAT levels (which is higher in the T21 cell lines) and decreased expression of the IFN-stimulated gene MX1. Strikingly, in the absence of JAK inhibition, there is a significant decrease in the number of trisomy 21 cells in the absence of any treatment. Addition of increasing doses of ruxolitinib enhances the number of viable trisomic cells while decreasing the number of their viable disomic counterparts. Consequently, the relative number of trisomic versus disomic cells increases with the dose of Ruxolitinib. This would explain why, over the course of the two weeks of shRNA screening, shRNAs targeting JAK1 (and TYK2) would show a relative enrichment in trisomy 21 cells."

Increased levels of induced phospho-STAT1 in trisomy 21 cells are evident for some fibroblast pairs in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. Of note, all three IFN ligands consistently induced STAT1 phosphorylation (pSTAT1) both in D21 and T21 cells, but the levels of pSTAT1 did not correlate precisely with the expression levels of the various ISGs. For example, the obviously different levels of ISG15 upon treatment with the three ligands do not correlate with dissimilar levels of pSTAT1 (see cell line pair 2 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). This suggests that STAT1 phosphorylation is not a robust predictor of ISG expression, which is ultimately defined by the orchestrated action of multiple IFN-activated transcription factors. Finally, we have now included western blots showing dose-dependent repression of pSTAT1 signaling and MX1 expression in response to ruxolitinib treatment for two T21-D21 cell line pairs.
