Here we report the 5.9 \u00c5 structure of HIV-1 TAR in complex with HIV-1 Tat and human AFF4, CDK9, and CycT1. The TAR central loop contacts the CycT1 Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM) and the second Tat Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) shows that AFF4 helix 2 is stabilized in the TAR complex despite not touching the RNA, explaining how it enhances TAR binding to the SEC 50-fold. RNA SHAPE and SAXS data were used to help model the extended (Tat Arginine-Rich Motif) ARM, which enters the TAR major groove between the bulge and the central loop. The structure and functional assays collectively support an integrative structure and a bipartite binding model, wherein the TAR central loop engages the CycT1 TRM and compact core of Tat, while the TAR major groove interacts with the extended Tat ARM."

Here we report the 5.9 \u00c5 structure of HIV-1 TAR in complex with HIV-1 Tat and human AFF4, CDK9, and CycT1. The TAR central loop contacts the CycT1 Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM) and the second Tat Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) shows that AFF4 helix 2 is stabilized in the TAR complex despite not touching the RNA, explaining how it enhances TAR binding to the SEC 50-fold. RNA SHAPE and SAXS data were used to help model the extended (Tat Arginine-Rich Motif) ARM, which enters the TAR major groove between the bulge and the central loop. The structure and functional assays collectively support an integrative structure and a bipartite binding model, wherein the TAR central loop engages the CycT1 TRM and compact core of Tat, while the TAR major groove interacts with the extended Tat ARM."

Even under intensive antiretroviral therapy, resting T cells that harbor latent provirus integrated into their genome survive (<a href=\"#bib5\">Archin et al., 2014</a>). The pool of latent virus is the primary obstacle to eradicating HIV, and thus the mechanisms by which latency is regulated are of paramount interest. The molecular mechanisms regulating HIV-1 transcription have been studied for three decades, yet renewed interest in eradicating HIV-1 infection has lent new urgency to obtaining a more complete understanding."

Transcription of the HIV-1 proviral DNA is initiated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding to the HIV promoter, but stalls after a 30\u201350 nucleotide transcript containing the trans-activation response region (TAR) is formed. Release of the stalled Pol II is dependent on the recruitment of the host super elongation complex (SEC) (<a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sobhian et al., 2010</a>) to the nascent TAR by HIV-1 trans-activator protein (Tat), a central driver of proviral transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fisher et al., 1986</a>)."

P-TEFb facilitates promoter escape by phosphorylating two negative elongation factors (DSIF and NELF) as well as the C-terminal domain of Pol II. Overexpression of full-length AFF1, but not a fragment that only binds to P-TEFb, strongly increases Tat transactivation of transcription from the HIV promoter (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2014</a>), indicating that productive HIV transcription requires the whole SEC."

HIV-1 Tat binds to CycT1 in an extended conformation adjacent to AFF4, interacting with residues in the cleft between the two cyclin-fold domains of CycT1, the Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM), and AFF4 helix \u03b12 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tahirov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gu et al., 2014</a>). Segments from AFF4, Tat, and CycT1 TRM that are flexible in isolation come together to form a more stable structure with a positively charged surface (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>). Biochemical experiments have shown that both Tat and CycT1 make critical and direct contributions to TAR binding (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calnan et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Richter et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Garber et al., 1998</a>). In the presence of AFF4, TAR affinity to P-TEFb increases sharply (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>). The exact mechanism for the increase in affinity has been unclear, in part due to the lack of a structure of the SEC complex with HIV-1 TAR. To fill the gap in structural understanding, we determined the structure of TAR bound to Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb. We validated our low resolution crystal structure of the TAR complex with data from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX), selective 2\u2019-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE), binding assays, and previously published biochemical data."

Although the Tat ARM is not visible in the electron density maps, its predicted location based on the Tat core position is close to the TAR bulge region in the crystal structure. This constraint, together with biophysical data, were used to develop an integrative model of the ARM, showing it bound through the length of the TAR major groove. AFF4 has no direct contacts with bound TAR in our crystal structure. Instead AFF4 is interacting with the CycT1 TRM and the second Tat Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordination loop. Hence, its stimulating activity on TAR binding is likely due to stabilization of the TAR interaction surface of Tat:P-TEFb by AFF4. Our results provide the first structural model, albeit at low resolution, of a critical regulator of HIV-1 latency, the Tat:SEC:TAR complex."

The HDX rate of a protein region depends on its flexibility, the amount of hydrogen bonding with backbone amides, and solvent accessibility (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hoofnagle et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Percy et al., 2012</a>). We compared absolute deuteron incorporation into different segments of Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb in the absence (apo complex) and in the presence of saturating amounts of HIV-1 TAR (TAR complex) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The observed peptic peptides of the apo complex covered more than 80% of the Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). Our HDX data of the apo complex in solution are in good agreement with the crystal structure of Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gu et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The C-terminal segment (residues 59-67) of the synthetic AFF4 peptide (32\u201367) shows 70% deuteration after 10\u2009s and almost complete deuteration within 3\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although the crystal structure indicates an\u00a0\u03b1-helix in this region, high B-factors indicate high mobility and partial unfolding of this terminal helix in solution, in agreement with the high deuteration levels observed in the HDX experiment. The Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM; residues 246 to 262 in CycT1, (<a href=\"#bib13\">Das et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Garber et al., 1998</a>) also showed almost complete deuteration within 10\u00a0s in the apo complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which is consistent with multiple conformations for the TRM in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>)."

These two segments are adjacent to each other in the crystal structure of Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb, consistent with their mutual cooperation in forming the TAR binding site. In contrast to CycT1 and AFF4, Tat exhibited a lesser degree of protection, localized to the N-terminal segment (residues 1-33) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, light blue segments). Surprisingly, the Tat ARM did not show any significant protection in HDX after TAR binding despite its well-established role in TAR binding (<a href=\"#bib61\">Weeks and Crothers, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Calnan et al., 1991</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Experiments were done using the 344 nt-long 5\u2019 end of the HIV genome (<a href=\"#bib23\">Heng et al., 2012</a>) in the presence and absence of the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb complex. Upon protein complex binding, the major SHAPE changes cluster in the 5\u2019 TAR region of the 5\u2019UTR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) with significant SHAPE changes observed around the bulge region at A17, the bulge region A22-U25, as well as the loop region C30-A35. As expected, no significant reactivity changes were observed in the regions 3\u2019 to TAR. The SHAPE reactivity for some nucleotides in bulge A22-U25 and loop C30-A35 is extremely high (above 3) in the absence of Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb and remains high even after Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb binding. TAR binding reduces SHAPE reactivity by 0.3-0.4 and 0.2-1.2 for nucleotides in the bulge and loop region, respectively. The pattern of changes in SHAPE reactivity for TAR after binding the SEC is significantly different from changes observed after TAR binding to a Tat peptide covering the ARM region (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kenyon\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>). This difference is expected because of additional contacts between CycT1 and TAR, which lead to higher affinity and more specific interactions between TAR and the SEC (<a href=\"#bib45\">Richter et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2000</a>) compared to interactions between TAR and a small arginine-rich peptide from Tat. Because reduction in SHAPE activity correlates with reduced flexibility of the respective RNA regions (<a href=\"#bib38\">McGinnis et al., 2012</a>), the results for the TAR-SEC complex indicate a stabilization of the bulge and loop structure through direct contacts between TAR and the SEC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

The backbone phosphates of nucleotides 30\u201332 contact basic residues in the CycT TRM region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This orientation places the N-terminus of the Tat ARM (Arg49) at the widest point in the TAR major groove, which is 13\u2009\u00c5 wide between nucleobases C24 and G34. However, there is not interpretable electron density present for residues in the Tat ARM region at the limited resolution of this crystal structure. This seems consistent with the lack of protection of this region seen in the HDX experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), but it is important not to overinterpret this observation given the limitations of the 5.9\u2009\u00c5 map."

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we explored the effect of mutations in the surface-exposed side of AFF4 helix \u03b12 on TAR binding. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with labeled TAR and Tat:P-TEFb complex in the presence of excess WT or mutant AFF4 fragment (residues 2-73) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The single site mutants AFF4 E61A and AFF4 K63A show a three-fold and two-fold reduction in TAR binding, respectively, while the effect of the other mutations is negligible. The gel shift in the absence of AFF4 shows a 50-fold increased K<sub>d</sub> for TAR binding by Tat:P-TEFb (K<sub>d</sub> = 19 nM) compared to the gelshift in the presence of WT AFF4 (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.26 nM). The small effect of surface mutations in AFF4 helix \u03b12 on TAR binding indicates that instead of direct interactions with TAR structural stabilization of the combined interface formed collectively by Cyc T1:Tat:AFF4 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>) is the major role of AFF4 \u03b12."

These assays were performed with the AFF1 scaffold protein, because Tat has a stronger effect on HIV transcription with AFF1 than with AFF4 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lu et al., 2015</a>). In addition, the assay used Tat(C22G), a Tat mutant that lacks an important Cys-Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination site required for wild-type Tat activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Garber et al., 1998</a>). It is thus highly sensitive to the AFF-mediated increase in affinity for P-TEFb (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). While wild-type AFF1 strongly supported the activation of HIV-1 LTR by Tat(C22G), all mutants displayed decreased activity, with 4-6-fold decreases observed when Glu65 (AFF4 Asp60), Glu66 (AFF4 Glu61), and Val67 (AFF4 Met62) were either singly or doubly mutated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

Three mutants with strongly reduced transactivation activity include G<sub>21</sub>-C<sub>41</sub>\u2192 AU, A<sub>22</sub>-U<sub>40</sub>\u2192 UA, and U<sub>23</sub>\u2192C, which are located just below and in the TAR bulge. To further evaluate AFF4 function in TAR binding we determined binding affinities for WT-TAR and TAR-mutants to Tat:P-TEFb with or without AFF4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). In the absence of AFF4, all three TAR-mutants showed strongly reduced binding affinity compared to the WT TAR.

The potent rescue of bulge mutants by addition of AFF4 is consistent with the placement of the bulge distal to the Tat zinc-binding loops. The picture that emerges is of a bipartite mode of TAR binding to the SEC. Nucleobases C29-G34 interact directly with the well-ordered Tat-SEC epitope consisting of the Tat zinc-binding loops and the adjacent N-terminal portion of the CycT1 TRM. This well-ordered region is the part that is scaffolded by AFF4.

Despite the resolution, the maps are adequate to rule out alternative orientations of TAR. We applied a battery of biophysical studies to support and validate the low-resolution crystal structure. These data elucidate important dynamical changes, especially in AFF4, that are not evident from the crystal structure alone. The Tat ARM region was missing in the crystal structure. The Tat ARM, as well as the partially disordered CycT1 TRM segment, were modeled as loop ensembles inserted into the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In agreement with previous biochemical data (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wei et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Garber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Richter et al., 2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2002b</a>), HIV-1 TAR binds with the loop region interacting with CycT1-TRM and the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating core region of Tat, while the TAR bulge is positioned close to the expected location of Tat ARM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). Results from HDX experiments for the ARM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) indicate a high flexibility for the Tat ARM even after binding to TAR. Indeed, the Tat peptide 38-57 exchanged 60% of its protons within 10\u2009s, whether TAR was bound or not. This region of Tat is visualized in the crystal structure through residue 49, and the amides are protected by helical hydrogen bonds through residue 45. Thus 37% of the peptide is protected from exchange, closely matching the 40% that is involved in helical amid hydrogen bonding in the crystal structure. This supports that the ARM main-chain is extended and exposed when bound to TAR."

In contrast, the TAR central loop binds to a more structured protein surface, composed of the CycT1 TRM and the second Tat Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion coordinating loop, Tat residues 24-29. Although AFF4 has no direct interactions with TAR, residues in helix \u03b12 bolster Tat helix \u03b12 and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordinating loop, and the CycT1 TRM. This network of AFF4 interactions, which stabilizes CycT1 and Tat conformations in the TAR interacting region, is the likely cause for the 50-fold increased binding affinity of Tat:P-TEFb for TAR in the presence of AFF4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>)."

This rescue effect is attributed to the supporting and stabilizing role of AFF4 on the TAR interacting surface composed of CycT1 TRM and Tat loop, 24-29. Our structural and binding studies show that TAR loop interactions with the CycT1-Tat core interface play a critical role for Tar binding and in the presence of AFF4 can even compensate for reduced binding between Tat ARM and TAR bulge mutants. The crystal structure is in good agreement with the results of our SHAPE experiments with HIV-1 5\u2019UTR with or without Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb, as SHAPE-protected nucleotides C30, G32, G33, and G34, shown in blue in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, are all in close contact with CycT1 TRM or Tat in the crystal structure."

In that structure, the Tat activation domain, which directs the incorporation of Tat into the SEC is disordered, and AFF1/4 is not present. The Tat ARM is found in a helical structure bound to the cyclin box and interacting with the EIAV TAR in the major groove and loop region. This complex structure is difficult to reconcile with the HDX data for the Tat ARM and CycT TRM, as well as with the critical role of human CycT1 residues in the TRM for TAR binding (<a href=\"#bib20\">Garber et al., 1998</a>).

The D<sub>max</sub> was determined after optimizing the <i>P</i>(r) function using the program SC\u00c5TTER, following recommended procedures. The initial <i>P</i>(r) function was calculated with the default D<sub>max</sub> of 96\u2009<b>\u00c5</b>. After removing the very low resolution data in the Guinier region, D<sub>max</sub> was increased until the <i>P</i>(r) function showed no undulations and was positive for all r-values."

Integrative modeling was based on the atomic structure of the Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb complex (PDB ID 4OGR) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>), an atomic structure of TAR (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2010</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib50\">2013</a>)\u00a0(PDB ID 1ARJ and 2KX5), a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profile of the complex, difference HDX data for the apo and TAR complexes, the SHAPE data describing the interactions between the HIV-1 5\u2019UTR and the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb complex, and previously published biochemical data identifying key residues for the recognition of TAR, including a cross-link between TAR U31 and CycT1 252-261 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Garber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Richter et al., 2002b</a>). Specifically, we followed an integrative docking protocol (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2012</a>), using the rigid-body docking program PatchDock (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005</a>). We selected only those resulting models whose FoXS computed SAXS profile (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2013</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib49\">2010</a>) matched the experimental profile with \u03c7 &lt; 1.5, followed by hierarchical clustering based on the pairwise all-atom RMSD values. Next, we filtered the remaining representative models further based on the HDX data, requiring that the Solvent Accessible Solvent Area (SASA) of AFF4 residues 57 to 67 was reduced by at least a 10% upon TAR binding. However, in retrospect, this filtering criterion was too strict, resulting in elimination of the correct model of the Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb:TAR complex. The crystal structure revealed that changes in the HDX rates of the AFF4 helical region are in fact caused by a conformational change triggered by binding of TAR rather than direct binding of TAR. The example illustrates the need for a conservative interpretation of experimental data used for structural modeling. It is more prudent to err on the side of caution, and apply spatial restraints that are broader than narrower, resulting in a less precise ensemble of models that still contains the correct structure as opposed to a more precise ensemble that does not contain the correct structure."

Previous studies have shown a range of phenotypic effects of point mutations in the UCU bulge and apical loop, as well as transversions base pairs in the TAR stem-loop structure.

Point mutations of N-terminal residues on AFF4 that are presumed to be directly involved in TAR binding only elicited a small reduction (&gt;4-fold) in SEC binding to TAR. It is therefore somewhat unclear the extent to which direct AFF4-TAR interactions contribute to the robust strengthening of Tat:P-TEFb binding to TAR. The Results section suggests that the role of direct contacts is secondary to a scaffolding role, but the discussion seems to place a larger importance on the complex formation role of helix \u03b12 of AFF1/4 than the data suggest. Moreover, the authors should at least mention alternative possible explanations, including that they may not have mutated the key contact residues and/or that AFF1/4 may not, in fact, contact TAR directly (i.e., that the modest mutational effects reflect indirect effects)."

The spirit of the hybrid modeling is very much akin to NMR structure determination, where one never describes the resolution, but rather the RMSD of independent trials. Along these lines, it might be helpful to show superpositions of the resulting models where the alignment is done on only part of the structure (say CycT1:Cdk9), showing the variance of the other regions (as is done for two-domain protein NMR structures for example).

Improved data and model qualities would lend more confidence into the insights gleaned from this complex.\" We of course realize the difficulties in obtaining well-diffracting crystals, but we remain concerned about some of the properties of the diffraction data and associated atomic model. To this end, we examined the PDB validation report that the authors kindly provided. First, according to the report, the geometry is not \"good\" contrary to what is stated in the Results section of the manuscript. We realize that it is difficult to build a model with good geometry at such low resolution, so this may explain the poor geometry. Moreover, there are some curious abnormalities, for example, the large differences between observed and ideal C=O bond lengths. It is actually extremely important that a model refined against low-resolution data has perfect geometry since the information content of the diffraction data is so low. The authors are incorrect to state that poor geometry at low resolution \"is the accepted wisdom in protein crystallography\"."

The presence of a substantial twin fraction makes the interpretation of difference maps notoriously difficult due to the inherent introduction of noise by twinning. Moreover, models derived from twinned diffraction data are much more prone to potential model bias than for data without twinning. In relation to this issue, the absence of electron density does not necessarily imply that the particular part of the complex is \"flexible\", but it may be a consequence of twinning. Thus, the conclusions drawn from this structure for the position and conformation of TAR and the Tat ARM must be viewed with great caution."

Previous studies have shown a range of phenotypic effects of point mutations in the UCU bulge and apical loop, as well as transversions base pairs in the TAR stem-loop structure. It would greatly strengthen the argument for direct interactions between AFF1/4 and TAR RNA if mutations in these regions could be shown to selectively limit AFF4 complex binding.

It is therefore somewhat unclear the extent to which direct AFF4-TAR interactions contribute to the robust strengthening of Tat:P-TEFb binding to TAR. The Results section suggests that the role of direct contacts is secondary to a scaffolding role, but the discussion seems to place a larger importance on the complex formation role of helix \u03b12 of AFF1/4 than the data suggest.

We currently don\u2019t know why WT Tat is far less sensitive in this assay. It is possible that in all the in vivo Tat-transactivation assays we have performed so far, it always involved the introduction of additional AFF1/4 into the cells or knocking down but not completely depleting AFF1/4 from the system. These situations may have made WT Tat, which is incredibly powerful, less sensitive to the stimulatory effect of AFF4 compared to that detected under the highly reductionist gel-shift conditions. We have recently performed a TAR pulldown assay looking for proteins that bind to TAR under Tat (+) and (-) conditions and saw significantly more Tat-mediated loading of the SEC subunits when HeLa nuclear extract (NE) was incubated with TAR RNA. However, when NE prepared from the AFF4-KD cells (~80% KD efficiency) was used in the assay, there was no obvious difference in loading of the rest of the SEC components to TAR. This illustrates that the stimulatory effect of AFF4 is not so easy to detect when analyzed under more complicated situations where there are still some leftover AFF1/4 in the cells."

Moreover, the photocross-linking and protein footprinting studies31 show that HIV-1 TAR RNA loop interacts with cyclin T1 residues 252\u2013260, which is far from the EIAV TAR RNA docking site. These differences make it difficult to model HIV-1 TAR binding to the Tat\u00b7P-TEFb complex on the basis of the structure of the EIAV complex.\u201d"
