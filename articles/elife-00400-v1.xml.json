The functional capability of the cerebellum hinges on whether individual granule cells receive mossy fiber inputs from multiple precerebellar nuclei or are instead unimodal; this distinction is unresolved. Using cell-type-specific projection mapping with synaptic resolution, we observed the convergence of separate sensory (upper body proprioceptive) and basilar pontine pathways onto individual granule cells and mapped this convergence across cerebellar cortex. These findings inform the long-standing debate about the multimodality of mammalian granule cells and substantiate their associative capacity predicted in the Marr-Albus theory of cerebellar function. We also provide evidence that the convergent basilar pontine pathways carry corollary discharges from upper body motor cortical areas. Such merging of related corollary and sensory streams is a critical component of circuit models of predictive motor control."

The functional capability of the cerebellum hinges on whether individual granule cells receive mossy fiber inputs from multiple precerebellar nuclei or are instead unimodal; this distinction is unresolved. Using cell-type-specific projection mapping with synaptic resolution, we observed the convergence of separate sensory (upper body proprioceptive) and basilar pontine pathways onto individual granule cells and mapped this convergence across cerebellar cortex. These findings inform the long-standing debate about the multimodality of mammalian granule cells and substantiate their associative capacity predicted in the Marr-Albus theory of cerebellar function. We also provide evidence that the convergent basilar pontine pathways carry corollary discharges from upper body motor cortical areas. Such merging of related corollary and sensory streams is a critical component of circuit models of predictive motor control."

Granule cells are simple neurons, having on average only four dendrites, each of which receives a single, large, excitatory mossy fiber input (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gray, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eccles et al., 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jakab and Hamori, 1988</a>). Mossy fibers project widely in the cerebellar cortex from a disparate set of sensory and motor-related relay structures throughout the brainstem and spinal cord. Knowing whether multiple types of mossy fibers synapse onto the same granule cell is key to understanding the types of operations they perform (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arenz et al., 2009</a>). For example, a granule cell receiving all synaptic inputs from the same mossy fiber source (i.e., \u2018unimodal\u2019) may serve to filter noise by requiring the summation of inputs in order to fire action potentials (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jorntell and Ekerot, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bengtsson and Jorntell, 2009</a>). A multimodal arrangement, in which an individual granule cell mixes inputs from different mossy fiber origins (e.g., one sensory and one motor-related precerebellar nucleus), enables more complex functions. Such mixing of mossy fiber inputs was a critical aspect of the expansion recoding of cerebellar afference performed by granule cells in the influential Marr-Albus theory of cerebellar function (<a href=\"#bib43\">Marr, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Blomfield and Marr, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Albus, 1971</a>).

Recently, mammalian granule cell input structure has been tested by in vivo receptive field mapping studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jorntell and Ekerot, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arenz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bengtsson and Jorntell, 2009</a>).

This lack of evidence for multimodality has led to a diminution of models of granule cell function from a recoder to a noise filter (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2008</a>). However, these electrophysiological studies did not systematically examine granule cells across cerebellar cortex, nor did they test the most numerous mossy fiber inputs, those originating from the basilar pontine nucleus (BPN) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Brodal and Bjaalie, 1992</a>)."

Combining genetics, viral tracing, and large scale confocal microscopy allowed us to take advantage of the unique mossy fiber/granule cell structure to generate synapse-resolution maps of ECN and BPN projections across the entire cerebellar cortex. We found that ECN and BPN inputs synapse onto the same granule cells, with a reproducible, region-specific, cerebellar topography. For a cerebellar area receiving upper body proprioceptive information, we show that the BPN input receives cortical afferents from an area associated with upper body motor control.

The genetic component of the strategy was used to distinguish the ECN and BPN from other nearby precerebellar sources, and the viral component was used to distinguish them from each other. First we searched for genes exhibiting regional selectivity for both the ECN and the BPN. Literature and Allen Institute Anatomic Gene Expression Atlas database searches produced candidates fitting this expression profile (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hisano et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ng et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2010</a>). The <i>solute carrier family 17 (sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter), member 7</i> (<i>Slc17a7)</i> gene was selected and a knock-in mouse, <i>Slc17a7-IRES-Cre</i>, expressing Cre under the control of this locus was generated. The Cre-dependent reporter expression in this mouse recapitulates the selective expression pattern of the <i>Slc17a7</i> locus as reported in the Allen Institute Anatomic Gene Expression Atlas database (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taking advantage of selective Cre expression and the approximate 4-mm separation between the ECN and the BPN, we stereotaxically injected different Cre-dependent reporter viruses into each nucleus of the <i>Slc17a7-IRES-Cre</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This strategy resulted in selective and distinguishable labeling of the ECN and the BPN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Axons of ECN and BPN were intensely labeled (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, white arrowheads) and could be identified at their terminations in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>)."

As has been previously reported, at a gross level the ECN and BPN target mostly non-overlapping regions of the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akintunde and Eisenman, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Serapide et al., 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2001</a>). ECN inputs primarily project to the ipsilateral cerebellar vermis and BPN inputs bilaterally terminate in the cerebellar hemispheres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). However, strong viral-reporter expression and high-resolution, large-area confocal microscopy revealed many areas of the cerebellum where ECN and BPN axons co-terminate. Such areas include the vermis, lateral vermis, simple lobule, paraflocculus, Crus1, Crus2, paramedian lobule, and copula of the pyramis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Within these areas, ECN and BPN axons terminate within very close proximity (&lt;50 \u00b5m), well within the length of the dendritic arbors of granule cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, inset). Therefore, various cerebellar microcircuits potentially process both proprioceptive and pontine information."

A mossy fiber terminal synapses with granule cell dendrites within a glomerulus (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arenz et al., 2009</a>). Inside a glomerulus, the claw-footed dendrites of granule cells wrap around and make multiple synaptic contacts with the single, large, mossy fiber termination. This synaptic arrangement allows us to determine, with light microscopy, whether ECN and BPN mossy fibers converge onto single granule cells. Anatomical assessment of convergence requires simultaneous and separate labeling of granule cell morphology and of the two types of mossy fibers. The genetic/viral approach described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> accomplishes the labeling of the ECN and BPN mossy fibers. However, cell density and the spatial expanse of the cerebellum precluded a similar approach for revealing the morphology of individual granule cells throughout the cerebellum. Alternatively, we screened enhancer-trap mouse lines for an expression pattern where granule cells are labeled in a sparse, \u2018Golgi stain-like\u2019 fashion. This screen identified one mouse line, <i>TCGO</i>, which expresses <i>tetracycline transactivator</i> and <i>mCitrine</i> in a subset of granule cells. While the density of labeled cells is consistent across <i>TCGO</i> animals, we lack evidence to distinguish if the labeling is stochastic or marks a particular class of granule cells. Strong expression of the <i>mCitrine</i> reporter, a low density of marked cells, and labeling spanning all cerebellar cortical regions allowed manual segmentation of the dendritic morphology of neighboring granule cells over the entire expanse of the cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Simultaneous labeling of the two types of mossy fibers and the granule cells was accomplished by injecting Cre-dependent viruses into both the ipsilateral ECN and the contralateral BPN of <i>Slc17a7-IRES-Cre; TCGO</i> bitransgenic animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

Some cerebellar areas, such as medial vermis, were composed mostly of <i>E and E</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> granule cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In some cases the lack of EB cells was due to the scarcity of BPN inputs to the region (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>), but in other regions the number of granule cells receiving BPN inputs (<i>B</i>, <i>B</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>) was roughly equivalent to the number receiving ECN inputs (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a><sub>cb1</sub>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a><sub>cb1</sub>). Therefore, vermal areas harbor proprioceptive pathways which are segregated from BPN inputs at the cellular level; this segregation would not be evident with traditional neuro-anatomical techniques. Other areas <i>intermingle all three granule cell types</i>, this category includes lateral vermis, simple lobule, copula of the pyramis and Crus1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The densities of granule cell type varied in these areas along the dorsal-ventral, and medial-lateral axes. Thus, these areas deliver multiple types of information to the overlying Purkinje cells and the combinations of these types can vary locally. Lastly, some cerebellar areas are <i>dominated by EB granule cells</i>. These areas include paramedian lobule, the paraflocculus, and Crus2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These areas are \u2018hotspots\u2019 for the intersection of ECN and BPN pathways, where the majority of proprioceptive granule cells also receive BPN inputs. Consequently, many parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells in these areas carry both ECN and BPN information.

                                "text": "ECN inputs carry forelimb and upper body proprioceptive information to cerebellar granule cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Campbell et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akintunde and Eisenman, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Quy et al., 2011</a>). We tested if the BPN inputs that converge with ECN signals are capable of delivering corollary discharges relating to similar regions of the body. To demonstrate the cortical nature of pontine inputs, we combined anterograde labeling from forelimb/upper body primary motor cortex (M1) and retrograde labeling of BPN neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We focused on the paramedian lobule as the projection target since nearly every paramedian, proprioceptive granule cell receives BPN inputs. For retrograde labeling, we employed a mCherry-expressing ASLV-A envelope glycoprotein (EnvA) pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus (SAD\u0394G-mCherry(EnvA)), whose tropism is restricted to <i>avian tumor virus receptor A</i> (<i>TVA</i>)-expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wickersham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wall et al., 2010</a>). Cre-dependent viral expression of <i>TVA</i> in the BPN in <i>Slc17a7-IRES-Cre</i> mice selectively sensitizes BPN neurons to SAD\u0394G-mCherry(EnvA) infection. To selectively label paramedian-projecting BPN neurons, we forced SAD\u0394G-mCherry(EnvA) rabies infection to originate from BPN distal axons by delivering the rabies virus to the paramedian lobule. To anterogradely label M1, we stereotaxically injected Cre-dependent <i>EGFP</i>-expressing viruses into a region of M1 known to contain neurons which drive forelimb/upper body movement (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ayling et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Harrison et al., 2012</a>). EGFP-labeled neurons were restricted to lateral agranular cortex, consistent with M1 identity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tennant et al., 2011</a>). We then examined if motor cortical axons synapse with paramedian-projecting BPN neurons. The majority of pontine inputs to the paramedian lobule originate from the medial-ventral BPN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, upper). Retrogradely-labeled BPN neurons are situated in dense fields of M1 axons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lower; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Cortical axons containing presynaptic vesicle proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bellocchio et al., 1998</a>) were in close proximity to retrogradely labeled pontine neurons; these M1 terminals were also associated with post-synaptic densities of BPN neurons (<a href=\"#bib50\">Naisbitt et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Putative M1 synaptic inputs were identified on rabies-labeled BPN neurons (minimum 10 synaptic partners analyzed per mouse) in 3/3 animals. We did not attempt to quantify the percentage of retrogradely labeled neurons receiving M1 inputs due to the high false negative rate originating from the intentionally incomplete labeling of cortical axons and the inefficiencies of immunostaining synaptic proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest synaptic arrangements between forelimb/upper body motor cortex and paramedian-projecting pontine neurons. Therefore, forelimb/upper body pathways separately carrying corollary discharges and proprioceptive information are aligned in cerebellar cortex."

David Marr and James Albus proposed that by mixing mossy fiber inputs, granule cells could perform such \u2018expansion recoding\u2019, enabling them to contribute to pattern separation and consequently to be fundamental for motor learning (<a href=\"#bib43\">Marr, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Blomfield and Marr, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Albus, 1971</a>). In this model, the associative capacity of granule cells is maximized if different modalities of mossy fibers are mixed onto individual granule cells. To test potential mixing of granule cell inputs, several groups performed receptive field mapping studies. In the C3 region of the anterior paravermis of the cerebellum, failure to find evidence for mixing led Jorntell and Ekerot to disfavor the multimodal view and relegate granule cell function from expansion recoding to noise reduction (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jorntell and Ekerot, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2008</a>). Such reassignment of function implies a marked reduction in the pattern discrimination capability of the cerebellum. In the cerebellar flocculus, <a href=\"#bib5\">Arenz et al. (2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2009)</a> provided indirect evidence for multimodal inputs to three granule cells. For these cells, some inputs were modulated by horizontal movement of the animal while others did not show this influence. However, whether the non-modulated inputs originated from a different mossy fiber source was not tested in these experiments, stopping short of demonstrating multimodality in granule cells. Relevant to our study, both of these electrophysiological mapping experiments failed to test the convergence of pontine and sensory pathways because they were performed in animals where the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway was either interrupted or suppressed."

This analysis has yielded the first direct evidence that a large number of mammalian cerebellar granule cells receive inputs from both pontine and primary sensory sources. Our results also provide a map of where this variety of multimodal convergence occurs and does not occur over the expanse of the cerebellar cortex. Multimodal claw-footed granule cells have also been observed in the electrosensory lobe of the mormyrid fish, suggesting multimodality is a feature of this morphological cell type that is conserved across vertebrate species and across brain regions (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sawtell, 2010</a>). The observation that our labeling strategy rarely accounted for all presynaptic partners of an individual granule cell suggests that multimodality is likely a more prevalent feature of cerebellar granule cells than indicated by the convergence of the ECN and BPN pathways reported here. By examining other precerebellar sources, systematic continuation of our mapping strategy will more fully establish the input structure and thus the associative potential of the cerebellum."

Proprioceptive and other sensory afferents deliver accurate post-hoc reports of movements, but many behaviors require predicting the likely consequences of a motor plan prior to, or without, movement (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wolpert and Miall, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bastian, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shadmehr et al., 2010</a>).

Forward models require two inputs: sensory inputs (peripheral afference) that update the state of the model and corollary discharge signals related to intended actions. To predict sensory consequences, corollary discharges are thought to mimic self-generated (reafferent) sensory information. To accomplish this mimicry, corollary discharges must be converted from motor to sensory coordinates, but where and how this occurs in the nervous system is largely unknown. Theory and perturbation studies suggest somatic forward models reside in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miall et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Miall, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wolpert et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Blakemore et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pasalar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ebner and Pasalar, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ito, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lesage et al., 2012</a>)."

Granule cells can generate action potentials in response to a single mossy fiber input (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rancz et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, inputs of different modalities can potentially substitute for one another to fire a granule cell. This interchangeability suggests a plausible mechanism for converting motor corollary discharges into sensory coordinates, as outlined below. A motor command is initiated in forelimb/upper body M1 and delivered to motor output centers and the BPN by corticofugal axons. Since these BPN neurons will be driven by cortical motor commands that do not directly participate in movement generation, by definition they can be considered to carry corollary discharges. Resulting BPN output is next sent to the cerebellum to synapse with multimodal granule cells that also receive self- and externally-generated forelimb/upper body proprioceptive inputs from the ECN. Pontine corollary discharges will stimulate these granule cells, generate parallel fiber output to Purkinje cells, and may be processed similar to proprioceptive signals that synapse on the same granule cells. Although speculative, hijacking this pathway could effectively convert the corollary message from motor to sensory coordinates, and thus in the appropriate reference frame to produce proprioceptive predictions."

A pulled-glass pipette (20 \u00b5m tip diameter) driven by a micromanipulator (Scientifica, Uckfield, United Kingdom) was inserted into the target area and one to four injections (50 nl per injection site) were made using a Nanoliter 2000 injector (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). For each penetration, a 2-min waiting period was imposed between sites and the pipette was slowly withdrawn 5 min after the final injection. After the surgery, the scalp was sutured, betadine was applied for antiseptic purposes, and ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) analgesic was provided subcutaneously. Mice were housed for 21\u201328 postoperative days in order to achieve optimal viral reporter expression and then were perfused for histology."

Granule cells lacking another traceable dendrite were excluded from further analysis. Granule cells with at least one tdTomato ECN input and at least one other identifiable dendritic claw foot without a labeled input were marked with red crosses (<i>E</i> granule cell). Granule cells with more than two ECN inputs were labeled with blue crosses (<i>E</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> granule cells). Granule cells with at least one ECN and at least one EGFP-positive rosette (BPN input) were annotated with green crosses (<i>EB</i> granule cells). For anterior vermal areas, annotators also identified mCitrine-positive dendritic arborizations embedded within an EGFP-positive BPN rosette and traced back to the granule cell soma. All other dendrites were traced from the soma and associated mossy fiber synapses were identified. In these select vermal areas, granule cells with one EGFP BPN input and at least one other identifiable dendritic claw foot without a labeled input were marked with red crosses (<i>B</i> granule cells). Granule cells with more than two BPN inputs were labeled with blue crosses (<i>B</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> granule cells). Graphs showing percentage of granule cell types between animals and annotators were produced using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). X-Y coordinates of annotation markers were exported from Zen and density contour maps were made using custom Python (Enthought, Austin, TX) scripts. 3D reconstruction of granule cells and associated mossy fibers were made using Fiji-TrakEM2."

The simple answer is that we do not yet know. The <i>TCGO</i> mouse line was produced by the random integration of a reporter cassette in the mouse genome (reported in a manuscript currently being revised). This raises the possibility that transgene expression is controlled by a nearby gene whose expression is restricted to this granule cell subset. Such exclusive gene expression could biologically distinguish these granule cells from other cerebellar neurons. We determined that the TCGO transgene integrated into the fifth intron of the <i>Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member</i> 12 gene. However, the expression pattern of this gene (as reported in Allen Institute Anatomic Gene Expression Atlas database) is not similar to reporter expression in the TCGO line. Therefore, we have yet to identify molecular differences between labeled and unlabeled granule cells in the TCGO mouse. We are currently attempting to profile the transcriptomes of TCGO-labeled and unlabeled neurons. We have added a line to the Results section indicating the unknown mechanism of sparse granule cell labeling."

The reviewers ask for quantification of the synaptic inputs to the BPN neurons. As the reviewers suggest, such quantification is difficult. To achieve such synaptology, we used only sparse retrograde labeling and injected anterograde tracers into small focal areas of cortex. In addition, due to limited tissue penetration, the synaptic antibodies labeled only a subset of synapses. The high false negative rate of these combined methods increases the significance of positive results. Therefore we added quantification highlighting the positive results found in all animals examined in this study. We also added justification for our lack of further quantification."
