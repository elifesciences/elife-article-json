                    "text": "Two ER membrane-resident transmembrane kinases, IRE1 and PERK, function as stress sensors in the unfolded protein response. IRE1 also has an endoribonuclease activity, which initiates a non-conventional mRNA splicing reaction, while PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1. We engineered a potent small molecule, IPA, that binds to IRE1's ATP-binding pocket and predisposes the kinase domain to oligomerization, activating its RNase. IPA also inhibits PERK but, paradoxically, activates it at low concentrations, resulting in a bell-shaped activation profile. We reconstituted IPA-activation of PERK-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation from purified components. We estimate that under conditions of maximal activation less than 15% of PERK molecules in the reaction are occupied by IPA. We propose that IPA binding biases the PERK kinase towards its active conformation, which <i>trans</i>-activates apo-PERK molecules. The mechanism by which partial occupancy with an inhibitor can activate kinases may be wide-spread and carries major implications for design and therapeutic application of kinase inhibitors."

                    "text": "Two ER membrane-resident transmembrane kinases, IRE1 and PERK, function as stress sensors in the unfolded protein response. IRE1 also has an endoribonuclease activity, which initiates a non-conventional mRNA splicing reaction, while PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1. We engineered a potent small molecule, IPA, that binds to IRE1's ATP-binding pocket and predisposes the kinase domain to oligomerization, activating its RNase. IPA also inhibits PERK but, paradoxically, activates it at low concentrations, resulting in a bell-shaped activation profile. We reconstituted IPA-activation of PERK-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation from purified components. We estimate that under conditions of maximal activation less than 15% of PERK molecules in the reaction are occupied by IPA. We propose that IPA binding biases the PERK kinase towards its active conformation, which <i>trans</i>-activates apo-PERK molecules. The mechanism by which partial occupancy with an inhibitor can activate kinases may be wide-spread and carries major implications for design and therapeutic application of kinase inhibitors."

If folding-enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum are not properly balanced with the load of proteins they must fold, the endoplasmic reticulum can be overwhelmed with unfolded proteins that accumulate, leading to \u2018endoplasmic reticulum stress\u2019."

To ascertain fidelity during protein maturation, ER-resident unfolded protein sensors continuously monitor the folding status in the ER lumen. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is induced when the protein folding capacity of the ER is surpassed, triggering the activation of three transmembrane sensors/signal transducers, IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), PERK (protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor-6). Two of the sensors, IRE1 and PERK, are protein kinases that are amenable to modulation by small molecule ATP-mimetics."

It contains an ER-lumenal sensor domain that is activated by binding directly to unfolded polypeptides (<a href=\"#bib7\">Credle et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>). As a result, IRE1 oligomerizes, activating its cytosolic kinase and endoribonuclease domains (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cox et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sidrauski et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Calfon et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Korennykh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2010</a>). IRE1's RNase domain initiates a non-conventional splicing reaction that results in the excision of an intron from the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP1. XBP1 produced from the spliced mRNA drives transcription of UPR target genes to remedy ER stress. The luminal domain of PERK is homologous to that of IRE1 and thus its activation is presumably also driven by direct binding to unfolded polypetides (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gardner and Walter, 2011</a>). Active PERK phosphorylates the \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harding et al., 1999</a>), leading to trapping eIF2\u03b1 in its GDP-bound inactive state, blocks eIF2\u03b1 recycling. As a result, global protein synthesis is attenuated, while a few mRNAs, including that encoding the transcription factor ATF4, are preferentially translated (<a href=\"#bib14\">Harding et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wek et al., 2006</a>)<i>.</i>"

Starting with studies in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we showed that Ire1's RNase modality can be activated using a small molecule ATP mimetic (1NM-PP1), when used in conjunction with a mutant form of Ire1 (\u2018IRE1-as\u2019 for <span class=\"underline\">a</span>nalog <span class=\"underline\">s</span>ensitized) that allows 1NM-PP1 to bind to the ATP-binding site of IRE1's kinase domain. Subsequent work showed that the RNase activity of wild-type Ire1 can too be activated pharmacologically with the broad-acting kinase inhibitors APY29 and Sunitinib in vitro (<a href=\"#bib19\">Korennykh et al., 2009</a>). The crystal structure of the Ire1 kinase/RNase domains bound to APY29, combined with biophysical and enzyme kinetic analyses, showed that binding of ATP-mimetic ligands to Ire1's active kinase site predisposes the enzyme to oligomerization, which activates its RNase activity."

Rather, activation requires that IRE1's kinase domain is in its <i>active</i> conformational state, characterized by the inward positioning of the \u03b1C helix and the DFG-loop in the kinase active site (DFG/\u03b1C-in conformation) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Korennykh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Korennykh and Walter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sanches et al., 2014</a>). Thus, ATP-mimetic ligands that trap IRE1's kinase domain in the inactive, DFG/\u03b1C-out conformation act as inhibitors, rather than activators, of IRE1 oligomerization and signaling via its RNase domain. Because RNase activation can occur in the absence of a phospho-transfer reaction, IRE1 is unique in that it is possible to monitor the functional consequences of conformational changes in the kinase domain induced by ligand occupancy of the ATP-binding site without concerns of losing the kinase activity."

Different ligands yield different plateaus of maximal oligomerization and RNase activation, even when saturating the active site. This seemingly perplexing property is reconciled by the model in which different ligands predispose IRE1's kinase domain to populate the DFG/\u03b1C-in and DFG/\u03b1C-out states to different degrees; a strong IRE1 RNase activator would stabilize the DFG/\u03b1C-in state, whereas a weaker one would bias the IRE1 molecules in the population towards the DGF/\u03b1C-in state, without completely trapping them in this state. The reverse would be true for IRE1 RNase inhibitors, which would bias IRE1's kinase domain towards the DFG/\u03b1C-out state."

Moreover, while 1NM-PP1 predisposes IRE1-as towards activation, it proved insufficient to activate IRE1 in cells in the absence of ER stress (which vastly concentrates IRE1 by virtue of oligomerization of the lumenal domain) or over-expression. Here, we describe the development of a novel small molecule, IPA, as the lead compound of a series of second-generation IRE1 activators. Surprisingly, IPA activates not only IRE1's RNase, but also PERK signaling but, by contrast to its ability to activate IRE1, only at low concentrations. We propose that PERK activation results from ligand-induced conformational changes in a small percentage of the molecules in the population that then interact with and activate PERK molecules that contain an empty active site."

We reasoned that (1) the cyclopropyl substituent on the pyrazole ring, which binds to the gatekeeper pocket in the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Ire1 structure, would be a key determinant of human IRE1\u03b1 binding, (2) interactions of the hinge-binding element of the APY29 scaffold would be essential to stabilizing IRE1\u03b1's kinase domain in a conformation leading to RNase activation, and (3) the pyrimidine ring, which occupies the adenine pocket in the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> structure, would provide an appropriate space filling moiety that further enhances affinity to the ATP binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We therefore kept these three elements constant in further optimizations and explored varying substituents attached to the pyrimidine ring for their ability to improve properties of the compounds."

These results were surprising, because the presence of an <i>m-</i>trifluoromethyl group was previously shown to be important to retain activity of related kinase inhibitors but, as shown here, is not essential for activation of IRE1\u03b1-KR43.

This behavior could be explained by a model posing that at lower IPA concentrations, IPA occupies the ATP-binding sites of a subset of PERK molecules, triggering kinase activation of neighboring, unoccupied PERK molecules, as previously shown for other kinases (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hall-Jackson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>). At higher IPA concentrations, IPA would saturate all PERK molecules, thereby inhibiting the pathway. We treated HEK293T with both Tm and IPA, expecting that Tm would not be able to activate PERK signaling in the presence of sufficiently high IPA concentration. Indeed, at 4 \u03bcM IPA, we observed that Tm addition did not activate PERK (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lane 6). Moreover, at 1 \u00b5M IPA, which induces PERK activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we found that Tm did not enhance the PERK mobility shift or eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation further than what was achieved by IPA alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lane 5).

Indeed, when we incubated HEK293T cells with IPA in the low concentration range where PERK becomes activated, incorporation of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine into newly synthesized proteins was impaired (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lanes 3 and 5), consistent with translation attenuation. Interestingly, treatment with GSK-restored translation to baseline levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lanes 4 and 6 and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This pharmacological manipulation therefore allowed us to experimentally uncouple IPA-induced IRE1\u03b1 and PERK activation. In particular, we were interested in testing whether the unexpected toxicity of IPA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) could, at last in part, be explained by PERK activation, which is known to induce apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lin et al., 2007</a>). To explore this notion, we tested cell viability at increasing IPA concentrations in the presence GSK. GSK inhibits PERK in cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 200 nM (<a href=\"#bib1\">Axten et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Moreno et al., 2013</a>) and shows no cell toxicity at 1 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Based on the co-crystal structure of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Ire1 with APY29, we developed a series of new small molecule activators, including IPA. We showed that IPA is a strong activator of IRE1\u03b1 signaling in vitro, by trapping IRE1\u03b1's kinase domain in its active (DFG/\u03b1C-in) conformation, which promotes IRE1 oligomerization. In the oligomer, IRE1's RNase becomes activated (<a href=\"#bib19\">Korennykh et al., 2009</a>), offering the unique opportunity to read-out the conformational status of a kinase domain in the absence of phospho-transfer. Conversely, a compound, AD60, that traps IRE1's kinase domain in its inactive (DFG/\u03b1C-out) conformation acts as an inhibitor of IRE1 signaling. Our studies confirm in mammalian cells that IRE1's kinase domain acts as a conformational switch, in which ligand binding to the ATP binding pocket\u2014rather than enzymatic phospho-transfer\u2014controls activity and down-stream signal transduction events (<a href=\"#bib20\">Korennykh et al., 2011</a>)."

The observation of kinase activation in patients undergoing Raf inhibitor (vemurafenib) clinical trials then led to an intense investigation of the cellular basis for the phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>). Current models suggest that drug-induced dimerization of Raf causes an increase in Raf kinase activity. This contention is supported by apo- and drug-kinase complex crystal structures, which show Raf dimers in the asymmetric crystal unit (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rajakulendran et al., 2009</a>). Other models have been proposed that Raf inhibitor-induced Raf activation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Holderfield et al., 2013</a>), and, to date, the critical prediction of the model that the Raf kinase inhibitor vemurafenib should induce Raf kinase activity in a purified system has resisted all attempts at biochemical reconstitution. This paucity in direct experimental access has forced mechanistic studies of inhibitor-induced activation to be carried out in cells, where the effects of the many components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway are necessarily confounding. Our work with the reconstitution of PERK's paradoxical activation by IPA shows for the first time that no other components of the kinase pathway are necessary and that inhibitor binding is sufficient for activation through the formation of homo-dimers or higher-ordered homo-oligomers. It was previously suggested that PERK activation is depended upon dimerization and the formation of higher-ordered oligomers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bertolotti et al., 2000</a>)."

Assuming a K<sub>d</sub> of 2.8 \u03bcM for IPA-binding to PERK as determined by PERK inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), we estimate that approximately 15% of the PERK molecules are occupied by IPA under assay conditions that yield maximal activation. Since PERK\u2022IPA triggered activation of unoccupied apo-PERK molecules would bias their conformation towards the active state and hence is likely to enhance their affinity for the inhibitor, the estimate of IPA-occupancy in the population defines an upper limit. This back-of-the-envelope calculation therefore suggests that PERK may form oligomers larger than dimers, in which one PERK\u2022IPA may suffice to activate more than one apo-PERK. At low concentrations of IPA, heterodimers of PERK\u2022IPA/PERK<sup>apo</sup>, or perhaps larger oligomers of PERK\u2022IPA/[PERK<sup>apo</sup>]<sub>n</sub>, where all PERK molecules are in the active DFG/\u03b1C-in conformation, are active in phospho-transfer.

Indeed, we observed a small amount of activation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in PERK<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, lane 6), indicating that at least one of the other known eIF2\u03b1 kinases (GCN2, HRI, and PKR) may be similarly regulated. Kinase activation by partial occupancy of the active site, therefore, may be an important consideration in dosing kinase inhibitors for therapeutic applications, imposing a \u2018minimal tolerable dose\u2019 below which potential drugs may exert detrimental effects that oppose the desired therapy. This dangerous scenario may result from many kinase inhibitors that bind and stabilize kinases in the DFG/\u03b1C-in conformation."

This property contrasts with that of the previously described activator 1NM-PP1, which binds in the ATP binding pocket to IRE1-as, the cognate, analog-sensitized allele. Activation of IRE1-as by 1NM-PP1 requires the additional induction of ER stress (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), or overproduction of IRE1-as driving IRE1-as oligomerization by mass action (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ghosh et al., 2014</a>).

In particular, we have shown that the lethality that IPA displays at high doses can be partially overcome if the PERK pathway is inactivated using a selective PERK inhibitor, GSK, increasing the EC<sub>50</sub> with which IPA drives cells into apoptosis by about an order of magnitude. This observation is consistent with the proposed roles of both the IRE1 and PERK branches, providing cytoprotective and pro-apoptotic outputs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lin et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, AD60, as a DFG-out kinase inhibitor, reversed the effects of IPA on IRE1. IPA, AD60, and other compounds developed to date therefore provide a stepping-stone towards developing novel methodologies for the selective pharmacological tuning of the UPR. Diseases, such as multiple myeloma, a cancer of highly secretory plasma cells where the UPR is thought to play a major cytoprotective role (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carrasco et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Leung-Hagesteijn et al., 2013</a>), or triple-negative breast cancer, in which high XBP1 activity has been correlated with poor patient prognosis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2014</a>), have exposed the potential significance of targeting the UPR in cancers. Additionally, mutations found in cancer cells that weaken IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity may be amenable targets for allosteric modulation. The chemical biology tools developed in this work provide an important step forward towards exploring the utility of UPR-based therapies, as well as offer fundamental mechanistic insights into a key mechanism that keeps the healthy balance of protein folding in the ER."

These observations have important implications for the design and clinical use of protein kinase small-molecule therapeutics."
