We found that glands of the <i>Drosophila</i> female reproductive tract, spermathecae and/or parovaria, are required for ovulation and to promote sperm storage. Reducing total secretory cell number by interferring with Notch signaling during development blocked ovulation. Knocking down expression after adult eclosion of the nuclear hormone receptor Hr39, a master regulator of gland development, slowed ovulation and blocked sperm storage. However, ovulation (but not sperm storage) continued when only canonical protein secretion was compromised in adult glands. Our results imply that proteins secreted during adulthood by the canonical secretory pathway from female reproductive glands are needed to store sperm, while a non-canonical glandular secretion stimulates ovulation. Our results suggest that the reproductive tract signals to the ovary using glandular secretions, and that this pathway has been conserved during evolution."

But whether these secretions reach the ovary and influence ovulation, or simply act on other aspects of reproduction such as mating, sperm storage, fertilisation or egg laying, remained unknown."

The ovaries of flies with abnormal secretory cell function contained as many egg cells as those of normal flies, but the mutant females laid fewer eggs.

During each cycle of ovulation, just one of the many mature oocytes present in the two ovaries is released into an oviduct. Octopaminergic neurons innervating oviduct muscle and epithelia are needed for ovulation, probably to activate oviduct muscle contraction and to stimulate epithelial secretion by activating the Oamb octopamine receptor (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Monastirioti, 2003</a>).

In controls, about 50% of females initiated ovulation within this time interval, as indicated by the presence of an egg in either the oviduct, the uterus, or the food vial (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). In contrast, none of the <i>Hr39</i> mutant and only 2% of <i>lz</i> mutant females initiated ovulation. The failure of mutant animals to ovulate was not due to defects in mating, as both mutant and control females showed similar rates of copulation success (indicated by the presence of sperm in the female reproductive tract) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>). Thus both <i>Hr39</i> and <i>lz</i> are required for ovulation, at least initially."

Several previous observations during studies of pupal spermathecal and parovarial development (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sun and Spradling, 2012</a>) revealed a likely role for Notch signaling in their developing secretory cells (SCs). The stereotyped divisions of secretory unity precursor cells (SUPs) resemble the Notch-requiring divisions during peripheral nervous system development (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lai and Orgogozo, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sun and Spradling, 2012</a>). Consistent with this idea, we discovered that a Notch signaling reporter is dynamically expressed in this lineage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>, green). Hindsight (Hnt), a transcription factor that acts downstream from Notch during ovarian follicle cell development (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sun and Deng, 2007</a>), was also expressed in developing and adult SCs but not epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>).

We examined spermathecae for the presence of stored sperm in females generated as described above using <i>dpr5Gal4</i> that differ in secretory cell number. Within 6 hr after copulation, most wild type females had finished transferring sperm from the uterus to the storage organs (seminal receptacle and spermathecae) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Manier et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, less than 20% of females with a severe deficit of secretory cells (e.g., <i>dpr5Gal4</i>&gt;<i>hnt</i><sup><i>RNAi1</i></sup>) had sperm inside the spermathaecal lumen at this time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Even among rare spermathecae that contained sperm inside the lumen, the number stored was much less than in controls. The absence of stored sperm is unlikely to be due to a physical block to the spermathecae, since sperm were found in the spermathecal duct and were stored in the seminal receptacle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Our experiments showed that a minimum of about 80 secretory cells are needed for females to store a normal number of sperm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), indicating that a quantitative requirement exists for the products of these cells."

In particular, the time required per ovulation event was not increased compared to control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Females in which canonical secretion was disrupted by knocking down <i>betaCOP</i> or <i>sec23</i> also laid eggs and ovulated similarly to controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). Nonetheless, the secretory cell requirement that we had previously documented for the early ovulation was confirmed when we knocked down Hr39 in adult secretory cells. After six days at the non-permissive temperature, these animals showed a significantly lower rate of egg laying, about half of normal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) and ovulated much more slowly than controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), requiring an average of 27 \u00b1 6.1 min per egg compared to 7.6 \u00b1 3.6 min in controls (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Our results show that at least two types of secretory cell products are released from reproductive gland secretory cells using different mechanisms. Products produced by the canonical protein secretory pathway are required to attract and store sperm in the spermathecae and to maintain their normal morphology. In addition, products needed to achieve a normal rate of ovulation require the function of <i>Hr39</i> in secretory cells, but do not utilize the canonical secretory pathway."

Sperm storage in the female reproductive tract is a general phenomenon in the animal kingdom including humans and insects (<a href=\"#bib43\">Neubaum and Wolfner, 1999b</a>). In mammals, carbohydrate-dependent binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelia is important in order to form a sperm reservoir (<a href=\"#bib50\">Talevi and Gualtieri, 2010</a>). In the absence of glands and hence of secretions, <i>Drosophila</i> sperm are still stored in the seminal receptacle, but they are poorly motile and fertility is low (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson, 1945</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Spradling, 2008</a>).

First, the initial attraction of sperm to the spermathecae within 6 hr of mating requires a minimum amount of secretion from the secretory cells (SCs). Females with fewer than 25 SCs rarely contain sperm. In contrast, females with 80 or more SCs show the same high frequency of sperm in their spermathecae as wild type. The secreted attractive factor might interact with the accessory gland protein Acp36DE to facilitate uterine contraction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Avila and Wolfner, 2009</a>), or act directly on sperm to regulate flagellar function (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kottgen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). Second, the fact that sperm still move to the seminal receptacle in the absence of SCs shows that different mechanisms are involved in transporting sperm to the two different storage organs. Third, we found that female reproductive tract secretions are required to maintain sperm structurally. In the absence of secretory cells, sperm are not attracted to the spermathecae and those in the seminal receptacle aggregate and are difficult to individually assess (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson, 1945</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Spradling, 2008</a>). However, when protein secretion in SCs is disrupted using <i>shi</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup>, sperm that do make it to the spermathecae exhibit distinctive morphological abnormalities."

When protein secretion was disrupted after eclosion, sperm storage in the spermathecae was drastically compromised. Since we did not mate these females until the day they were tested, our experiments show that any initial accumulation of secretory products during pupal development turns over or is insufficient to store new sperm. The requirement for new secretion from the reproductive glands is consistent with previous studies showing that some proteins in these glands are induced by mating (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mack et al. 2006</a>). The fact that Hr39 is required confirms that this gene, which is known to play a prominent role during reproductive gland development and to be expressed in adult secretory cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Spradling, 2008</a>), does play a key functional role in the adult gland. Many but not all spermathecal protein mRNAs, including many that are likely to be involved in sperm maintenance, are greatly reduced in an <i>Hr39</i> mutant that retains spermathecae (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Spradling, 2008</a>)."

Like these authors, we found that reproductive tract secretions are required to attract sperm to the spermathecae and to maintain their normal structure. We extended these observations by showing that a minimum number of about 80 secretory cells is required for normal sperm attraction and storage, and that these functions require the canonical protein secretory pathway and Hr39 expression. Schnakenberg et al. reported that egg release from the uterus frequently but sporadically is reduced in females with a deficit of secretory cells, and suggested that secretory cells produce an initial, long-lasting lubricant that coats the uterus. In contrast, when secretion was compromised, we saw that egg laying was strongly and consistently reduced due to defects in ovulation rather than in egg release. Schnakenberg et al. did not study ovulation independently from egg laying. In contrast, we used assays that separate these processes, allowing the role of secretion in ovulation to emerge."

While nervous control of ovulation is clearly required to coordinate egg release with environmental and circadian factors (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2008</a>), the underlying mechanism of egg selection is likely to be more complex and involve local interactions as well as communication between the ovaries.

Prostaglandin-like molecules are known to regulate ovulation in mammals (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dinchuk et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lim et al., 1997</a>), and Lrh-1 is thought to function by regulating expression of the prostaglandin-generating enzyme COX-II in mouse granulosa cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duggavathi et al., 2008</a>). A prostaglandin-like signal already is known to function during egg maturation in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tootle and Spradling, 2008</a>), and a COX-II-like enzyme, CG10211, is expressed in spermathecae under the control of Hr39 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Spradling, 2008</a>). It will be interesting to determine if Lrh-1 functions in reproductive tract secretory cells. Finally, identifying additional glandular products acting in the <i>Drosophila</i> reproductive tract may elucidate additional pathways of communication between oviduct and ovary that are relevant to the induction of ovarian cancer."

Virgin females were selected 4 hr after eclosion and immediately shifted to 29\u00b0C for 6 days. UAS-RFP was used to monitor <i>syt12Gal4</i> expression. For lineage tracing experiments, specific Gal4 driver was crossed to <i>G-Trace</i> line<i>s</i> to monitor real-time expression and lineage expression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Evans et al., 2009</a>). Clonal labeling and pupae preparation were as previously described (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sun and Spradling, 2012</a>). The Notch activity reporter <i>Su(H)GBE-Gal4, UAS-mCD8:GFP</i> was used to monitor Notch activation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zeng et al., 2010</a>), and ProtB-GFP was used to visualize sperm DNA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Manier et al., 2010</a>). Control flies were derived from specific Gal4 driver crossed to wild-type Oregon-R."

For ovulation and copulation tests, single-pair matings between a 4- to 6-day-old virgin female and a ProtB-GFP male were carried out in the morning at 25\u00b0C, except for experiments that perturb the exocytosis pathway or Hr39 function in adult secretory cells, which were carried out at 29\u00b0C. 6 hr after mating, females were dissected to examine eggs inside the reproductive tract, and the corresponding vials were also examined for laid eggs. Female reproductive tracts were then fixed with paraformadehyde and sperm inside them were examined to determine copulation success. The number of sperm inside spermathecae was manually counted. In <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, egg laying time (in minutes) = 22 \u00d7 60/number of eggs; the ovulation time = the egg laying time \u00d7 (1 \u2212 egg distribution in uterus); and uterus time = the egg laying time \u00d7 egg distribution in uterus. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated correspondingly."

Incubation with primary antibody overnight was followed by a 2-hr incubation with secondary antibody and DAPI staining. Tissues were then mounted in Vectashield mounting media. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Hnt (1:75; Developmental Study Hybridoma Bank), rabbit anti-GFP (1:4000; Invitrogen), and chicken anti-\u03b2\u2013Gal (1:1000; Abcam). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 and 546 goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-chicken (1:1000; Invitrogen). Images were acquired using the Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope or the Zeiss Axioimager ZI microscope, and assembled using photoshop software."

The authors show that a developmental defect in the specification of secretory organs in the female reproductive tract (through mutations in genes such as lozenge and Hr39) causes significant ovulation defects. These defects are neither due to mating deficiencies, nor caused by defects in neurons that innervate the oviduct muscles."

Similarly, the authors establish a role for the transcription factor Hindsight, which is also expressed in these cells. Finally, using a Janelia Gal4 driver line expressed specifically in developing but not in mature secretory cells, the authors establish that secretory cells are needed in sufficient numbers to allow normal ovulation and sperm storage. Previous studies have shown that secretory cells in the female reproductive glands release their secretions into a structure called the end apparatus, which is in close apposition to the microvilli of the secretory cells. The authors test the role of secretions from these cells using a specific Gal4 and block exocytosis from these cells by over-expressing a dominant negative version of Dynamin (shi[ts]). This causes a defect in sperm storage but not in ovulation. The authors conclude that either the secretory factors from SC that regulate ovulation are independent of exocytosis or they are needed at very low levels, not disrupted in the chosen experimental design."

Similarly, no attempt is made on the functional side to determine the nature of the secretions that have such profound effects on ovulation. In the end, the negative result with shibire-ts leaves the question wide open for further exploration. This work represents an exploratory project that has a lot of future potential but is not yet ready to move the field forward."

The paper clearly shows the requirement of secretory cells in the events leading to attraction and storage of the sperm. However, the data on the nature of the secretory components is not satisfactory. The authors report the involvement of Shibre (Dynamin); however, shibre is known to affect endocytosis in the neurons: the significance of this mutation on exocytosis is, therefore, unclear. It is important to know if the defect is due to secretion of extracellular matrix components or some growth factors or cytokines. I do not expect the authors to reveal the identity of the essential secreted component(s); they must, however, provide the clear involvement of the secretory process. Does it involve the regulated or the constitutive secretory pathway? The authors should test the effect of mutations in the genes that block constitutive (ER-Golgi-plasma membrane) and the regulated (Golgi-secretory storage granules-PM) in sperm attraction and attachment to support their proposal."

In fact, using Hr39 RNAi with the dpr5-Gal4 driver showed what appears to be a small drop in ovulation after 6 hrs (from 64.5 to 45.8 although the RNAi control is missing) \u2013 however, no drop in egg laying after 48 hours was seen. In addition, no significant drop in sperm storage was seen. Based on these findings, it is difficult to see why the authors used Hr39 in the title of this paper. In addition it seems that the interesting conclusions are not highlighted in the Abstract or Introduction. There needs to be a clear differentiation in the writing of the paper between conclusions based on the absence of the entire tissue, and those effecting cell number on adult function. Overall, the paper should be rewritten to clearly highlight the more interesting conclusions regarding the role of the secretory cells of the spermathecae (i.e. ovulation defects and sperm storage defects), and the conclusions based on <i>hr39</i> and <i>lz</i> should be more clearly stated for what they are, a study of the loss of the tissues they help form."

To unequivocally test the adult role of Hr39 (and the ER/Golgi/PM pathway) in adults, we drove RNAi expression targeting Hr39, betaCOP or Sec23 with Syt12-Gal4 in the presence of GAL80ts. At 18 <b>\u00b0</b>C the GAL80 inhibitor prevents Gal4 expression and the flies are phenotypically wild type with a normal number of secretory cells. We raised the temperature to 29<b>\u00b0</b>C at the time of adult eclosion. Some secretory products have probably been produced already at this time, and the turnover of the GAL80 protein at the restrictive temperature can take a few days, providing additional time for additional normal secretory cell function. Despite the potential for perdurance, when we tested the ability of these flies to store sperm, ovulate, or lay eggs at day 6 of adulthood, we saw strong defects (described below), thereby proving that Hr39 gene function and secretory cell function are required in adulthood. These results are presented in a revised Figure 5 and a new table: Table 2. The first two bars of panels D, G, and H present the original results, while the remaining bars show the new experiments. In addition, we added a new panel to Figure 5 with a timeline for the temperature shift and assay to make it clear that we are testing only adult function."

The few sperm that were present showed the same defective morphology illustrated in Figure 5F for shi[ts].

We improved on these assays by measuring both the egg laying rate of the flies over 2 days beginning at day 6 (Table 2, column 1) and for a 6 hour sample of this period, measuring in individual flies of each genotype the number of eggs laid and the presence or absence of an egg still in the uterus (Table 2, column 2). (We confirmed that the percentage of flies with uterine eggs was the same after 6 hours and after the longer 2-day period.) By calculating the total time required for each laid egg, and by using the percentage of uterine eggs, we apportioned that time between ovulation time and time in the uterus (Table 2, column 3). Ovulation time provides a sensitive measurement of how efficiently ovulation is occurring in the different genotypes."

Strikingly, ovulation time is not increased at all by disrupting ER/Golgi/PM secretion in these cells, confirming our previous result with shi[ts]. In contrast, Hr39-RNAi in secretory cells does significantly decrease the number of eggs laid and substantially and significantly slows ovulation (Fig. 5H). This confirms our conclusion that sperm storage requires ER/Golgi/PM secretion from female secretory cells and shows that this requirement exists in adulthood. Moreover, these data now show clearly that female secretory cells also function in adulthood to stimulate ovulation by a process requiring adult Hr39 expression, but that the stimulation of ovulation by secretory cells is independent of the canonical secretory pathway. We suspect that this second secretion is likely to be a small molecule that can move more easily than a large protein from the spermathecae and/or parovaria to the base of the ovary."
