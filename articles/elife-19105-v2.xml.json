Tom1 directly ubiquitinates unassembled RPs primarily via residues that are concealed in mature ribosomes. Together, these data point to an important role for Tom1 in normal physiology and prompt us to refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for excess ribosomal protein quality control. A similar pathway, mediated by the Tom1 homolog Huwe1, restricts accumulation of overexpressed hRpl26 in human cells. We propose that ERISQ is a key element of the quality control machinery that sustains protein homeostasis and cellular fitness in eukaryotes."

Tom1 directly ubiquitinates unassembled RPs primarily via residues that are concealed in mature ribosomes. Together, these data point to an important role for Tom1 in normal physiology and prompt us to refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for excess ribosomal protein quality control. A similar pathway, mediated by the Tom1 homolog Huwe1, restricts accumulation of overexpressed hRpl26 in human cells. We propose that ERISQ is a key element of the quality control machinery that sustains protein homeostasis and cellular fitness in eukaryotes."

The ribosomes themselves are composed of almost 80 different proteins that are held together by scaffolds made from molecules of RNA. Each protein is present in one copy, and so equal numbers of all proteins are needed to assemble a ribosome. However, because it takes many steps to produce a protein and biological processes are inherently imprecise, it is essentially impossible for a cell to produce exactly the same number of copies of all the proteins in a ribosome. Much research suggests that, to overcome these issues, a cell will make more of certain ribosomal proteins than it needs, and then degrade the leftovers that are not used. However, it was not clear how this happens, nor was it known what are the consequences of failing to degrade the leftovers."

Consequently, the mutant yeast become sensitive to any factors that alter the balance of the protein and RNA building blocks used to assemble ribosomes."

Similar to what we observed with bortezomib (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sung et al., 2016</a>), deletion of <i>TOM1</i> enabled increased accumulation of at least seven of them (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We next sought to test whether Tom1 promoted degradation of unassembled ribosomal proteins in cells in which they were not deliberately overexpressed. We reasoned that if this is the case, Tom1 should directly associate with ribosomal proteins. Mass spectrometry of <sup>3xHA</sup>Tom1 immunoprecipitates from bortezomib-treated cells revealed enrichment for several ribosomal proteins, including Rpl26b (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3A</a>)."

                                "text": "Ribosomal proteins are commonly identified in purified ubiquitin conjugates (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mayor et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Peng et al., 2003</a>) or in ubiquitination site mapping experiments that rely on purification of the GlyGly dipeptide that remains attached to a lysine side chain following digestion of an ubiquitin conjugate with trypsin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lesmantavicius et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Porras-Yakushi and Hess, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Porras-Yakushi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sarraf et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swaney et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Udeshi et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). Thus, we reasoned that if Tom1 plays a broad role in PQC of unassembled ribosomal proteins as suggested by the experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>, perhaps it accounts for the frequent recovery of ribosomal proteins in prior global ubiquitin conjugate profiling efforts. To address this possibility, we performed quantitative GlyGly profiling of <i>tom1\u2206</i> and <i>TOM1</i> cells using SILAC (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) to identify changes in the level of ubiquitination of specific lysines that occur upon loss of Tom1. Analysis of three biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3B</a>) revealed 1980 unique ubiquitination sites in 920 distinct proteins, of which 972 unique sites in 532 proteins were quantified. All three <i>tom1\u2206</i> biological replicates exhibited lower overall ubiquitination than wild type, suggesting a major role for Tom1 in PQC. Of the 141 sites that exhibited a \u2265two-fold decrease in ubiquitination in <i>tom1\u2206</i>, 51 (36%) were in ribosomal proteins (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Moreover, of the ubiquitinated peptides derived from ribosomal proteins, &gt;50% (51 of 101) decreased in abundance in <i>tom1\u2206</i>. By comparison, of 837 non-ribosomal sites identified, only 11% decreased in abundance in <i>tom1\u2206</i>. SILAC analysis of the unfractionated cell lysates indicated that the reduction in ribosomal ubiquitin conjugates in <i>tom1\u2206</i> was not due to reduction in total ribosomal protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Gene ontology analysis of the GlyGly profiling data confirmed that ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), particularly those of the large (60S) subunit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), was disproportionately impacted by loss of Tom1. These trends are clearly evident from a plot of the top 25 Tom1-dependent modification sites within all proteins (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) or just ribosomal proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). To address whether the strong effects on ribosomal protein ubiquitination seen in <i>tom1\u2206</i> cells were due specifically to loss of Tom1\u2019s E3 activity, the GlyGly SILAC analysis was repeated with WT and <i>tom1<sup>CA</sup></i> cells. Quantitative analysis of the data confirmed a disproportionate loss of ribosomal protein ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>)."

Since preliminary sucrose gradient fractionations did not reveal high levels of unassembled ribosomal proteins in <i>tom1\u2206</i> cells (data not shown), we reasoned that over time, undegraded excess ribosomal proteins might aggregate and collect in insoluble deposits. To investigate this matter, we prepared detergent-insoluble fractions from WT cells treated with or without bortezomib (btz) and <i>tom1\u2206</i> cells, and evaluated them for their content of ribosomal proteins. Detergent-insoluble proteins, including Rpl1 and Rpl3, were greatly increased in <i>tom1\u2206</i> cells compared to WT cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, Pellet). High accumulation of insoluble proteins in <i>tom1\u2206</i> cells was evident regardless of the method or buffer employed for cell lysis (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

To begin to address this question, we constructed a mutant Rpl26a that did not bind to rRNA. Two positively-charged clusters in Rpl26 \u2013 RRKARK (amino acids 12\u201317) and a patch formed by R27, R28, R51, and R52 \u2013 mediate binding to 5.8S rRNA and assembly into ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babiano et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

However, upon inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 or bortezomib, Rpl26a-4E<sup>FLAG</sup> accumulated (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and was detected in the low MW fractions of a sucrose gradient (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom panels), where it was ubiquitinated, albeit to a lesser extent than unassembled WT Rpl26a<sup>FLAG</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

We suggest that upon its import into the nucleus, Rpl26a-4E becomes a substrate for Doa10 that is localized to the inner nuclear membrane (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deng and Hochstrasser, 2006</a>). Taken together, our results suggest that residues of Rpl26a that mediate interactions with rRNA and are buried when incorporated into the ribosome are also required for ubiquitination by Tom1 when Rpl26a fails to assemble."

                                "text": "To pursue this observation further and probe its potential generality, we focused on Rpl4, because assembly of Rpl4 has been studied in some depth (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stelter et al., 2015</a>). Upon its synthesis, Rpl4 binds the dedicated chaperone Acl4. The Rpl4\u2013Acl4 then recruits the karyopherin Kap104, for import into the nucleus. Importantly, a crystal structure is available for Rpl4\u2013Acl4 (F.H. and A.H., submitted), and the binding site of Kap104 on the complex has been mapped ([<a href=\"#bib62\">Stelter et al., 2015</a>]; F.H. and A.H., submitted). In our GlyGly profiling efforts, measurements were obtained for three ubiquitination sites on Rpl4: K55, K308, and K338 (10-, 8-, and 1.6-fold decrease in <i>tom1\u2206</i>, respectively) (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3B</a>). The crystal structure of the ribosome indicates that K55 and K308, whose ubiquitinations exhibited the strongest dependence on Tom1, contact rRNA and are not accessible for modification in the mature ribosome (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ben-Shem et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, the crystal structure of the Acl4\u2013Rpl4 complex revealed that Acl4 conceals K55, and a structural model of Kap104 docked to Acl4\u2013Rpl4 indicates that it protects K308 and K338. Upon import of Rpl4\u2013Acl4\u2013Kap104 into the nucleus, Kap104 is dissociated through the action of Ran-GTP (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kressler et al., 2012</a>)(F. H. and A. H., submitted). To test if this exposes the C-terminal region of Rpl4 to Tom1 (as would be the case if assembly of Rpl4 was delayed following nuclear import and release of Kap104), we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay with purified substrates. <sup>3xHA</sup>Tom1 immunoprecipitates readily ubiquitinated Rpl4 in binary Acl4\u2013Rpl4 complexes but not in ternary Acl4\u2013Rpl4\u2013ctKap104 complexes, despite the fact that at least eight lysines of Rpl4 should remain exposed in the ternary complex (red circle, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Ubiquitination of Rpl4 within the binary complex required its extended C-terminus because it was eliminated when the C-terminal region was truncated at residue 276 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These data, along with those on Rpl26a, suggest that Tom1 selectively recognizes and ubiquitinates ribosomal proteins via residues that are only accessible in the unassembled state. Notably, pulse-chase labeling of yeast cells revealed that Rpl4\u220663\u201387, which lacks the loop region that binds Acl4, transiently associates with Tom1 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> of <a href=\"#bib62\">Stelter et al., 2015</a>). However, it is unclear if loss of Tom1 during the chase was due to degradation or incorporation of Rpl4\u220663\u201387 molecules into ribosomes."

For this analysis, we used the structure of the HECT domain of Rsp5 covalently conjugated to both a donor ubiquitin and a substrate acceptor (pdb 4LCD). We asked whether the epsilon amino group of a given lysine within the mature large subunit could conceivably make contact with the active site cysteine of Rsp5. Of the 18 lysines that could be observed in the 4V88 structure, 13 in the free 60S and 15 in the assembled 80S were not accessible to the probe (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Taken together, our data suggest strongly that Tom1-dependent ubiquitination events generally occur on ribosomal proteins prior to their assembly into the ribosome, on residues that normally are either buried in the ribosome, engage in salt bridges, or are otherwise shielded from contact."

If a limited capacity to degrade excess ribosomal proteins contributes to the temperature-sensitive growth defect of <i>tom1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib72\">Utsugi et al., 1999</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C and D</a>), we reasoned that conditions that foster imbalances in the production of ribosome components should exacerbate this defect. To test this, we performed three different perturbations. First, <i>tom1<sup>CA</sup></i> cells (but not WT cells) were extremely sensitive to constitutive overexpression of <i>RPL26A</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) but not <i>RPL26A-4E</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) from the <i>GAL10</i> promoter. Second, we created a situation in which ribosomal proteins as a group are made in excess of rRNA via depletion (using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) [<a href=\"#bib51\">Morawska and Ulrich, 2013</a>]) of proteins involved in rRNA synthesis including Rrn3 (transcription factor for RNA polymerase I), Rpa190 (RNA polymerase I largest subunit) and Hmo1 (regulator of transcription by RNA polymerase I). Each of these depletions caused a synthetic growth defect when combined with <i>tom1<sup>CA</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The effect of combining <i>hmo1\u2206</i> and <i>tom1<sup>CA</sup></i> mutations was even more severe (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Third, we manipulated cells such that assembly of a single ribosomal protein was impaired, via deletion of the Rpl4-selective chaperone Acl4 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stelter et al., 2015</a>). Inactivation of <i>TOM1</i> in an <i>acl4\u2206</i> background caused a substantial synthetic growth defect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Essentially no progress was made towards understanding the underlying mechanism, until it was shown that ribosomal proteins are among the most abundant ubiquitin conjugates that accumulate in yeast cells with reduced proteasome activity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mayor et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2005</a>), and that newly-synthesized ribosomal proteins are degraded by the proteasome in human nucleoli (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lam et al., 2007</a>). More recently, we have shown that ribosome proteins produced in excess are ubiquitinated and then degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sung et al., 2016</a>). In the work reported here, we shed additional light on this old puzzle by showing that the ubiquitin ligase Tom1 collaborates with the E2 enzymes Ubc4 and Ubc5 to broadly mediate degradation of unassembled ribosomal proteins in yeast. We refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for Excess Ribosomal protein Quality control."

Second, it has to be able to distinguish their assembled versus unassembled forms. Although the exact structural basis for this discrimination remains to be determined, our analysis reveals that for Tom1 to act upon ribosomal proteins, residues that are normally concealed in the mature ribosome must be accessible. This was shown in vivo for the model substrate Rpl26 and in vitro for Rpl4. In addition, mapping of the major Tom1-dependent ubiquitination sites on the structure of the ribosome large subunit revealed that nearly 83% (15 of 18) of the sites on 12 different ribosomal proteins are no longer available to Tom1 following incorporation into the 80S ribosome. This suggests a very simple kinetic competition between Tom1 and rRNA for binding to ribosomal proteins newly arrived in the nucleolus. If the kinetic parameters for this race normally favor rRNA, the correct outcome would dominate and only those proteins that fail to assemble would be targeted."

To test whether the mechanism we described in yeast also operates in human cells, we first demonstrated that the human ortholog (hRpl26) of yeast Rpl26 fails to accumulate upon transient overexpression, and then established that both ubiquitination and degradation of excess hRpl26 require Huwe1, which is the closest human homolog of Tom1. A recent proteome-wide profiling of ubiquitination sites that exhibit diminished occupancy upon depletion of Huwe1 revealed that, excluding Huwe1 itself, six of the top ten affected sites and seventeen of fifty-six that exhibited \u2265two-fold decreased occupancy were from ribosomal proteins (<a href=\"#bib67\">Thompson et al., 2014</a>).

We can rule out that ERISQ is an indirect consequence of cell cycle arrest, nucleolar fragmentation, defective mRNA export, or a reduced rate of rRNA processing, because the defect in ERISQ is observed at temperatures that are permissive for growth of <i>tom1</i> mutants, whereas the other defects are only seen (or in the case of rRNA processing rate, is strongly enhanced) at the non-permissive temperature and thus are more likely to arise indirectly from exacerbation of a primary defect upon imposition of heat stress.

Regarding the first question, given that ribosomal proteins are highly expressed, positively charged nucleic acid binding proteins, their accumulation might interfere with RNA biology. Regarding feedback mechanisms, it is interesting to note that in human cells, reduction of rRNA expression by low-dose actinomycin D treatment results in poor assembly of several ribosomal proteins including Rpl5 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dai and Lu, 2004</a>), Rpl11 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lohrum et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>), Rpl26 (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), Rps7 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2007</a>) and Rps14 (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). These unassembled ribosomal proteins bind to and titrate ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which leads to stabilization and accumulation of the Mdm2 substrate p53. This provides a sensitive feedback loop to reduce cell growth in response to stresses that impede ribosome assembly. It will be of great interest to determine whether a similar feedback mechanism operates in yeast, and how Huwe1 activity relates to the Mdm2\u2013p53 feedback pathway described in human cells."

Particularly, given that one of the characteristic features of cancer is an increase in the overall rate of protein synthesis, it is clear that regulation of ribosome biogenesis is closely associated with tumor progression. Consistent with this expectation, RNA Pol I activity is highly elevated in many cancer cells and it leads to the enlargement of the nucleolus, which has been used as a marker for cancer for over 100 years (<a href=\"#bib17\">Derenzini et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, two major human tumor suppressor proteins, pRB and p53, have been shown to repress the production of rRNA and the loss of these factors cause an up-regulation of ribosome biogenesis in cancer tissues, consistent with a close relationship between cancer and ribosome synthesis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Montanaro et al., 2008</a>). Up-regulation of ribosome production in cancer cells implies an enhanced dependency on QC mechanisms that survey ribosome assembly. However, the molecular pathway that mediates ERISQ in human cells has, up to now, remained unknown. Interestingly, several observations link Huwe1 function to cancer. Huwe1 is overexpressed in multiple human tumors, is essential for proliferation of a subset of tumors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adhikary et al., 2005</a>), and is required for activation of Myc-inducible target genes including ribosomal proteins in colon carcinoma cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Peter et al., 2014</a>). Our data suggest the intriguing hypothesis that accumulation of unassembled ribosomal proteins would titrate Huwe1, resulting in reductions in both Myc activity and transcription of genes that encode ribosomal proteins. Insights into the detailed molecular basis underlying ERISQ afforded by the discovery reported here will enable investigations into the biological relevance of ERISQ in human pathologies, including cancer, which may lead to novel concepts for therapy."

The doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression constructs (pLKO-Tet-ON vector (<a href=\"#bib67\">Thompson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wiederschain et al., 2009</a>)) containing the control (RDB3142; CAA CAA GAT GAA GAG CAC CAA) and shHUWE1 (RDB3143; TGC CGC AAT CCA GAC ATA TTC) sequences were used (<a href=\"#bib67\">Thompson et al., 2014</a>). shHUWE1 described previously as si5635 (<a href=\"#bib83\">Zhong et al., 2005</a>) was used. Transduced T-REx-293 cells transduced with the control or HUWE1 shRNA constructs were selected in the presence of 4 \u03bcg/ml of puromycin."

All default options were used except for SILAC diGly samples where the multiplicity was set to 2 with heavy labels Arg6 (+6.020129) and Lys8 (+8.014199). Tryptic digest was specified with up to two missed cleavages. Protein, peptide and site false discovery rates were less than 1% and were estimated using a target-decoy approach (<a href=\"#bib21\">Elias and Gygi, 2010</a>). For non-GlyGly analysis, oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. For GlyGly analysis, N-ethylmaleimide modification of cysteine (+125.0477) was specified as a fixed modification, while N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106), methionine oxidation (+15.9949), and the GlyGly remnant (+114.0429, not on peptide C-terminus with neutral losses of 57.0215 and 114.0429 to account for fragmentation in the GlyGly remnant) were set as variable modifications, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib57\">Porras-Yakushi et al., 2015</a>). iBAQ protein quantitation and 'match between runs' were enabled."

The average difference between <i>tom1\u2206</i> and WT samples across the three replicates was then used to identify the top 10 percent of proteins most accumulating. This set of 127 proteins was checked for annotation enrichment against all proteins identified in the sample using DAVID (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huang et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2009b</a>). The most enriched terms included GO FAT cellular component annotations 'ribosome' (p-value&lt;9.3E-40) and 'mitochondrion' (p-value &lt; 6.3E-2). The distribution of average \u0394iBAQ values for all proteins and for proteins with those annotations is in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>. The distributions of average \u0394iBAQ values for the large and small ribosomal subunits were compared with non-ribosomal proteins in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>.

By comparison, much less is known concerning quality control mechanisms for formation of the ribosome itself. It was initially found in 1977 by Warner that reduced ribosomal RNA expression did not affect the rate of production of many ribosomal proteins but that the \"excess\" ribosomal proteins were rapidly degraded. At the time, the mechanism of turnover of excess ribosomal proteins wasn't addressed and in fact, very little is known about how excess ribosomal proteins are degraded. This is in spite of the fact that production (and rapid turnover) of supernumerary ribosomal proteins has been linked with aneuploidy by the Amon lab and may also be a consequence of MYC overproduction for example."

Using cells engineered to overexpress a ribosomal protein, the authors screened for non-essential E2s and E3s that stabilize the supernumerary ribosomal proteins \u2013 yielding TOM1 \u2013 and then performed a number of biochemical and genetic experiments to examine various aspects of the mechanism. Together with earlier work indicating degradation in the nucleus and the known location of TOM1 there, the model is that TOM1 is a factor that directly interacts with residues of ribosomal proteins that would normally be buried in an assembled ribosome. The authors also provide an initial series of experiments suggesting that HUWE1 is a potential ortholog for the E3 in mammals."

Some aspects of the study were somewhat unexplained or not entirely convincing, although in an initial study of a new quality control pathway, one would not expect everything to be resolved.

Second, the authors examine accumulation of Rpl26 with HUWE1 depletion but they don't look at turnover. The authors should perform turnover assays to definitely demonstrate an effect on turnover.

First of all we would like to note that there is not an appreciable bias towards 60S proteins in the insolubility assay (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). The argument that Tom1 is involved in degradation of ribosomal proteins that do not assemble seems inescapable to us, based on the evidence provided. To recap: Tom1 associates with unassembled ribosomal proteins, it is required for their ubiquitination and degradation in cells, and it directly ubiquitinates them in vitro. This is pretty straightforward evidence that it is an ubiquitin ligase that degrades ribosomal proteins that fail to assemble, which is what we claim. What is less straightforward is whether it might be partly to blame for assembly failures in <i>tom1</i> cells; i.e. does Tom1 also have a chaperone function that promotes assembly of ribosomal proteins? We believe we can rule out an ubiquitination-independent chaperone function resides in Tom1, because the ligase-dead point mutant behaves much like the deletion mutant (although in some assays the deletion has a modestly greater defect which could be due to an E3-independent chaperone function)."

If assembly does not occur, perhaps the ubiquitin then serves to nucleate assembly of an ubiquitin chain, leading to degradation. According to this idea, Tom1 has a dual role in promoting assembly and degrading what does not assemble. It is an intriguing idea but difficult to test in a compelling manner. To test it in trans would require an extremely fast-acting conditional mutation that wipes out Tom1 function. Otherwise, in any comparison of wild type and <i>tom1\u0394</i> cells, one would be left with the problem of how to untangle an observed defect with a direct role for Tom1 in chaperoning the process, versus an indirect effect of undegraded, unassembled ribosomal proteins causing interference. Unfortunately, such a mutant does not exist. The alternative would be to make a cis mutant in a ribosomal protein. However our analysis of two different ribosomal proteins suggested the sites of ubiquitination are, at least in the two cases shown, on residues that are normally concealed in the assembled structure (and hence potentially of functional significance, making their mutation problematic). Adding to this problem is that ribosomal proteins are quite rich in ubiquitination sites. To address this important comment, we have added the following text to the Discussion: \u201cSome of the <i>tom1</i> phenotypes noted above are suggestive of a potential positive role for Tom1 in the assembly of functional ribosomes. [\u2026] However, the observation that genetic reductions of protein kinase A activity (which are predicted to diminish synthesis of ribosome proteins) suppress <i>tom1\u0394</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) seems inconsistent with the idea that Tom1 plays a direct positive role in ribosome assembly.\u201d"

If the authors are concerned about the large size of polysomes interfering with the analysis, the sample could be digested with nuclease first to convert everything to monosomes.</i> "

                    "text": "We used low salt because the hydrophobic effect (which is thought to underlie most aggregation) is well-known to be exaggerated in high salt, and we were concerned that a high-salt buffer might exacerbate matters. Please note also that our method included a wash of the insoluble fraction with 500 mM salt to try to rule out aggregation of highly-charged proteins. Nevertheless, to address this comment more thoroughly we repeated an analysis of <i>tom1\u0394</i> and wild type cells lysed in three different buffers: one that contains high salt and magnesium and two others that were used in previous reports (Kaganovich et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2014). In addition, we generated lysates by bead-beating of intact cells instead of detergent solubilization of spheroplasts. The new data are presented in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>. The amount of protein in the pellet fraction is greater in these experiments than what was observed with our previous method. Two factors may account for this: either bead-beating causes more denaturation during cell lysis, and/or the omission of a pellet wash step in new protocol leads to greater contamination of the pellet fraction by soluble proteins. Regardless, the amount of protein in the pellet fraction is consistently greater in <i>tom1\u0394</i> cells, indicating that the observations we made previously were not an artifact of the buffer or lysis conditions employed."

First, the RNAi experiments do not meet the typical standards of two or more shRNAs or a rescue experiment (which would obviously be challenging in this case). Second, the authors examine accumulation of Rpl26 with HUWE1 depletion but they don't look at turnover. The authors should perform turnover assays to definitely demonstrate an effect on turnover. This is important for completeness and to maintain appropriate standards. Alternatively, the reviewers think that the paper could stand on its own with just the yeast data.</i>"
