Here we show, using functional MRI and pattern classification methods, that tool use is subserved by multiple distributed action-centred neural representations that are both shared with and distinct from those of the hand. In areas of frontoparietal cortex we found a common representation for planned hand- and tool-related actions. In contrast, in parietal and occipitotemporal regions implicated in hand actions and body perception we found that coding remained selectively linked to upcoming actions of the hand whereas in parietal and occipitotemporal regions implicated in tool-related processing the coding remained selectively linked to upcoming actions of the tool. The highly specialized and hierarchical nature of this coding suggests that hand- and tool-related actions are represented separately at earlier levels of sensorimotor processing before becoming integrated in frontoparietal cortex."

Here we show, using functional MRI and pattern classification methods, that tool use is subserved by multiple distributed action-centred neural representations that are both shared with and distinct from those of the hand. In areas of frontoparietal cortex we found a common representation for planned hand- and tool-related actions. In contrast, in parietal and occipitotemporal regions implicated in hand actions and body perception we found that coding remained selectively linked to upcoming actions of the hand whereas in parietal and occipitotemporal regions implicated in tool-related processing the coding remained selectively linked to upcoming actions of the tool. The highly specialized and hierarchical nature of this coding suggests that hand- and tool-related actions are represented separately at earlier levels of sensorimotor processing before becoming integrated in frontoparietal cortex."

A compelling demonstration that this transfer might actually occur at the cortical level comes from neural recordings of grasping neurons in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and motor cortex (M1) of macaque monkeys trained to use pliers (<a href=\"#bib101\">Umilta et al., 2008</a>). In both these areas, many neurons that encoded the specifics of hand grasping subsequently encoded tool grasping, even when use of the specific tool (reverse pliers that close as the hand grip opens) required hand kinematics opposite to those required when grasping with the hand alone. These findings suggest that tool use is supported by an effector-independent level of representation, in which the overall goal of the motor act is coded separately from the precise hand kinematics required to operate the tool. In further support of this notion, findings from human neuropsychology (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berti and Frassinetti, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Maravita and Iriki, 2004</a>), human behavior (<a href=\"#bib42\">Gentilucci et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cardinali et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2012</a>), and macaque monkey neurophysiology (<a href=\"#bib53\">Iriki et al., 1996</a>) suggest that following training, a tool may actually become incorporated into the body schema of the actor and coded as an extension of the hand/limb. While provocative, how well does this single mechanism explain the neural substrates of tool use in humans, particularly within established networks that have been identified for tools (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>), hand actions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Culham et al., 2006</a>), and body perception (<a href=\"#bib82\">Peelen and Downing, 2007</a>)?"

Increasing evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggests that human frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex contain specialized regions that selectively represent tools and bodies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Downing et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Frey, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Peelen and Downing, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Peeters et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Valyear and Culham, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bracci et al., 2012</a>). For instance, when individuals view, imagine, or pantomime tool use actions, the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)\u2014areas that have shown some of the greatest evolutionary expansion in humans (<a href=\"#bib104\">Van Essen and Dierker, 2007</a>)\u2014are often co-activated (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Frey, 2007</a>). fMRI studies further suggest that human occipitotemporal cortex also contains body-selective regions for perception, such as the extrastriate body area (EBA), which preferentially respond to viewing of the body and its parts (<a href=\"#bib4\">Astafiev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">David et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Peelen and Downing, 2007</a>). The frontoparietal regions activated by tools are spatially close to (and perhaps overlapping with) brain areas implicated in hand actions, particularly the grip component of reach-to-grasp actions. Specifically, SMG lies very near the grasp-selective anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS, <a href=\"#bib16\">Chao and Martin, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Valyear et al., 2007</a>) and PMd shows grasp-selective as well as tool-selective responses (<a href=\"#bib45\">Grezes and Decety, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011</a>). In addition, real hand actions activate other frontoparietal regions including the superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) region, PMd, and additional areas along the IPS (<a href=\"#bib23\">Culham et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Filimon, 2010</a>), but the specific role of these areas in tool use remains unexplored. Moreover, almost all of the human neuroimaging studies of tools to date have used proxies for real tool use (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>), including visual stimuli such as images or movies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib6\">Beauchamp et al., 2002</a>), semantic tasks (e.g., <a href=\"#bib71\">Martin et al., 1995</a>), or simulated tool actions like pantomiming, imitating or imagining tool use (e.g., <a href=\"#bib58\">Johnson-Frey et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Rumiati et al., 2004</a>) or making perceptual judgments about how one would use a tool (e.g., <a href=\"#bib55\">Jacobs et al., 2010</a>). It remains unclear whether the highly specialized brain areas within these tool-, body-, and action-related networks in humans also play important roles in planning real movements with a tool or with the body (hand) alone."

To this aim we used fMRI to examine neural activity while human subjects performed a delayed-movement task that required grasp or reach actions towards a single target object. Critically, subjects performed these two different movements using either their hand or reverse tongs, which required opposite operating kinematics compared to when the hand was used alone. This manipulation allowed us to maintain a common set of actions throughout the experiment (grasping vs reaching) while at the same time varying the movement kinematics required to achieve those actions (i.e., depending on whether the hand vs tool effector was used). Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode preparatory (pre-movement) signals, we then probed exactly where in frontoparietal cortex and in tool- and body-selective areas in occipitotemporal cortex movement plans (grasping vs reaching) for the hand and tool were distinct (effector-specific) vs where signals related to upcoming actions of the hand could be used to predict the same actions performed with the tool (effector-independent)."

In addition, in anterior parietal regions (e.g., aIPS) and motor cortex we found that pre-movement activity patterns discriminated planned actions of \u2018both\u2019 the hand and tool but, importantly, could not be used to predict upcoming actions of the other effector. Instead, we found that this effector-independent type of coding was constrained to the preparatory signals of a subset of frontoparietal areas (posterior IPS and premotor cortex), suggesting that in these regions neural representations are more tightly linked to the goal of the action (grasping vs reaching) rather than the specific hand movements required to implement those goals."

Subjects used either the right hand or a tool (controlled by the right hand) to execute a precision reach-to-grasp (Grasp) or reach-to-touch (Reach) movement towards a single centrally located real three-dimensional (3D) target object made of Lego blocks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The tool used was a set of reverse tongs; when the hand closed on the grips, the ends of the tongs would open and vice versa. As such, different hand kinematics were required to operate the tool compared to when the hand was used alone. Use of the hand and tool were alternated across experimental runs. The position of the target object was changed between hand and tool experimental runs in order for the grasps and reaches to be performed at a comfortable distance for each effector (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). On each trial, subjects were first cued to the action to be carried out (grasp or reach). Then, following a delay period, they performed the instructed action (with the hand or tool, depending on the experimental run). The delay timing of the paradigm allowed us to divide the trial into discrete time epochs and isolate the sustained plan-related neural responses that evolve prior to movement from the transient visual response (Preview phase) and the movement execution response (Execute phase; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>)."

With respect to this second aim, it is important to note that based on differences between hand and tool experimental runs, a brain area showing effector-independent preparatory activity patterns cannot be attributable to low-level similarities in motor kinematics (i.e., because the hand and tool required opposite operating mechanics) or sensory input across trial types (i.e., because the object\u2019s visual position with respect to fixation changed between hand and tool runs)."

The purpose of this second scan session was to localize well-documented visual-perceptual ROIs involved in body- and tool-selective processing and then examine, using the motor experiment data from these same subjects, whether hand and tool movement plans could be decoded from these separately identified object-selective areas. One area of interest, EBA, has been widely implicated in coding perceptual functions related to the body, including the identification of other individuals, the processing of others\u2019 emotional states and movements, as well as perception of the self and representations of the body schema (<a href=\"#bib28\">Downing and Peelen, 2011</a>). Likewise, pMTG has been implicated in coding numerous perceptual functions related to tools, including tool motion, identification, naming, auditory processing, and the retrieval of semantic information concerning their use (e.g., <a href=\"#bib72\">Martin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Beauchamp and Martin, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>).

Across subjects, this contrast revealed consistent activity in two brain regions: 1) pMTG and 2) an area located anteriorly along the IPS (tool-aIPS, t-aIPS). The anatomical locations of these tool-specific activations were highly consistent with previous investigations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Mahon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Valyear and Culham, 2010</a>).

This time-resolved decoding analysis revealed a full range of decoding profiles during movement planning across the network of specified regions. For instance, preparatory voxel patterns in SPOC and EBA accurately predicted upcoming grasping vs reaching actions with the hand only whereas preparatory voxel patterns in SMG and pMTG successfully predicted grasping vs reaching actions with the tool only (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 6</a>, red and blue decoding traces). Notably, in nearly all the remaining regions, we were able to successfully use the activity patterns to predict the action performed (grasping vs reaching) for both the hand and tool effector (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a>, red and blue decoding traces; purple traces will be discussed in the next section entitled \u2018Separate and shared representations for the hand and tool\u2019). For instance, in parietal cortex, preparatory activity in pIPS, midIPS, post. aIPS, aIPS, and t-aIPS could be used to accurately discriminate which object-directed hand or tool movement was to be performed moments later (for overlap between t-aIPS and the post. aIPS and aIPS regions, see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Likewise, in frontal cortex, predictive movement activity for hand and tool actions was also found in motor cortex, PMd, and PMv. Importantly, consistent with expectations and previous investigations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2011b</a>), our sensory control region, SS-cortex, failed to decode any planned movements and only discriminated the different actions upon execution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). To verify the observations obtained from the time-resolved decoding analysis, we also averaged the spatial activity patterns generated over a 4-s (2-volume) window of time immediately prior to the cue for subjects to perform the movement (denoted by gray shaded bars in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20136</a>). In line with our previous fMRI investigations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2011b</a>), this plan-epoch decoding approach supports the notion that discriminatory predictive signals for movement can arise moments prior to action execution."

Second, in support of the notion that this predictive motor information is directly related to the \u2018intention\u2019 to make a movement, accurate classification never arises prior to the subject being aware of which action to execute (i.e., prior to the auditory instruction delivered at the initiation of the Plan phase).

When we performed this analysis, we found accurate across-effector classification in four regions during planning: two areas in posterior parietal cortex (PPC), pIPS and midIPS, and two areas in premotor cortex, PMd and PMv (see purple decoding traces and bars in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). (Note that separating these tests, Train set: Hand \u2192Test set: Tool and Train set: Tool \u2192 Test set: Hand, revealed no major asymmetries in classification, see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, recall that because the object location was changed (with respect to fixation) between hand and tool experimental runs coupled with the fact that the reverse tool required operating mechanics opposite from those required when the hand was used alone, accurate across-effector classification cannot be attributed to low-level visual, haptic, or kinematic similarities between hand and tool trials. Furthermore, note that accurate across-effector classification does not simply arise in \u2018any\u2019 area where the pattern classifiers are able to successfully discriminate grasp vs reach movements for both the hand and tool. Indeed, although several other areas accurately differentiated the two upcoming movements for both effectors (e.g., post. aIPS, aIPS, t-aIPS, and motor cortex), the preparatory spatial patterns of activity in these areas did not allow for accurate cross-classification. This finding is in itself notable, as it suggests that these latter areas may contain separate coding schemes for the hand and tool. One obvious interpretation of this result is that these latter areas separately code the kinematics used to operate the hand vs tool, providing a neural instantiation of the effector-specific representations thought to be critical for complex tool use. These findings are summarized in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."

That is, while the weightings of some voxels appeared to be consistent across pair-wise comparisons within a subject, others appeared to shift their weighting depending on the effector to be used in the movement. (Note that the only consistency observed was that voxels coding for one particular type of action [as indicated by the positive or negative direction of the weight] tended to spatially cluster [which is sensible given the spatial blurring of the hemodynamic response; see <a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011a</a> for a further discussion of this issue]). One possible explanation for the anisotropies observed in the voxel weight distributions across pair-wise comparisons is that they relate to the fact that the decoding accuracies reported here, while statistically significant, are generally quite low (means across participants \u223c55%). This indicates some appreciable level of noise in the measured planning-related signals, which, given the highly cognitive nature of planning and related processes, likely reflects a wide range of endogenous factors that can vary throughout the course of an entire experiment (e.g., focus, motivation, mood, etc.). Indeed, even when considering the planning-related activity of several frontoparietal structures at the single-neuron level, responses from trial to trial can show considerable variability (e.g., <a href=\"#bib98\">Snyder et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Hoshi and Tanji, 2006</a>). When extrapolating these neurophysiological characteristics to the far coarser spatial resolution measured with fMRI, it is therefore perhaps to be expected that this type of variability should also be reflected in the decoding accuracies generated from single-trial classification. With regards to the resulting voxel weights assigned by the trained SVM pattern classifiers, it should be noted that even in cases where brain decoding is quite robust (e.g., \u223c80% for orientation gratings in V1\u2013V4), the spatial arrangement of voxel weights still tends to show considerable local variability both within and across subjects (e.g., <a href=\"#bib60\">Kamitani and Tong, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Harrison and Tong, 2009</a>)."

In other words, the cross-decoding observed in PPC and premotor cortex regions might only reflect the selective processing of the auditory commands common to Hand-G and Tool-G (\u2018Grasp\u2019) and Hand-R and Tool-R (\u2018Touch\u2019) trials and actually have nothing to do with the mutual upcoming goals of the object-directed movement. If this were the case, then we would expect to observe significant across-effector classification in primary auditory cortex (Heschl\u2019s gyrus) for the same time-points as that found for PPC (pIPS and midIPS) and premotor (PMd and PMv) cortex. We directly tested for this possibility in our data by separately localizing left Heschl\u2019s gyrus in each subject with the same contrast used to define the sensorimotor frontoparietal network, [Plan &amp; Execute &gt; 2*Preview] (recall that auditory cues initiate the onset of the Plan and Execute phases of the trial and so this was a robust contrast for localizing primary auditory cortex). We found that although accurate across-effector classification does indeed arise in Heschl\u2019s gyrus during the trial, it does so distinctly earlier in the Plan-phase compared to that of the frontoparietal areas (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This observation is consistent with the noticeably transient percentage signal change response that accompanies the auditory instructions delivered to participants at the beginning of the Plan-phase (see time-course in <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), as compared to the more sustained planning-related responses that emerge throughout the entire frontoparietal network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The temporal disconnect between the cross-decoding found in Heschl\u2019s gyrus (which emerges in the fourth volume of the Plan-phase) and frontoparietal cortex (which generally emerges in the fifth-sixth volumes of the Plan-phase) makes it unlikely that the effector-invariant nature of the responses revealed in PPC and premotor cortex can be fully attributable to simple auditory commonalities in the planning cues."

                                "text": "It is worth emphasizing that while accurate decoding in a region points to underlying differences in the neural representations associated with different experimental conditions (e.g., for reviews see <a href=\"#bib49\">Haynes and Rees, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Kriegeskorte, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Naselaris et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Norman et al., 2006</a>), a lack of decoding or \u2018null effect\u2019 (i.e., 50% chance classification) can either reflect that the region 1) is not recruited for the conditions being compared, 2) contains neural/pattern differences between the conditions but which cannot be discriminated by the pattern classification algorithm employed (i.e., a limit of methodology, see <a href=\"#bib85\">Pereira et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Pereira and Botvinick, 2011</a>), or 3) is similarly (but non-discriminately) engaged in those conditions. With respect to the first possibility, given that we selected frontoparietal cortex ROIs based on their involvement in the motor task at the single-subject level (using the contrast of [Plan &amp; Execute &gt; Preview] across all conditions), it is reasonable to assume that all the localized areas are in some way engaged in movement generation. (Note that this general assumption is confirmed by the higher-than-baseline levels of activity observed in the signal amplitude responses during the Plan- and Execute-phases of the trial in areas of frontoparietal cortex [<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 5</a>] and that this even appears to be the case in the independently localizer-defined lateral occipitotemporal areas, EBA and pMTG [<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>]). Although it is understandably difficult to rule out the second possibility (i.e., that voxel pattern differences exist but are not detected with the SVM classifiers), it is worth noting that we do in fact observe null-effects with the classifiers in several regions where they are to be expected. For instance, SS-cortex is widely considered to be a lower-level sensory structure and thus anticipated to only show discrimination related to the motor task once the hand\u2019s mechanoreceptors have been stimulated at object contact (either through the hand directly or through the tool, indirectly). Accordingly, here we find that SS-cortex activity only discriminates between grasp vs reach movements following movement onset (i.e., during the Execute phase of the trial). Likewise, in motor cortex we show decoding for upcoming hand- and tool-related actions but, importantly, find no resulting across-effector classification. This latter result is highly consistent with the coding of differences in the hand kinematics required to operate the tool vs hand alone and accords with the presumed role of motor cortex in generating muscle-related activity (<a href=\"#bib59\">Kalaska, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Lillicrap and Scott, 2013</a>). These findings in SS-cortex and motor cortex, when combined with the wide-range of decoding profiles found in other areas (i.e., from the hand-selective activity patterns in SPOC and EBA at one extreme, to the tool-selective activity patterns in SMG and pMTG at the other, for summary see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), suggest that the failure of some areas to decode information related to either hand- or tool-related trials (but not those of the other effector) is closely linked to an invariance in the representations of those particular conditions. (To the extent that in cases where the activity of an area fails to discriminate between experimental conditions it can be said that the area is therefore not involved in coding [or invariant to] those particular conditions, we further expand upon interpretations related to these types of null effects in the \u2018Discussion\u2019 section.)"

Exactly how the human brain supports this cognitive capacity, particularly in the everyday example of tool-use, remains poorly understood. Here we manipulated the type of object-directed hand action that was planned (grasping vs reaching) as well as the effector (hand vs tool) used to implement that action. We then employed fMRI MVPA in order to examine whether planned object-directed hand actions were represented in an effector-specific or effector-independent manner in human frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex. At the effector-specific level, we found that SPOC and EBA discriminated upcoming hand movements only whereas SMG and pMTG discriminated upcoming tool movements only. Furthermore, anterior parietal (post. aIPS, aIPS, t-aIPS) and motor cortex areas discriminated planned actions for both the hand and tool, but did not cross-decode between the two effectors. At the effector-independent level, in posterior parietal (pIPS and midIPS) and premotor (PMd and PMv) cortex areas, we found that the pre-movement patterns predictive of grasp vs reach actions for the hand also predicted grasp vs reach actions with the tool. Notably, because the tool-effector required very different hand kinematics than when the hand was used alone, this suggests that these brain areas encoded the action performed rather than the specific muscle movements needed to achieve it. Consistent with the transfer of goals for the hand to those of the tool, this finding resonates with embodied theories of tool use whereby through use, tools become incorporated as part of the body schema. Notably, however, in the majority of regions tested we find that neural representations remain linked to either the hand or tool."

The present findings provide insights into where different brain regions might be situated within such a hierarchy. For instance, at some lower level along this hierarchy we likely have hand-selective regions like SPOC and EBA and tool-selective regions like SMG and pMTG. Although typically associated with visual-perceptual processing, EBA, like SPOC, has been implicated in coding movements of the hand/arm (<a href=\"#bib4\">Astafiev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Orlov et al., 2010</a>, although see <a href=\"#bib81\">Peelen and Downing, 2005</a>) and the fact that we were unable to decode tool movement plans from these regions suggests that they fail to incorporate tools into the body schema (see also <a href=\"#bib38\">Gallivan et al., 2009</a>). SMG and pMTG, in contrast, are typically activated when human subjects view (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Peeters et al., 2009</a>) or pantomime (<a href=\"#bib58\">Johnson-Frey et al., 2005</a>) tool-related actions, and damage to these areas creates difficulty in pantomiming or performing tool use actions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Haaland et al., 2000</a>). That planning-related signals in SMG and pMTG are able to \u2018predict\u2019 real tool actions, as shown here, provides an important extension of these previous findings, demonstrating that these areas also play an important and selective role in generating object-directed tool actions."

When considering the particular tool used here\u2014where the operating mechanics of the tool were opposite to those of the hand alone\u2014this effector-specific level of action planning is imperative. It provides a coding for the kinematic properties and/or dynamics associated with each effector (<a href=\"#bib101\">Umilta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Jacobs et al., 2010</a>) as well as the other low-level differences that exist between hand and tool trials (e.g., spatial location of target). These features match the known properties of motor cortex; it provides the largest source of descending motor commands to the spinal neurons that produce hand kinematics (<a href=\"#bib88\">Porter and Lemon, 1993</a>) and correspondingly, much of its activity can be accounted for in muscle control terms (see <a href=\"#bib59\">Kalaska, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Lillicrap and Scott, 2013</a>).

Notably, it has also been implicated in tool use (<a href=\"#bib38\">Gallivan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Jacobs et al., 2010</a>), but to date, its precise role in tool-related behaviour has remained unclear. The current findings provide two important clarifications with respect to this previous work. First, the anterior IPS is recruited in the planning of tool actions in addition to those of the hand, suggestive of an important role in preparing actions with both effectors. Second, this pattern of findings on its own does not demonstrate that hand and tool actions rely on the same underlying representations, as previously interpreted (e.g., <a href=\"#bib91\">Rijntjes et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Castiello et al., 2000</a>). Rather, as indicated by our cross-classification findings, the representations may differ, perhaps depending on the specifics of the kinematics or object-effector interactions."

In the human and macaque monkey, the posterior IPS appears to serve a variety of high-level visual-motor- and cognitive-related functions, such as integrating target- and effector-related information for movement (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen and Buneo, 2002</a>) and encoding 3D features of objects for hand actions (<a href=\"#bib95\">Sakata et al., 1998</a>). One possibility, in line with this previous work, is that effector-independent responses in these areas emerge due to a common coding of object features that are more relevant for grasping than reaching. That is, the same set of object features pertinent for grasping with the hand (object contact points, orientation, distribution of mass, etc.) are pertinent for grasping with the tool and a coding of these features may explain why pattern classifiers trained on hand trials can decode actions performed on tool trials (and vice versa). We also found evidence for these same types of effector-independent representations in premotor areas, PMd and PMv. Each area is engaged in hand actions in both the monkey (<a href=\"#bib92\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Raos et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib90\">2006</a>) and human (<a href=\"#bib26\">Davare et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011</a>) and their implication in higher-level goal-related processing (<a href=\"#bib92\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cisek et al., 2003</a>), particularly in the case of tool use with PMv (<a href=\"#bib101\">Umilta et al., 2008</a>), strongly resonates with the findings reported here."

In addition to providing insights into how action-centred behavior is cortically represented (discussed above) these findings offer a new lens through which to view findings reported from previous observation-based fMRI studies. To date, nearly all fMRI studies examining action-centred coding have done so by adopting tasks that require the observation of others\u2019 actions (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Grafton and Hamilton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Peeters et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Valyear and Culham, 2010</a>), in which most commonly, 2D static images or movies of action-related behaviors or tool use are passively viewed by participants (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Grafton and Hamilton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Peeters et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Valyear and Culham, 2010</a>). Notably, the aim of many of these previous investigations has not necessarily been to reveal how the brain plans and executes different actions per se, but instead, to reveal how the brain understands the goals and intentions of an observed actor. This particular line of research has been primarily motivated by the discovery of \u2018mirror-neurons\u2019 in the monkey (<a href=\"#bib93\">Rizzolatti et al., 2001</a>), located in inferior parietal and ventral premotor cortex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Fogassi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Umilta et al., 2008</a>), which discharge both when the monkey performs a motor act and when the monkey views the same act performed by another individual. When embedded within this larger context, however, it becomes important to not just understand how the actions of other individuals are represented but also how these perceptual representations may relate to the coding of self-generated motor actions. With respect to the latter, past fMRI research has largely left open the question of how goal-directed movements, particularly in the case of tool use, are cortically represented."

For instance, in occipitotemporal cortex we found that the preparatory activity in the independently localized body-selective EBA and the tool-selective pMTG decoded movement plans for hand and tool actions, respectively. This indicates that, similar to the highly modular nature of visual-perceptual processing in occipitotemporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib30\">Downing et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Kanwisher, 2010</a>), hand- and tool-related actions at certain cortical processing levels may also recruit distinct neural populations. As an interesting departure from these occipitotemporal cortex results, we found that we could decode upcoming movements for \u2018both\u2019 the hand and tool from the independently defined tool-selective t-aIPS. At the functional level, the decoding of tool actions in t-aIPS is entirely congruent with its activation in observation-based tool-related tasks (for reviews, see <a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Frey, 2007</a>) and, at the anatomical level, the decoding of hand actions in t-aIPS accords with its close proximity to parietal areas involved in hand preshaping and manipulation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Culham et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Valyear et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011</a>).

Although others have shown that hand/arm movements can activate different regions in occipitotemporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Astafiev et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Filimon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cavina-Pratesi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Oosterhof et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Orlov et al., 2010</a>), here we demonstrate that these signals reflect the \u2018intention\u2019 to perform a motor act rather than the sensory feedback responses (visual, proprioceptive, tactile) that accompany it. This distinction is important because it indicates that these occipitotemporal cortex areas may play a significant role in action planning and control, possibly by predicting the sensory consequences of actions/movement even before those consequences unfold. Given the delay of incoming sensory signals, this type of forward-state estimation is featured prominently in models of action control (<a href=\"#bib108\">Wolpert and Ghahramani, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Wolpert and Flanagan, 2001</a>) and, from the standpoint of perception, predicting the sensory consequences of movement can be used to disambiguate movements of the body (self) vs movements of the world (others) (<a href=\"#bib106\">von Helmohltz, 1866</a>). The current findings would suggest that such forward-state estimations, at least at the level of occipitotemporal cortex, remain linked to the type of effector (hand vs tool) to be used in an upcoming movement. Updating the considerably simpler notion that action planning, particularly in the case of tool use, merely involves \u2018access\u2019 to ventral stream resources (<a href=\"#bib74\">Milner and Goodale, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Valyear and Culham, 2010</a>), these findings show that hand- and tool-related action plans can actually be decoded from preparatory signals in body- and tool-selective occipitotemporal cortex areas."

Several theories have been proposed to account for the categorical-selectivity of responses throughout OTC (e.g., for faces, scenes, bodies, tools, etc), with the majority arguing that this modular arrangement arises due to similarities/differences in the visual structure of the world and/or how it is experienced (<a href=\"#bib61\">Kanwisher, 2010</a>). For example, according to one prominent view, faces and scenes activate different regions of OTC due to underlying visual field preferences (i.e., faces activate areas with stronger foveal representations, like FFA, whereas scenes activate areas with stronger peripheral representations, like PPA; <a href=\"#bib63\">Levy et al., 2001</a>). According to another well-known view, it is instead similarity in visual shape/form that is mapped onto ventral temporal cortex (<a href=\"#bib48\">Haxby et al., 2001</a>). One particularly compelling alternative view, however, argues that the organization of OTC may be largely invariant to bottom-up visual properties and that it instead emerges as a by-product of the distinct connectivity patterns of OTC areas with the rest of the brain, particularly the downstream motor structures that use the visual information processed in OTC to plan movements of the body (<a href=\"#bib69\">Mahon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Mahon and Caramazza, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">2011</a>). Under this view, the neural specificity frequently observed for the visual presentation of body parts and/or tools in particular regions of OTC may reflect, to a certain extent, their anatomical connectivity with frontoparietal areas involved in generating movements of the body and/or interacting with and manipulating tools, respectively\u2014a notion that garners some empirical support from the \u2018downstream\u2019 functional connectivity patterns of areas involved in body part- and tool-related processing (<a href=\"#bib69\">Mahon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bracci et al., 2012</a>). Assuming the sharing of action-related information within functionally interconnected circuits, this conceptual framework might help explain the matching object-selective and planning-related responses observed here within both EBA and pMTG. This compatibility of visual- and motor-related responses within single brain areas resonates with neurophysiological findings in macaque parietal cortex showing that the visual-response selectivity of neurons in AIP (for size, shape, orientation, etc.) are often matched to their motor-response selectivity during action (e.g., <a href=\"#bib76\">Murata et al., 2000</a>). This coupling is thought to mediate the transformation of visual information regarding physical object properties into corresponding motor programs for grasping or use (<a href=\"#bib56\">Jeannerod et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001</a>) and resonates with the broader concept of motor affordances, whereby the properties of objects linked to action are automatically represented in movement-related areas of the brain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cisek, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</a>). Where exactly the current findings fit within the context of these broader frameworks remains unclear, nevertheless, our results provide novel evidence suggesting that the specificity of visual object categorical responses in OTC are in some way linked to a specific role in preparing related motor behaviors."

Participants planned and performed individual movements with their hand or a tool (reverse tongs) towards a single centrally located object when required (use of the hand and tool were alternated across experimental runs).

For experimental runs with the hand, grasping required the subjects to precision grasp the object with their thumb and index finger (Hand-G) without lifting whereas the reaching action required the subject to simply transport their hand to the object without hand pre-shaping (Hand-R). For experimental runs with the tool, grasping required the subjects to precision grasp the object with the set of reverse tongs without lifting, which involved squeezing the handle of the tongs (in order to initially open the distal ends of the tongs) and then subsequently releasing pressure on the handle (in order to close the distal ends of the tongs onto the object; Tool-G, \u2018Grasp\u2019 auditory command). Reaching actions with the reverse tongs simply required the subject to transport the tool to the object without any manipulation, and touch the top of the target (Tool-R; \u2018Touch\u2019 auditory command). Participants were instructed to keep the timing of movements for grasping and reaching trials as similar as possible. Other than the execution of these hand and tool actions, the hand throughout all other phases of the trial (Preview phase, Plan phase and ITI) was to remain still and in a relaxed \u2018home\u2019 position on the right surface of the platform. For each participant the home/starting position was marked with a small elevation of black tape and subjects were required to always return to this same position following execution of the instructed movement. For experimental runs with the hand, the required home position of the hand was a relaxed fist, and for experimental runs with the tool, the required home position was to have the thumb and index finger gently placed on the handle of the tool (without applying pressure). Importantly, within each experimental run, the target object never changed its centrally located position, thus eliminating retinal differences within the workspace of each effector across trials. Critically, however, this manipulation allowed us to maintain large retinal differences (i.e., position of the object with respect to fixation) and somatosensory differences (presence or absence of the tool in hand) between hand and tool runs. Although including hand and tool trials within the same run would have enabled direct statistical comparisons between them, this would have necessitated insertion and removal of the tool during experimental testing, possibly leading to additional movement artifacts. In between runs, the tool was given to and removed from the subject by the experimenter."

In contrast, when a normal set of tongs are used, the distal ends of the tool exactly mirror the movements made by the hand (i.e., when the hand closes on the tongs, the distal ends of the tongs would also close), and if we had used this type of tool instead, it would have made it difficult to rule out that any tool-related decoding was independent of the planned hand movements required to operate the tool (See also <a href=\"#bib101\">Umilta et al., 2008</a>)."

Although there were no visual differences between the Preview and Plan phase portions of the trial (i.e., the single object was always visually present), only in the Plan phase did participants have the necessary motor information in order to prepare the upcoming movement. After 12 s of the Plan phase, a 0.5-s auditory beep cued participants to immediately execute the planned action, initiating the Execute phase of the trial. 2 s following the beginning of this Go cue, the illuminator was turned off, providing the cue for subjects (during both hand and tool runs) to return the hand to its peripheral starting position. After the illuminator was extinguished, subjects then waited in the dark while maintaining fixation for 14 s, allowing the BOLD response to return to baseline prior to the next trial (ITI phase). The two trial types (grasp or reach), with ten repetitions per condition (20 trials total) were randomized within a run and balanced across all runs (that required the same effector) so that each trial type was preceded and followed equally often by every other trial type across the entire experiment."

These sessions were carried out before the subjects entered the scanner as well as during the anatomical scan (collected at the beginning of every experiment). A testing session for each participant included set-up time (\u223c45 min), 8 functional runs (although two subjects participated in 6 and 10 functional runs, respectively) and 1 anatomical scan, and lasted approximately 3 hr. Throughout the experiment, the subject\u2019s fixation and hand movements were monitored using an MR-compatible infrared-sensitive camera optimally positioned directly below the fixation point and facing towards the subject. The videos captured during the experiment were analyzed off-line to verify that the subjects were indeed performing the task as instructed. A more rigorous tracking of the eyes was not performed because our eye-tracking system does not work while the head is tilted due to a partial occlusion from the eyelids."

Stimulus epochs were organized into sets of three, separated by scrambled epochs, balanced for epoch history within a single run (photos were repeated across runs). To provide a fixation point, a small black circle was superimposed at the center of each image. Each image subtended 15\u00b0 of the subject\u2019s visual field. Stimuli were organized into separate 16 s epochs, with 18 photos per epoch, presented at a rate of 400 ms per photo with a 490-ms inter-stimulus interval. To encourage that participants maintained attention throughout the localizer scans, subjects performed a one-back task throughout, whereby responses were made, via a right-handed button press, whenever two successive photos were identical. In addition to running this localizer, we also collected a high-resolution anatomical image from each of the participating subjects. All subjects participated in at least three of these localizer runs."

Functional MRI volumes were collected using a T2*-weighted single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisition sequence (time to repetition [TR] = 2000 ms, slice thickness = 3 mm, in-plane resolution = 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm, time to echo [TE] = 30 ms, field of view = 240 mm \u00d7 240 mm, matrix size = 80 \u00d7 80, flip angle = 90\u00b0, and acceleration factor [integrated parallel acquisition technologies, iPAT] = 2 with generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions [GRAPPA] reconstruction). Each volume comprised 34 contiguous (no gap) oblique slices acquired at a \u223c30\u00b0 caudal tilt with respect to the plane of the anterior and posterior commissure (AC-PC), providing near whole brain coverage. In the Motor experiment, we used a combination of imaging coils to achieve a good signal:noise ratio and to enable direct viewing without mirrors or occlusion. Specifically, we placed the posterior half of the 12-channel receive-only head coil (6-channels) beneath the head and tilted it at an angle of \u223c20\u00b0 and suspended a 4-channel receive-only flex coil over the forehead. In the Localizer experiment, subjects were scanned using a conventional setup (i.e., stimuli projected onto a 2D screen and viewed with a mirror), with a 32-channel receive-only head coil. Functional data from both the Motor and Localizer experiments were aligned to the high-resolution anatomical collected during the Localizer testing session. We reconstructed the cortical surface from one subject from a high-resolution anatomical image, a procedure that included segmenting the gray and white matter and inflating the surface boundary between them. This inflated cortical surface was used to overlay group activation for figure presentation (for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> note that voxel activity was spatially interpolated from 3-mm functional iso-voxels to 1-mm functional iso-voxels). All preprocessing and univariate analyses were performed using Brain Voyager QX version 2.12 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, the Netherlands)."

Other than the sinc interpolation inherent in all transformations, no additional spatial smoothing was performed. Talairach data was only used for group voxelwise Random-effects (RFX) analyses in order to display the pre-defined action-related regions of interest (ROIs). For MVPA, these areas were defined anatomically within each subject\u2019s AC-PC data. Given that MVPA discriminates spatial patterns across voxels, we have found it beneficial to select ROIs at the single-subject level using the AC-PC data in lieu of the Talairach data (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">2011b</a>)."

Nine of these ROIs were selected based on their well-documented involvement in movement planning/generation. We selected SS-cortex to function as a sensory control region (i.e., known to respond to transient stimuli [i.e., sensory events], but not expected to participate in sustained movement planning/intention-related processes). The voxels included in each ROI were selected based on all significant activity within a cube of (15 mm)<sup>3</sup> = 3375 mm<sup>3</sup> centered on pre-defined anatomical landmarks (see \u2018ROI selection\u2019 below for criteria). These ROI sizes were chosen as it not only allowed the inclusion of a sufficient number of functional voxels for pattern classification (an important consideration), but also ensured that a similar number of voxels were included within each ROI and that the regions could be reliably segregated from adjacent activations (for the average number of functional voxels selected across the 13 subjects, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Critically, given the orthogonal contrast employed to select these 10 areas (i.e., Plan &amp; Execute &gt; Preview), their activity is not directionally biased to show any preview-, plan- or execute-related pattern differences \u2018between\u2019 any of the experimental conditions."

More specifically, by training a pattern classifier to discriminate grasp vs reach movements with one effector (e.g., hand) and then testing whether that same classifier can be used to predict the same trial types with the other effector (e.g., tool), we could assess whether the object-directed action being planned (grasping vs reaching) was being represented with some level of invariance to the effector being used to perform the movement (see \u2018Across-effector classification\u2019 below for further details)."

The second, extracted the percent signal change values for a windowed-average of the activity for the 4 s (2 imaging volumes; TR = 2) prior to movement (plan-epoch decoding). For both approaches, the baseline window was defined as volume \u2212 1, a time point prior to initiation of each trial and avoiding contamination from responses associated with the previous trial. For the plan-epoch approach\u2014the time points of critical interest in order to examine whether we could predict upcoming movements (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gallivan et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2011b</a>)\u2014we extracted the average pattern across imaging volumes 8\u20139 (the final 2 volumes of the Plan phase), corresponding to the sustained activity of the planning response prior to movement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D and 2</a>).

We capitalized on this fact in order to characterize different brain regions according to the types of upcoming movements they could predict: Hand-G vs Hand-R and/or Tool-G vs Tool-R. We did not examine individual pair-wise discriminations for movements between hand and tool trials (e.g., Hand-G vs Tool-G, Hand-R vs Tool-R) given the fact that in addition to the differences in action planning, substantial visual and somatosensory differences already exist between the two types of trials, like the retinal position of the target object and presence/absence of the tool which both varied between experimental runs. Notably, while these low-level visual and somatosensory differences between experimental runs provided an inherent impediment for interpreting any direct comparisons between hand and tool trials, the presence of these differences significantly aided the interpretation of accurate across-effector classification results. That is, cross-decoding between effectors for the planned action (grasp vs reach) would be unequivocally independent of any visual or somatosensory similarities between the hand and tool runs."

The authors\u2019 findings, showing that occipital temporal regions can decode upcoming actions would seem to resonate with that type of an explanation of the causes of neural specificity for different classes of visual stimuli in the ventral stream, at least as it applies to the representation of tools."

We fully expect that this observation, more than anything else, speaks to the noisier (and thus more variable) nature of the single time-point decoding approach (in which pattern decoding is performed at each individual imaging volume in the trial), compared to that when time-points are averaged together, producing a mean activity pattern. Indeed, this difference in statistical significance between both approaches (i.e., time-resolved vs. mean-based decoding analyses) has been well-documented and previously reported (e.g., Harrison and Tong, 2009). For this very reason, we also provided (for the benefit of readers as well as reviewers) the \u2018less-noisy\u2019 Plan-Epoch-based decoding analysis, in which decoding is performed based on the \u2018average\u2019 pattern of voxels over the two imaging volumes preceding movement onset (denoted by the gray shaded bars in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, for example)."

With respect to this last point, it is worth recognizing that we did in fact perform a statistical analysis (included in the main manuscript with our previous submission) comparing decoding accuracies in the mean-based plan-epoch across pairwise comparisons within each region. While the results of these tests revealed several significant effects (e.g., the responses in L-SPOC were found to be hand-specific whereas the responses in L-SMG were found to be tool-specific), we did not find significant differences between decoding accuracies for the hand versus tool conditions in L-midIPS. This finding reinforces the notion that <i>differences in significance</i> for hand- and tool-related decoding (vs. 50% chance) do not necessarily equate to <i>significant differences</i> between those conditions."

                    "text": "\u201cIn addition to suggesting a role for OTC in visual-motor planning, these findings might also shed light on the organizing principles of the ventral visual stream. Several theories have been proposed to account for the categorical-selectivity of responses throughout OTC (e.g., for faces, scenes, bodies, tools, etc.), with the majority arguing that this modular arrangement arises due to similarities/differences in the visual structure of the world and/or how it is experienced (Kanwisher, 2010). For example, according to one prominent view, faces and scenes activate different regions of OTC due to underlying visual field preferences (i.e., faces activate areas with stronger foveal representations, like FFA, whereas scenes activate areas with stronger peripheral representations, like PPA, (Levy et al., 2001)). According to another well-known view, it is instead similarity in visual shape/form that is mapped onto ventral temporal cortex (Haxby et al., 2001). One particularly compelling alternative view, however, argues that the organization of OTC may be largely invariant to bottom-up visual properties and that it instead emerges as a by-product of the distinct connectivity patterns of OTC areas with the rest of the brain, particularly the downstream motor structures that use the visual information processed in OTC to plan movements of the body (Mahon et al., 2007; Mahon and Caramazza, 2009, 2011). Under this view, the neural specificity frequently observed for the visual presentation of body parts and/or tools in particular regions of OTC may reflect, to a certain extent, their anatomical connectivity with frontoparietal areas involved in generating movements of the body and/or interacting with and manipulating tools, respectively \u2013 a notion that garners some empirical support from the \u2018downstream\u2019 functional connectivity patterns of areas involved in body part- and tool-related processing (Mahon et al., 2007; Bracci et al., 2012). Assuming the sharing of action-related information within functionally interconnected circuits, this conceptual framework might help explain the matching object-selective and planning-related responses observed here within both EBA and pMTG. This compatibility of visual- and motor-related responses within single brain areas resonates with neurophysiological findings in macaque parietal cortex showing that the visual-response selectivity of neurons in AIP (for size, shape, orientation, etc) are often matched to their motor-response selectivity during action (e.g., Murata et al., 2000). This coupling is thought to mediate the transformation of visual information regarding physical object properties into corresponding motor programs for grasping or use (Jeannerod et al., 1995; Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001) and resonates with the broader concept of motor affordances, whereby the properties of objects linked to action are automatically represented in movement-related areas of the brain (Cisek, 2007; Cisek and Kalaska, 2010). Where exactly the current findings fit within the context of these broader frameworks remains unclear, nevertheless, our results provide novel evidence suggesting that the specificity of visual object categorical responses in OTC are in some way linked to a specific role in preparing related motor behaviors.\u201d"

We have directly addressed this issue in our revised paper by separately localizing primary auditory cortex activity (i.e., Heschl\u2019s gyrus) in all participants, extracting the activity related to the motor task, and then determining whether we could decode, using the time-resolved and plan-epoch based analyses, the content of the cue (i.e., \u201cGrasp\u201d or \u201cReach\u201d) from the area."

In other words, the cross-decoding observed in PPC and premotor cortex regions might only reflect the selective processing of the auditory commands common to Hand-G and Tool-G (\u201cGrasp\u201d) and Hand-R and Tool-R (\u201cReach\u201d) trials and actually have nothing to do with the mutual upcoming goals of the object-directed movement. If this were the case, then we would expect to observe significant across-effector classification in primary auditory cortex (Heschl\u2019s gyrus) for the same time-points as that found for PPC (pIPS and midIPS) and premotor (PMd and PMv) cortex. We directly tested for this possibility in our data by separately localizing left-Heschl\u2019s gyrus in each subject for the same contrast used to define the sensorimotor frontoparietal network, [Plan &amp; Execute &gt; 2*Preview](recall that auditory cues initiate the onset of the Plan and Execute phases of the trial and so this was a robust contrast for localizing primary auditory cortex). We found that although accurate across-effector classification does indeed arise in Heschl\u2019s gyrus during the trial, it does so distinctly earlier in the Plan-phase compared to that of the frontoparietal areas (see <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). This observation is consistent with the noticeably transient percentage signal change response that accompanies the auditory instructions delivered to participants at the beginning of the Plan-phase (see time-course in <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 3</a>), as compared to the more sustained planning-related responses that emerge throughout the entire frontoparietal network (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The temporal disconnect between the cross-decoding found in Heschl\u2019s gyrus (which emerges in the fourth volume of the Plan-phase) and frontoparietal cortex (which generally emerges in the fifth-sixth volumes of the Plan-phase) makes it unlikely that the effector-invariant nature of the responses revealed in the wide-range of frontoparietal areas can be fully attributable to simple auditory commonalities in the planning cues.\u201d"

Specifically, all frontoparietal ROI clusters were selected according to anatomical landmarks (see the section in the Materials and methods entitled \u201cROI selection\u201d) at the single-subject level at a statistical threshold of t=3, p&lt;0.005 (cluster threshold corrected at p&lt;0.05) using a maximum of (15 mm)<sup>3</sup> cluster sizes. The localizer-defined ROI clusters were selected using well-documented ROI selection methods for the ventral visual stream (i.e., we selected (15 mm)<sup>3</sup> of activity around the peak voxel of activity for each contrast of interest). Together, these voxel selection criterions not only ensured that the voxels being selected for each ROI correspond with the selection criteria applied in our previously published work in frontoparietal cortex (Gallivan et al., 2011a; Gallivan et al., 2011b; Gallivan et al., 2013) and others\u2019 work on the ventral stream in EBA and pMTG (e.g., Downing et al., 2006), but it also ensured that: 1) the selected voxels were defined objectively, 2) the ratio of voxels to trial repetitions in each ROI was reduced, decreasing the chance of classifier over-fitting (Pereira et al., 2009), 3) the voxels selected were statistically responsive to the task, reducing the chance of uninformative or noisy voxels being included in the ROI analysis, 4) ROI clusters were segregated from nearby activations (which is particularly important for parietal (i.e., SPOC, pIPS, midIPS, post. aIPS, aIPS) and lateral occipital areas (i.e., EBA and pMTG) which reside in close anatomical proximity and, at more liberal statistical thresholds, can have highly overlapping activations, 5) a similar number of voxels were included across frontoparietal cortex areas (from a minimum mean across subjects of 54 voxels in SPOC and PMv to a maximum mean across subjects of 89 voxels in motor cortex) and OTC areas (from a minimum mean across subjects of 23 voxels in pMTG to a maximum mean across subjects of 32 voxels in EBA), 6) the voxels included in each ROI were spatially contiguous, which may not be the case if voxel number was manipulated after cluster selection, and lastly, 7) a large enough number of voxels were included for spatial pattern classification."

As well demonstrated by others, the lateral occipital cortex (where object-selective, face-selective, body-selective and tool-selective ROIs reside, the latter two areas localized and examined in the current study) contains several tightly spatially clustered category-selective ROIs, and their activations, at more liberal statistical thresholds, can be highly overlapping (e.g., Levy et al., 2001; Downing et al., 2007; Orlov et al., 2010). Thus, including additional voxels in each ROI (beyond what we have already selected, (15 mm)<sup>3</sup>) easily runs into the inherent problem that voxels being selected as belonging to the activity of one category-selective ROI, like EBA, become overlapping with the activity selected as part of a separate category-selective ROI, like pMTG (or some other ROI like the lateral occipital area, LO, or the occipital face area, OFA, both not localized in this study). Understandably, this would result in several interpretational issues for the data and this was a problem we wished to avoid in the current study by constraining the number of voxels included for analysis in each ROI to (15 mm)<sup>3</sup> spatially contiguous clusters. Also, it is worth noting that when considering reducing the number of voxels in each ROI (to balance voxel number across ROIs), that the number of voxels presented in our analysis already represents, to a large extent, the lower end to the number that is typically reported in other studies."

Lines of best fit, color-coded to correspond to a specific pair-wise comparison, are overlaid atop the data points, and demonstrate near zero correlations between both factors (voxel number and decoding accuracy).

These findings are now reported in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>.

In binary pattern classification, all that is being learned by the classification algorithm is an optimal decision boundary that discriminates the spatial patterns of activity associated with two experimental conditions and it should be expected that if this decision boundary accurately generalizes to a completely different set of conditions (i.e., cross-decodes) and truly reflects a meaningful relationship in the data, that the particular direction of classifier training and testing should not reveal large differences in the resulting cross-classification accuracies."

[Also, it should be noted that the frontoparietal areas included in the current manuscript are many of the exact same areas localized and analyzed in our previously published work (Gallivan et al., 2011a; Gallivan et al., 2011b; Gallivan et al., 2013) and it was of particular benefit for us as investigators to determine whether (and how) these same regions are involved in the planning of object-directed motor tasks involving an implement that is not actually part of the body, such as a tool]. In the case of OTC, several of these areas have a long and well-documented history of being involved in object-related perception and by independently localizing areas involved in body- and tool-related visual processing (i.e., EBA and pMTG, respectively) and extracting their activity from the motor-related task, we thought that it might be possible to reveal substantial insights into the roles that these areas play in generating hand- and tool-related actions (indeed, we believe that the matching visual-perceptual and motor-related functions of these areas observed in the current study does reveal such insight)."

Moreover, we believe it is important to not gloss-over the fact that we already perform analyses and discuss, in quite significant detail, the activity of 13 different brain areas in our manuscript (and that number rises to 14, if the newly added auditory cortex findings are included in that tally). We are concerned that by extending our analysis (and related discussions) to areas not involved in the motor task (as indicated by their standard univariate responses for the contrast of Plan &amp; Execute &gt; Preview) nor body- or tool-selective visual processing (such as the independently localized areas, EBA and pMTG) that we will significantly weaken the focus and narrative of our paper. We should also note that some of the motivation for performing ROI-based MVPA here, as well as in our previous work in frontoparietal cortex (Gallivan et al., 2011a; Gallivan et al., 2011b; Gallivan et al., 2013), stems from the Whole-brain Searchlight MVPA approach requiring inter-subject anatomical averaging. In our experience, we have found that group stereotaxic averaging (e.g., Talairaching) performs quite poorly in many areas of parietal and frontal cortex. For example, group-activation in SPOC doesn\u2019t survive intersubject averaging well despite there being highly robust effects at the single subject level; this is perhaps because SPOC is not only located far from the anatomical landmarks used for Talairach stereotaxic alignment but also due to the significant heterogeneity in the sulci of parietal cortex across participants (e.g., Quinlan and Culham, 2007)."

                    "text": "\u201cIt is worth emphasizing that while accurate decoding in a region points to underlying differences in the neural representations associated with different experimental conditions (e.g., for reviews see Haynes and Rees, 2006; Norman et al., 2006; Kriegeskorte, 2011; Naselaris et al., 2011), a lack of decoding or \u2018null effect\u2019 (i.e., 50% chance classification) can either reflect that the region 1) is not recruited for the conditions being compared, 2) is similarly (but non-discriminately) engaged in those conditions, or 3) does in fact contain neural/pattern differences between the conditions but which cannot be discriminated by the pattern classification algorithm employed (i.e., a limit of methodology, see Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira and Botvinick, 2011). With respect to the first possibility, given that we selected frontoparietal cortex activity based on its involvement in the motor task at the single subject level (using the contrast of [Plan &amp; Execute &gt; Preview] across all conditions), it is reasonable to assume that all the localized areas are in some way engaged in movement generation. [Note that this general assumption is confirmed by the higher-than-baseline levels of activity observed in the signal amplitude responses during the Plan- and Execute-phases of the trial in areas of frontoparietal cortex (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 5</a>) and that this even appears to be the case in the independently localizer-defined lateral occipital cortex areas, EBA and pMTG (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)]. Although it is understandably difficult to rule out the second possibility (i.e., that voxel pattern differences exist but are not detected with the SVM classifiers), it is worth noting that we do in fact observe null-effects with the classifiers in several regions where they are to be expected. For instance, SS-cortex is widely considered to be a lower-level sensory structure and anticipated to only show discrimination related to the motor task once the hand\u2019s mechanoreceptors have been stimulated at object contact (either through the hand directly or through the tool, indirectly). Accordingly, here we find that SS-cortex activity only discriminates between grasp vs. reach movements following movement onset (i.e., during the Execute phase of the trial). Likewise, in motor cortex we show decoding for upcoming hand- and tool-related actions but, importantly, find no resulting across-effector classification. This latter result is highly consistent with the coding of differences in the hand kinematics required to operate the tool versus hand alone and accords with the presumed role of motor cortex in generating muscle-related activity (Kalaska, 2009; Churchland et al., 2012; Lillicrap and Scott, 2013). These findings in SS-cortex and motor cortex, when combined with the wide-range of decoding profiles found in other areas (i.e., from the hand-selective activity patterns in SPOC and EBA at one extreme, to the tool-selective activity patterns in SMG and pMTG at the other, for summary see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), suggest that the failure of some areas to decode information related to either hand- or tool-related trials (and not those of the other effector) is closely linked to invariance in the representations of those particular conditions. [To the extent that in cases where the activity of an area fails to discriminate between experimental conditions it can be said that the area is therefore not involved in coding (or invariant to) those particular conditions, we further expand upon interpretations related to these types of \u2018null effects\u2019 in the Discussion section.]\u201d"

Second, in support of the notion that this predictive motor information is directly related to the <i>intention</i> to make a movement, accurate classification never arises prior to the subject being aware of which action to execute (i.e., prior to the auditory instruction delivered at the initiation of the Plan phase). Finally, decoding related to the planning of a movement can be fully disentangled from decoding related to movement execution, which generally arises several imaging volumes later.\u201d"
