                    "text": "The widely conserved ParABS system plays a major role in bacterial chromosome segregation. How the components of this system work together to generate translocation force and directional motion remains uncertain. Here, we combine biochemical approaches, quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to examine the mechanism by which ParA drives the translocation of the ParB/<i>parS</i> partition complex in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. Our experiments, together with simulations grounded on experimentally-determined biochemical and cellular parameters, suggest a novel 'DNA-relay' mechanism in which the chromosome plays a mechanical function. In this model, DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers serve as transient tethers that harness the elastic dynamics of the chromosome to relay the partition complex from one DNA region to another across a ParA-ATP dimer gradient. Since ParA-like proteins are implicated in the partitioning of various cytoplasmic cargos, the conservation of their DNA-binding activity suggests that the DNA-relay mechanism may be a general form of intracellular transport in bacteria."

How the components of this system work together to generate translocation force and directional motion remains uncertain. Here, we combine biochemical approaches, quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to examine the mechanism by which ParA drives the translocation of the ParB/<i>parS</i> partition complex in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. Our experiments, together with simulations grounded on experimentally-determined biochemical and cellular parameters, suggest a novel 'DNA-relay' mechanism in which the chromosome plays a mechanical function. In this model, DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers serve as transient tethers that harness the elastic dynamics of the chromosome to relay the partition complex from one DNA region to another across a ParA-ATP dimer gradient. Since ParA-like proteins are implicated in the partitioning of various cytoplasmic cargos, the conservation of their DNA-binding activity suggests that the DNA-relay mechanism may be a general form of intracellular transport in bacteria."

The process of chromosome separation in cells of higher organisms such as animals and plants is well understood. A protein-based structure called the spindle apparatus guides the separating chromosomes to different ends of the dividing cell. However, how chromosome separation occurs in bacteria is not well understood despite its importance in bacterial multiplication."

While the molecular players are known, how they work together to separate chromosomes is under debate. One popular suggestion is that ParA forms a spindle-like structure. Alternatively, a diffusion-based mechanism has been proposed, where a gradient of ParA molecules bound to the chromosome interacts with a <i>parS</i>/ParB complex, directing the diffusion of the complex."

When ParB intermittently binds to ParA, it usually catches the ParA-DNA complex when the complex is elastically stretched. The elasticity of the chromosome itself then makes the <i>parS</i>/ParB complex move in the direction where the most ParA molecules are still bound to the chromosome. Lim et al. suggest that similar elastic mechanisms could also be behind more general intracellular transport in bacteria."

In eukaryotic cells, chromosome segregation is driven by the microtubule-based mitotic spindle in a process for which there is considerable mechanistic understanding (<a href=\"#bib63\">McIntosh et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, much less is known in bacteria. Yet a robust segregation mechanism must be in place to keep up with the fast-paced proliferation of bacterial cells.

How the newly replicated chromosomal origin regions segregate remains poorly understood. In recent years, the ParABS systems, which are conserved among most bacterial species (<a href=\"#bib59\">Livny et al., 2007</a>), have been recognized as important active transport systems of chromosomal origin regions in diverse bacteria (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mohl and Gober, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kim et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Godfrin-Estevenon et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lewis et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fogel and Waldor, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Saint-Dic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lasocki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Jakimowicz et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Toro et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bartosik et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Donovan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ptacin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Schofield et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Shebelut et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Harms et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Iniesta, 2014</a>)<i>.</i> ParABS systems, first identified on plasmids for their role in stable plasmid inheritance (<a href=\"#bib3\">Austin and Abeles, 1983</a>), consist of three components: the DNA sequence <i>parS</i>, the DNA-binding protein ParB, and the deviant Walker A-type ATPase ParA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ebersbach and Gerdes, 2005</a>). ParB specifically recognizes <i>parS</i> sequences, which are typically found near the origin of replication of most bacterial chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Livny et al., 2007</a>). Upon binding to <i>parS</i>, ParB is thought to spread on flanking sequences to form the so-called ParB/<i>parS</i> partition complex (<a href=\"#bib76\">Rodionov et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Murray et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Breier and Grossman, 2007</a>). ParA dimerizes upon ATP binding, which in turn promotes nonspecific DNA binding (<a href=\"#bib54\">Leonard et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hester and Lutkenhaus, 2007</a>). Various in vitro studies have also observed that ParA-ATP dimers can further assemble into filaments (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barilla et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ebersbach et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Machon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ptacin et al., 2010</a>).

According to this popular spindle-like model, ParA polymerizes into a thin filament bundle upon ATP binding. Depolymerization of ParA filaments through ParB-induced ATP hydrolysis then pulls the ParB/<i>parS</i> complex and its associated chromosomal origin region. However, the significance of ParA DNA-binding activity remains unclear, even though this activity is essential for the segregation process based on mutational analysis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hester and Lutkenhaus, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Castaing et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ptacin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Schofield et al., 2010</a>).

Obtaining stable preparations of chromosomal ParA proteins is notoriously difficult because of the tendency of these proteins to precipitate (<a href=\"#bib36\">Howard and Gerdes, 2010</a>). Through troubleshooting, we found that addition of Mg-ATP to all buffers (including the cell lysis and storage buffers) as well as potassium glutamate (150 mM) after chromatography was crucial to maintain long-term stability of purified <i>C. crescentus</i> ParA. Such preparations of ParA were used to investigate the oligomerization state of the protein upon ATP binding by size exclusion chromatography. Prior to chromatography, Mg-ATP was removed from a ParA aliquot via incubation with EDTA followed by buffer exchange ('Materials and methods'). The resulting sample was then split into two samples: one sample remained without ATP, while Mg-ATP was added to the other sample. In the absence of ATP, ParA eluted from the column as a single peak at an elution volume corresponding to the ParA monomer (\u223c28 kDa) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In the presence of Mg-ATP (2.5 mM), ParA eluted earlier, at an elution volume consistent with a dimeric form (\u223c56 kDa) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, <i>C. crescentus</i> ParA dimerizes in the presence of ATP concentrations expected to be found inside bacterial cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bennett et al., 2009</a>)."

The two-peak distribution was fit by a bimodal Gaussian (black), representing fluorescence detected in two populations of cells: wild-type (magenta) and GFP-ParB-producing cells (cyan).

Fluorescent emitters within six polar partition complexes were analyzed. The histogram was fitted with a Gaussian function with \u03c3 = 39 nm (solid line). Radial distribution of mEos3.2-ParB from the foci were then combined and plotted as a histogram (<i>n</i> = 440 localizations). This means that 95% of the molecules were localized within 78 nm (2\u03c3) from the center of the spot. We used 78 nm as the radius of the spherical volume occupied by ParB dimers within a partitioning complex. Such a sphere occupied a volume of 2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup> fL."

However, this ATPase activity of 6.7 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> remains slow relative to the time scale of ParB/<i>parS</i> migration towards the distal pole, which occurs in the minute range (<a href=\"#bib84\">Shebelut et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ptacin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Schofield et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hong and McAdams, 2011</a>). We therefore anticipated that further stimulation by ParB would be required to obtain significant ATPase activity from ParA. Indeed, ParB (60 \u00b5M) further increased ParA ATPase activity by about 10-fold in a DNA-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The increased activity was likely due to an interaction between ParB and ParA (as opposed to a contaminating ATPase activity in the ParB preparation) since substitution of ParB by the ParB<sub>L12A</sub> mutant (purified under the same conditions as ParB, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), which is unable to interact with ParA (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ptacin et al., 2010</a>), failed to stimulate ATPase activity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Moreover, when we examined its motion along the short cell axis, we found that the displacement distributions were virtually identical for the fast and slow phases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). These observations are at odds with the idea that a ParA filament bundle serves as a stable bridge guiding the movement of the partitioning complex across the cell. That is, unless the ParA filament bundle rapidly moves across the cell width, which is highly unlikely given the large size of the presumed ParA bundle. We therefore considered two alternative explanations. First, during the process of translocation, the partitioning complex detaches from the ParA filament bundle and diffuses before reattaching to the ParA filament bundle. Second, ParA-ATP does not form a filamentous structure inside the chromosome-packed cell; instead ParA-ATP dimers bind to the chromosomal DNA away from the ParB/<i>parS</i> complexes."

To examine whether the cellular concentration of ParA could accommodate the formation of a micron-long filament bundle, we determined the number of ParA molecules per cell using three independent methods: quantitative Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>), calibrated fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), and stoichiometric comparison with ParB (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Each method gave a similar result with an average of about 180 ParA molecules or 90 ParA dimers per cell (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). ParA2 from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> has been shown to polymerize on DNA in vitro, forming a nucleoprotein filament with a dimension of 4.4 dimer units per helical pitch of 12 nm (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hui et al., 2010</a>). If we assume that ParA forms a similar nucleoprotein filament inside <i>C. crescentus</i>, this filament would be at most 240 nm in length. Even if we ignore DNA binding and consider that ParA dimers polymerize back-to-back along their largest dimension (as determined from the crystal structure of the <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> Soj/ParA dimer; <a href=\"#bib54\">Leonard et al., 2005</a>), the filament could be at most 580 nm long (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>).

In addition, to increase emitter density, we generated a second strain in which ParA-Dendra2 was expressed from a xylose-inducible promoter on the chromosome in addition to being expressed from the native promoter. To specifically examine ParA-Dendra2 localization prior to <i>parS</i> replication and segregation, cells in G1 cell cycle phase (swarmer cells) were isolated and imaged by 2D PALM at an averaged localization precision of 18 nm in both the x- and y-directions.

When crescentin is fused to a fluorescent protein, the crescentin fusion fails to attach to the cell membrane (resulting in loss of cell curvature) but still polymerizes into a single filamentous structure (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ausmees et al., 2003</a>). PALM visualization of crescentin-Dendra2 indeed revealed a clear filament-like localization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), indicating that our method can identify protein filaments. As a second control, we imaged L1-Dendra2-tagged ribosomes using PALM. In <i>C. crescentus</i>, ribosomes spread throughout the cytoplasm, as shown by both cryo-electron tomography and conventional epifluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#bib13\">Briegel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Montero Llopis et al., 2010</a>).

In this proposed mechanism (hereafter referred to as \u2018diffusion-binding\u2019 mechanism, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), the DNA serves as a matrix to tether ParA-ATP dimers and the partition complex diffuses until it binds to one or more DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers. Stimulation of ATP hydrolysis results in monomerization of ParA, causing the release of the ParB/<i>parS</i> complex and a local depletion of DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers. The partition complex then encounters new DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers by diffusion, reinitiating the biochemical cycle. The hypothesis is that repeated cycles of this process would result in biased diffusion of ParB/<i>parS</i> toward a higher concentration of ParA-ATP dimers."

The concentration of ParA-ATP dimers was 90 per cell (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Their spatial distribution was modeled to reproduce the gradient of ParA-ATP dimers bound to the DNA matrix inside cells. The shape of the ParA gradient was determined by quantitative analysis of cells expressing ParA-YFP at different stages of segregation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We found that the averaged trajectory showed little (if any) net translocation toward the new pole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

In this model, the DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers fluctuate around the equilibrium point of the underlying DNA loci. When the partition complex catches DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers in a stretched out-of-equilibrium state, it experiences the elastic force, which moves the complex toward the equilibrium point until ATP hydrolysis releases it. Repetition of the process results in a <i>relay</i> of the partition complex from one chromosomal region to another. Directionality arises from the presence of the ParA-ATP dimer gradient.

Analyzing only cells in which the CFP-ParB/<i>parS</i> complex has duplicated and separated, we measured the aspect ratio (AR) of each partition complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), a metric that has also been used to distinguish between compacted and decompacted states of chromatin loci in eukaryotic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib96\">Verdaasdonk et al., 2013</a>). A perfectly round CFP-ParB/<i>parS</i> signal is expected to have an AR of 1 while a stretched signal has an AR score greater than 1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We visually correlated a subset of the spots with their AR and verified that an AR cutoff of 1.5 reliably discriminated between the compacted and decompacted conformations. Using this AR cutoff, we found that the frequency of decompacted conformation (AR &gt;1.5) is low near the new and old poles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), where the ParB/<i>parS</i> complexes are expected to either be anchored by PopZ or diffuse locally (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, the frequency of decompacted CFP-ParB/<i>parS</i> signals increased as the partition complex moved away from the old pole (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Thus, the frequency of decompacted CFP-ParB/<i>parS</i> signals correlated with the concentration of ParA-ATP dimers, suggesting that the stretched conformation adopted by the partition complex is triggered by ParB interacting with ParA-ATP dimers bound to the dynamic DNA. Furthermore, the AR of the segregating partition complex appeared to fluctuate over time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), consistent with the partition complex dynamically responding to fluctuating pulling forces."

It also suggests that the role of a ParA-ATP dimer is to provide a timed and reversible connection between the partition complex and the dynamic DNA. According to the model, a fluctuating DNA locus is captured out-of-equilibrium by the partition complex (via ParA-ATP dimers). As the DNA locus returns to its equilibrium, it brings the partition complex along. The association time between ParB/<i>parS</i> and the DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimer\u2014which is defined by ParB-stimulated ATP hydrolysis rate (<i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub>)\u2014is critical for this mechanism to work efficiently. Under optimal conditions, the partition complex would be released immediately once equilibrium is reached to catch the next out-of-equilibrium DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimer. This would result in an apparent relay of the partition complex from one DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimer to another. A back-of-the-envelope calculation ('Materials and methods') estimates that the optimal attachment time would be 36 s. Thus, the optimal rate of ATP hydrolysis, which is the inverse of this optimal attachment time, should be about 0.03 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. This value is in remarkably good agreement with the ParB-induced ATP hydrolysis rate (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = 0.03 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) we obtained from our biochemical data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

To examine how the performance of the DNA-relay model depends on <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub>, we varied the <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> values in our simulations.

In this model, the translocation force is derived from the elastic property of the chromosome. Elastic dynamics may be inherent to highly compacted and ordered DNA as they have also been observed for chromosomal loci in eukaryotic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib96\">Verdaasdonk et al., 2013</a>) as well as in nucleoids isolated from lysed <i>E. coli</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cunha et al., 2005</a>).

For example, <i>B. subtilis</i> Soj controls DNA replication initiation in vegetative cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Murray and Errington, 2008</a>). While this distinct function involves interactions with other cellular components (e.g., DnaA), biochemical evidence suggests that differential regulation of ParA dimeric states by ParB also plays an important role. As shown here, <i>C. crescentus</i> ParA ATPase activity requires high concentration of ParB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), which insulates ParA-ATP dimers from premature turnover by diffusing ParB and restricts stimulation of ATP hydrolysis to the ParB-rich partition complex. In contrast, in <i>B. subtilis</i>, a low concentration of Spo0J (ParB) is sufficient to stimulate Soj ATPase activity, such that even diffusing Spo0J promotes ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib82\">Scholefield et al., 2011</a>). As a consequence, in <i>C. crescentus</i>, ParA accumulates as a cloud of DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers, primed for the transport of the ParB/<i>parS</i> complex, whereas in <i>B. subtilis</i>, Soj mostly exists in a replication-inhibitory monomeric form that cannot bind the DNA (<a href=\"#bib82\">Scholefield et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this notion, a mere overproduction of Soj, which should tip the balance toward the Soj dimer state, results in cloud-like localization of Soj and Spo0J/<i>parS</i> translocation in the receding wave of the Soj cloud (<a href=\"#bib62\">Marston and Errington, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Quisel et al., 1999</a>).

One milliliter of cell culture was pelleted and used to make a cell lysate for Western blotting. The cell lysate was separated on an Any-kD Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel (Biorad, Hercules, CA), proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was probed with 1:50,000 dilution of anti-ParB polyclonal antibody (Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL) and 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Biorad). Signals were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and detected by exposing the membrane to a Kodak film (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY) or using a Typhoon PhosphoImager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The intensities of bands were quantified using ImageJ and compared against a standard curve generated from known amounts of ParB-His6 probed on the same blots. Since, at low concentrations, we lost significant amount of ParB-His6 presumably due to nonspecific binding of the protein to the wall of the plastic tubes, the ParB-His6 standard stock was prepared by diluting purified ParB-His6 in SDS buffer denatured cell lysates made from strain MT174 (which produces GFP-ParB instead of native ParB). After normalizing for the fraction of lysate loaded, we calculated the number of ParB molecules in the CB15N lysate by dividing the ParB amount by the molecular weight of ParB and by multiplying by the Avogadro number. In parallel, the number of cells used to prepare the cell lysate used for the Western blots was determined by serial dilution followed by quantification of colony forming unit (CFU) on an agar plate containing PYE medium. Using lysates made from four different pellets, we determined that swarmer cells contain 720 \u00b1 80 (mean \u00b1 SD) ParB molecules (or 360 ParB dimers) per cell."

We used MicrobeTracker to quantify the fluorescence associated with segmented areas along the long cell axis. We assumed that segments with the least fluorescence concentration (fluorescence within the segment divided by the segment area) correspond to cell area far away from the GFP-ParB/<i>parS</i> complex and therefore their fluorescence values report the concentration of freely diffusing GFP-ParB. For each cell, we computationally ranked the fluorescence concentration within each cell segment, selected the lowest 10% of the total segments containing the lowest fluorescence concentration, calculated the average, and normalized this value to the total cell area to obtain the fluorescence value associated with the total diffusing GFP-ParB.

To quantify the fluorescence intensity of single ParA-YFP molecules, we used a solution of ParA<sub>G16V</sub>-YFP-His6 (500 pM). This reagent was used because of its availability at the time of the experiment and the G16V mutation on ParA should not affect the fluorescent property of YFP. One hundred microliters of the ParA<sub>G16V</sub>-YFP-His6 solution was incubated on the poly-Lysine coated side of the coverlip for 10 s and washed extensively with buffer B7 supplemented with 10% glycerol and 0.5 mM DTT. Most of the wash solution was removed by contacting the side of the coverslip with a sheet of Kimwipe, leaving behind \u223c1\u20133 \u00b5l. The coverslip was then mounted onto a cleaned glass slide and sealed. The images of the surface-immobilized YFP molecules were stream-acquired with 2-s integration time. In these images, ParA<sub>G16V</sub>-YFP-His6 molecules appeared as distinct diffraction-limited fluorescent spots. For image analysis, we centered a 9 \u00d7 9 pixel box on each diffraction limited spot and integrated the fluorescence intensity in the box over time (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A,B</a>). To determine the fluorescence intensity of a single ParA<sub>G16V</sub>-YFP-His6 (or ParA-YFP) molecule, we analyzed only spots with a fluorescence profile that showed single-step photobleaching (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6B</a>, i). We determined the fluorescence intensity of a single YFP by calculating the difference in averaged fluorescence intensities before and after the stepwise photobleaching, <i>\u0394I</i>. The mean fluorescence intensity of a single ParA-YFP molecule was determined from the mean of a Gaussian fit to the distribution of <i>\u0394I</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6C</a>)."

Wild-type cells were added to measure the fluorescence contribution from cellular autofluorescence. Swarmer cells of the two strains were then imaged on the same agarose pad using the same optical settings as those used to image single ParA-YFP molecules. Outlines of cells were obtained using MicrobeTracker. Fluorescence images were background-subtracted to remove signals from the agarose pad before further analysis. To completely capture the YFP fluorescence within each cells, we expanded the cell outline by five pixels. Cells with overlapping outlines were eliminated to prevent cross-cell \u2018fluorescence contamination\u2019. Intensities of all pixels within each cell outline were then integrated and designated as total YFP fluorescence per cell. Number of ParA-YFP molecule per cell was calculated as the ratio between the total ParA-YFP fluorescence per cell and the mean fluorescence of single ParA-YFP molecules. We distinguished <i>parA-yfp</i>-expressing cells from wild-type cells through fluorescence thresholding (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6D</a>). In a separate experiment, we confirmed that this classification method reliably separates the two strains with better than 99% accuracy (data not shown)."

Briefly, the mean offset was determined from 1000 raw images using the 256 \u00d7 256 pixels region at the center of the EMCCD chip in a dark environment with no incident photons. To determine the amplification gain, we extracted the slope of the variance vs the mean scatter plot calculated from each pixel over 200 camera frames while illuminated with a stationary intensity pattern.

We then linked each single molecule to each cell outline by using the inpolygon function in MATLAB and calculated the distance for each single molecule to the cell center line as determined from the MicrobeTracker outline. To determine the individual distribution of Dendra2 fusions inside cells along the cell width, we selected cells that contain high density of localized emitters (&gt;1000 per cell) for analysis. To analyze the distribution of emitters along the short cell axis, a 0.5\u20130.8 \u03bcm long segment was manually selected for each cell. These segments corresponded to regions containing the ParA \u2018cloud\u2019 in cells expressing ParA-Dendra2 or areas where the crescentin-Dendra2 filament orientation was parallel to the long cell axis. For cells expressing L1-Dendra2, the segments were randomly selected since the distribution of emitters along the long cell axis was mostly homogenous. Only segments with at least 600 emitters were analyzed to minimize statistical error. For segments that passed the selection, single emitter positions with respect to the short cell axis were then normalized to the mean of the distribution in each cell and plotted as a histogram."

Note that because of its slow rate, dissociation of ParA from the DNA due to the basal ATPase activity of DNA-bound ParA was neglected. Since for the plasmid P1 system, the rate of freely diffusing ParA monomers dimerizing and binding to DNA is thought to be comparable to ATP hydrolysis rate (<a href=\"#bib92\">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</a>), we assumed that <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>db</i></sub> = <i>\u03c4</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> = 30 s for all simulations shown here.

The main difference between the two models would seem to be the proposed role of intrinsic fluctuating motion of DNA-bound ParA-ATP dimers. Intuitively, it seems to me that the modelling would work just as well by a Mizuuchi-like process and that tethering the ParA molecules to DNA provides a matrix on which the polar gradient of ParA can be fixed. It would be interesting to see this alternative scenario modelled. The new model also does not take account of the fact that each oriC region has multiple ParB molecules bound, and that there are several separated <i>parS</i> sites, each of which could collide with a DNA-bound ParA dimer, facilitating the walk up the ParA gradient towards the cell pole. Perhaps the occasional \u201cstretching\u201d of ParB foci represents simultaneous interactions made by different <i>parS</i> assemblies?"

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and 4C</a>, this diffusion-binding model does not lead to fast or robust segregation. Note that we were, at first, surprised by the results because we had the same intuition as Reviewer 2. In hindsight, the poor performance of the diffusion-binding model should be expected because in this model, the movement of the partition complex is governed by diffusion. There is no force involved and the ParA-ParB interactions only stall the partition complex without productively moving the partition complex in the \u2018right\u2019 direction."

As a result, the diffusion-binding model does not perform better than the model in which the partition complex only passively diffuses (no interaction with ParA-ATP dimers). In fact, the diffusion-binding model quantitatively performs worse than the diffusion-alone model because the only thing the ParA/ParB interaction does is to temporally stops the motion of the partition complex, slowing down its ultimate arrival at the opposite cell pole. We found that it was essential to include the elastic dynamics of the underlying DNA (which had not been considered before) to explain the translocation kinetics observed in vivo.

By epifluorescence microscopy, this region appears as a single diffraction-limited spot (Lin et al., PNAS, 1997, Glaser et al., Genes Dev, 1997), indicating that the most distal <i>parS</i> sites are separated by \u2264 250 nm. As suggested by the reviewer, we have expanded the \u2018diffusion-binding\u2019 model to consider the cases of two ParB/<i>parS</i> assemblies (two spheres of 35 nm of radius) separated by a flexible linker of varying lengths to simulate the reviewer\u2019s scenario. The reason for using a radius of 35 nm is to make the surface area of the two ParB spheres comparable to the surface area of the single partition complex sphere (50 nm of radius) used in the original model (2\u00b7\u03c0\u00b735<sup>2</sup> \u2248 \u03c0\u00b750<sup>2</sup>). Our simulations show that separating the <i>parS</i> sites by up to 400 nm had little, if any, positive effect on translocation (unpublished result), further supporting the notion that the elastic dynamics of the underlying DNA must be considered to obtain the translocation kinetics observed inside cells. Since the partition complex of <i>C. crescentus</i> is unlikely to form two or more ParB assemblies, we feel that these data do not belong to this manuscript. We would therefore prefer to publish these results elsewhere together with follow-up studies<i>.</i>"
