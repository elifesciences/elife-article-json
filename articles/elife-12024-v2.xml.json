Using measurements of capillary erythrocyte-associated transients, fluctuations of oxygen partial pressure (Po<sub>2</sub>) associated with individual erythrocytes, to infer Po<sub>2</sub> in the nearby neuropil, we report the first non-invasive micron-scale mapping of cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> in awake, resting mice. Interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> has similar values in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex, whereas there are large capillary hematocrit and erythrocyte flux differences. Awake tissue Po<sub>2</sub> is about half that under isoflurane anesthesia, and within the cortex, vascular and interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> values display layer-specific differences which dramatically contrast with those recorded under anesthesia. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring energy parameters non-invasively in physiological conditions to precisely quantify and model brain metabolism."

Using measurements of capillary erythrocyte-associated transients, fluctuations of oxygen partial pressure (Po<sub>2</sub>) associated with individual erythrocytes, to infer Po<sub>2</sub> in the nearby neuropil, we report the first non-invasive micron-scale mapping of cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> in awake, resting mice. Interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> has similar values in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex, whereas there are large capillary hematocrit and erythrocyte flux differences. Awake tissue Po<sub>2</sub> is about half that under isoflurane anesthesia, and within the cortex, vascular and interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> values display layer-specific differences which dramatically contrast with those recorded under anesthesia. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring energy parameters non-invasively in physiological conditions to precisely quantify and model brain metabolism."

If the blood flow to brain tissue is cut off as happens in stroke, or if an individual stops breathing, the brain becomes deprived of oxygen and brain cells will be damaged and die. To better understand how the brain works in health and disease, scientists need to learn how much oxygen the blood must deliver to the brain tissue to adequately support the activities of brain cells."

Then, the animals were allowed to recover for a few weeks, and were trained to get them used to how they would be handled during the experiments. After this period, the oxygen concentrations and blood flow in different parts of the mouse brains were measured in fine detail using the microscope while the animals were awake and relaxed."

Numerous methods have been used to monitor brain oxygenation, and the most spatially resolved approaches have long relied on fine Clark-type electrodes (for review see <a href=\"#bib25\">Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007</a>), which have been used to report resting-state Po<sub>2</sub> and local oxygen consumption in various brain regions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lecoq et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Masamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Offenhauser et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Thompson et al., 2003</a>) during neuronal activation. However, these electrodes are invasive, do not faithfully report Po<sub>2</sub> in vessels and cannot easily be used to determine Po<sub>2</sub> in physiological conditions, that\u00a0is, in awake, unstressed animals, avoiding the use of anesthetics. As anesthetics affect resting and evoked neuronal and astrocyte activity, arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, the physiological values of cerebral interstitial Po<sub>2\u00a0</sub>and their relationship to blood flow parameters in capillaries remain unknown."

In addition, by detecting single red blood cells (RBCs) during Po<sub>2</sub> measurement, we demonstrated the possibility of simultaneously monitoring blood flow and Po<sub>2</sub> in capillaries (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lecoq et al., 2011</a>) and of detecting erythrocyte-associated transients (EATs), Po<sub>2</sub> fluctuations associated with each individual erythrocyte flowing in capillaries, which were first reported in mesentery capillaries (<a href=\"#bib9\">Golub and Pittman, 2005</a>). We showed that in olfactory bulb glomeruli of anesthetized mice, one parameter of EATs, the Po<sub>2</sub> in between two red blood cells (Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC), is at equilibrium with, and thus reports, the Po<sub>2</sub> in the nearby neuropil (<a href=\"#bib28\">Parpaleix et al., 2013</a>).

This contrasts with the large differences of capillary hematocrit and RBC flow values observed between the two brain regions. In addition, we find that in the cortex capillary and interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> values display layer-specific differences, being lower in layer I than in layer II/III or layer IV. We also find that hemoglobin in brain capillaries is highly saturated with oxygen. Finally, we show that in both brain regions, the interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> is much lower during wakefulness than under isoflurane anesthesia."

In brief, over the course of 2\u20133 days, each mouse was habituated to handling, and trained to run on a treadmill placed in its cage. A titanium bar was then surgically attached to the cranium and then a cranial window implanted over the region of interest, either the olfactory bulb or the somatosensory cortex. Then, over 2\u20134 weeks, the mouse was progressively habituated to being head-fixed, via the attached bar, in the dark, below the objective of the two-photon microscope, and with the limbs and body free to move on the treadmill. Habituation was achieved when the animal remained calm for periods &gt;1\u2009hr in the set-up with short bouts of running (~30 s). On the day of recording, the animal was briefly anesthetized (2% isoflurane, &lt;5 min) and the oxygen sensor PtP-C343 was injected intravenously. The animal was returned to its home cage, and after a delay of 90\u2013120 min, Po<sub>2</sub> recordings sessions of 1\u20133\u2009hr commenced. Each animal underwent 1\u20133 recording sessions per day over the course of 2\u20137 days, with breaks of at least several hours between each session. Note that similar Po<sub>2</sub> values were obtained from one day to the next and between sessions occurring the same day (without reinjection of PtP-C343)."

Po<sub>2</sub> measured at the RBC border (Po<sub>2</sub>RBC) was significantly larger than at mid-distance between two RBCs (Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC). Po<sub>2</sub>Mean, which was intermediate between these two values, is the average Po<sub>2</sub> measured in a capillary without taking into account the existence of EATs, and is the only capillary Po<sub>2</sub> value that has commonly been reported in the brain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sakadzi\u0107 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Vovenko, 1999</a>). Several measurements were made in each capillary but the average values of Po<sub>2</sub>RBC, Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC and Po<sub>2</sub>Mean were similar whether calculated on all measurements or on all capillaries (262 measurements: Po<sub>2</sub>RBC = 60.5 \u00b1 0.9 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC = 23.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>Mean = 32.8 \u00b1 0.7 mm Hg. 38 capillaries: Po<sub>2</sub>RBC = 60.6 \u00b1 2.3 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC = 23 \u00b1 1.5 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>Mean = 32.7 \u00b1 1.9 mm Hg) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The standard deviation of measurements (SD) made in a given capillary, during single or multiple recording sessions were modest for Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC (mean SD = 2.6 \u00b1 0.3 mm Hg) and slightly larger for Po<sub>2</sub>RBC (mean SD = 5.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm Hg). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> illustrates that average Po<sub>2</sub> values masked the large span of all values measured. This was particularly true for Po<sub>2</sub>RBC, for which values frequently exceeded 70 mm Hg. Overall, these data show that in the glomerular layer of the awake resting mouse, interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> ranges from 15 to\u00a035 mm Hg in about 82% of our measurements. We then investigated whether the range and fluctuations of Po<sub>2</sub>values depend on two vascular parameters, RBC blood flow and hematocrit, in the same capillaries."

It differently affects regional cerebral blood flow in humans (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ramani and Wardhan, 2008</a>), and modulates neurovascular coupling in a concentration-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Masamoto et al., 2009</a>) as well as the relationship between spontaneous or evoked neuronal activity with BOLD signal (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aksenov et al., 2015</a>). However, its effects on brain oxygenation have only been investigated using approaches with low spatial resolution and which did not allow simultaneous measurement of blood flow (<a href=\"#bib20\">Liu et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ortiz-Prado et al., 2010</a>). We performed paired measurements of EATs and flow parameters in a set of capillaries, both when the animals were awake and when they were anesthetized with isoflurane (~0.75% as measured at the animal\u2019s snout, delivered in air with no supplementary O<sub>2</sub>). As can be seen from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, isoflurane significantly increases all capillary Po<sub>2</sub> values (Po<sub>2</sub>Mean, Po<sub>2</sub>RBC and Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC). This effect was present in all but one of the capillaries tested. Although reduced neuronal activity (and hence O<sub>2</sub> consumption) in the isoflurane anesthetized state (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aksenov et al., 2015</a>) is likely to play a role, it appears that this elevation of Po<sub>2</sub> largely resulted from an increase in RBC flow, as the increase in Po<sub>2</sub> values observed is in accordance with that which would be predicted from the observed increase in RBC flow based on the relationship presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>. This increase in capillary RBC flow rate is related to isoflurane\u2019s vasodilatory effects on large vessels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Koenig et al., 1994</a>). Consequently, cellular processes, including neuronal activity in response to odor, occur at a much higher oxygen concentration during isoflurane anesthesia than in the awake, resting state, and this difference is likely to be exacerbated when isoflurane is delivered in gas mixtures where [O<sub>2</sub>] is greater than 21% (as in many other studies). Since the olfactory bulb glomerular layer has a specific neuronal and vascular organisation that could be a main determinant of Po<sub>2</sub> values, we extended our investigation of tissue oxygenation to the cerebral cortex, due to its importance to higher cognitive functions and its use as an ischemic model."

Due to the greater inter-capillary distance in the cortex than in the glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lecoq et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sakad\u017ei\u0107 et al., 2014</a>), and as Po<sub>2</sub> gradients have previously been observed around blood vessels in anesthetized animals (<a href=\"#bib5\">Devor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sakadzi\u0107 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sharan et al., 2008</a>), it is likely that there are tissue regions, in areas far from the nearest capillary, in which the Po<sub>2</sub> is lower than what is reported by Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC. Nonetheless, based on our previous results (<a href=\"#bib28\">Parpaleix et al., 2013</a>) in olfactory bulb glomeruli and on theoretical predictions (<a href=\"#bib21\">L\u00fccker et al., 2014</a>), we expect that Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC reports steady-state tissue Po<sub>2</sub> up to a radius of approximately 10\u00a0\u00b5m from a capillary. Furthermore, recent work, that models hematocrit distribution in large microcirculatory networks and accurately replicates physiological RBC distribution, predicts that the distribution of oxygen in tissue volumes supplied by these networks is largely homogeneous (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gould and Linninger, 2015</a>). We thus consider that our measured values of Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC represent a significant proportion of the range of Po<sub>2</sub> values present in the cortical interstitium. Our Po<sub>2</sub> measurements revealed that the averages and ranges of Po<sub>2</sub> values in cortical capillaries (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>) were similar to those measured in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer (Po<sub>2</sub>RBC = 66.3 \u00b1 1.6 mm Hg, Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC = 23.3 \u00b1 1.1 mm Hg, and Po<sub>2</sub>Mean = 36.3 \u00b1 1.3 mm Hg), indicating that at rest in the awake state, these two brain areas have similar levels of both RBC, capillary and pericapillary oxygenation. In contrast, the average RBC flow and hematocrit values (41.9 \u00b1 1.8 cells/s and 47.3 \u00b1 0.9%, respectively) were significantly higher than those found in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) with the hematocrit values being higher than previously reported levels in the cerebral cortex of anesthetized animals (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hudetz, 1997</a>). The lower hematocrit levels in glomerular layer capillaries could be related to differences in the bulb cerebrovascular supply which, in contrast to the cortex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blinder et al., 2013</a>), is poorly established (<a href=\"#bib3\">Coyle, 1975</a>)."

As anesthetics could differently modulate synaptic activity and blood flow in layers I to IV, it is difficult to predict the extent to which Po<sub>2</sub> depth variations occur in the awake animal. We thus first measured Po<sub>2</sub> in descending and ascending large vessels and then compared Po<sub>2</sub>and blood flow parameters of capillaries from layers I to IV (from the surface to 410 \u00b5m in depth). Capillaries less than 60\u00a0\u03bcm below the surface were considered to be in layer I, those from 90\u00a0to\u00a0260\u00a0\u03bcm below the surface were classified as layer II/III capillaries and those deeper than 340\u00a0\u03bcm were considered layer IV capillaries (capillaries from 260 to 340 \u00b5m were not considered due the ambiguity of their location). Penetrating vessels (arterioles and venules) were traced from their point of descent below the surface down along their main trunk until they ramified into smaller vessels (or descended below 410\u00a0\u00b5m, which was the maximum depth at which we made measurements). Note that in these vessels EATs were not detectable due to the close apposition of RBCs. The mean Po<sub>2</sub> was 69.2 \u00b1 1.4 mm Hg for arterioles and 39.9 \u00b1 1.3 mm Hg for venules and, in contrast to what was reported in anesthetized animals (<a href=\"#bib5\">Devor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sakadzi\u0107 et al., 2010</a>), no gradient was observed with depth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>)."

In the awake rodent, brain oxygenation has previously only been investigated with lower resolution approaches. Liu et al. (<a href=\"#bib20\">Liu et al., 1995</a>) used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry with a lithium phthalocyanine crystal being implanted in the cerebral cortex of rats 24\u2009hr prior to the measurements. They reported that restrained and untrained rats have a cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> of about 34 mm Hg, which, surprisingly, was reduced by isoflurane anesthesia (1% in 21% O<sub>2</sub>) to about 24 mm Hg. This resting value (34 mm Hg) is significantly higher than our average interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> value, most probably due to the effects of the stress resulting from restraint in the absence of habituation. The effect of isoflurane, which decreased Po<sub>2</sub> is intriguing, and indicates that the main effect of isoflurane in this case was to abolish the Po<sub>2</sub> augmenting effects of stress. Interestingly, increasing the delay from crystal implantation to 7 days and introducing some habituation to restraint reduced cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> to 27 mm Hg (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dunn et al., 2000</a>). The best demonstration of physiological measurements of Po<sub>2</sub> has been performed in unrestrained rats, in which brain Po<sub>2</sub>was measured with an implanted fiber optic probe measuring quenching of an oxygen sensor (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ortiz-Prado et al., 2010</a>). Although the probe was very invasive, it reported an average bulk tissue Po<sub>2</sub> value of 25 mm Hg, a value very similar to ours. We are thus confident that Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC is an excellent reporter of the interstitial Po<sub>2</sub>, that our extensive habituation procedures are efficient, and that this study gives the first non-invasive and physiological values of Po<sub>2</sub>, hematocrit and capillary blood flow in the rodent brain."

Tissue Po<sub>2</sub> values have previously been reported to be in the range of ~5\u2013100 mm Hg, with the higher values occurring in regions close to pial arterioles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Devor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sakadzi\u0107 et al., 2010</a>). Our values of tissue Po<sub>2</sub> (Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC) lie in the lower end of this wide range, do not include measurements from the capillary-free peri-arteriolar regions, and so are likely to be reflective of the Po<sub>2</sub> levels that exist in the majority of the tissue, away from large arterioles. Considering intravascular Po<sub>2</sub>, our measurements of capillary Po<sub>2</sub>Mean (average \u224836 mm Hg in the cortex) seem to be broadly in agreement with those reported by <a href=\"#bib30\">Sakadzi\u0107 et al., 2010</a> (~25\u201335 mm Hg), but our recorded values of capillary RBC Po<sub>2</sub> (Po<sub>2</sub>RBC, average \u224866 mm Hg in the cortex), are dramatically higher than those published by <a href=\"#bib31\">Sakadzi\u0107 et al., 2014</a>, where the most frequent values were ~25\u201335 mm Hg. A prominent discrepancy between the results of previous studies and our findings in awake, resting animals relates to changes in cortical oxygenation with depth. Many previous studies report drops in interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> with increasing depth in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cross and Silver, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Devor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Masamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nair et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Whalen et al., 1970</a>), with Po<sub>2</sub> in layer I being higher than in underlying layers. In contrast, our measures of Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC suggest that interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> is lower in layer I than in either layer II/III or IV. These conflicting patterns of laminar variations of Po<sub>2</sub> also exist in comparisons of the mean vascular Po<sub>2</sub> values (Po<sub>2</sub>Mean), where previous 2PLM studies have reported decreases in mean vascular Po<sub>2</sub> in concert with decreases in penetrating arteriole and venule Po<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Devor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sakadzi\u0107 et al., 2010</a>) with increasing depth in the cortex. In the present study, we see an increase in capillary Po<sub>2</sub>Mean from layer I to deeper layers, and no gradient in penetrating vessel Po<sub>2</sub> with depth. It is possible that the deviation from normal physiological conditions inherent in anesthesia and acute surgical preparation, which we avoid with our approach, leads to the emergence of these disagreements."

Furthermore, examples were found in both brain regions where the Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC was below the value of ~3.4 mm Hg that has previously been reported as the critical Po<sub>2</sub> in brain tissue (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kasischke et al., 2011</a>). Similarly low tissue Po<sub>2</sub> measurements have previously been observed (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Whalen et al., 1973</a>), but their existence has been interpreted as being related to disruption of normal tissue physiology in the experimental preparations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>).

The animals received anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatment (Carprofen, one daily 0.15 mg subcutaneous injection, administered pre-surgically and for the three days post-surgery), antibiotics (Ceftrioxone, one daily 0.25 mg subcutaneous injection, administered pre-surgically and for the three days post-surgery) and dexamethasone to reduce cerebral edema (one daily 60 \u00b5g subcutaneous injection on the day before surgery, directly before the surgery and the first post-surgical day). Surgical anesthesia was induced with ketamine-xylazine (100 mg and 8 mg per kg body mass, respectively). During surgery, the mice breathed a mixture of air and supplementary oxygen (the final inhaled proportion of oxygen was ~30%) and the body temperature monitored by a rectal probe and maintained at ~36.5\u00b0C by a feedback-controlled heating pad. A craniotomy was performed with great care taken not to apply great pressure to the bone and the area was regularly flushed with cool aqueous buffer solution to avoid damage or heating of the underlying tissue.

In the days that preceded the surgery, the mice were gently habituated to handling, and provided with treats (sugar pellets, Bio-Serv). 2\u20133 days after the surgery restraint habituation began. The frame used for head restraint during the habituation and imaging consists of a metal frame in which the mouse\u2019s head-bar is secured, and a treadmill wheel (similar to that in the animal\u2019s home cage). This configuration allows the animal limbs and body to move freely while the head is stably fixed. All restraint-habituation sessions were carried out in the set-up that was used for imaging, with the animal kept in the near-dark at all times.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (Mw = 150\u00a0kDa) was often co-administered with PtP-C343 to enhance imaging contrast.

We implemented this delay of ~2\u2009hr between the injection and the following recording session to avoid potential confounding effects of the brief exposure to isoflurane or the effects of the injection itself. We found that the concentration of PtP-C343 in the blood typically remained sufficient for Po<sub>2</sub> measurements to be made over 1\u20133 days after an injection, allowing for multiple recording sessions to be made before reinjection was necessary.

The green channel was bandpass filtered (HQ 520/40\u00a0m, Chroma Technology Corp,\u00a0Bellows Falls, Vermont). The red channel had two shortpass filters (FF01-750/sp-25, Semrock, Rochester, New York), and one bandpass filter (HQ 680/60\u00a0m-2P, Chroma Technologies Corp), and a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (PMT, R10699, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan). PMT signals were amplified with custom-build electronics and sampled at 1.25 MHz by an acquisition card. Photons detected in the green channel during the on phase of the recording cycle were used to detect the borders of RBCs and extract RBC flow rates and hematocrit values (see below). Phosphorescence decays detected during the 'off'\u00a0period were averaged over a number of cycles (~5000\u201350,000 decays) and the lifetime of the phosphorescence determined by fitting a single exponential curve to the data. The first 6\u20137 bins (~5\u00a0\u00b5s) after the end of the on-phase were discarded. This lifetime measurement is then converted to a value of Po<sub>2</sub> using a calibration curve. We used the nonlinear least-squares method and the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to obtain the decay lifetimes and associated standard errors. We used a Stern-Volmer\u2013like calibration curve to convert the phosphorescence lifetimes into the corresponding Po<sub>2</sub> values. This analysis was performed using custom build software (see below) developed using LabView (National Instruments)."

(2013)</a> and <a href=\"#bib18\">Lecoq et al. (2011)</a>, see especially <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> therein). In brief, the fluorescence recorded during the excitation period of the cycle was analyzed and the passage of RBCs through the excitation point detected based on the associated dips in fluorescence intensity. These transient reductions in fluorescence intensity were detected and quantified using a binary threshold method, with the borders of the RBC corresponding to the full width at half maximum of the fluorescence dip. This allowed for the measurement of both capillary RBC flow rate (the number of RBCs detected per unit time) and hematocrit (the number of decay cycles originating from within RBCs as a percentage of the total number of decay cycles). The borders of the detected RBCs were used as time-stamps, and the phosphorescence decays recorded were binned according to their distance in time from the borders of the nearest RBC. The Po<sub>2</sub>RBC value was calculated from the average lifetime of decays recorded in the 1\u20134 ms around the border of the RBC, whereas the Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC was determined from average value of decays at mid-distance between RBCs (averaged over a window of at least 5 ms). The EAT-extraction custom-built software is now available online at the following address: <a href=\"https://github.com/charpak-lab/EAT-detection\">https://github.com/charpak-lab/EAT-detection</a>. Hemoglobin saturation (So<sub>2</sub>) was estimated from Po<sub>2</sub>RBC using the Hill equation, with a Hill coefficient (2.59) and P<sub>50</sub> (40.2 mm Hg), which are accurate for C57BL/6 mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Uchida et al., 1998</a>) and have previously been used to make estimations of mouse cerebral So<sub>2</sub> from Po<sub>2</sub> data (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sakad\u017ei\u0107 et al., 2014</a>)."

The current explanation links increased bloodstream oxygenation to the vasodilatory effect of isoflurane (subsection \u201cBrain oxygenation is greatly enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia\u201d). However, the increase in RBC flux (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) resulting from vasodilation would lead to a decrease in oxygen unloading from RBCs, as evidenced by the increase in RBC Po<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). If less oxygen is unloaded from the red blood cells, then less oxygen diffuses through the vessel wall, leading to a decrease in tissue oxygenation. This is contradicted by the statement that cellular processes occur at a higher oxygen concentration during isoflurane anaesthesia. This matter is further confused by the delivery of isoflurane in a 21% oxygen gas mixture."

This work extends a proven strategy of using compounds with a phosphorescence lifetime that is oxygen sensitive. The approach enables probe-specific calibration of oxygen levels using the phosphorescence lifetime. The methods (O<sub>2</sub> probe) although not developed by Charpak`s lab, is applied quite effectively here. The authors extend previous work by David Boas and make measurements of oxygenation from awake animals. The work examines different cortical layers and contrasts with olfactory bulb. The analysis and presentation of the data is strong. Novel data includes capillary specific measurements and relationships between local oxygenation and red blood cell flux.

Nonetheless, the facts that: 1. Our approach of placing the cover glass into the craniotomy and directly on to the dura mater surface seems to avoid the commonly described degradation (due to inflammation) and subsequent recovery of cranial window quality over the course of 2-3 weeks (Holtmaat et al. 2009), and 2.
