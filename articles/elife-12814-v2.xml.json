For example, V600E in the BRAF hydrophobic activation segment (AS) pocket accounts for &gt;95% of all kinase mutations. While many hypotheses tried to explain such significant mutation patterns, conclusive explanations are lacking. Here, we use experimental and in silico structure-energy statistical analyses, to elucidate why the V600E mutation, but no other mutation at this, or any other positions in BRAF\u2019s hydrophobic pocket, is predominant. We find that BRAF mutation frequencies depend on the equilibrium between the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket, the overall folding energy, the activation of the kinase and the number of bases required to change the corresponding amino acid. Using a random forest classifier, we quantitatively dissected the parameters contributing to BRAF AS cancer frequencies. These findings can be applied to genome-wide association studies and prediction models."

For example, V600E in the BRAF hydrophobic activation segment (AS) pocket accounts for &gt;95% of all kinase mutations. While many hypotheses tried to explain such significant mutation patterns, conclusive explanations are lacking. Here, we use experimental and in silico structure-energy statistical analyses, to elucidate why the V600E mutation, but no other mutation at this, or any other positions in BRAF\u2019s hydrophobic pocket, is predominant. We find that BRAF mutation frequencies depend on the equilibrium between the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket, the overall folding energy, the activation of the kinase and the number of bases required to change the corresponding amino acid. Using a random forest classifier, we quantitatively dissected the parameters contributing to BRAF AS cancer frequencies. These findings can be applied to genome-wide association studies and prediction models."

The \u201cvaline-to-glutamate\u201d mutation (often called V600E for short) disrupts the interactions that create this pocket. This in turn results in a permanently active form of BRAF and uncontrolled cell growth. However, it remains unclear why the valine-to-glutamate mutation is so much more common in cancer cells than any other mutation that could affect the pocket in BRAF."

                        "text": "In a time of personalized medicine and tumor sequencing, determining which missense mutations affect disease phenotype and exploring the role of cellular and environmental context are crucial. In many oncogenes, mutations are enriched at specific amino acid positions (\u2018mutation hotspots\u2019), and it is not usually obvious if rare substitutions are passengers or disease-causing mutations. A striking example is the oncogenic serine/threonine kinase BRAF, for which the V600E mutation in its kinase activation segment (AS) accounts for &gt;95% of all BRAF cancer mutations. BRAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is an upstream regulator of cellular responses such as cell division and differentiation and is mediated by the MEK/ERK signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib10\">Garnett and Marais, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wellbrock et al., 2004</a>). BRAF kinase is found mutated in both germline diseases (e.g. cardiofaciocutaneous and Noonan syndromes; (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rauen, 2013</a>) and somatic cancers of the thyroid, skin, colon, and lung (<a href=\"#bib17\">Holderfield et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ascierto et al., 2012</a>). BRAF contains an N-terminal region with a Ras-binding domain, which is followed by a cysteine-rich motif and a C-terminal kinase domain. BRAF is autoinhibited in a closed conformation by the interaction of the N-terminal conserved region 2 (following the Ras-binding and cysteine-rich domains) with the kinase domain, mediated by the interaction of two phosphorylated residues, Ser365 and Ser729, with a 14-3-3 dimer (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brummer et al., 2006</a>). Upon dephosphorylation of the N-terminal phosphorylated Ser365 by phosphatase PPII, the Ras-binding domain is free to interact with Ras at the plasma membrane. This releases autoinhibition and enables either homodimerization or heterodimerization with CRAF, ARAF, or KSR17; subsequent phosphorylation in the AS at Thr599 and Ser602 results in kinase activation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hmitou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zhang and Guan, 2000</a>; for a recent review on the topic see <a href=\"#bib24\">Lavoie and Therrien, 2015</a>)."

AS residues undergo hydrophobic interactions with the phosphate-binding loop and the \u2018\u03b1C helix\u2019 of the N-terminal lobe (making the \u2018hydrophobic pocket\u2019), locking the kinase in its inactive state. In addition, the misalignment of spatially conserved hydrophobic residues in the N- and C terminal lobes (\u2018hydrophobic spines\u2019) prevents catalytic activation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lavoie and Therrien, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2015</a>). Phosphorylation within the AS causes structural rearrangements of the AS, the \u03b1C helix and the phosphate-binding loop, reorienting the catalytic Asp of the DFG motif in a catalysis-competent orientation, thereby causing BRAF to become active."

In principle, other mutations at the AS (such as Leu597 mutated into Glu), or in other parts of the hydrophobic pocket (e.g V487 into Glu or Leu525 into Glu), should also release the AS and cause constitutive kinase activation. Thus, to answer this question, we performed combined structure-energy, experimental and statistical analyses of mutations in the hydrophobic pocket. We show that V600E is the only single nucleotide substitution (Asp, Lys, and Arg, require two bases substitutions) that opens the AS through destabilization of autoinhibitory interactions, without significantly impairing the folding of the inactive or active kinase domain. We show that other mutations requiring three base substitutions (i.e. V600H) have kinase activities similar to V600E. We provide a quantitative measure for all parameters that contribute to BRAF cancer mutation frequencies by evaluating their importance using a random forest classifier. We anticipate that our results can be translated to other kinases and disease-causing proteins, provided that high-resolution X-ray structures are available."

We performed FoldX-based molecular modeling of amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic pocket of BRAF using active-like (4MNE\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Haling et al., 2014</a>), 3OG7 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bollag et al., 2010</a>) and the V600E mutant 4MNF (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haling et al., 2014</a>)) and inactive-like (4EHE (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mathieu et al., 2012</a>) and 3TV6 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wenglowsky et al., 2011</a>)) BRAF \u2018template\u2019 structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Using FoldX, we mutated every amino acid residue in the hydrophobic pocket of the five selected active and inactive structures to all amino acids, including itself (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). This resulted in a total of 5 x 280 = 1400 structural models, and the change in folding energy (\u25b3\u25b3G BRAF Mutant-WT) was determined (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Pairwise correlations of energies derived from active structures or inactive structures, respectively, show a good overall correlation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In contrast, poor correlations were found when comparing energies from active and inactive structures, supporting the classification of the template structures."

                                "text": "All structural models with a change in FoldX energy (\u25b3\u25b3G BRAF Mutant \u2013 WT) &gt; 0.8 kcal were considered, as destabilizing mutants as this energy corresponds to a value twice the standard deviation of the energies calculated using the FoldX force field. To interpret the changes in FoldX energies, we needed to take into account several considerations (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). First, mutations that destabilize the inactive conformation (\u25b3\u25b3G BRAF_inactive) will drive the protein into a complex with chaperones (i.e. HSP90; <a href=\"#bib12\">Grbovic et al., 2006</a>) and/or aggregation/degradation, thereby decreasing its overall effective concentration. Second, mutations that destabilize the active conformation (\u25b3\u25b3G BRAF_active) will also result in the protein having a decreased effective concentration (unless they favor heterodimer formation and cause paradoxical activation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Heidorn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Poulikakos et al., 2010</a>)). Third, unfavorable energy changes in the AS loop of the inactive structures will favor its release and therefore kinase activation (\u25b3\u25b3G BRAF_inactive_loop). Structural inspection of 28 BRAF structures with different inhibitors showed that the AS loop between Leu597 and Gly615 is moderately to highly flexible (high B-factors) and consequently is unsolved in many structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Position Val600 is moderately flexible (70% solved in X-ray structures). This confirms previous predictions that the AS loop belongs to a region within the kinase domain (intra domain region) that has a large tendency to be disordered (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lu et al., 2015</a>). Also, previous enhanced-sampling structure-based computational simulations proposed that the AS exhibited a significant tendency to switch from the ordered to unstructured conformation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marino et al., 2015</a>). Mutations in regions of high flexibility will have less impact on the unfolding of BRAF compared to those in conformational restricted regions. Thus, for the inactive state, we corrected the folding energies of the mutations in the AS loop (\u25b3\u25b3G BRAF_inactive) by the frequency for which the corresponding position is solved in the 28 crystal structures. This correction was not applied to the active-like structures because for these three active structures residues were solved only until position 600. The only available structure for which the loop had been solved (4MNE), had a high B-factor from position 601 onwards, but as there was no significant destabilization seen by FoldX, no correction was applied. After applying all these factors, we found several mutations that release the AS (FoldX energies above the threshold of 0.8 kcal/mol) and therefore could activate the kinase (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

After correcting for differences in BRAF expression levels, we found that BRAF V600E phosphorylated MEK at higher levels than wild-type BRAF, and as predicted by FoldX, at similar levels to the double-nucleotide substitutions of V600D and V600K. In contrast, BRAF V600M and V600A yielded wild-type levels of MEK phosphorylation, suggesting that these are in fact passenger mutations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The remaining mutations gave intermediate MEK phosphorylation levels. Indeed, the V600G mutation, which is also found in the germline and causes CFC syndrome (<a href=\"#bib7\">Champion et al., 2011</a>) is\u00a0an intermediate MEK activity mutant."

We confirmed this further by identifying mutations that were not found in cancer (at positions 597 and 600 in the AS), that required three base changes, and that were predicted to be as activating as the most frequent cancer mutation found at these positions. Expression of these mutants (L597Y and V600H) in cells resulted in medium and high kinase activity as predicted (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

This supports our hypothesis that structural movements in the flexible AS could partially accommodate bulkier hydrophobic residues in the inactive orientation. Thus, we included the chemical nature/hydrophobicity as another factor.

We next wanted to analyze why no other mutation in the hydrophobic pocket - in a different position to Val600 - is found frequently mutated in cancer. Based on FoldX structure-energy calculations, we predicted that mutations in the hydrophobic pocket that destabilize the pocket and may thereby release the AS, would also affect the folding of the inactive and/or active kinase, thereby reducing the effective concentration and thus resulting in lower MEK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We experimentally tested three mutations (V487E, L525E and F498S) that required one, or two (L525E) base changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). F498S is predicted to be the most destabilizing, followed by L525E and V487E. By analyzing the soluble and insoluble fractions from transiently\u00a0transfected HEK293 cells, we determined that the ratios between soluble and insoluble BRAF were similar for wild-type and the V600E and V600W mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), while the V487E and L252E mutants resulted in significantly more insoluble protein. It is important to note that due to the very low levels of the BRAF F498S protein, it could only be detected when loaded in a 10-fold excess of lysate compared to wild-type (with no separation into soluble and insoluble fractions; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

However, despite the low levels of soluble F498S protein, it phosphorylated MEK at approximately the same level as wild-type BRAF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), while the V487E and L525E mutants, after normalizing by the total soluble protein gave higher MEK phosphorylation levels than wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

This is the mode of interaction for all so-called \u2018RD\u2019 kinases that become activated through phosphorylation within the activation segment (<a href=\"#bib19\">Johnson and Lewis, 2001</a>). Structural inspection after superimposing all kinases suggests that mutating Lys601 to Glu could also lead to interaction with Arg575, with a small conformational change (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Thus, we added favorable energies to the Asp and Glu mutations made at those positions (the added energy value was determined by mutating phospho-Ser to Ser in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase structure (PDB entry 1ATP; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zheng et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 5A</a>). This did not apply to position 600, however, which always points away from Arg575 in the active conformation, irrespective of if it is a Val or Glu, similar to the equivalent position in many other active kinases (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), and whose contribution to the active conformation energy is null. Finally, although in the V600E structure (PDB entry 4MNF) Glu600 forms a salt bridge with Lys507 in the \u03b1C helix (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haling et al., 2014</a>),\u00a0both residues are solvent exposed, and the Lys side chain is not structurally constrained. Therefore, the possible salt-bridge energy contribution is negligible (FoldX energy calculations suggest no energetic contribution between Glu600 and Lys507 (\u25b3\u25b3G (E600A) = 0.04+/- 0.1 kcal/mol). This explains why mutations to Lys or Arg are as activating as Glu and Asp."

In normal growth medium, we observed either no change (V600E) or a slight reduction (V600K) in MEK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This suggests that by opening the AS and preventing its closure, the kinase becomes active, independent of phosphorylation. These results were additionally supported by mutating Glu611 to Ala in the context of V600E. As Glu611 forms a salt bridge with Arg575, this interaction may partially stabilize the open conformation. However, as MEK phosphorylation did not change (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6B\u2013C</a>), it is more likely that this salt bridge contributes little or nothing to stabilization."

In addition to the six parameters described above, we also included as a parameter the change in codon usage frequency due to a mutation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). If a frequent codon is mutated to a rare one, this could affect translation efficiency and protein levels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lampson et al., 2013</a>). To see if a combination of the factors discussed above can be used to predict the observed mutation frequency in cancer, we constructed a random forest classifier (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). This ensemble learning technique identifies the contributions of individual \u2018trees\u2019 (here, FoldX energies, nucleotide substitutions, and codon frequencies) to an output (here, cancer frequencies). As values not given in the training set cannot be extrapolated by the random forest method, we ran two sets of 100 predictions. For each prediction, we trained with a random subset of samples, using \u223c70% of the data and balancing mutations with low and high cancer frequencies. The V600E mutation was included in only one set, and the importance values for all seven parameters for all sets were kept. Next, we ran the trained random forest on the remaining \u223c30% of the data and calculated the root mean square deviation (RMSD) as well as the correlation between the real data and the predicted values. The ratio of this correlation to the RMSD was us as a performance indicator for each run. The importance values of the seven different parameters were similar between sets, suggesting that the presence or absence of V600E did not affect the training outcome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The AS loop energy was the highest contributor to the random forest prediction of cancer frequencies (parameter 3; \u223c70% ), while parameters 2 (folding energy active conformation), 4 (nucleotide substitution frequency), 5 (change in codon usage frequency), and 7 (hydrophobic solvation energy) contributed almost equally, and 1 and 6 (destabilization of inactive conformation and the salt bridge) had very little contribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Ensemble methods, such as random forests, have several advantages compared to non-ensemble machine-learning methods, such as better handling of small sample sizes and high dimensionality, increased robustness and limited overfitting. The contributions of the different features calculated in this study are quite robust, and in the two cases analyzed (with and without V600E in the training set), they were found to be comparable and to follow the same order."

By using structure-energy calculations and a number of nucleotide substitutions, we were able to reconcile why V600E is by far the most frequent cancer mutation. We show here, that the effect of a mutation on folding depends on the structural flexibility of the respective hydrophobic pocket where the mutated amino acid is located (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, left side). Position Val600 is in a region where the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket causes activation of the kinase as structural flexibility still allows for proper folding. In contrast, those mutations in structurally rigid areas of the hydrophobic pocket only slightly increase the catalytic activity while increasing destabilization, and thus rapidly cause unfolding of BRAF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, right side)."

Our results underscore the importance of considering the number of base substitutions required for a given mutation in genome-wide association studies. Rare mutations can be passengers or drivers, depending on the number of base substitutions needed. Additionally, individuals with silent mutations at critical hotspot positions may acquire rare disease mutations infrequently found in cancer. Finally, mutations that both activate and slightly destabilize a protein may be rescued by random fluctuations in the chaperone levels present in a population (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lehner, 2013</a>). Consideration of these factors in combination with protein design algorithms may also offer mechanistic explanations of why certain mutations are found at higher frequencies in other oncogenic proteins."

The FoldX algorithm enables predictions of mutational affects for any of the 20 natural amino acids, but not for any backbone changes. Prior to any mutagenesis, we optimized the total energy of the protein using the RepairPDB option of FoldX, which identifies and repairs those residues with bad torsion angles and van der Waals clashes. Mutagenesis was performed using the BuildModel option of FoldX, with five repetitions per mutation. Stabilities were calculated using the Stability command of FoldX, and \u0394\u0394G values were computed by subtracting the energy of the wild-type from that of the mutant."

Two sets of 100 random forests each were constructed. In one set, the V600E mutant was always included in the training set of the classifiers, while in the other it was not. Random forests used \u223c70% of the samples for the training, with the remaining \u223c30% was used for performance testing. All random forests were trained with the same parameters. The number of trees was set to 40, as a further increase did not improve the performance of the predictor. The number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split of the trees was set to four. To assess the significance of each of the features used in the random forest and how they contribute to the prediction outcome, we determined the importance of each of them. This value is computed by calculating the total decrease in node impurities when splitting on a certain variable. This means that every time a specific variable is used for a split in any of the trees in the forest, the decrease in the impurity of the child nodes, respect to the parent node, is calculated. In regression random forests, this is done by calculating the residual sum of squares, comparing the predicted value of the forest with the real value, for each of the samples in the training. It is expected that the residual sum of squares decreases at each split, thus improving the tree. The larger the decrease, the better the split, and thus the variable used is considered more important. For each variable, the decrease in the node impurity is calculated every time it is used for a split in any of the trees, and the values are added to determine the importance of this variable. The features that contribute most to the random forest prediction will have larger importance values."

For each seeding-transfection-(stimulation)-lysis experiment, HEK293 cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes and transfected after 24\u2009hr (at 80% confluence) with 1 \u03bcg of BRAF plasmid, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,\u00a0Thermo Fisher Scientific,\u00a0Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 24\u2009hr, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 25 mM Tris [pH 7.8], 1:1000 protease inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2 [Sigma]). For EGF stimulation experiments, cells were transfected (in serum-free medium) and then, after 1 day, stimulated with 50 ng of EGF or HRG, in 3 ml, for the indicated times, washed with PBS and lysed as above. To fractionate cells into soluble and insoluble fractions, cells were first lysed in hypertonic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1:1000 protease inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 [Sigma]), sonicated for 5\u2009min, and centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 3000 rpm, after which the supernatant was removed (\u2018soluble fraction\u2019). The pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (\u2018insoluble fraction\u2019). Cell lysates were loaded for Western blot analysis. Blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo 34096) and visualized with a LAS-3000 imager (Fujifilm Co.). Two to three biological sample replicates were generated in each seeding-transfection-lysis experiment and analyzed on the identical Western blot (\u2018biological replicates performed at the same day\u2019). Up to eight different seeding-transfection-lysis experiments were performed (\u2018biological replicates performed at different days\u2019). The intensity of protein bands for MEK-p and flag (for total BRAF levels) was quantified with ImageJ. MEK-p levels were normalized by total BRAF levels (using the flag antibody). To compare biological replicates performed at different days MEK-p/BRAF total intensities were referenced to WT (=100%). While the relative intensity changes between WT and mutants always followed the same trend in all biological replicates performed at different days, the quantitative intensity spread could vary (e.g. for V600E between 180% to 400% compared to WT). To compare intensities from Western blots from different days, we averaged experiments that had a similar intensity spread. The following antibodies were used for Western blotting: Flag (Sigma, F1804), phospho-BRAF Ser445 (Cell Signaling, #2330), phospho-MEK Ser217 and Ser221 (Cell Signaling, #9121), \u03b2-actin (Thermo, MA5-15739), and total BRAF (SIGMA, HPA001328)."

Through energetic analyses of the effects of mutations on the overall fold stability of BRAF kinase and the mutations' impact to the catalytically active conformation using FoldX, an empirical structure-based energetic function, the authors showed that the high occurrence of V600E is rooted in the unique combination of promoting the catalytically active kinase conformation and maintaining the overall fold stability of the kinase domain by this mutation. It is further shown that the high occurrence of V600E is in part attributed to the fact that the mutation involves only a single nucleotide change in the codon, as V600D and V600K mutations, which are shown to be similar to V600E in terms of energetics and kinase activity, are much rarer for their requirement of two nucleotide in the codon. This work underscores the balance between functional alteration and impact to the overall fold stability of the protein behind a high-occurrence driver oncogenic mutation."

In terms of language and details of the figures, the manuscript is somewhat under-polished and not close to a near publishable condition.

The folding energies of the inactive structures (DDG BRAF_inactive) have been corrected at regions of high flexibility (such as the AS loop).
