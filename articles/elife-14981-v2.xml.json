Here we discern the functional architecture of human NELF through X-ray crystallography, protein crosslinking, biochemical assays, and RNA crosslinking in cells. We identify a NELF core subcomplex formed by conserved regions in subunits NELF-A and NELF-C, and resolve its crystal structure. The NELF-AC subcomplex binds single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro, and NELF-C associates with RNA in vivo. A positively charged face of NELF-AC is involved in RNA binding, whereas the opposite face of the NELF-AC subcomplex binds NELF-B. NELF-B is predicted to form a HEAT repeat fold, also binds RNA in vivo, and anchors the subunit NELF-E, which is confirmed to bind RNA in vivo. These results reveal the three-dimensional architecture and three RNA-binding faces of NELF."

Here we discern the functional architecture of human NELF through X-ray crystallography, protein crosslinking, biochemical assays, and RNA crosslinking in cells. We identify a NELF core subcomplex formed by conserved regions in subunits NELF-A and NELF-C, and resolve its crystal structure. The NELF-AC subcomplex binds single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro, and NELF-C associates with RNA in vivo. A positively charged face of NELF-AC is involved in RNA binding, whereas the opposite face of the NELF-AC subcomplex binds NELF-B. NELF-B is predicted to form a HEAT repeat fold, also binds RNA in vivo, and anchors the subunit NELF-E, which is confirmed to bind RNA in vivo. These results reveal the three-dimensional architecture and three RNA-binding faces of NELF."

NELF is associated with chromatin (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wu et al., 2005</a>) and represses transcription elongation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</a>).

NELF is required for the regulation of the heat stress gene <i>hsp70</i> (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wu et al., 2003</a>), immediate early genes such as <i>junb</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aida et al., 2006</a>), and expression of genes of the human immunodeficiency virus (<a href=\"#bib52\">Natarajan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>).

Elucidating this mechanism requires structural information of\u00a0the NELF complex. Here we show that regions of human NELF-A and NELF-C form a highly conserved core subcomplex with a novel fold. One side of this NELF-AC subcomplex exhibits a conserved binding face for single-stranded nucleic acids. RNA binding experiments in human cells reveal that NELF-B, NELF-C, and NELF-E associate with RNA in vivo. Our data provide the first structural model of NELF and extend our understanding of its RNA binding surfaces."

NELF-C adopts a horseshoe-like structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). NELF-C consists of 22 \u03b1-helices (\u03b11\u2019-\u03b122\u2019) and a small two-stranded \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21\u2019-\u03b22\u2019, residues 367\u2013379) that protrudes from the surface. The C-terminal half of NELF-C (helices \u03b114\u2019-\u03b119\u2019) forms three HEAT repeats (H1-H3). The HEAT repeat region shows structural similarity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</a>) to the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Meinhart and Cramer, 2004</a>) and the polyadenylation factor symplekin (<a href=\"#bib74\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>). Despite the presence of a CID-like fold, NELF-AC did not show significant binding to CTD diheptad peptides carrying phosphorylations at CTD residues serine-2, serine-5, serine-2 and serine-5, or a consensus non-phosphorylated CTD diheptad peptide (not shown).

The TAR RNA is used to recruit P-TEFb and other factors to promoter proximally paused Pol II (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ott et al., 2011</a>). The NELF-E RRM domain binds the HIV-1 TAR RNA in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Pagano et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fujinaga et al., 2004</a>) and is postulated to regulate Pol II elongation by associating with the TAR element (<a href=\"#bib33\">Karn and Stoltzfus, 2012</a>). To expand our understanding of NELF association with the TAR RNA stem loop, we performed fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments with our collection of NELF variants and a 5\u2019 FAM labeled TAR stem loop. Binding experiments performed with the WT NELF complex revealed strong association between NELF and the TAR RNA stem loop (146 \u00b1 30\u00a0nM), similar to affinities reported by the Lis group for the isolated human NELF-E RRM and the TAR stem loop (200 \u00b1 10\u00a0nM) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pagano et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, NELF complexes lacking the NELF-E RRM or NELF-E retained the ability to associate with the TAR stem loop albeit with a \u22486\u201310-fold reduction in binding affinity (869 \u00b1 140\u00a0nM NELF\u00a0\u2206RRM, NELF-ABC 1.32 \u00b1 0.18\u00a0\u00b5M). To determine which subcomplex of NELF is responsible for the non-RRM mediated association with the TAR stem loop, we tested binding of NELF-AC and NELF-BE (1\u2013138) to the TAR stem loop. NELF-BE (1\u2013138) modestly associated with the TAR stem loop (5.6 \u00b1 1.0\u00a0\u00b5M) whereas NELF-AC showed little association (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This further suggests that RNA binding by NELF-AC is influenced by RNA sequence and/or structure and that NELF associates with RNA on surfaces outside of the RRM domain."

Our biochemical experiments demonstrate that NELF additionally binds to single-stranded nucleic acids via NELF-B and NELF-AC in vitro.

To this end, structures of the involved multi-protein components are required.

However, structural information about NELF is lacking, except for the RRM domain of NELF-E (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">2008</a>). To close this gap, we report here the crystal structure of the conserved core NELF subcomplex NELF-AC and the architecture of the 4-subunit, complete NELF complex. We further show that NELF-B and NELF-AC bind single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro, and that NELF-B and NELF-C, in addition to NELF-E, associate with RNA in vivo. These results provide an important step in understanding NELF function and provide the basis for a mechanistic analysis of the role of NELF in promoter-proximal pausing."

Future structural studies are required to determine the nucleic acid binding surfaces of NELF-B and to determine how RNA snakes from the NELF-E RRM through the rest of the complex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>).

Such gene specificity may be explained by differences in promoter-proximal DNA regions. How can DNA sequence influence pausing? First, certain sequences may lead to DNA-RNA hybrids that favor Pol II pausing by slowing down the elongation rate, similar to DNA sequences that influence pausing of bacterial RNA polymerase or <i>Drosophila</i> Pol II (<a href=\"#bib40\">Larson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Greive and Hippel, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nechaev et al., 2010</a>). DNA sequence also affects binding of proteins such as GAGA factor and estrogen receptor, which both are reported to recruit NELF to specific genes to induce pausing (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aiyar et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Second, nascent RNA may bind to NELF with different affinities, influencing the efficiency of NELF recruitment to pause sites. Indeed, we observed that nucleic acid binding of NELF-AC may depend on the nucleic acid sequence, and it is known that the RNA-binding activity of the NELF-E RRM domain is sequence-dependent (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pagano et al., 2014</a>). It is also known that DNA regions differ in their GC content (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ginno et al., 2012</a>) and in <i>Drosophila</i> a sequence motif was reported to be associated with pausing (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hendrix et al., 2008</a>). Third, nucleosome stabilities vary with DNA sequence and nucleosomes are known to influence Pol II elongation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gilchrist et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mayer et al., 2015</a>)."

Analysis of this intricate mechanism awaits structural studies of functional complexes comprising Pol II, DSIF, NELF and additional factors.

Crosslinking data obtained with full NELF complex purified from insect cells (data not shown) is arguably the most informative about the structure of NELF complex, compared to data obtained from other incomplete NELF subcomplexes.

For example, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> should have several negative controls, such as sequences that occur in <i>junB</i> or <i>fos</i> well downstream of the pause site, sequences that won't form simple single stranded regions, such as hairpins, etc. However, if the authors concur that the RNA binding is likely non-specific charge-charge interactions, this should be clearly spelled out in the manuscript."

First, the bands for NELF-C/D are not well separated from NELF-B, making it totally possible that they are in fact detecting NELF-B interactions with RNA rather than NELF-C. This is a serious caveat. Further, I am concerned that the signals shown don't appear to depend much on UV irradiation (especially in 293FT cells, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Can the authors find a more convincing way to demonstrate NELF-C interactions with RNA in vivo? This would really strengthen the manuscript."

Is it a question of structure? Flexibility? A specific motif? These questions are all left unanswered). Thus, there is concern over definitive statements such as \"the strength of binding and preference for RNA or DNA are sequence-dependent\"."

Crosslinking data obtained with full NELF complex purified from insect cells (data not shown) is arguably the most informative about the structure of NELF complex, compared to data obtained from other incomplete NELF subcomplexes.

Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were performed with the complete NELF complex and subcomplexes of NELF containing NELF-ABC or NELF-ABC and an -E variant lacking the RRM. These experiments reveal that NELF binds to RNA using regions outside of the well-characterized NELF-E RRM. Introduction of NELF-C patch mutations in the tetramer reduce RNA association of the complex, further supporting NELF-C dependent RNA interactions within the tetramer. We also find that NELF-B binds to RNA with a similar affinity as measured for NELF-AC. As advised by the referees, we performed additional crosslinking-MS experiments with the complete NELF complex purified from insect cells. This data is now reported in the manuscript and indeed indicates that in the context of the tetramer, the reported RNA binding face of NELF-C is not involved in contacts between other subunits."

Use of another random 25 nt RNA/DNA sequence resulted in no detectable binding by the NELF-AC complex. This data has now been incorporated as panel 5B. Further, the HIV-1 TAR RNA was previously shown to be a preferred substrate for the <i>Drosophila</i> and human NELF-E RRM (Pagano et al., 2014, Yamaguchi et al., 2002, Fuijnaga et al., 2004) in vitro. To expand upon these findings, we tested whether the stem loop of the HIV-1 TAR RNA associates with NELF through regions outside of the RRM. Indeed, we find that NELF associates with the TAR stem loop in the absence of NELF-E. From our data, it appears that NELF-B in complex with a fragment of -E modestly associates with the RNA. In contrast, NELF-AC does not associate with the TAR RNA, further suggesting that its ability to associate with RNA is sequence-dependent."

First, the bands for NELF-C/D are not well separated from NELF-B, making it totally possible that they are in fact detecting NELF-B interactions with RNA rather than NELF-C. This is a serious caveat. Further, I am concerned that the signals shown don't appear to depend much on UV irradiation (especially in 293FT cells, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Unfortunately, we are limited in the number of available technologies for detecting protein\u2022RNA interactions in vivo. PAR-CLIP is well suited but is limited by the availablility of good antibodies to immunoprecipitate (IP) specific complexes or proteins. We attempted to IP NELF-C specifically, but the IP failed with several different antibodies. We also tried to IP NELF-B specifically, but this also failed. We performed PAR-CLIP in several cell lines with the NELF-E IP (HeLa, K562, Jurkat, 293FT). In K562 and HeLa cells, low abundance of the NELF complex and other RNA binding contaminants, respectively, stymied our attempts to orthogonally test whether we could detect a signal for NELF-B/C."

Further, we have observed that 293FT cells show less signal after UV exposure than Jurkat cells. UV irradiation enhances the RNA crosslinking to proteins but the efficiency of crosslinking might differ for each cell line. It is possible that Jurkat cells possess more RNA bound NELF than 293FT, resulting in a more intense signal after UV irradiation. Taken together, we hope the reviewers appreciate the technical limitations of investigating RNA binding to NELF subunits in vivo, and agree that we show convincingly that NELF-B and -C bind RNA in cells, but certainly there is in vivo RNA binding outside of NELF-E."

We also observe changes in the intraprotein crosslinks when RNA is present, indicating conformational changes in NELF upon RNA binding. We currently lack an atomic model of NELF-B and the N-terminus of NELF-E, which makes it difficult to know exactly how NELF interacts with RNA. We have thus decided to not present the new crosslinking MS data in the current manuscript.
