Ion channels create pores in the outer membrane of cells and act as gates that open and close to regulate the flow of ions into and out of cells. This flow of ions generates electrical signals that sensory neurons use to communicate information about the environment to the brain. The TRPV1 channel is opened by heat, but also by venom toxins, acid and the active ingredient in hot chilli peppers."

The experiments involved a technique that records the movement of ions through TRPV1 channels in the cell surface membrane while exposing the cell to various stimuli that open or close the channels. The results showed that TRPV1 contains an important site on its outer surface that binds sodium ions and fine-tunes the channel\u2019s properties. This enables the channel to be activated by potentially damaging temperatures. Further analysis revealed that TRPV1 undergoes at least two distinct physical changes in response to heat and that the binding of sodium ions to the channel\u2019s outer structure regulates one of these changes."

                        "text": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels belong to a large and diverse superfamily of tetrameric cation channels that contain six transmembrane helices per subunit (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hellmich and Gaudet, 2014</a>), similar to voltage-activated ion channels (<a href=\"#bib35\">Long et al., 2007</a>), ryanodine receptors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yan et al., 2015</a>) and IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fan et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Several TRP channels are exquisitely temperature-dependent, enabling them to serve as biological thermosensors throughout the animal kingdom (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vay et al., 2012</a>). The vanilloid-sensitive TRPV1 channel is a weakly voltage-dependent and cation-selective channel that is expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons, where it acts as a sensor for noxious stimuli (<a href=\"#bib10\">Caterina and Julius, 2001</a>) including heat, extracellular acidic pH, vanilloid compounds (e.g capsaicin), and venom toxins (e.g. double-knot toxin or DkTx) (see [<a href=\"#bib22\">Hilton et al., 2015</a>] for review). The sensitivity of TRPV1 to diverse modulators is fascinating because many stimuli are capable of influencing the responses of TRPV1 to other signals. For example, protons can sensitize the channel to activation by heat (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jordt et al., 2000</a>) and capsaicin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jordt et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ryu et al., 2003</a>), and both capsaicin (<a href=\"#bib46\">Voets et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Matta and Ahern, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gregorio-Teruel et al., 2014</a>) and protons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee and Zheng, 2015</a>) can sensitize the channel to activation by voltage. Conceptually, these observations can be explained by allosteric models wherein distinct stimulus-sensing domains are coupled to each other (<a href=\"#bib28\">Latorre et al., 2007</a>), and to an internal gate within the pore that opens and closes the ion permeation pathway (<a href=\"#bib44\">Salazar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

However, we currently do not understand the structural basis by which the binding of protons, capsaicin or DkTx promotes opening of the internal pore. Moreover, there is no consensus about the site and mechanism of temperature sensitivity. Mutations throughout TRPV1 alter the temperature sensitivity of the channel (<a href=\"#bib41\">Feng, 2014</a>), and distinct models have been proposed to explain temperature sensitivity in these channels (<a href=\"#bib47\">Voets, 2012</a>). For example, in the conventional allosteric model, a specialized temperature-sensitive transition is coupled to a temperature- and voltage-insensitive opening transition (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brauchi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Matta and Ahern, 2007</a>). In contrast, others have suggested that temperature sensitivity arises from a weakly voltage-sensitive opening transition (<a href=\"#bib46\">Voets et al., 2004</a>). Indeed, one recent study on voltage-activated potassium (Kv) channels suggests that the opening transition in these related channels can be made steeply temperature-dependent when the coupling between the voltage-sensing and pore domains is weakened (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). It has also been suggested that TRP channels may not contain localized temperature-sensors, but that their steep temperature-dependence results from changes in solvation of hydrophobic residues throughout the protein (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clapham and Miller, 2011</a>)."

In addition, the external pore and selectivity filter change conformation in the combined presence of DkTx and the vanilloid resiniferatoxin (RTx) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liao et al., 2013</a>). Given our limited understanding of the temperature-sensitivity of TRPV1, it is unclear whether these structures provide insight into the mechanisms of heat activation. However, the structural rearrangements within the external pore are intriguing because mutations in this region have been reported to alter activation of the channel by protons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jordt et al., 2000</a>) and heat (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grandl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cui et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). In addition, external Na<sup>+</sup> ions have been reported to inhibit the TRPV1 channel at room temperature (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ohta et al., 2008</a>), raising the possibility that an external cation binding site may regulate these channels. In the present study, we demonstrate the presence of a critical external Na<sup>+</sup> ion-binding site that must be occupied for the channel to remain closed at room temperature, and to be available for opening by noxious heat. Our results also show that multiple steeply temperature-dependent transitions are allosterically coupled to an opening transition, and that binding of Na<sup>+</sup> or DkTx to the external pore strongly influences the activity of the temperature-sensor and opening of the pore."

At room temperature, this simple manipulation produced a rapid and reversible increase in outward currents at positive voltages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ohta et al., 2008</a>). Subsequent application of a saturating concentration of capsaicin further increased the outward currents independently of whether external Na<sup>+</sup> or NMDG<sup>+</sup> was present (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At moderate TRPV1 expression levels, where outward Na<sup>+</sup> currents could be accurately measured, the inward currents with external NMDG<sup>+</sup> were negligible even in the presence of capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that TRPV1 has a relatively low permeability to large cations. Although large outward currents induced by exchanging external ions were observed in all cells in which capsaicin evoked measurable currents, this manipulation also produced a variable and irreversible rundown of the channel that increased with time in Na<sup>+</sup>-free solutions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Exchanging external Na<sup>+</sup> with NMDG<sup>+</sup> also produced large outward currents in human, mouse and chicken TRPV1 orthologues (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which together with the previous report on porcine TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ohta et al., 2008</a>), suggest that this phenomenon is a conserved feature of TRPV1 channels.

Removal of internal Na<sup>+</sup> in recordings using inside-out patches produced no channel activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel), whereas removing external Na<sup>+</sup> using outside-out patches led to robust activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel), demonstrating that the inhibitory influence of Na<sup>+</sup> is limited to the external side of the TRPV1 channel.

Moreover, activation of the channel by pH 6 could be completely overcome by raising the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration to 300 mM. These results are consistent with the expectation that protonation of acidic residues forming the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site would lower the affinity of the metal ion, suggesting that the inhibitory Na<sup>+</sup> binding site is intimately involved in the regulation of the TRPV1 channel by acid. However, acidic solutions further stimulated channel activation in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), indicating that protons also activate TRPV1 channels through a Na<sup>+</sup>-independent mechanism.

The double-knot tarantula toxin (DkTx) is an interesting candidate as it activates the TRPV1 channel with high avidity by binding to the periphery of outer pore of the channel (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2016</a>). We recently solved the solution structure of DkTx and performed a detailed analysis of its interactions with the TRPV1 channel, which suggested that the toxin activates TRPV1 by disrupting a cluster of hydrophobic residues at the extracellular half of the S5 and S6 segments (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> before application of the toxin activates TRPV1 to a similar extent when compared with a saturating concentration of DkTx (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>), and removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> did not produce further activation of DkTx-bound channels. In contrast, application of a saturating concentration of capsaicin produced further activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The lack of additivity for the\u00a0activation of TRPV1 by DkTx and the removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> contrasts with our results with acidic extracellular pH in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and suggests that DkTx and external Na<sup>+</sup> modulate the TRPV1 through convergent mechanisms."

To confirm a key role of this residue in modulation of TRPV1 by external Na<sup>+</sup>, we investigated the effect of removing external Na<sup>+</sup> on E600Q mutant channels, and found that the\u00a0removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> no longer produced constitutive activation even though the mutant remained responsive to capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

We therefore explored whether the\u00a0deletion of the pore turret retains modulation by external Na<sup>+</sup>. Initially, we found that the\u00a0removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> produced robust channel activation at depolarized potentials in channels lacking the pore turret (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), and that the addition of 10 \u00b5M capsaicin in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> further activated the channels, similar to WT TRPV1. Interestingly, the\u00a0removal of the pore turret increased the apparent affinity of the channel for Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), indicating that the pore turret does not form the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site, but influences the cation-binding site through an allosteric mechanism. However, we also made the surprising discovery that the\u00a0removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> in the presence of 10 \u00b5M capsaicin resulted in enhanced channel activation at positive voltages relative to 10 \u00b5M capsaicin in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), in stark contrast with WT channels where I-V relations under these two conditions superimpose at depolarized potentials due to maximal channel activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Increasing the concentration of capsaicin from 10 to 40 \u00b5M did not further activate \u0394604\u2013626 TRPV1 channels in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), indicating that 10 \u00b5M is a saturating concentration and that capsaicin is a partial agonist for this construct. This reveals that the pore turret is mechanistically associated with the\u00a0modulation of the channel not\u00a0only\u00a0by stimuli acting on the extracellular pore (e.g. external Na<sup>+</sup>), but also by capsaicin that binds near the intracellular part of the protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

If TRPV1 remains sensitive to changes in temperature below 35\u00b0C, it is possible that the spontaneous activation that we observed upon removing external Na<sup>+</sup> at room temperature might be caused by an alteration in the temperature-dependence for channel activation. We therefore began by investigating TRPV1 channel activity over a broad temperature range in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> using cells with widely varying expression levels of the channel. We measured macroscopic current-temperature (I-T) relations between ~8\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C using slow temperature ramps and observed steep temperature-dependent activation over the entire range of temperatures explored (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Although these I-T relations largely reflect temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub>, the rate of ion conduction through open channels is also weakly temperature-dependent and thus will contribute to the slope of I-T relations. To directly evaluate temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub>, we estimated the temperature-dependence of ion conduction (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>) and then calculated P<sub>o</sub>-T relations from the macroscopic I-T relations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). To qualitatively compare the\u00a0slopes of P<sub>o</sub>-T relations between cells and conditions, we fit a single exponential function (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) to the data over defined temperature ranges to obtain apparent enthalpy (\u0394H<sub>app</sub>) values (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>). At temperatures &gt; 35\u00b0C, we observed steep temperature-dependence to P<sub>o</sub> at positive membrane voltages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>), which became even steeper at negative membrane voltages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B and E</a>), consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib46\">Voets et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2010</a>). At temperatures between 8 and 25\u00b0C, a range in which the temperature-sensitivity of TRPV1 has not been previously investigated, we also observed steep temperature-dependence to P<sub>o</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>). However, the entire P<sub>o</sub>-T relationship could not be described by a single temperature-dependent transition due to the presence of an apparent plateau near 22\u00b0C, raising the possibility that multiple temperature-dependent transitions are involved in the gating mechanism of TRPV1."

A round glass coverslip was attached to the bottom of the stage and an additional stainless steel 25 mm chamber (MS-502S, Ala Scientific) was added to the stage to reduce the volume of recording solution (500 \u00b5L). Thermal grease was applied between the stainless-steel chamber (outer chamber) and the incubator stage. The metal surface of the outer chamber was covered with a thin layer of silicon or teflon spray for electrical insulation. Finally, a copper block of ~1 cm<sup>3</sup> with an embedded thermistor probe and an axial slit (0.7 mm diameter) in one face was positioned to make contact with the outer chamber. Once the whole-cell configuration was obtained, the\u00a0cells were lifted and the pipette tip introduced into the slit in the copper block, which served as a 'buffer' to ensure that the temperature at the pipette tip closely matched that of the embedded thermistor. The addition of the copper block significantly increased the accuracy of temperature measurements, as judged from experiments in which the resistances of open pipettes were recorded during temperature ramps (data not shown). A fan-based heat sink (Koolance, Warner Instruments,\u00a0Hamden,\u00a0CT) for the Peltier elements in the temperature controlled-stage was used during heating when performing temperature-ramps, whereas a refrigerated water circulator (NESLAB RTE7, Thermo Scientific,\u00a0Waltham,\u00a0NA) at 6.3\u00b0C was used for cooling. (<b>B</b>) Normalized I-T (filled circles) and P<sub>o</sub>-T relations (empty symbols, mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 11) at +90 mV constructed from whole-cell TRPV1 current recordings in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> and saturating capsaicin (10 \u00b5M). I-T (and P<sub>o</sub>-T) relations from individual cells were normalized relative to the current at 22\u00b0C before averaging (as denoted by the vertical and horizontal dotted lines and the y-axis labels). The red curve is a fit to the mean I-T relation using <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) with an enthalpy (\u0394H<sup>\u2260</sup>) of 9 kcal/mol, which reflects the temperature-dependence of ion conduction through an open channel. P<sub>o</sub>-T relations were obtained from the quotient between individual I-T relations and <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> with an enthalpy of 9 kcal/mol (see Materials and methods for further details).

Remarkably, both I-T and P<sub>o</sub>-T relations displayed greatly diminished slopes and readily detectable channel activity at the lowest experimentally accessible temperatures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). In addition, removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> produced marked temperature-dependent inactivation of TRPV1 channels between 25 and 38\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, see yellow arrow), a process that typically occurs after repetitive cycles of heating and cooling in the presence of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Joseph et al., 2013</a>) and at temperatures above ~50\u00b0C in single heat-activation experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, see purple arrow). Notably, temperature-inactivated channels could not be subsequently activated by heating, but were partially responsive to saturating capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cao et al., 2014</a>). This facilitation of temperature-dependent inactivation in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> can explain why removing Na<sup>+</sup> also leads to progressive rundown of the TRPV1 channel at room temperature (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also observed that capsaicin diminishes rundown at room temperature when external Na<sup>+</sup> was removed (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), consistent with a mechanistic link between temperature-dependent inactivation and channel rundown in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> at room temperature."

                                "text": "We next explored why the TRPV1 channel lacks steep temperature-dependent activation in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. One possibility is that the mechanism of heat activation remains intact, but that increases in P<sub>o</sub> upon heating cannot be seen because channels run\u00a0down after opening during temperature ramps (see <a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and Materials and methods for an illustration using an allosteric model for channel gating). If this is the case, increasing the rate at which temperature is changed in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> should diminish the effects of rundown and reveal the presence of heat activation. To examine this possibility, we measured I-T relations in either the presence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, large grey circles) or absence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, large orange circles) of external Na<sup>+</sup> by rapidly jumping between solutions at different temperatures (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and observed that I-T relations in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> obtained from temperature-ramps and from jumps agreed up to ~25\u00b0C, after which they deviated markedly (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, note deviation between orange circles and small yellow circles as highlighted by the blue lines). Additionally, the rate of temperature-dependent inactivation in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> at T &gt; 45\u00b0C became so fast that the speed of our temperature-jumps was not sufficient to visualize the increase in P<sub>o</sub> before significant inactivation occurred (note the last orange circle in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results suggest that temperature-dependent activation has been greatly perturbed in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> at temperatures below 25\u00b0C, but that activation at higher temperatures appears largely intact (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, compare orange and grey large circles). Taken together, these findings suggest that the Na<sup>+</sup> regulatory site is strongly coupled to a temperature-dependent transition that governs TRPV1 activation at low temperature, and confirm the presence of multiple temperature-dependent transitions."

The vertical dotted grey line indicates the lowest temperature that we can achieve experimentally, with the yellow arrow crossing that temperature representing a hypothetical temperature-sensitive transition in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. We include this transition because the P<sub>o</sub>-T relation in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> shows some temperature-dependence to P<sub>o</sub> at T &lt; 10\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6A</a>). To verify the existence of this transition in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>, we tested two manipulations that should shift the temperature range over which that transition operates. Capsazepine has been proposed to shift heat activation of TRPV1 to higher temperatures (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matta and Ahern, 2007</a>), and we therefore tested whether this allosteric inhibitor might produce a rightward shift in the P<sub>o</sub>-T relation, making the temperature- sensitive transition more readily detectable in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. Indeed, the addition of capsazepine resulted in clear temperature-dependence of P<sub>o</sub> at low temperatures in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and C</a>). Next, we tested intermediate external Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations to see if temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub> could be detected at lower temperatures. We obtained P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at 10, 30 and 65 mM external Na<sup>+</sup>, and observed clear temperature-dependence at low temperatures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), with enthalpies close to those measured in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> in the same temperature range (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the TRPV1 channel undergoes the same conformational transitions in response to heat regardless of whether external Na<sup>+</sup> is present, and thus that the enthalpy (\u0394H<sup>o</sup>) associated with Na<sup>+</sup> binding is not itself responsible for temperature-dependent gating (for a more detailed discussion see Materials and methods). Rather, it seems that external Na<sup>+</sup> modifies the midpoint (or entropy, \u25b3S) of the temperature-sensitive transition that operates at low temperatures. Additionally, external Na<sup>+</sup> appears to stabilize a closed state of the channel independently of its effect on temperature-sensitivity, as the P<sub>o</sub> values corresponding to the inferred plateau regions (denoted by dotted lines in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> - insert) decrease as the concentration of external Na<sup>+</sup> is increased."

                                "text": "These features of our results can be depicted in a simple allosteric model wherein two temperature-sensitive transitions are allosterically coupled to a temperature-insensitive opening transition, with Na<sup>+</sup> regulating both the midpoint (\u25b3S) of the temperature-sensitive transition operating at low temperatures and the open/closed equilibrium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, see Materials and methods for an in-depth discussion on the choice of model and the inherent assumptions). In the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, the two temperature-sensitive transitions have similar midpoints, such that the plateau between the two is barely noticeable in the P<sub>o</sub>-T relation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> insert, grey arrows). Upon Na<sup>+</sup> removal, the midpoint of the first temperature-sensitive transition shifts to lower temperatures, effectively extending the middle plateau where P<sub>o</sub> is temperature-independent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> insert, yellow lines and arrows) and the channel mostly occupies the open/closed equilibrium highlighted with orange squares in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>. Additionally, external Na<sup>+</sup> also negatively impacts the opening transition through allosteric coupling, which results in the intermediate plateau between the two temperature-dependent transitions in P<sub>o</sub>-T relations having a lower P<sub>o</sub> in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. This simple model can qualitatively reproduce our results at intermediate Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). One important feature of the model is that the opening transition is relatively temperature-insensitive, and that the channel can open even when the temperature sensor is in the deactivated state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,</a> C \u2013 O transitions with blue squares). Although we would not rule out measurable changes in \u0394H<sup>o</sup> during opening, as shown by an alternate model that also satisfactorily reproduced our experimental results (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), such a mechanism would require divergent temperature-sensitive transitions depending on whether external Na<sup>+</sup> is bound to the channel, which we consider to be more conceptually complex than the allosteric model proposed here (see Materials and methods for a more detailed discussion). Additionally, in the alternate model ii, external Na<sup>+</sup> influences the temperature-dependent transition that occurs at lower temperatures in the same way as in Model i (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also cannot rule out the possibility that the temperature sensors have to activate for the channel to open (i.e., occupancy of the open states with blue squares in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> is negligible), as the gating of TRPV1 channels remains temperature-sensitive even at the lowest temperatures examined. However, in the absence of constraining experimental data, we have opted for the more general mechanism depicted in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>."

We were therefore interested in determining whether it exerts a similar influence on the temperature-sensitivity of TRPV1 as external Na<sup>+</sup>. To explore this possibility, we measured P<sub>o</sub>-T relations using slow temperature ramps in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> and different concentrations of capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8A\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> for P<sub>o</sub>-T relations from individual cells). Although we observed detectable temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub> at low temperatures for subsaturating concentrations of capsaicin, the P<sub>o</sub> values varied by more than 100-fold over the range of capsaicin concentrations, suggesting that capsaicin has a larger effect on the closed/open transition compared to the temperature-dependent transition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> - insert). This contrasts with the effects of removing external Na<sup>+</sup>, which produces much larger shifts in the P<sub>o</sub>-T relation and smaller changes in P<sub>o</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Notably, incorporating these features in our model (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) can qualitatively describe our experimental findings with capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The P<sub>o</sub>-T relation in saturating capsaicin exhibited marginal temperature-dependent changes, consistent with a large influence of capsaicin on the open/closed equilibrium of the channel leading to full receptor activation at a saturating concentration of this agonist (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>)."

To test this possibility, we first determined whether TRPV1 channels lacking the pore turret are temperature-sensitive, as this is a controversial issue (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cui et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liao et al., 2013</a>).

At 8\u00b0C, the fractional activation by saturating capsaicin in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> was substantially lower than what we observed at 22\u00b0C, revealing that lowering temperature further decreased the efficacy of capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>; 8\u00b0C colored circles; 22\u00b0C colored ramps; see black arrows). We then obtained the full P<sub>o</sub>-T relationship in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin, as before for the WT channel, but for the turret deletion we observed large temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub>, with two components in the relation separated by a clear plateau at intermediate temperatures (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> for P<sub>o</sub>-T relations from individual cells). These findings with the turret deletion further support the allosteric framework for conceptualizing the mechanism by which Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin influence temperature-dependent gating. Notably, we could accurately describe the P<sub>o</sub>-T relations in saturating capsaicin and the dose-response for external Na<sup>+</sup> for the turret deletion using model i (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>), simply by assuming that the deletion of the pore turret increased the affinity of the channel for external Na<sup>+</sup> and reduced the strength of the coupling between the binding of capsaicin and the opening of the pore (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2E</a>). Together, these results qualitatively show that capsaicin influences both the activity of the temperature-sensor and the open/closed equilibrium, but appears to have a larger influence on the latter. Even though the values of the coupling parameters in our modeling are not well-determined, we believe that the larger influence of capsaicin on the open/closed equilibrium is robust enough to support this conclusion."

Our previous results with DkTx suggest external Na<sup>+</sup> and DkTx modulate the TRPV1 through a common mechanism (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). In addition, our recent analysis of the interaction between DkTx and TRPV1 suggests that the toxin activates the channel by inducing a displacement of the S5-S6 segments relative to the S1-S4 domain (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which results in the disruption of a cluster of buried hydrophobic residues at the extracellular ends of the S5 and S6 segments (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2016</a>). This is interesting in light of a recent demonstration in the Shaker Kv channel that movement of hydrophobic residues between buried and solvent-exposed environments imparts temperature-dependence (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chowdhury et al., 2014</a>). We therefore measured P<sub>o</sub>-T relations in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup> and DkTx to test whether the binding of the toxin has an effect on temperature-sensitivity, and observed that activation of the channel by heat was effectively ablated between 5 and 35\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10,</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> for P<sub>o</sub>-T relations from individual cells). This finding is particularly striking when considering that the P<sub>o</sub> is situated well below the theoretical upper limit of 1.0. These results demonstrate that DkTx also exerts strong control over temperature-sensor activation, which in our model can be achieved simply by trapping the channel in the intermediate plateau and preventing temperature-sensor deactivation or full activation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10,</a> insert)."

First, our results demonstrate that the TRPV1 channel has evolved external Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites that must be occupied for the channel to remain closed at physiological body temperatures in mammals. The steeply temperature-sensitive transition that normally opens TRPV1 in response to noxious heat still operates in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, yet without external Na<sup>+</sup> the channel would be spontaneously open at physiological temperatures, many channels would be inactivated, and responses to noxious heat would therefore be diminished. Our results also show that the Na<sup>+</sup> sites will play physiologically important roles in activation of the channel by acid, as protonation of acidic residues involved in binding Na<sup>+</sup> leads to diminished Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy and activation of the channel. This connection between Na<sup>+</sup> and pH regulation provides a mechanistic explanation for previous observations where mildly acidic solutions potentiate activation of TRPV1 by heat (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jordt et al., 2000</a>). Thus, this Na<sup>+</sup> regulatory mechanism plays a fundamental role in tuning the properties of TRPV1 to serve as a detector of noxious heat and acid, and possibly other stimuli that have yet to be examined."

                        "text": "Second, our results reveal the existence of multiple temperature-sensitive transitions that are coupled to the opening transition (see model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u00a0</a>). Although we see only hints of the presence of distinct temperature-dependent transitions in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), they become unambiguous when Na<sup>+</sup> is removed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)and when studied in the presence of capsaicin with the turret deletion construct\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C)</a>. Our results suggest that the role of the first temperature-sensitive transition is to maintain the channel in a closed state at physiological temperatures, whereas the second transition functions to activate the channel in response to noxious heat. It is interesting that both Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin do not seem to have a substantial impact on the second transition, at least to the extent that we could study this component in the presence of inactivation. In contrast, external Na<sup>+</sup> exerts strong control over the first transition. Capsaicin also modifies the shape of macroscopic P<sub>o</sub>-T relations\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A)</a>, but we were able to detect temperature-dependent transitions at low temperatures even in the presence of near-saturating capsaicin concentrations (e.g. 100 nM) that increase the P<sub>o</sub> at room temperature to values higher than those measured in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or in the presence of DkTx\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C)</a>. In contrast, we observed marginal to no temperature-dependence in the P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at low temperatures in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or in the presence of DkTx\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a><a href=\"#fig10s1\">)</a>. These observations suggest that the vanilloid has a larger influence on the open/closed equilibrium than on the temperature-sensing machinery. The existence of multiple temperature-sensitive transitions also provides a possible explanation for why P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at negative voltages are at least two-fold steeper than at positive voltages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Voets et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2010</a>). If hyperpolarization shifts the temperature-sensitive transition operating at lower temperatures so as to coincide with the second temperature-sensitive transition, the \u25b3H<sup>o</sup> of the two transitions would add to make the P<sub>o</sub>-T steeper. Overall, the present results on the influence of Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin on temperature-dependent gating in TRPV1 provide a set of essential constraints for understanding the gating mechanism of the channel using an allosteric framework."

                        "text": "Third, our results provide clues about where these important Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites are located. Because Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition has only very weak voltage-dependence, these Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites are likely to be located outside the ion permeation pathway within each subunit. Indeed, the large outward Na<sup>+</sup> currents we observe on removing external Na<sup>+</sup> at positive voltages indicate that the permeation pathway must have a high Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy even in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>. Mutating acidic residues forming the external Na<sup>+</sup> site would weaken Na<sup>+</sup> binding affinity, possibly leading to lower Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy in the presence of 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup>. However, such an effect would not necessarily cause spontaneous TRPV1 activity because the lower Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy would be expected to promote the form of inactivation that we observed on removing external Na<sup>+</sup>. Additionally, removing external Na<sup>+</sup> would be expected to cause less activation of the channel compared to the WT protein because ion occupancy would be diminished by the mutant. E600 in the extracellular loop just after the S5 helix (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) has been proposed to be responsible for proton-mediated potentiation of heat- and capsaicin-dependent activation of the channel (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jordt et al., 2000</a>), making it an excellent candidate for forming the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site. The E600Q mutant displayed modest spontaneous activity when recording at room temperature (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ohta et al., 2008</a>), and only weak activation when removing external Na<sup>+</sup> or applying DkTx when compared with the WT channel, consistent with a role in forming the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site. Interestingly, E600 is located near the pore turret (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liao et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which when deleted from TRPV1 causes a dramatic increase in the apparent affinity of Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), and this residue is also located very close to where DkTx binds (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

In the cryo-EM studies on the turret deletion construct of TRPV1, capsaicin appears to produce a partial opening of the internal pore, and the combined influence of RTx and DkTx to produce further expansion of the internal pore together with a conformational change within the selectivity filter (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These differences between the two structures might indicate that there are two gates that can be differentially regulated by activating stimuli (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, we discovered that capsaicin is a partial agonist of the turret deletion construct, suggesting that the partially open features of the capsaicin-bound channel may not represent a unique conformation of the protein, but an average of closed and open states. The cryo-EM structure of the apo state of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liao et al., 2013</a>), however, reveals that the internal pore must expand for the pore to support ion permeation, consistent with accessibility studies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Salazar et al., 2009</a>). The observation of temperature-independent plateaus in P<sub>o</sub>-T relations under diverse conditions that produce submaximal open probabilities suggests that the\u00a0opening of the pore does not require the two temperature-dependent transitions to occur, and that the open/closed equilibrium itself is not the source of the temperature-sensitivity of TRPV1. If opening of the internal pore is indeed temperature-insensitive, what is the significance of the structural changes in the external pore observed in the structure of the RTx/DkTx-bound channel? The present findings with external Na<sup>+</sup> and DkTx suggest that these structural changes in the external pore are tightly associated with the temperature-sensing machinery, either by participating in allosteric coupling or in the actual mechanism of temperature-sensing."

I-V relations in saturating capsaicin with and without external Na<sup>+</sup> superimpose at positive potentials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), we did not observe large changes in single channel conductance at +90 mV and at room temperature between patches with or without external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and capsaicin does not affect the single-channel conductance of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Premkumar et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hui et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that the single channel current at positive voltages is not substantially altered under our experimental conditions. Based on measurements provided in the literature using single-channel recordings (<a href=\"#bib40\">Premkumar et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hui et al., 2003</a>) or noise-analysis of macroscopic currents (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oseguera et al., 2007</a>), we assumed that the P<sub>o</sub> in saturating capsaicin (10 \u00b5M) + 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> at +90 mV and at room temperature is ~0.9. The P<sub>o</sub> at room temperature and +90 mV for 0 Na<sub>o</sub> (i.e., 130 mM extracellular NMDG) was then estimated from the macroscopic I-V relations (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A and C</a>) to be ~0.2. For other experimental conditions where P<sub>o</sub> is similar to that measured in 0 Na<sub>o</sub>, we estimated the P<sub>o</sub>-values at room temperature and +90 mV simply by recording I-V relations at the test conditions and 0 Na<sub>o</sub> and scaling based on 0 Na<sub>o</sub>. The following conditions were scaled in this way (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A and C</a>): 0 Na<sub>o</sub> + 1 \u00b5M Cpz., 0 Na<sub>o</sub> + 10 \u00b5M Cpz., 10 Na<sub>o</sub>, 30 Na<sub>o</sub>, 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 100 nM caps., 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 25 nM caps., 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 1 \u00b5M DkTx. For experimental conditions where P<sub>o</sub> was much lower than for 0 Na<sub>o</sub>, we used 30 Na<sub>o</sub> as a reference in cells expressing TRPV1 to higher levels (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B and C</a>). The following conditions were scaled in this way: 130 Na<sub>o</sub>, 65 Na<sub>o</sub>, 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 10 nM caps. Notably, the P<sub>o</sub> value estimated here for 130 Na<sub>o</sub> is consistent with measurements of unliganded P<sub>o</sub> for TRPV1 at depolarized potentials (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oseguera et al., 2007</a>). We also validated our scaling procedure using noise analysis (see below for methodological description). Using this approach, we obtained a mean P<sub>o</sub> at ~24\u00b0C of 0.91 \u00b1 0.02 (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 4) for data in 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + 10 \u00b5M caps. and a P<sub>o</sub> of 0.21 \u00b1 0.04 in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin (see <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2G</a> for P<sub>o</sub> values from individual cells at different temperatures), which is very close to our initial estimated values."

Macroscopic recordings from the same group performed at T &gt; 50\u00b0C with and without capsaicin also show that the\u00a0addition of the vanilloid produces an increase in P<sub>o</sub> of at least twofold (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that P<sub>o</sub> at high temperatures can be substantially less than 1. Macroscopic data from other laboratories also show less-than-maximal channel activation by temperature as compared with saturating capsaicin (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cao et al., 2014</a>). One important consideration in comparing single-channel and macroscopic data is the fact that temperature-inactivated channels can still respond to saturating capsaicin (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cao et al., 2014</a>), and that temperature-dependent channel inactivation (or rundown) also occurs in the presence of external Na<sup>+</sup>, so that it is possible that a subset of channels in HEK293 cells cultured at 37\u00b0C are inactivated and therefore unresponsive to heat. This would lead to an underestimation of the P<sub>o</sub> in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or in heat-activation experiments in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> when measured from macroscopic current recordings, as in the present study. However, we think that this underestimation is not large given our noise-analysis results in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013G</a>) and the observation of frequent closures in our outside-out recordings where the activity of single channels can be discerned, indicating that the P<sub>o</sub> in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> is not maximal even at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Given that all P<sub>o</sub>-T relations were scaled under similar conditions, a systematic underestimation of the P<sub>o</sub> would not change any of the conclusions of the present work."

For experiments at T &gt; 6\u00b0C, temperature was controlled using perfusion (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). The temperature-controlled recording chamber (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) was used for experiments at T &lt; 6\u00b0C. The\u00a0data were acquired at a single temperature per cell. For the WT channel, currents in response to 40\u201350 voltage pulses (3\u2009s inter-pulse interval) of 400 ms duration from -90 to +90 mV were obtained at 0 Na<sub>o</sub>, followed by another 50 pulses at 10 \u00b5M capsaicin + 130 Na<sub>o</sub>.

For each experiment, the current variance (<i>\u03c3<sup>2</sup><sub>I</sub></i>) was calculated from the ~50 current traces obtained with the same extracellular recording solution (i.e. 0 Na<sub>o</sub> or 130 Na<sub>o</sub> + caps, for the WT channel) as the ensemble average of the squared differences of successive currents records (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heinemann and Conti, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2002</a>), an optimal method for channels with rundown.

This feature of the model was incorporated in order to reproduce the plateaus observed in some P<sub>o</sub>-T relations, in which the P<sub>o</sub> does not increase with temperature despite being well below its maximal theoretical value of 1.0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Are there other gating mechanisms that produce temperature-independent gating at P<sub>o</sub> &lt; 1.0 and have a temperature-dependent open/closed equilibrium? This is relevant given a recent study on Kv channels, which suggested that the opening transition of channels structurally related to the TRPV1 can be steeply temperature-dependent (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, if the opening transition were responsible for the heat-activation of the TRPV1, a lot of information on the elusive mechanism of temperature-dependent gating could be readily gained from the structures of the channel in the closed and open states (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>). A temperature-dependent open/closed equilibrium implies that the enthalpies (H<sup>o</sup>) associated with the open and the closed states are different (i.e. \u0394H<sup>o</sup> is large). A modulator such as Na<sup>+</sup> could affect the temperature-dependence of channel opening by altering the enthalpy of the open or the closed state such that \u0394H<sup>o</sup> changes. In this scenario, a temperature-independent opening transition (with \u0394H<sup>o</sup> \u2248 0) could become temperature-dependent through the binding of sodium, if sodium increases the enthalpy of the open state or decreases the enthalpy of the closed state. The resulting P<sub>o</sub>-T relations would be flat (no temperature-dependence) in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, and steeply temperature-dependent in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. However, our experimental results suggest that the channel retains temperature-dependence in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup>, as evidenced by the steep I-T relations at T &gt; 30\u00b0C obtained from temperature jumps (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and the I-T relations at low temperatures in the presence of capsazepine without external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This indicates that external Na<sup>+</sup> is not directly responsible for conferring temperature-sensitivity to the TRPV1 channel. Thus, a model in which external Na<sup>+</sup> confers temperature-sensitivity to the opening transition would require distinct Na<sup>+</sup>-independent heat-driven transitions to occur in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> in order to replicate our experimental results. Model ii (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) incorporates these requirements and reproduces our experimental findings with comparable accuracy as model i (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, model ii is mechanistically more complex than model i, since it requires distinct temperature-dependent transitions depending on whether the channel is bound to external Na<sup>+</sup> or not, implying that the TRPV1 possess different mechanisms of temperature-sensing. On the contrary, model i requires a single pair of temperature-dependent transitions and a common mechanism for temperature-sensing. Although a distinction between the two possibilities cannot be made, we favor model i due to its simplicity. Additionally, it can be concluded that the opening transition is not obligatorily temperature-dependent, but could become temperature-dependent under more complex models for TRPV1 channel gating."

                                        "text": "The second important assumption is the inclusion of an additional temperature-dependent transition in model i. The inherent complexity of P<sub>o</sub>-T relations in 130 Na<sub>o</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) strongly suggest that there are at least two temperature-dependent transitions involved in the gating mechanism of the TRPV1 channel. Furthermore, the P<sub>o</sub>-T relations obtained with the turret-deletion construct in saturating capsaicin and external Na<sup>+</sup> unambiguously show the presence of at least two different temperature-dependent transitions associated with gating of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). One transition appears to dominate temperature-dependent gating at T &gt; 38\u00b0C, and represents the steep temperature-dependence that has been measured for TRPV1 in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Voets et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>). Another transition dominates channel activity at lower temperatures, and appears to have a somewhat lower temperature-dependence, although this may only be the result of this temperature-dependent transition being close to saturation in the experimentally accessible range of temperatures. If the data is simulated using a model with a single temperature-dependent transition (Model iii, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) with a large associated enthalpy, the resulting P<sub>o</sub>-T curves at T &lt; 35\u00b0C would be steeper than the experimental data. If the enthalpy for the temperature-sensor is chosen such that the model agrees well with the experimental data at T &lt; 35\u00b0C, then the predicted P<sub>o</sub>-T relations lack the highly temperature-dependent increase in P<sub>o</sub> at T &gt; 38\u00b0C that is characteristic of the TRPV1 channel (see the predictions in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), indicating that activation of the TRPV1 by heat involves at least two temperature-dependent transitions. Finally, we arranged the two temperature-dependent transitions in Model i sequentially, as opposed to considering them as separate coupled equilibria in a parallel arrangement. We chose a sequential arrangement of the transitions because it reduces the number of states in the model and eliminates a free parameter (the allosteric coupling constant between the two temperature-dependent transitions). However, fits to the experimental P<sub>o</sub>-T relations of identical quality could be obtained with a parallel arrangement of temperature-sensors (data not shown), so that this aspect of the model is unconstrained."

This has important implications for the mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup>-regulation because one alternate mechanism by which sodium could inhibit the TRPV1 channel is by binding exclusively to the closed state. In that case, sufficiently high concentrations of external Na<sup>+</sup> should completely prevent opening of the channel by other stimuli. We can exclude this possibility because the channel can be robustly opened with capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and heat (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) in the presence of a saturating concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> (130 mM), or even when the concentration of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions is increased to 600 mM (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) or 2\u00a0M (data not shown). In addition, temperature-dependent activation of TRPV1 in the presence of 600 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> does not qualitatively differ from that measured with 130 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), suggesting that external Na<sup>+</sup> does not modulate the temperature-sensor by binding exclusively to its resting state."

The low permeability of NMDG<sup>+</sup> relative to Na<sup>+</sup> greatly limited the range of voltages over which we could obtain useful data at most of the relevant experimental conditions in this study (see <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We therefore decided to estimate how much could changes in voltage above 0 mV alter the shape of P<sub>o</sub>-T curves in both saturating capsaicin and in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>. To do this, we first calculated G-V relations in saturating capsaicin at two temperatures (22\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) from families of currents elicited by voltage-steps from -120 to +140 mV (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). The G-V relations at both temperatures reach saturation at 0 mV (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), indicating that voltage does not appreciably influence channel gating and its temperature-dependence in saturating capsaicin at positive membrane potentials, consistent with previous measurements (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matta and Ahern, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, this indicates that voltage-dependent changes in the I-V relations in saturating capsaicin at positive voltages reflect only the changes in single-channel current as a function of voltage but not changes in P<sub>o</sub>. We therefore divided the I-V relations in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> (22\u00b0C, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>; 8\u00b0C, <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) by the I-V relations in saturating capsaicin to obtain the fraction of open channels (P<sub>o</sub>) as a function of voltage for data at both temperatures (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). The resulting P<sub>o</sub>-V relations at the two temperatures superimpose, confirming that removal of external Na<sup>+</sup> leads to negligible temperature-dependence in channel gating over a range from 5 to 25\u00b0C. Moreover, the P<sub>o</sub>-V relations show only weak voltage-dependence, suggesting that the effects of voltage-dependent gating on our P<sub>o</sub>-T relations measured at a fixed voltage should have a minimal influence on the interpretation of our results. We therefore decided not to include voltage-dependent transitions in our final model."

To explicitly introduce cooperativity would have required us to extend the model to take into account the tetrameric assembly of TRPV1, incrementing the number of states, free parameters and assumptions necessary to model the data. We therefore introduced an arbitrary cooperativity term for the binding of both Na<sup>+</sup> and capsaicin as is done in the Hill model of cooperativity, such that the modified capsaicin- or Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent equilibrium constants had the form: K<sub>1</sub> = (K<sub>1</sub>\u2019 x [Na])<sup>1.5</sup> and K<sub>2</sub> = (K<sub>1</sub>\u2019 x [caps.])<sup>1.5</sup>."

In this regard, it was recently noted that changes in side-chain hydration associated with a protein conformational transition that involves only a few residues could result in moderate changes in \u0394C<sub>p</sub>, which in turn would render that conformational change highly temperature-sensitive (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clapham and Miller, 2011</a>). The applicability of this molecular mechanism for ion channels was recently demonstrated using voltage-gated potassium channels with engineered voltage-sensing domains (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chowdhury et al., 2014</a>). Given the possibility that \u0394C<sub>p</sub> is responsible for the temperature-sensitivity in TRPV1 channels, we tested whether considering a change in heat capacity for both temperature-dependent transitions in model i would have an influence on the behavior of the model and the interpretation of our results.

This phenomenon is apparent for several of the experimental P<sub>o</sub>-T curves measured in this study. However, since temperature-dependent inactivation is irreversible, it cannot be included in the mathematical models in this study, which are for equilibrium conditions. Nonetheless, we were interested in determining whether a simple decaying exponential function of time (to simulate inactivation) could effectively reduce the steepness of P<sub>o</sub>-T curves and ultimately lead to a steep temperature-dependent decrease in P<sub>o</sub>.

However, we decided to incorporate Na<sup>+</sup>-dependence in an arbitrary way that would yet allow us to qualitatively assess the effects of an exponentially decaying function of time and temperature on the P<sub>o</sub>-T curves at several Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations. We therefore arbitrarily assigned <i>k(T)</i> a Na<sup>+</sup>- and temperature-dependent pre-factor <i>k<sub>0</sub></i>\u00a0as follows: <math id=\"inf15\"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>,</mo><mo></mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mi>N</mi><msup><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>A</mi><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>\u2212</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>a</mi></mrow></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math>, where A is a constant and <i>F<sub>Na</sub></i> is the fraction of Na<sup>+</sup>-bound states at equilibrium relative to the total number of states in model i.

This approach allowed us to replicate the overall shape of P<sub>o</sub>-T curves with inactivation and their Na<sup>+</sup> dependence, confirming that temperature-dependent inactivation can indeed reduce the apparent steepness of P<sub>o</sub>-T relations and ultimately leading to a steep decay in open probability.

The general question is how TRPV1 responds to small temperature changes. The results demonstrate that the TRPV1 channel has an external Na binding site that must be occupied for the channel to remain closed at physiological temperature, and is also likely responsible for acid sensing. The Na<sup>+</sup> regulatory mechanism thus tunes TRPV1 for noxious stimuli. The authors find evidence for multiple temperature-sensitive transitions that couple to a relatively temperature-insensitive opening transition; the first temperature-sensitive transition maintains the channel in a closed state at physiological temperatures, whereas the second transition functions to activate the channel in response to noxious heat. Na<sup>+</sup> inhibition has only very weak voltage-dependence, and there is substantial evidence in this paper that the site is near the turret, likely involving E600 in the extracellular loop just after the S5 helix and close to the DkTx binding site. This is a solid contribution to the field and for the first time provides evidence for multiple temperature-dependent transitions in the TRPV1 channel. Nevertheless, we have some concerns mainly with regards to the interpretation of their data and its implications."

At 45 degrees, their P<sub>o</sub> values were 0.5 whereas in this manuscript the Po values are approximately 0.06 at those temperatures. Why is there so much discrepancy in the Po values even though both groups are studying the same channel expressed in Hek cells? Qin and coworkers obtained their P<sub>o</sub> measurements directly from single channel recordings whereas in this manuscript P<sub>o</sub> is deduced from macroscopic currents after correcting for temperature-dependent changes in conductance."

A hallmark of allosteric system is that one should be able to observe temperature-independent transitions at both high and low temperatures. According to their models, the saturation at low temperatures will occur at ranges that would be experimentally intractable and at high temperatures this would be complicated by inactivation (or desensitization?). This is an unfortunate situation that ultimately makes it difficult to discriminate between an allosteric versus an obligatorily coupled temperature-sensor. To be fair, the authors acknowledge this problem and state that they favor the allosteric model because it is simpler. I would argue that an obligatorily coupled model has fewer free parameters than an allosteric model. Again these caveats should be clearly stated in their conclusion."

We also now give more emphasis to the effects of capsaicin on temperature-sensitivity and gating in general. A small restructuring in the order of the figures in the paper has allowed us to provide a more compelling and precise discussion on the role of capsaicin on temperature-sensitivity. While the large number of free parameters in the model and the small number of experimental constraints don\u2019t allow us to make comparisons between the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants for external sodium and capsaicin, we believe that the observation that P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at all subsaturating concentrations of capsaicin exhibit temperature dependence at low temperatures, in contrast to what we observe in the absence of external sodium, suggests that capsaicin has a much larger influence on the open/closed equilibrium than on the function of the temperature-sensor. Otherwise, no temperature-dependent changes in P<sub>o</sub> at low temperatures would be observed in the presence of capsaicin, as is observed in the case of DkTx. This is now discussed more clearly in the text. We have also incorporated a discussion on the possible alternatives to the model proposed here in the main text to stress that other alternative models are theoretically possible, but while also emphasizing the qualitative features of the data that are independent of the model. Finally, we now give equal weight to the allosteric effect of external sodium on temperature-dependent gating and on the open/closed equilibrium, as there is no way of drawing any quantitative conclusions on the relative magnitudes of the strength of the couplings between external sodium and the two other equilibria."

Previous work from Feng Qin's lab using single channel measurements (Biophysical Journal 2003) showed that the Po values for TRPV1 channels at 50 degrees reach very close to 1. At 45 degrees, their P<sub>o</sub> values were 0.5 whereas in this manuscript the Po values are approximately 0.06 at those temperatures. Why is there so much discrepancy in the Po values even though both groups are studying the same channel expressed in Hek cells? Qin and coworkers obtained their P<sub>o</sub> measurements directly from single channel recordings whereas in this manuscript P<sub>o</sub> is deduced from macroscopic currents after correcting for temperature-dependent changes in conductance.</i>"

We think that one source of the difference is that there may be a fraction of channels that are heat-inactivated in macroscopic recordings, leading to an underestimation of P<sub>o</sub>. However, we think that there is variability in the maximal P<sub>o</sub> for heat activation, because our noise analysis is roughly consistent with our method for calculating P<sub>o</sub> from macroscopic currents and our recordings where unitary channel activity can be discerned are not consistent with a P<sub>o</sub> near 1. We have added a discussion of this issue in the Methods section (subsection \u201cScaling of Po-T relations based on macroscopic current recordings\u201c, last paragraph), and pointed out how this does not affect any of the conclusions presented in our study."

A hallmark of allosteric system is that one should be able to observe temperature-independent transitions at both high and low temperatures. According to their models, the saturation at low temperatures will occur at ranges that would be experimentally intractable and at high temperatures this would be complicated by inactivation (or desensitization?). This is an unfortunate situation that ultimately makes it difficult to discriminate between an allosteric versus an obligatorily coupled temperature-sensor. To be fair, the authors acknowledge this problem and state that they favor the allosteric model because it is simpler. I would argue that an obligatorily coupled model has fewer free parameters than an allosteric model. Again these caveats should be clearly stated in their conclusion.</i> "

                    "text": "We have now removed all statements in the Abstract pertaining to the temperature-sensitivity of channel opening, and included a more extensive discussion on this subject in the main text. Two different issues are now mentioned: 1) whether the opening transition is itself temperature-dependent and 2) whether the channel requires activation of the temperature sensor in order to activate. We consider that the observation of temperature-independent plateaus in P<sub>o</sub>-T relations at P<sub>o</sub> values lower than 1 suggests that the opening transition itself is not obligatorily temperature-dependent, as the channel can still be closed by voltage while on the plateaus. This does not preclude the possibility of the activation gate of TRPV1 transitioning to various conformations, with some of these transitions occurring in a temperature-dependent manner. However, we consider this possibility to be mechanistically more complex than the model proposed in the manuscript, which is now described explicitly in the main text. Regarding the need of the temperature-sensor to activate in order for the channel to open, we now mention in the main text that this remains an open question, but that we have favored the more general mechanism that considers all possible transitions, including opening of channels with temperature sensors in the resting state. We have also modified the pictorial depiction of our model, which aids in the treatment of these issues."

Typically our whole-cell recordings have very small leak currents at negative voltages, with some exceptions that become more frequent as the passage number of the culture increases. TRPV1 displays prominent outward rectification, and in our recording conditions, the contaminating endogenous currents would become evident as larger inward currents at negative voltages and a reduction of the outward-rectifying character of IV relations for TRPV1. We systematically discarded cells that displayed less prominent outward rectification. We also noticed that these endogenous currents become more prominent at elevated temperatures (since they start to increase at T &gt; 20 \u00b0C), which is the reason why we included magnesium in the pipette solution for all heat-activation experiments. We had originally performed quite a few experiments at high-temperature without magnesium, which we repeated once we realized that these currents sometimes contaminated our recordings. We also checked that adding magnesium does not influence IV relations in the absence of external Na<sup>+</sup> or after addition of DkTx, and all of our experiments at room temperature display pronounced outward-rectification, so we are confident that these reflect the activity of TRPV1. We have now detailed this in the Methods section."
