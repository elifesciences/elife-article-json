The neural mechanisms that couple skill level and variability, however, are not known. The zebra finch, a songbird, presents a unique opportunity to address this question because production of learned song and induction of vocal variability are instantiated in distinct circuits that converge on a motor cortex analogue controlling vocal output. To probe the interplay between learning and variability, we made intracellular recordings from neurons in this area, characterizing how their inputs from the functionally distinct pathways change throughout song development. We found that inputs that drive stereotyped song-patterns are strengthened and pruned, while inputs that induce variability remain unchanged. A simple network model showed that strengthening and pruning of action-specific connections reduces the sensitivity of motor control circuits to variable input and neural \u2018noise\u2019. This identifies a simple and general mechanism for learning-related regulation of motor variability."

This capacity of the nervous system to regulate variability and plasticity in motor output as a function of learning or skill level enables new skills to be acquired and those already mastered to be stably expressed and maintained.

This suggests that LMAN's effectiveness in inducing motor variability and promoting plasticity is curtailed by the strengthening and pruning of HVC-RA connections. A simple network model shows how strengthening and pruning of action-specific connections in motor control circuits makes the dynamics in those circuits less sensitive to external sources of variability (e.g. LMAN) and neural \u2018noise\u2019. This identifies a simple and general circuit-level mechanism for learning-related regulation of motor variability."

We found that this slice preserves more HVC inputs to RA than the straight parasagittal slice, yielding larger HVC fiber stimulation-evoked MAX currents.

This calculation assumes that inputs to RA neurons sum linearly, and that the average SF input to an RA neuron can be estimated from the average SF current across the population of cells at the given age. An alternative method for approximating the number of inputs to a cell originally introduced to quantify number of inputs at the retinogeniculate synapse (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hooks and Chen, 2006</a>), uses the SF current(s) recorded in a cell as the estimate of mean input strength. The fiber fraction (SF current/MAX current) for each input can then be estimated and averaged across the SFs in an age group to get the mean fiber fraction. The inverse of this quantity provides an alternative estimate for the number of inputs to cells in a given age group. We note that the two estimates yield very similar numbers. Estimating the number of HVC inputs using the mean SF current across the population as a proxy for any given cell's mean input, that is, the method we use for reporting the number of inputs in the text, yields 19, 26, and 11 inputs for age groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively, whereas the original method using fiber fractions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hooks and Chen, 2006</a>) yields 19, 28, and 8 inputs. Importantly, these numbers represent lower bounds on the average number of inputs to a cell at a given age."

A prior study showed LMAN-RA synaptic input, when averaged across juvenile and adult birds, to be composed of 90% NMDA and 10% AMPA (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stark and Perkel, 1999</a>). Though we did not measure the NMDA/AMPA currents directly, our results conform to this ratio. LMAN input currents measured at +40 mV holding potential (Mg<sup>2+</sup> block is removed) reflect both AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated components, while, at a holding potential of \u221270 mV, the synaptic current is mainly mediated by AMPARs. Therefore, the ratio between peak synaptic currents given the driving force at these two holding potentials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) can be used to estimate the relative contribution of NMDA and AMPA receptor mediated currents at LMAN-RA synapses using the following formula:"

They use this model to address the general issue of how motor performance and variability interact so that during acquisition variability, which is essential for learning a new skill, is reduced as performance is enhanced. The system is particularly suitable for such analyses because variability generating (LMAN) inputs and the inputs that drive learned song (HVC) separately project to the premotor area (RA). They conclude that there is no change in the variability generating inputs (LMAN) but that the song generating inputs are pruned and strengthened during song acquisition and consolidation. They then present a simple model that shows how such a system leads to increased performance and show how NMDA inputs from the variability system enhance this process."

The <a href=\"#bib33\">Kittelberger, J.M., and Mooney, R.

RA neuronal intrinsic properties, were also characterized by <a href=\"#bib33\">Kittelberger, J.M., and Mooney, R. (1999)</a>. How LMAN inputs to RA progress during development has not been described and represents a significant innovation in this study. The reviewers have concerns that this part of the study is not adequately documented in the data so that statistical tests are meaningful. Considerable new experimental measurements would have to be made to satisfy this criticism. Another innovation of the present study is the modeling effort, but all the reviewers are concerned that this is not well developed or described, being more of an afterthought in the Discussion. Substantial amplification of the modeling effort (to explore whether the stated results are robust to the variability in synaptic strength demonstrated in the first part of the paper, to potential age-dependent changes in the strength of LMAN inputs, time-varying LMAN rates, etc.) would be needed to satisfy this concern."

However, two other key claims made by the authors\u2014the apparent lack of such changes in LMAN-to-RA synapses shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and the claim that the intrinsic properties of RA neurons do not change, supported by data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E and 5F</a>\u2014are based on the absence of a statistically significant effect. Although claims about changes in neural/synaptic populations must necessarily be made based on a limited sampling of neurons, I am concerned by the fact that the non-significant findings (<a href=\"#fig4 fig5\">Figures 4, 5E, F</a>) are based on smaller datasets than the reported significant finding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For example, total number of data points shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> (72+60+120=252) is more than twice as great as those in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> (40+45+38=123). Is the failure to detect a significant difference in the LMAN-RA synapses simply a result of the authors collecting less data than they obtained for HVC-RA synapses? Of even more concern is the argument based on the data shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E, F</a>. As the authors acknowledge, there is a trend towards an age-dependent effect which does not reach significance, however the total number of data points is small (n=9-10 for each condition); I am therefore not convinced that no age-dependent trend exists. This issue might be addressed in two different ways (ideally in both). First, the authors could devise an analysis to demonstrate that the difference between the LMAN-RA and HVC-RA results is not an artifact of dataset size. Second, the authors could expand their modeling approach to demonstrate that their argument about the consequences of changes in HVC-RA synapses holds true, even if the (small, and in the present analysis not statistically significant) changes in LMAN-RA connectivity and intrinsic RA properties hinted at in <a href=\"#fig4 fig5\">Figures 4 and 5</a> were in fact present."

However there are several important (and potentially problematic) differences between that earlier analysis and the one used here. Hooks and Chen calculated the ratio of single fiber current divided by the maximum current (SF/MAX), whereas the authors of the paper under review compute the reciprocal of this quantity (MAX/SF). Hooks and Chen's approach prevents large biases from low single fiber currents that would make the MAX/SF ratio quite large. After averaging this ratio for all measured single fibers, Hooks and Chen then invert it to estimate relative number. Importantly, Hooks and Chen calculate this statistic for each measured single fiber current \u2018individually\u2019, whereas the paper under review takes every maximum current and divides it by the \u2018average\u2019 single fiber current for that age group. It seems like SF/MAX should first be calculated for each single fiber input, as in Hooks and Chen, and <i>then</i> averaged. Moreover, the distributions shown in <a href=\"#fig3 fig4\">Figures 3B and 4C</a> are skewed to the right, making the mean a poor choice for calculating the relative number. Additionally, as many readers will not be familiar with this analysis technique the pros and cons of this approach should be discussed in greater detail to clarify the underlying assumptions."

In the current study, LMAN input is modeled as a single Poisson input with a fixed rate, although the firing rate of LMAN neurons, while variable, is modulated over the course of a motif. Are the conclusions based on the model robust to RA neurons receiving multiple, time varying inputs from LMAN? I suspect that the answer is yes; however demonstrating this would make the model results more convincing. Also, it is surprising that the authors do not parameterize their model with the distribution of single-fiber synaptic strengths presented in the first part of the paper (the fact that model inputs are expressed in units of mV makes it hard to assess whether the model distribution is similar to the distribution observed experimentally). Would the key model results hold true using a more realistic distribution of input strengths?"

The authors make whole cell recordings from RA neurons in brain slices from male zebra finches at three canonical time points during song learning, and electrically stimulate either HVC or LMAN axons to measure the strength of single fiber (SF) inputs and also to estimate the (relative) maximum (MAX) numbers of synapses from each of these sources. Using these approaches, they determine that HVC synapses become stronger and relatively less abundant over song learning, whereas LMAN inputs remain stable in strength and relative numbers; they also show that the intrinsic properties of RA neurons are also stable over this period. They then provide a simple circuit model that supports the idea that differences in how HVC and LMAN synapses onto RA neurons change with development could account for the decrease in song variability that accompanies song learning."

Thus, the characterization of LMAN synapses on RA neurons over song learning is the novel experimental data set provided here; the modeling study is also novel. Whether these together provide enough of an advance and will appeal to a broader readership is hard for me to assess. As a songbird researcher, I find the results very interesting and they help to articulate how the consolidation of HVC synapses on RA neurons could act as a counterweight to suppress noise from LMAN inputs. I would be interested to hear what the other reviewers' thoughts are about this."

They use this model to address the general issue of how motor performance and variability interact so that during acquisition variability, which is essential for learning a new skill, is reduced as performance is enhanced. The system is particularly suitable for such analyses because variability generating (LMAN) inputs and the inputs that drive learned song (HVC) separately project to the premotor area (RA). They conclude that there is no change in the variability generating inputs (LMAN) but that the song generating inputs are pruned and strengthened during song acquisition and consolidation. They then present a simple model of the system that reflects the changes in HVC and LMAN inputs to RA projection neurons observed during song maturation (learning). This model is carefully described and appropriate to the question at hand. The model is systematically explored and the modeling data supports their major conclusion that strengthening and pruning of HVC RA connections is the dominant mechanism that leads to decreased variability in performance and suggests how NMDA inputs from the viability system may enhance this process."

For example, the legend to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> reads: \u201c\u2026(c) strengthening/weakening LMAN inputs by up to 50%\u201d. This should specify: \u201c\u2026 up to 50% relative to the default value of W_LMAN, which was based on our empirical measurements of single-fiber currents (see Results; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)\u201d.

This section of the Discussion is therefore somewhat unsatisfying and highlights that the authors have not performed an important variation on their analysis that could yield additional insight. I think that the authors should either explore this directly using the model (by dissociating input sparsity from input strength to back up their qualitative assertions) or remove this consideration from the Discussion."

The decay kinetics of NMDA-mediated currents at the LMAN to RA synapse are known to become faster with age, similar to developmental changes described at other vertebrate central synapses, especially in the mammalian neocortex. Although these changes are most often associated with sensory learning of various kinds, it would be useful to know whether a slower time course in the LMAN to RA synaptic current has an effect on RA spike variability."

And the detailed explanation they provided for why they view their characterization of the developmental changes at the HVC to RA synapse was also helpful, although I still maintain that those changes could be at least partly inferred from earlier structural and functional studies by Hermann, Kittelberger and Canady. This is not to minimize the current study's importance, but I do believe the authors could go further in integrating the earlier work into their present writing to better highlight exactly what is new here and also to more accurately place their study in the published literature."

Further, Canady's serial EM reconstruction work (albeit in canary) revealed that HVC synapses are mostly (&gt;90%) onto spines, whereas LMAN synapses are split between spines and shafts; because HVC synapses far outnumber LMAN synapses on single RA neurons (I believe the ratio was greater than 20:1, but it's been awhile since I have read it thoroughly), Canady concluded that the vast majority of inputs onto spines of RA dendrites reflected input from HVC and from other RA neurons and not from LMAN. I think it is reasonable to assume from this that the developmental changes in RA spine density reported by Kittelberger mostly reflect reorganization from those two sources and not from LMAN. This postsynaptic change is paralleled by a reduction in the frequency of putative HVC axonal boutons in RA; taken together, this seems to provide pretty clear structural evidence of a reduction in the number of HVC to RA synaptic connections with development. Lastly, those structural changes are accompanied by increased efficacy in the HVC to RA synapse, as measured by the stimulus current, EPSP onset slope relationship, which steepens significantly between 45 d juveniles and adults. At face value, this suggests to me that the HVC to RA synapse undergoes developmental consolidation in a process that involves synaptic pruning and strengthening."

He also found that spontaneous EPSC amplitudes increased (with LMAN lesions, which mimicked the developmental effects), making it less likely that the change in the stimulus-response relationship simply reflected changes in HVC fiber excitability. He noted a reduction in HVC bouton frequency along with decreased spine density and increased stimulus-response relationship. In aggregate, these findings strongly suggest to me a developmental process in which HVC synapses are pruned and strengthened, thus partially anticipating one aspect of the current study. Nonetheless, the current study goes well beyond this by providing more direct evidence of such consolidation while also providing an exact estimate of the numbers of inputs at a greater range of developmental points."

First, the authors could devise an analysis to demonstrate that the difference between the LMAN-RA and HVC-RA results is not an artifact of dataset size. Second, the authors could expand their modeling approach to demonstrate that their argument about the consequences of changes in HVC-RA synapses holds true, even if the (small, and in the present analysis not statistically significant) changes in LMAN-RA connectivity and intrinsic RA properties hinted at in</i> <a href=\"#fig4 fig5\"><i>Figures 4 and 5</i></a> <i>were in fact present</i>."

To address the reviewers concern, however, we did probe whether having time\u2010varying LMAN inputs to RA impacts our conclusion. As the reviewer predicted, it does not. Strengthening and pruning of HVC\u2010RA synapses still decreases the variability in RA neuron firing (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 3A</a>), but because a strongly time\u2010varying LMAN input is less variable than a Poisson input, variability in RA, as compared to random LMAN input, is reduced.

We decided to do this for the reasons we initially did the experiments (see above) and because we believe it is good for the field to see that results can be robustly replicated across labs and with different recording techniques."

The current paper relates changes in RA circuitry during initial learning and development to the regulation of motor variability. It is not clear that increased variability after deafening or other perturbations would engage the same or similar mechanisms. Moreover, our contention is not that strengthening and pruning of HVC\u2010RA synapses is the only way to influence variability, and we now show that other mechanisms can contribute (<a href=\"#fig8 fig9\">Author response images 2 and 3</a>). Rather, the point we would like to make is that strengthening and pruning of HVC\u2010RA synapses is an important, and likely dominant, mechanisms for regulating variability during normal development."

We initially chose not to explore variation in NMDA kinetics, since available data from zebra finches suggest that it does not change over the course of sensorimotor learning (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stark and Perkel, 1999</a>). In response to the reviewer\u2019s comment, however, we changed NMDA kinetics in our model. We find that even a fourfold change in the decay constant has only a minor effect on variability (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 4</a> below). However, the simulations suggest that a decrease in this time constant, i.e. the trend seen during early development of neocortical NMDA synapses, actually increases variability, thus offering no explanation for the decreased variability in motor output. This result, however, may be confounded by another issue, which is that changing the time constant results in significant changes to RA firing rates. Decreasing the NMDA time constant from 100 ms to 50 ms, for example, reduces the average firing rate of model RA neurons from \u223c50 Hz to \u223c20 Hz. To keep the firing rate constant, we would need to tweak the model in ways that could also affect variability. Moreover, since most parameters in the model are already determined by our data, additional \u2018tweaks\u2019 would need to be justified. We note that changes to other parameters in the model over the ranges reported in the paper (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) did not materially affect the average firing rate of RA neurons."

And the detailed explanation they provided for why they view their characterization of the developmental changes at the HVC to RA synapse was also helpful, although I still maintain that those changes could be at least partly inferred from earlier structural and functional studies by Hermann, Kittelberger and Canady.

Further, Canady's serial EM reconstruction work (albeit in canary) revealed that HVC synapses are mostly (&gt;90%) onto spines, whereas LMAN synapses are split between spines and shafts; because HVC synapses far outnumber LMAN synapses on single RA neurons (I believe the ratio was greater than 20:1, but it's been awhile since I have read it thoroughly), Canady concluded that the vast majority of inputs onto spines of RA dendrites reflected input from HVC and from other RA neurons and not from LMAN. I think it is reasonable to assume from this that the developmental changes in RA spine density reported by Kittelberger mostly reflect reorganization from those two sources and not from LMAN. This postsynaptic change is paralleled by a reduction in the frequency of putative HVC axonal boutons in RA; taken together, this seems to provide pretty clear structural evidence of a reduction in the number of HVC to RA synaptic connections with development</i>."

That being said, we fully agree that the anatomical studies are consistent with our results and we now emphasize this further in the text. Yet there is no unambiguous way to predict from these structural studies how the organization of single fiber inputs to RA changes with development. This is because changes in the number of synaptic contacts could reflect changes in the number of functional inputs or fewer contacts per input. Moreover, the structural studies say little about the functional strength of the synapses. We believe our study, which focuses on the changes in the strength and number of single fiber inputs, nicely compliments previous anatomical work, giving us a more complete picture of the changes that accompany song learning."
