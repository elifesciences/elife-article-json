However, current cell type-specific gene disruption techniques in flies often reduce gene activity incompletely or rely on cell division. Here we describe FlpStop, a generalizable tool for conditional gene disruption and rescue in post-mitotic cells. In proof-of-principle experiments, we manipulated <i>apterous</i>, a regulator of wing development. Next, we produced conditional null alleles of <i>Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1</i> (<i>Gad1</i>) and <i>Resistant to dieldrin</i> (<i>Rdl</i>), genes vital for GABAergic neurotransmission, as well as <i>cacophony</i> (<i>cac</i>) and <i>paralytic</i> (<i>para</i>), voltage-gated ion channels central to neuronal excitability. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we manipulated <i>cac</i> in a specific visual interneuron type and discovered differential regulation of calcium signals across subcellular compartments. Thus, FlpStop will facilitate investigations into the interactions between genes, circuits, and computation."

However, current cell type-specific gene disruption techniques in flies often reduce gene activity incompletely or rely on cell division. Here we describe FlpStop, a generalizable tool for conditional gene disruption and rescue in post-mitotic cells. In proof-of-principle experiments, we manipulated <i>apterous</i>, a regulator of wing development. Next, we produced conditional null alleles of <i>Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1</i> (<i>Gad1</i>) and <i>Resistant to dieldrin</i> (<i>Rdl</i>), genes vital for GABAergic neurotransmission, as well as <i>cacophony</i> (<i>cac</i>) and <i>paralytic</i> (<i>para</i>), voltage-gated ion channels central to neuronal excitability. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we manipulated <i>cac</i> in a specific visual interneuron type and discovered differential regulation of calcium signals across subcellular compartments. Thus, FlpStop will facilitate investigations into the interactions between genes, circuits, and computation."

Most genes have multiple temporally and spatially distinct roles in different cells and can regulate both circuit development and function. Thus, to dissect the links between genes, computation, and behavior in the adult brain, gene activity must be manipulated selectively in mature, differentiated neurons in a cell type-specific manner. Here we describe a generalizable approach for completely disrupting target genes in cell populations of interest and demonstrate how this method can be used to illuminate the molecular basis of neural computation."

Studies in this animal have provided crucial insights into cell fate determination, wiring specificity, and the circuit bases of sensory processing and behavior (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bellen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kaneko and Ye, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Silies et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Wilson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</a>). <i>Drosophila</i> is well suited for studies of gene function in the nervous system, as its stereotyped circuit architecture allows repeated access to defined circuit components. In addition, many key neural genes are either uniquely encoded in the genome or have a small number of paralogs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000</a>). As a result, these genes are less likely to be functionally redundant, creating a unique opportunity for defining their contributions. Finally, large collections of genetic tools place heterologous transcription factors like Gal4 under the control of genomic enhancers, enabling access to many specific cell populations (<a href=\"#bib84\">Venken et al., 2011b</a>)."

For instance, in both mammals and insects, inhibitory GABAergic signaling implements signal transformations such as gain control and normalization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carandini and Heeger, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Olsen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Root et al., 2008</a>). During neuronal computation, these extrinsic signals interact with the intrinsic membrane properties of each neuron, which are governed by the complement of ion channels the neuron expresses. For example, a suite of voltage-gated calcium channels with different kinetics and activation thresholds mediate neuronal excitability, presynaptic vesicle release, and activity-dependent changes in transcription (<a href=\"#bib12\">Catterall, 2011</a>). The subcellular distribution and biophysical properties of such ion channels have profound impacts on the dynamics of synaptic transmission and on the integration of synaptic inputs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Migliore and Shepherd, 2002</a>). However, how these active conductances contribute to the encoding of information in vivo is not fully understood. The functions of voltage-gated channels have been studied extensively at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction. There, the calcium channel encoded by the gene <i>cacophony</i> is required for evoked transmission, suggesting that it mediates the influx of calcium that drives synaptic vesicle fusion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kawasaki et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kawasaki and Zou, 2004</a>). <i>Drosophila</i> has two additional voltage-gated calcium channels, <i>CaAlpha1D</i> and <i>CaAlpha1T</i>, which have been suggested to also play roles in neuronal excitability (<a href=\"#bib39\">Iniguez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Worrell and Levine, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ryglewski et al., 2012</a>). However, it is incompletely understood how these channels contribute to signaling and computation in the central nervous system."

                        "text": "Since each of these genes has widespread functions in the brain, the ability to manipulate them in individual classes of neurons is essential. Current techniques for cell type-specific gene manipulation in <i>Drosophila</i> are RNA interference (RNAi), targeted degradation of GFP-tagged proteins (deGradFP), recombinase-mediated exon deletion, induction of somatic mutations with CRISPR/Cas9, and clonal analyses using approaches such as Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker (MARCM) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dietzl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Xue et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lee and Luo, 1999</a>). While powerful, these methods have limitations that restrict their utility. RNAi uses a short hairpin RNA to trigger sequence-specific gene knock down; expression of these hairpins with the Gal4 system confers cell type-specificity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fire et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kennerdell and Carthew, 2000</a>). Large RNAi libraries targeting most genes in the genome are publically available (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dietzl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ni et al., 2009</a>). However, these hairpins can have off-target effects, interfering with genes other than the gene of interest (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ma et al., 2006</a>). In addition, knock down of gene expression is rarely complete and varies depending on the level of Gal4 expression. deGradFP uses cell type-specific expression of an anti-GFP nanobody to target GFP-tagged proteins for proteosomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Caussinus et al., 2012</a>). However, this approach requires that GFP-tagging preserves protein function, and, similar to RNAi, the extent of gene knock down also depends on the level of Gal4 expression. Flanking critical exons of a gene with recombinase sites produces conditional alleles such that cell type-specific expression of the recombinase enables targeted gene disruption; however, this approach has seen only limited application in flies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Choi et al., 2009</a>). CRISPR/Cas9 uses a small guide RNA and the Cas9 nuclease to produce small insertion and deletion mutations in the targeted gene; Gal4-driven expression of Cas9 confers cell type-specificity. However, somatic expression of Cas9 produces different mutations in each cell and has not been shown to work in fly neurons. Critically, RNAi, recombinase-mediated deletion, and somatic CRISPR/Cas9 all lack a cell-by-cell indicator of gene disruption, an essential feature for cell type-specific manipulations. In contrast, methods such as MARCM use mitotic recombination to create labeled homozygous mutant cells within an otherwise heterozygous animal. However, by design, MARCM is incompatible with Gal4 driver lines that are only expressed postmitotically, precluding selective manipulation of all cells of a single type in the adult fly."

By design, FlpStop is specific for both the target gene and cell type and provides a cell-by-cell readout of the manipulation. FlpStop uses insertional mutagenesis to create conditional null alleles and reports gene manipulation through positive labeling of targeted cells. We tested this approach in eight different genes that are involved in development, neuronal signaling, and intrinsic excitability\u2014<i>apterous</i> (<i>ap</i>), <i>cacophony</i> (<i>cac</i>), <i>Choline acetyltransferase</i> (<i>ChAT</i>), <i>Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1</i> (<i>Gad1</i>), <i>paralytic</i> (<i>para</i>), <i>Resistant to dieldrin</i> (<i>Rdl</i>), <i>Shaker cognate l</i> (<i>Shal</i>), and <i>Vesicular glutamate transporter</i> (<i>VGlut</i>)\u2014and generated five conditional null alleles and two conditional hypomorphs. We demonstrate that FlpStop can efficiently impair gene function within genetically targeted populations of interest and at specific times during development. Finally, we used FlpStop in combination with in vivo calcium imaging to investigate the role of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cac in a visual interneuron. Strikingly, cell type-specific removal of Cac selectively altered visually evoked calcium signals in individual neuronal compartments in unexpected ways. While the\u00a0loss of Cac reduced responses in some but not all axonal compartments, it also dramatically increased responses in a specific dendritic region. Thus, FlpStop is a powerful tool for investigating how individual genes contribute to neuronal function in vivo."

                                "text": "We designed a generalizable transgenic tool that allows conditional, cell type-specific disruption of gene function. The Gene Disruption Project has produced a publically available collection of genomic insertions that can be exchanged for other DNA sequences using \u03d5C31 integrase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). These MiMIC cassettes target 2854 coding introns within 1862 distinct genes (<a href=\"#bib83\">Venken et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015b</a>). We reasoned that a strategy that uses intronic insertions to conditionally disrupt gene function would be broadly useful. Therefore, we designed FlpStop, a small construct for conditional gene disruption capable of integrating into MiMIC insertions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Our approach incorporated two parallel strategies to disrupt gene expression. First, the construct acts on transcription using the SV40 and Tub\u03b11 transcriptional terminators (<a href=\"#bib79\">Stockinger et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Second, the construct acts on translation by incorporating the MHC intron 18 splice acceptor followed by stop codons in all three reading frames (<a href=\"#bib83\">Venken et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hodges and Bernstein, 1992</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Similar constructs have been used previously in flies to produce strong loss-of-function alleles (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lukacsovich et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Schuldiner et al., 2008</a>). These disruptive elements, hereafter designated SA-STOP for brevity, are flanked by two pairs of Flp recombinase target (FRT) sites that form a FLEx-switch, making this DNA region invertible and thus conditional (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schn\u00fctgen et al., 2003</a>). The FRT sites are arranged such that in the presence of Flp recombinase, the construct can be inverted and then stably locked in the opposite orientation (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schn\u00fctgen et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Therefore, in one orientation, the splice acceptor and the transcriptional terminators of the SA-STOP cassette lie on the non-transcribed DNA strand and do not interfere with the\u00a0expression (non-disrupting, ND); after inversion, the SA-STOP cassette is relocated to the transcribed DNA strand, enabling it to interfere with gene activity (disrupting locked orientation, D lock) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). A conceptually similar construct was sufficient to conditionally disrupt a mitochondrial RNA helicase in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ni et al., 2012</a>). Using the FlpStop approach, homozygous mutant cells can be induced in otherwise heterozygous animals by placing the conditional FlpStop allele in trans to an existing null allele and expressing Flp recombinase within target cells of interest (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b,c</a>). Use of an independent null allele avoids the potential effects of off-target mutations in a genetic background, as is standard practice in the field. In <i>Drosophila</i>, precise control of Flp expression can be easily achieved by expressing Flp under either the direct control of a specific promoter or the indirect control of a driver (e.g. the Gal4 system)."

An intronic MiMIC cassette (<a href=\"#bib83\">Venken et al., 2011a</a>) is replaced with the FlpStop cassette using \u03d5C31. The FlpStop cassette contains the following disruptive elements: two transcriptional terminators, a MHC splice acceptor, and stop codons in all three reading frames. These disruptive elements are flanked by a series of Flp recombinase sites (FRT and F3). An upstream activation sequence (UAS) is located outside of the FRT sites and a tdTomato is encoded internal to the FRT sites. (<b>b</b>) Pipeline to create FlpStop alleles. First, a MiMIC line is identified that contains an insertion within a coding intron of a gene of interest.

This fluorescent reporter provides a direct readout of the cells in which the cassette is inverted and allows assessment of inversion efficiency under different experimental conditions."

                                "text": "To test the ability of the FlpStop cassette to produce strong, conditional loss-of-function alleles, we targeted <i>apterous</i>, a gene encoding a transcription factor required for wing development (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 1992</a>). The developmental role of <i>apterous</i> has been extensively characterized, and its disruption produces an easily quantifiable wing phenotype, making it a good candidate for proof-of-concept experiments. To target <i>apterous</i>, we used an intronic MiMIC insertion between exons 4 and 5, upstream of approximately half of the coding region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Two FlpStop insertions in the <i>apterous</i> locus were isolated (non-disrupting and disrupting, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We next performed complementation testing to characterize the <i>apterous</i> FlpStop alleles (designated <i>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i> and <i>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i>) with an established recessive molecular null allele, <i>ap<sup>UG035</sup></i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 1992</a>). Wings were scored on an established scale from class 1 (wild-type wing) to class 5 (no wing) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gohl et al., 2008</a>). For the FlpStop approach to be conditional, the non-disrupting orientation must be inert, maintaining wild-type gene activity, while the disrupting orientation should be strongly mutagenic, abolishing gene function. When the <i>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i> allele was combined with <i>ap<sup>UG035</sup></i>, flies had almost exclusively wild-type wings (99% class 1, n\u00a0=\u00a0462, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result demonstrates that <i>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i> did not interfere with gene function. Conversely, when <i>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i> was combined with the null allele, virtually all flies had no wings (97% class 5, n\u00a0=\u00a0236, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This phenotype was as severe as homozygous flies bearing two copies of the null allele, demonstrating that <i>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i> completely disrupted gene function. In addition, when combined with a wild-type chromosome, neither allele produced wing abnormalities, ruling out dominant negative effects (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For comparison, we note that previous studies of <i>apterous</i> using the deGradFP approach produced only class 4 wing phenotypes and were unable to completely block wing development in any flies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Caussinus et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the FlpStop cassette can produce orientation-dependent, loss-of-function alleles."

To invert the cassette, we expressed Flp recombinase under the control of the heat-shock promoter (<i>hsFlp</i>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</a>). Flies that were <i>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i>/<i>ap<sup>UG035</sup></i> or <i>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i>/<i>ap<sup>UG035</sup></i> and carried the <i>hsFlp</i> transgene were heat-shocked for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C to induce recombinase expression at different time points during development, and the phenotype of adult wings was scored (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). We predicted that early manipulation of <i>apterous</i> function would have strong wing phenotypes because Apterous is essential for the development of the wing imaginal disc during larval stages (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen et al., 1992</a>). We first tested the non-disrupting allele, whose inversion should disrupt <i>apterous</i> function. Control flies that were not heat-shocked had wild-type wings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Experimental flies heat-shocked early in development (days 1\u20133) exhibited severe wing phenotypes, with many flies completely lacking one or both wings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). When cassette inversion was induced later in development, flies exhibited less severe wing phenotypes, consistent with the established role of <i>apterous</i> in wing development during late larval stages (<a href=\"#bib87\">Wilson, 1981</a>). Next, we performed the converse experiment in which the disrupting allele was used to rescue <i>apterous</i> function at different developmental time points (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). We observed a rescue of the <i>apterous</i> wing phenotype when the <i>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i>\u00a0cassette was inverted early; more than half of the wings from flies heat-shocked on day 1 were wild-type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Restoration of <i>apterous</i> later in development (days 4\u20137) was unable to rescue the no-wings phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Interestingly, the time window during which <i>apterous</i> is necessary for wing development differs from the time window during which its rescue is sufficient to enable wing development: heat-shock on day 4 substantially altered the phenotype of <i>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i>/<i>ap<sup>UG035</sup></i> flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>), yet had little effect on <i>ap<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i>/<i>ap<sup>UG035</sup></i> flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). This difference may reflect the early requirement of <i>apterous</i> in cell fate specification; rescue of <i>apterous</i> function following misspecification of cells within the wing disc cannot restore normal wing formation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that FlpStop enables temporally precise gene disruption as well as gene rescue, thereby facilitating the investigation of gene function during development."

To test whether the FlpStop approach could remove Apterous protein in somatic mosaic animals, we again expressed Flp recombinase under control of the heat-shock promoter (<a href=\"#bib30\">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</a>) in <i>ap<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i>/<i>ap<sup>UG035</sup></i> larvae. To mark the tissue containing the inverted cassette, the ubiquitous driver <i>Tubulin-Gal4</i> was also included. With this experimental design, <i>apterous</i> mutant cells were positively labeled with tdTomato, while the rest of the tissue was heterozygous and unmarked (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). Importantly, wing discs from control larvae displayed normal Apterous expression (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2c</a>). TdTomato-positive regions lacked Apterous staining, while other regions of the same disc displayed high levels of protein expression (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2d</a>). Thus, tissue-specific inversion of the FlpStop cassette strongly impaired expression of Apterous, demonstrating the utility of the FlpStop approach for efficiently producing somatic mosaic tissue for developmental studies."

All loci contained a MiMIC insertion within an intronic region common to all splice variants, upstream of a large portion of the coding sequence (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). For neuronal excitability, we targeted <i>paralytic</i> (<i>para</i>), which encodes the alpha subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel (<a href=\"#bib81\">Suzuki et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Loughney et al., 1989</a>); <i>cacophony (cac)</i>, the alpha subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kawasaki et al., 2000</a>); and <i>Shaker cognate l</i> (<i>Shal</i>), a voltage-gated potassium channel (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butler et al., 1990</a>).

For these loci, we produced FlpStop alleles with separate insertions in both the non-disrupting and disrupting orientations (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

For <i>cac</i>, only the non-disrupting stock was isolated by transgenesis so we instead used germline expression of Flp to isolate an allele of <i>cac</i> in which the FlpStop cassette was locked in the disrupting orientation (D lock, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and Materials and methods).

The genes <i>cac</i>, <i>ChAT</i>, <i>Gad1</i>, <i>para</i>, <i>Rdl</i>, <i>and VGlut</i> are essential to nervous system function; hence null alleles are homozygous lethal. We combined the disrupting and non-disrupting orientation FlpStop alleles for <i>ChAT</i>, <i>Gad1</i>, <i>Rdl</i>, and <i>VGlut</i> with known null alleles and scored adult survival (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This demonstrated that, as required for conditional manipulations, the FlpStop construct had no phenotypic effect when in the non-disrupting orientation. In addition, we saw no evidence of dominant negative activity as measured by heterozygous lethality from the FlpStop alleles (data not shown). Next, we tested mutagenicity of the disrupting orientation. For <i>Gad1</i> and <i>Rdl</i> the combination of the disrupting allele with either of two independent null alleles was lethal, demonstrating complete disruption of gene function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>). When placed in trans to a null allele, the <i>VGlut<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i> allele resulted in a significant reduction in viability relative to the non-disrupting allele (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). However, the combination was not completely lethal, suggesting that insertion of the FlpStop cassette created a hypomorphic allele of <i>VGlut</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). The <i>VGlut</i> FlpStop insertion lies between exons 3 and 4, and consistent with our observation, a chromosomal deletion of exons 1\u20133 creates a viable allele that only partially reduces <i>VGlut</i> function (<a href=\"#bib19\">Daniels et al., 2006</a>). The FlpStop insert into a single locus, <i>ChAT</i>, was viable in combination with established null alleles, showing no evidence of gene disruption (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>)."

To further test the function of the FlpStop alleles of <i>para</i> and <i>cac</i>, we performed complementation tests with these temperature sensitive alleles and measured heat-induced paralysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c,d</a>). Under our culture conditions, flies homozygous for <i>para<sup>ts1</sup></i> were sometimes immobilized when exposed to 33\u00b0C for 2 min and almost always paralyzed at 35\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). When the cassette in the non-disrupting orientation was combined with the <i>para<sup>ts1</sup></i> mutation (<i>para<sup>FlpStop ND</sup>/para<sup>ts1</sup>)</i>, flies did not become paralyzed at either temperature, results that were comparable to control flies that were heterozygous for <i>para<sup>ts1</sup></i> (<i>para<sup>ts1</sup>/+</i>). Thus, the <i>para<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i> allele did not impair gene function. Conversely, flies in which the <i>para<sup>FlpStop\u00a0D</sup></i> allele was combined with <i>para<sup>ts1</sup></i> (<i>para<sup>FlpStop D</sup>/para<sup>ts1</sup></i>) exhibited a fully penetrant paralysis phenotype at both temperatures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). As this phenotype was more severe than that observed for <i>para<sup>ts1</sup></i> homozygous mutant flies, we infer that <i>para<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i> caused complete or nearly complete disruption of <i>para</i> function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Analogous complementation tests were performed for the <i>cac<sup>FlpStop</sup></i> alleles using the temperature-sensitive mutation <i>cac<sup>TS2</sup></i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kawasaki et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). When <i>cac<sup>FlpStop</sup></i> alleles were complemented against <i>cac<sup>TS2</sup></i>, the non-disrupting allele displayed little paralysis at either of two restrictive temperatures. Conversely, flies carrying the cassette in the disrupting orientation displayed a highly penetrant paralysis phenotype that was more severe than that observed in <i>cac<sup>TS2</sup></i> homozygous animals. Thus, the <i>cac<sup>FlpStop D lock</sup></i> allele also severely impaired gene function."

To capture the combined mutagenic effects of both the transcriptional terminators and the splice acceptor in the cassette, qRT-PCR primers were designed to amplify mRNA transcripts from the exons that flanked the FlpStop insertion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). Thus, either termination of transcription or hijacking of the splicing pattern would reduce the level of the qRT-PCR product. Complete loss of function of <i>Shal</i> is homozygous viable and has no easily scorable phenotype (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bergquist et al., 2010</a>); thus, we performed qRT-PCR on flies homozygous for the FlpStop insertions to test their ability to disrupt gene function. <i>Shal<sup>FlpStop D</sup>/ Shal<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i> flies displayed an approximately 50% reduction in <i>Shal</i> transcript relative to <i>Shal<sup>FlpStop ND</sup>/ Shal<sup>FlpStop\u00a0ND</sup></i> flies, consistent with the <i>Shal<sup>FlpStop D</sup></i> allele functioning as a hypomorph (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). We also wanted to confirm that the alleles that were lethal by complementation testing (<i>cac</i>, <i>Gad1</i>, <i>para</i>, and <i>Rdl</i>) fully reduced mRNA transcript levels. As the disrupting alleles of these genes were homozygous lethal, we measured gene expression in heterozygous animals bearing one copy of either the non-disrupting or disrupting allele. Under these conditions, if the disrupting allele were behaving as a null, heterozygous <i>D/+</i> flies should express half as much intact target gene mRNA as heterozygous ND/+ flies. Consistent with our complementation tests, transcripts in heterozygous flies bearing the disrupting allele were reduced approximately 50% relative to heterozygous flies bearing the non-disrupting allele (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f\u2013i</a>)."

For four of the seven genes, <i>cac, Gad1, para,</i> and <i>Rdl</i>, the disrupting orientations were genetically null (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). For two of the seven genes, <i>VGlut</i> and <i>Shal,</i> the disrupting alleles were hypomorphic (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). A single locus, <i>ChAT</i>, showed no evidence of gene disruption. Taken together, these genetic and molecular tests of the FlpStop alleles demonstrate that non-disrupting alleles have no negative effect on gene activity and that disrupting alleles often behave as genetic null or hypomorphic alleles (six of seven genes).

To establish this proof-of-concept for FlpStop, we examined visually evoked responses in the third-order visual interneuron Tm3.

The arbors in layers M8, M10, Lo1, and Lo4 are primarily presynaptic, with prominent synapses onto T4 in layer M10 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hasegawa et al., 2011</a>). Although each Tm3 arbor is primarily either dendritic or axonal, each arbor can contain both pre- and postsynaptic sites (<a href=\"#bib82\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>). Tm3 responds with transient graded depolarizations to increases in light intensity (ON) and is required for flies to respond behaviorally to fast moving ON edges (<a href=\"#bib4\">Behnia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Yang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ammer et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, we incorporated a <i>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></i> transgene, a ubiquitously expressed temperature-sensitive repressor of Gal4 (<a href=\"#bib58\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>), to restrict Gal4 activity to late pupal and adult stages.

The no-Flp control should neither disrupt <i>cac</i> nor express tdTomato but otherwise contains all other transgenes, thereby controlling for their presence. The heterozygous control should invert <i>cac<sup>FlpStop ND</sup></i> and express tdTomato; however, as it carries one wild-type <i>cac</i> allele, <i>cac</i> function in Tm3 likely remains largely intact. This controls for any potential effects of Flp and tdTomato on Tm3. Experimental males and heterozygous controls expressed tdTomato in nearly all Tm3 cells while no-Flp controls expressed no detectable tdTomato (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b\u2013e</a> and data not shown). In one-day old adults, nearly all of Tm3 neurons expressed tdTomato and therefore carried the inverted FlpStop cassette (data not shown).

Compared with both no-Flp and heterozygous controls, Tm3 cells lacking Cac displayed significantly reduced responses in the cell body as well as in the arbors in layers Lo1 and Lo4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,f,g</a>). This suggests that in these cellular compartments, Cac is required for a substantial portion, but not all, of the visually evoked calcium response. Strikingly, calcium signals in the layer M5 arbor became dramatically larger when Cac was removed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). We speculate that removal of Cac from this compartment leads to replacement of Cac channels with one or more other channel types, resulting in increased calcium influx. Interestingly, loss of <i>cac</i> function did not affect responses in the arbors of layers M1, M8, and M10 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b,d,e</a>), demonstrating that calcium signals in these compartments can be mediated by other channel types. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cac is a critical regulator of Tm3\u2019s calcium responses to visual stimuli and has differential effects across cellular compartments."

Here we describe FlpStop, a generalizable strategy for producing cell type-specific disruption or rescue of gene function that is reported with fluorescent protein expression. We demonstrate that insertion of the FlpStop cassette into coding introns using the MiMIC collection enables straightforward production of conditional null alleles of many genes. Conditional gene disruption with FlpStop can be easily targeted to cell populations of interest through expression of Flp recombinase using the Gal4 system. The fluorescent reporter provides a readout of cassette orientation and is compatible with in vivo and fixed-tissue imaging. To make a broadly useful toolkit for dissecting neural circuit function, we created and validated FlpStop alleles of genes involved in GABAergic inhibition (<i>Rdl</i> and <i>Gad1</i>) as well as voltage-gated conductances (<i>para</i> and <i>cac</i>). In a proof-of-principle experiment, we used this tool to disrupt <i>cac</i> within Tm3 neurons. Strikingly, this experiment uncovered a novel role for <i>cac</i> in select subcellular compartments, demonstrating not only the complexity of calcium signaling but also the utility of the FlpStop approach. Thus, FlpStop is a powerful tool for targeted gene manipulation to address questions exploring the interactions between genes, circuits, and behavior."

Two genes targeted by FlpStop were not completely successful in creating the desired conditional null alleles: the insert into <i>Shal</i> produced a hypomorph, and the insert into <i>ChAT</i> showed no evidence of gene disruption. Interestingly, <i>ChAT</i> is a complex genetic locus where the coding region of <i>VAChT</i> is nested within the first intron of the <i>ChAT</i> gene, and it has been proposed that both transcripts arise from a common transcript by differential RNA processing (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kitamoto et al., 1998</a>).

At present, MiMIC insertions allow access to the coding introns of approximately 24% of neuronal genes (as annotated by flybase.org; see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015b</a>). For genes that lack a suitable MiMIC site, the FlpStop construct can be targeted to desired genomic loci using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (CRISPR-HDR). To facilitate this approach, we have created a plasmid for integration of the FlpStop construct through CRISPR-HDR (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gratz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mali et al., 2013</a>) (Materials and methods, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This plasmid contains a multiple cloning site on either side of the FlpStop cassette to enable inclusion of the homology arms and a Cre recombinase-excisable <i>3xP3-dsRed</i> reporter to enable scoring of successful incorporation of the cassette into the genome (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gratz et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given the flexible access to almost all genetic loci provided by CRISPR-HDR, the FlpStop cassette can be targeted to essentially any gene of interest that contains a coding intron. While more time consuming because of the need to clone new homology arms for each genetic locus, CRISPR-HDR-mediated insertion of FlpStop is more flexible than MiMIC-based insertion and could be used to target specific introns for more efficient gene disruption. The CRISPR-HDR approach can be further adapted to target genomic regions containing a Gal4 transgene using Homology Assisted CRISPR Knock-in, opening up additional loci without the need for gene-specific homology arms (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gratz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Lin and Potter, 2016</a>). As the FlpStop tool kit is expanded to more loci, more information about the failures and successes of insertions will be obtained. Incorporating this new information into the choice of intron for the targeting of new genes could further increase the already high success rate of the FlpStop approach."

Each of these inverted alleles would express tdTomato under Gal4 control. In this work, we demonstrate that the transformation from non-disrupting to disrupting provides a powerful approach for exploring the functions of essential genes. For non-essential genes, the transformation from disrupting to non-disrupting allows for cell type-specific genetic rescue by the endogenous locus, as demonstrated by the rescue of <i>apterous</i> function at specific time points during development (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). For this application, one should combine the disrupting allele with a null allele so that the entire animal lacks gene activity but the Flp-targeted cell population becomes heterozygous. This approach offers advantages over rescue experiments using the Gal4 system to express cDNAs as the genes are expressed in their native regulatory contexts. Therefore, it will be particularly useful for studies of gene function during development and circuit studies of genes involved in, for example, sensory transduction."

For example, as we demonstrate with <i>ap<sup>FlpStop</sup></i>, use of the heat-shock promoter to express Flp restricts inversion of the FlpStop construct to a brief time window, a manipulation that is well suited to developmental studies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Flp recombinase can also be expressed under Gal4 control, and additional temporal specificity can be achieved by incorporating Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, as we demonstrate with Tm3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). These approaches enable the inversion of the FlpStop construct to be restricted to a time period of hours to days. In addition, combining the FlpStop approach with temperature-sensitive alleles enables control of gene activity on the scale of seconds to minutes (<a href=\"#bib77\">Siddiqi and Benzer, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Suzuki et al., 1971</a>). As we demonstrated with <i>para</i> and <i>cac</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), one can place a temperature-sensitive allele in trans to the FlpStop allele of the same gene and use a temperature shift to disrupt gene function. Extending this approach, when the disrupting orientation is induced within a cell type of interest, those cells will only produce proteins containing the temperature-sensitive mutation while all other cells will express both wild-type and mutant protein. Upon temperature shift, the cell type of interest will lack functional protein while the rest of the animal will have a 50% reduction in gene activity, becoming effectively heterozygous. This strategy could be applied to any gene where a temperature-sensitive mutation exists, thereby enabling highly precise spatial and temporal control of gene activity."

                                "text": "FlpStop complements and extends existing techniques for cell type-specific gene manipulation. First, our validated FlpStop disrupting alleles are nulls, and the non-disrupting alleles have wild-type function, reducing the experimental variability that can emerge when performing gene knock down using RNAi or deGradFP. That is, in these two approaches, differences in the strength of the Gal4 driver result in differences in the extent of gene knock down in each cell. In contrast, because of the binary nature of FlpStop, differences in the strength of the driver change the frequency of cassette inversion, producing different proportions of mutant cells; the extent of gene disruption across mutant cells is constant. However, RNAi requires fewer genetic elements than FlpStop, and collections targeting most genes are available (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dietzl et al., 2007</a>). RNAi therefore may be more suitable for large-scale screens and experiments that contain genetic complexity in addition to gene knock down, while FlpStop would be more suitable for targeted interrogations where complete removal or rescue of gene function is required. Second, unlike recombinase-mediated deletion of exons, RNAi, deGradFP, and CRISPR/Cas9, FlpStop positively labels affected cells with a fluorescent reporter of gene manipulation and enables gene rescue in addition to gene disruption. Third, unlike MARCM, which also positively labels manipulated cells, FlpStop can be used to target all the cells of a single differentiated type in the adult brain. However, like MARCM, FlpStop requires a null allele of the gene of interest, though for FlpStop, this issue can be avoided for genes on the X chromosome by the\u00a0use of hemizygous males (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). For autosomal genes, a rich history of <i>Drosophila</i> genetics has produced null alleles of many genes. When choosing a null for FlpStop analysis of an autosomal gene, we recommend avoiding alleles that contain an FRT site, as these could recombine with the FlpStop cassette and generate unwanted DNA rearrangements. This includes the disrupting FlpStop allele of the same gene and some deficiencies. If an established null does not already exist for a gene of interest, MiMIC insertions in the disrupting orientation can often provide a null allele, and CRISPR-Cas9 technology enables the straightforward production of null alleles by creating targeted mutations within an essential exon (<a href=\"#bib83\">Venken et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bassett et al., 2013</a>). Thus, FlpStop opens a number of new experimental avenues."

                                "text": "To demonstrate the utility of the FlpStop approach to studying neuronal function in vivo, we removed Cac specifically from the visual interneuron Tm3. We found that Cac is a critical regulator of light-evoked calcium responses in specific subcellular compartments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In motor neurons, Cac is the voltage-gated calcium channel required presynaptically for evoked neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kawasaki et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kawasaki and Zou, 2004</a>). However, recent studies in olfactory projection neurons (PNs) demonstrate that Cac may have a more complex role in the central nervous system (<a href=\"#bib34\">Gu et al., 2009</a>). We measured visually evoked calcium signals in all of the arbors of Tm3, comprising four predominately axonal regions and two predominately dendritic regions, as well as the cell body. As expected from its role in synaptic vesicle release in motor neurons, we show that in Tm3, <i>cac</i> is required for normal light-evoked calcium responses in the axon terminals in layers Lo1 and Lo4. However, unexpectedly, the effects of Cac removal were substantially different across the other compartments of Tm3. In particular, Cac is not required in the axon terminals in layers M8 and M10. Thus, unlike in motor neurons where Cac is required at all synaptic boutons, in Tm3, some, but not all, output regions require this channel. Given that these arbors synapse onto distinct downstream partners, these molecular differences may be computationally significant. Additionally, we observed that loss of Cac reduces calcium responses in the cell body, an observation that also diverges from its role in motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib88\">Worrell and Levine, 2008</a>). As the cell body neither makes nor receives synapses, Cac perhaps contributes to other processes such as calcium-mediated regulation of transcription or enzyme activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Catterall, 2011</a>). Finally, we were surprised to find that removal of Cac increased calcium responses to light specifically in the layer M5 arbor. The removal of a voltage-gated calcium channel from a compartment would not be expected to directly increase calcium signals. One explanation for this observed increase is that Cac was locally replaced with another voltage-gated calcium channel that perhaps has a lower activation threshold or slower inactivation, allowing more calcium to enter the layer M5 arbor upon stimulation. Indeed, wild-type calcium responses in the layer M5 arbor are much smaller than would be expected from the corresponding voltage signals (<a href=\"#bib91\">Yang et al., 2016</a>). Perhaps Cac normally mediates this small response, but the channel that replaces it in <i>cac</i> mutant cells has different properties. Alternatively, loss of Cac throughout Tm3 may cause global changes in calcium channel regulation or expression and thus the phenotypes we observe may also be influenced by compensation. If this were the case, the compartment-specific effects of <i>cac</i> disruption on calcium signaling would reflect differential effects of compensation across subcellular compartments. Taken together, the effects of disrupting <i>cac</i> in Tm3 illustrate the complexity of neuronal calcium signaling and the diverse roles Cac plays in a central nervous system neuron."

Brains were microdissected out of the flies\u2019 heads in PBS. Brains were then\u00a0homogenized in a solution containing beta-mercaptoethanol, and RNA was extracting using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All of the RNA samples were checked for quality by bioanalysis to confirm the presence of both 18S and 28S ribosomal peaks and the lack of evidence of RNA degradation (RNA integrity number\u00a0&gt;\u00a05). QC Bioanalysis was performed by the Stanford PAM facility using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA was made from the RNA samples using the SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and this cDNA solution was used directly in subsequent qRT-PCR reactions. Four technical replicates were run for each of the biological replicates of each genotype, and the mean of those four readings was used to estimate transcript levels for each individual biological replicate. For all of the qRT-PCR experiments, <i>Gapdh2</i> was used as a reference for normalization. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained from the Eppendorf software. The Delta-Delta Ct method was used to calculate relative transcript levels: % Transcript difference\u00a0=\u00a02<sup>\u2227</sup>((Ct ND target gene \u2013 Ct ND reference gene) - (Ct D target gene \u2013 Ct D reference gene)). An unpaired, two-tailed, two-sample Student\u2019s t-test was applied to the delta Ct values obtained for the biological replicates to assess significance. For presentation purposes, all observations were normalized to the mean transcript level of the non-disrupting genotype."

In the 3D \u2018Surpass\u2019 visualization mode, we manually placed \u2018spots\u2019 on the middle of each GFP-positive cell body (GCaMP6f in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4 and 6</a>, mCD8::GFP in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Spots labeling GFP-positive cells were placed while blinded to the tdTomato channel. Next, \u2018spots\u2019 marking the center of tdTomato positive cell bodies were placed while blinded to the GFP channel. Colocalization between GFP and tdTomato spots was then obtained using the \u2018Colocalize Spots\u2019 function. For experiments labeling Mi1, Tm1, and Tm3, a threshold distance of less than 3.5 \u00b5m between the two spots was used as the cutoff for colocalization. For the T4 analysis this threshold was lowered to 2.5 \u00b5m since the T4 cell bodies were more closely clustered together. After running the colocalization function, the analysis was checked by eye and any obvious false positive or false negative errors were corrected by changing either the location of a spot, removing a spot, or adding a spot.

The brain was exposed by removing the overlying cuticle and fat bodies with fine forceps, and an oxygenated saline-sugar solution (<a href=\"#bib85\">Wilson et al., 2004</a>) was perfused over the fly. The saline composition was as follows: 103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM TES, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM sucrose, and 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The pH of the saline equilibrated near 7.3 when bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Neurons were imaged with a Leica TCS SP5 II microscope with a Leica HCX APO 20X/1.0-NA water immersion objective (Leica). For two-photon imaging, a pre-compensated Chameleon Vision II femtosecond laser (Coherent, Inc.) tuned to a\u00a0wavelength of 920 nm was used to excite the sample (5\u201315 mW of power at the stage). Emitted photons from GCaMP6f were collected with a 525/50 nm filter. Visually evoked calcium responses were acquired at a constant frame rate of 38.9 Hz using a frame size of 200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020 pixels, 15X digital zoom, a line scan rate of 1400 Hz, and bidirectional scanning. Imaging time per fly never exceeded 1.5 hr. Tm3 calcium signals were imaged in adult flies 10 to 12 days after eclosion. For one-photon imaging, a 488 nm diode laser was used to excite GCaMP6f, and emitted photons with wavelengths between 496 nm and 537 nm were collected. A 543 nm diode laser was used to excite tdTomato, and emitted photons with wavelengths between 557 nm and 661 nm were collected."

Immediately prior to being projected onto the screen, the stimulus was filtered with a 482/18 nm bandpass filter as well as an ND 0.5 neutral density filter so that it could not be detected by the microscope PMTs. The stimulus was refreshed at 240 Hz and had a radiance of approximately 30 mW\u00b7sr<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>.

Regions of interest (ROIs) around individual arbors or cell bodies were manually selected in the time series-averaged image. For each imaging frame within the time series, intensity values for the pixels within each ROI were averaged and the mean background value (the average intensity in a region of the image without cells) was subtracted. To correct for bleaching, the time series for each ROI was fit with the sum of two exponentials, and in the calculation of \u0394F/F = (F(t) \u2013 F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, the fitted value at each time t was used as F<sub>0</sub>. For the 2 s flash search stimulus, all imaging frames were used to compute the fit, thereby placing \u0394F/F\u00a0=\u00a00 at the mean response after correction for bleaching. For the 25 ms light and dark flashes off of gray stimulus, only imaging frames that fell in the last 25% of the gray period were used to fit the bleaching curve; this places \u0394F/F\u00a0=\u00a00 at the mean baseline the cell returns to after responding to the flash instead of at the mean of the entire trace. The stimulus-locked average was computed for each ROI by reassigning the timing of each imaging frame to be relative to the stimulus transitions (dark to light or light to dark for the 2 s flash search stimulus, gray to light or gray to dark for the flashes off of gray) and then computing a simple moving average with a 25 ms averaging window and a shift of 8.33 ms. This effectively resampled our data from 38.9 Hz to 120 Hz with 3-point boxcar smoothing but did not otherwise distort the fluorescence signal. As the screen on which the stimulus was presented did not span the fly\u2019s entire visual field, only a subset of imaged ROIs actually observed the stimulus. Both the 2 s flash search stimulus and the 25 ms light and dark flashes stimulus were presented to each ROI. Responding ROIs were identified as those responding to the 2 s flash search stimulus. All of the responses also were examined manually. All traces are presented as the mean\u00a0\u00b11 SEM across all of the responding ROIs of the moving average response to all trials of each ROI."

These driver lines were chosen because they labeled many neurons within a single brain and because the cell bodies were spaced out enough from one another to enable quantification on a large scale in a confocal volume (Materials and methods). We quantified the fraction of GCaMP6f-positive cells that were also tdTomato-positive. These experiments strongly support our claim that the flipping efficiency is very high and will be suitable for many experimental goals. For Mi1, Tm1, and Tm3 greater than 90% of GCaMP6f-positive cells are also labeled by tdTomato.

[\u2026] This includes the disrupting FlpStop allele of the same gene and some deficiencies. If an established null does not already exist for a gene of interest, MiMIC insertions in the disrupting orientation can often provide a null allele and CRISPR-Cas9 technology enables the straightforward production of null alleles by creating targeted mutations within an essential exon (Venken et al. 2011; Bassett et al. 2013).\u201d"

While it is necessary to show that FlpStop works, this information would be of greater interest if it compared the efficacy of gene disruption using FlpStop with that of a MiMIC insertion in the disrupting orientation. One design difference between the MiMIC and FlpStop constructs is that the latter has transcriptional terminators, and it would be interesting to know if they are actually useful (i.e. do FlpStopDs reduce transcript levels more than the original MiMICs, when the latter are in a disrupting orientation?)</i> "

                    "text": "The extent to which transcriptional terminators contribute to the mutagenicity of the FlpStop cassette is an interesting question, and one we have explored to some extent. In particular, when testing an older version of FlpStop, we inserted into <i>Rdl<sup>MI02620</sup></i> two different cassettes that were identical, other than the presence of 1 terminator (SV40) or 2 terminators (SV40 and Tub\u03b11). The second cassette was more mutagenic, as assessed using complementation testing and scoring for lethality. Thus, the terminators do contribute to disruption efficiency. However, the comparison between the MiMIC and FlpStop cassettes cannot be used to further address the role of transcriptional terminators. The MiMIC cassette contains the SV40 terminator following the EGFP as well as the terminator signals that follow the <i>yellow</i> marker in the same orientation as the gene trap (i.e. the splice acceptor and stop codons) (Venken et al. 2011). The FlpStop cassette contains an SV40 terminator and a Tub\u03b11 terminator. When the direct comparison can be made between FlpStop disrupting alleles and MiMIC inserts in the disrupting orientation (<i>Rdl</i>, for example) both function as null alleles. As both cassettes contain multiple transcriptional terminators, interpreting their relative disruption efficacy is challenging."

We have rephrased our writing to make this clearer (subsections \u201cFlpStop can produce conditional null alleles\u201d, first paragraph and \u201cThe current FlpStop tool kit\u201d, last paragraph). In fact, an earlier generation of the FlpStop cassette had to be modified to exclude <i>mini-white</i> as it had mutagenic effects independent of the orientation of the SA-STOP. We speculate that this may have been due to the transitional terminator present within the <i>mini-white</i> gene."
