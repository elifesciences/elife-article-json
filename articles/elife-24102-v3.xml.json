EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR1 (EPF1) is a founding member of the secreted peptide ligands enforcing stomatal patterning. Yet, its exact role remains unclear. Here, we report that EPF1 and its primary receptor ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1) target MUTE, a transcription factor specifying the proliferation-to-differentiation switch within the stomatal cell lineages. In turn, MUTE directly induces <i>ERL1.</i> The absolute co-expression of ERL1 and MUTE, with the co-presence of EPF1, triggers autocrine inhibition of stomatal fate. During normal stomatal development, this autocrine inhibition prevents extra symmetric divisions of stomatal precursors likely owing to excessive MUTE activity. Our study reveals the unexpected role of self-inhibition as a mechanism for ensuring proper stomatal development and suggests an intricate signal buffering mechanism underlying plant tissue patterning."

EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR1 (EPF1) is a founding member of the secreted peptide ligands enforcing stomatal patterning. Yet, its exact role remains unclear. Here, we report that EPF1 and its primary receptor ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1) target MUTE, a transcription factor specifying the proliferation-to-differentiation switch within the stomatal cell lineages. In turn, MUTE directly induces <i>ERL1.</i> The absolute co-expression of ERL1 and MUTE, with the co-presence of EPF1, triggers autocrine inhibition of stomatal fate. During normal stomatal development, this autocrine inhibition prevents extra symmetric divisions of stomatal precursors likely owing to excessive MUTE activity. Our study reveals the unexpected role of self-inhibition as a mechanism for ensuring proper stomatal development and suggests an intricate signal buffering mechanism underlying plant tissue patterning."

Development of stomata, turgor-driven cellular valves on the plant epidermis for optimal gas exchange while minimizing water loss, is coordinated by the intricate cell-cell signaling that impinges on the activity of cell-fate determinants (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pillitteri and Dong, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Han and Torii, 2016</a>). Stomatal development in <i>Arabidopsis</i> occurs through stereotypical cell-state transition events: a stomatal initial cell on the protoderm called a meristemoid mother cell (MMC) undergoes an asymmetric entry division to give rise to a meristemoid, a transient amplifying cell of the stomatal lineage. The meristemoid reiterates asymmetric divisions and renews itself, while creating surrounding stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs). Eventually, the meristemoid loses its stem-cell-like property and differentiates into a guard mother cell (GMC). The GMC executes a single round of symmetric division to form paired guard cells (GCs) surrounding a pore, thereby completing stomatal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lau and Bergmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pillitteri and Torii, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Han and Torii, 2016</a>). These cell state transitions are directed by the sequential actions of three basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE, and FAMA, which determine the initiation and proliferation, meristemoid-to-GMC transition, and GMC-to-GC differentiation, respectively. These three bHLH proteins form heterodimers with the broadly expressed sister bHLH proteins SCREAM (SCRM: also known as ICE1) and SCRM2, both of which are absolutely required for the activities of SPCH-MUTE-FAMA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lau and Bergmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pillitteri and Dong, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Han and Torii, 2016</a>)."

                        "text": "The spatial control of stomatal differentiation processes is achieved by a family of secreted cysteine-rich peptides called EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTORS (EPFs) that are perceived by cell-surface receptors with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain: three ERECTA-family receptor kinases and their signal modulator LRR receptor-like protein TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nadeau and Sack, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shpak et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hunt and Gray, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Torii, 2012</a>). These modules are conserved down to basal land plants (<a href=\"#bib6\">Caine et al., 2016</a>). During the initiation of stomatal cell lineages, EPF2 peptide perception by ERECTA activates downstream intracellular signals mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascade, which inhibits the entry divisions of MMC by down-regulating SPCH protein (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lampard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2015</a>). As such, application of bioactive EPF2 peptide confers an epidermis solely composed of pavement cells, phenotypically identical to loss-of-function <i>spch</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Recent studies established that <i>EPF2</i> is a direct transcriptional target of SPCH and SCRM, therefore EPF2, ERECTA\u2022TMM, and SPCH\u2022SCRM modules constitute a negative feedback loop generating evenly distributed spatial patterns of stomatal initial cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Horst et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the decision of whether or not to enter the stomatal cell-lineage is fine-tuned by the competitive binding of EPF2 and its antagonistic peptide, EPF-LIKE9 (EPFL9), also known as Stomagen, to ERECTA (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kondo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sugano et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). Unlike EPF2, the direct binding of Stomagen to ERECTA leads to the inhibition of receptor activation and signal transduction, therefore resulting in excessive stomatal clusters like <i>erecta</i>-family mutants (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "The founding member of EPF/EPFL-family peptides, EPF1, enforces stomatal spacing and its loss-of-function mutation confers stomatal pairing and clustering (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2007</a>). Both genetic and biochemical studies have placed ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1), a sister receptor of ERECTA, as well as TMM as a receptor module acting downstream of EPF1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). However, unlike EPF2, the exact action and function of EPF1 remain unclear. Early models predicted that the signal emanating from a meristemoid is perceived by the receptors in the neighboring cells to regulate stomatal patterning (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nadeau and Sack, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Serna, 2004</a>). However, both <i>EPF1</i> and <i>ERL1</i> promoter activities are the highest in the stomatal precursor cells, most notably in the late meristemoids and GMCs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shpak et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2007</a>). The inconsistency of their expression patterns and predicted functions adds to the conundrum as to how this ligand-receptor system operates. It is also unknown whether EPF1 signaling acts on any of the stomatal bHLH transcription factors. To address these questions, we investigated the in vivo dynamics and regulation of ERL1, the primary receptor of EPF1. We found that ERL1 and MUTE constitute a negative feedback loop, which, with co-expression of EPF1, elicits an autocrine inhibition of stomatal differentiation potential. Our study reveals the unexpected role of self-inhibition as a mechanism for ensuring timely transition of stomatal differentiation and proper stomatal patterning. Given that EPF1 peptide sources are shared by both autocrine and paracrine signaling, the intricate buffering mechanism may underpin proper stomatal patterning."

While this is consistent with the early stomatal-lineage expression of ERL1, it does not explain the rapid boost in accumulation of ERL1 during the meristemoid-to-GMC transition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The transition from meristemoids to GMCs is specified by SPCH\u2019s sister bHLH protein, MUTE (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pillitteri et al., 2007</a>). We thus hypothesized that MUTE is driving the rapid increase of ERL1 in the late meristemoids. To address this, we first examined the MUTE and ERL1 proteins in the stomatal lineage cells using <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines co-expressing <i>MUTE-tagRFP</i> and <i>ERL1-YFP</i> driven by their own respective endogenous promoters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As expected, early stomatal-lineage cells only express ERL1-YFP. However, all late meristemoids co-expressed MUTE-tagRFP in the nuclei and strong ERL1-YFP at the cell periphery (n\u00a0=\u00a0270; 12 seedlings analyzed) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). MUTE-tagRFP was driven by the identical promoter (\u22121989 bp) used to express MUTE-GFP (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pillitteri et al., 2007</a>). Both <i>MUTEpro::MUTE-GFP</i> and <i>MUTEpro::MUTE-tagRFP</i> exhibited transient signals during late meristemoid-to-GMC transition (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and their co-introduction into Arabidopsis seedlings further confirmed their co-expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

The estradiol-inducible <i>MUTE</i> overexpression (<i>iMUTE</i>) line upregulates <i>MUTE</i> transcripts within two hours and remained high throughout the analyzed time course, with the maximum average fold increase of 1536\u00a0\u00b1\u00a079 after 8 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). <i>iMUTE</i> triggered rapid upregulation in <i>ERL1</i> transcripts also within two hours, indicating that <i>ERL1</i> is an early MUTE-induced gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). To unequivocally address whether <i>ERL1</i> is a direct MUTE target, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed. For this purpose, we took advantage of the <i>Arabidopsis scrm-D</i> enabled line that vastly increases the stomatal-lineage cell population thereby enhancing the signals for ChIP assays (<a href=\"#bib17\">Horst et al., 2015</a>). Our previous study has shown that the <i>scrm-D</i>-enabled transcriptomic profiling of meristemoids accurately reflects the meristemoid-specific gene expression during normal epidermal development (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pillitteri et al., 2011</a>), further supporting the use of this genetic background. We introduced functional MUTE-GFP protein driven by its own promoter (<i>MUTEpro::MUTE-GFP</i>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pillitteri et al., 2007</a>), into <i>scrm-D</i> mutant background. A robust binding of MUTE was detected within the <i>ERL1</i> promoter at the region overlapping with the known SPCH binding site (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2014</a>), which contains the predicted bHLH-binding E-box (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B,D</a>). Furthermore, the binding of MUTE-GFP at the <i>ERL1</i> promoter region was also detected in the complemented genetic background, <i>MUTEpro::MUTE-GFP</i> expressed in <i>mute</i>, which exhibits wild-type phenotype (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pillitteri et al., 2007</a>). As predicted, the fold-enrichment of signals were reduced in the absence of <i>scrm-D</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). The data demonstrate the binding of MUTE-GFP during normal epidermal development. Collectively, the results indicate that MUTE induces <i>ERL1</i> expression by directly associating with the <i>ERL1</i> promoter region."

To understand the ultimate target of this EPF1-ERL1 signaling, we examined the effects of excessive EPF1 on transcription factors driving GMC differentiation, MUTE and SCRM. For this purpose, we first made use of our estradiol-induced <i>EPF1</i> overexpression (<i>iEPF1</i>) line that rapidly upregulates <i>EPF1</i> transcript amounts to the maximum fold increase of 407\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046 at 5 hr after estradiol treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

A steep decline in <i>SPCHpro::nucGFP</i> signals were detected within the first five hours in both mock and estradiol treatment for <i>iEPF1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Paradoxically, however, expression of the endogenous EPF1 coincides with MUTE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We thus postulated that expressing ERL1 only in the MUTE<i>-</i>expressing cells may lead to a loss of stomatal fate, in other words, having a secreted peptide, its receptor and target transcription factor only in the same cells will auto-inhibit stomatal differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the functional <i>ERL1-YFP</i> under the control of the <i>MUTE</i> promoter. <i>MUTEpro::ERL1-YFP</i> was introduced into <i>er erl1 erl2</i> triple null mutants in order to ensure that ERL1 will be the only existing receptor pool that will perceive and transduce the signal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). <i>er erl1 erl2</i> cotyledon epidermis develops stomatal clusters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shpak et al., 2005</a>).

The results suggest that the endogenous EPF peptides are required to elicit the inhibition of stomatal differentiation potential.

The Stomagen peptide also associates with ERL1 <i>in planta</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). This prompted us to further test whether the excessive amounts of Stomagen could revert the fate of arrested meristemoids in <i>MUTEpro::ERL1-YFP</i> in <i>er erl1 erl2</i>. As control, mock treated leaf epidermis showed meristemoid arrests (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). By contrast, application of bioactive Stomagen peptide (5 \u03bcM) to <i>MUTEpro::ERL1-YFP er erl1 erl2</i> seedlings conferred clusters of mature stomata (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Therefore, Stomagen counteracts the EPF1-ERL1 autocrine signaling, likely via competing with EPF1 for the ERL1 binding. TMM forms a heteromer with ERL1 and is required for EPF1-ERL1 mediated signaling (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2012</a>).

In all these cases YFP signals are detected in a subset of arrested meristemoids, confirming that the restoration of stomatal differentiation by <i>epf1 epf2</i>, Stomagen application, and <i>tmm</i> mutation is not due to the reduced expression of <i>MUTEpro::ERL1-YFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013I</a>). On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the co-presence of EPF1, ERL1, and MUTE in the late meristemoids elicits autocrine inhibitory signaling, leading to a termination of stomatal fate."

The important question, however, is the role of the EPF1-ERL1 autocrine inhibitory signaling during normal stomatal development. To address this question, a quantitative analysis of MUTE protein accumulation was performed in the presence or absence of TMM, which is required for the EPF1-ERL1 signal transduction. Specifically, we compared the <i>MUTEpro::MUTE-tagRFP</i> signals in the nuclei from the <i>erl1</i> null mutant background fully rescued by <i>ERL1pro::ERL1-YFP</i> (hereafter referred to as \u2018wild-type (WT)\u2018) and those from the <i>erl1 tmm</i> double null mutant background rescued by <i>ERL1pro::ERL1-YFP</i> (referred to as \u2018<i>tmm</i>\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The <i>ERL1pro::ERL1-YFP</i> transgene was introduced into <i>tmm</i> via genetic crosses. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and C</a>, MUTE-tagRFP signal intensity in each nucleus is substantially higher in <i>tmm</i>, with over 2.5-fold higher average total intensity in each nucleus compared to wild type. The result supports the hypothesis that endogenous autocrine EPF1-ERL1 signaling in the meristemoids prevents excessive MUTE protein accumulation. Also, compared to the wild-type epidermis, more cells express MUTE protein in <i>tmm</i>, consistent with the increase in stomatal precursor cells by <i>tmm</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

It is well known that TMM is required for the asymmetric spacing division of a neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nadeau and Sack, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lau and Bergmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Han and Torii, 2016</a>). On the contrary, the role of TMM in suppressing the symmetric division of a meristemoid has been overlooked. Taken together, our data suggest that loss of the autocrine EPF1-ERL1 signaling during normal stomatal development causes accelerated and dysregulated stomatal differentiation, likely as a ramification of excessive MUTE accumulation."

In this study, we discovered an unexpected role for EPF1 and ERL1 in the autocrine regulation of stomatal differentiation potential. The key framework is a negative feedback loop between MUTE and ERL1 whereby MUTE directly upregulates <i>ERL1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and in turn, ERL1 mediates EPF1-peptide signaling leading to inhibition of MUTE activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). <i>ERL1</i> is also induced by SPCH in earlier stomatal-lineage cells, including MMCs, early meristemoids, and SLGCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2014</a>). While <i>EPF1</i> expression is not regulated by MUTE, <i>EPF1</i> turns on during meristemoid-to-GMC transition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

(<b>B</b>) Autocrine signaling model: <a href=\"#bib11\">Facette and Smith (2012)</a> proposed an alternate, autocrine signaling model based on the observations that <i>EPF1</i>, <i>ERL1</i>, and <i>TMM</i> all exhibit the highest expression in the meristemoid (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nadeau and Sack, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shpak et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2007</a>). Here, EPF1 secreted from a meristemoid is perceived by ERL1-TMM on a surface of the same meristemoid. The downstream signaling leads to expression of a yet unidentified peptide (X: orange), which will be perceived by a yet unidentified receptor (Y: brown) on a surface of the neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC). This triggers signal transduction regulating asymmetric spacing division. (<b>C</b>) Model based on the current study: Both <i>ERL1</i> and <i>TMM</i> are expressed in a meristemoid and a stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC), since they are both upregulated by SPCH at an earlier stage\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Horst et al., 2015</a>). During the meristemoid-to-GMC transition, MUTE upregulates <i>ERL1</i> expression and this causes high accumulation of ERL1 in the meristemoid over the stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC). Meanwhile, EPF1 is expressed and secreted from the late meristemoid by an independent mechanism. A perception of EPF1 by the meristemoid-expressed ERL1 and TMM triggers signal transduction leading to downregulation of MUTE, thereby restricting MUTE activity via an autocrine mechanism. The same pool of EPF1 is also perceived by ERL1 and TMM expressed in the neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC), which trigger downstream signal transduction to ensure asymmetric spacing division via a paracrine mechanism. Consequently, receptors in the meristemoids and stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) buffer the pool of EPF1 ligands. Note that our model does not exclude the possibility that yet another unknown signals (like X and Y) operate simultaneously during the stomatal differentiation process."

For example, EPFL9/Stomagen secreted from internal mesophyll tissues is perceived by ERECTA in the protoderm (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). EPFL4 and EPFL6 are inter cell-layer signals between the stem endodermis and phloem to promote inflorescence elongation via ERECTA (<a href=\"#bib51\">Uchida et al., 2012</a>). Recently, we have reported that EPFL2 peptide promotes leaf serration as a ligand for ERECTA-family (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tameshige et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, EPFL2 and its primary receptor, ERL2, exhibit inverse expression patterns: <i>ERL2</i> shows the highest expression at the leaf teeth tips where <i>EPFL2</i> expression is excluded.

Based on this phenotype, a paracrine model was proposed initially, whereby a signal (EPF1) emanating from the meristemoids/GMCs will be perceived by receptors (ERL1 and TMM) in the neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) to orient asymmetric spacing division (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, based on the high expression of EPF1, ERL1, and TMM in the meristemoids/GMCs, an alternative autocrine model has been described (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Facette and Smith, 2012</a>). Here, EPF1 peptide is perceived by ERL1/TMM in the meristemoids/GMCs. A subsequent downstream signal transduction promotes the expression of a yet unidentified ligand X, which will be secreted and perceived by a yet unidentified receptor Y on the surface of neighboring stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs). This eventually leads to the oriented asymmetric spacing division (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Facette and Smith, 2012</a>). Our findings revise these models and propose a buffered system, whereby the pool of EPF1 is shared by both the meristemoid and its neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). ERL1 and TMM also accumulates at the plasma membrane of stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs), albeit in lesser amounts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nadeau and Sack, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Horst et al., 2015</a>). ERL1 in the stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) most likely perceives the EPF1 peptides emitted from neighboring meristemoids, and this EPF1-ERL1 paracrine signaling orients the asymmetric spacing divisions. Based on this model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), the paracrine action of EPF1 also limits the inhibitory activity of EPF1-ERL1 autocrine signals in the meristemoids, since ERL1 in the meristemoids and in neighboring stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) both share the same source of EPF1 signals."

Indeed, <i>MUTEpro::ERL1-YFP</i> does not confer any discernable phenotype if the wild-type copies of the three <i>ERECTA-</i>family genes are present (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is therefore most likely that, in addition to ERL1, ERECTA and ERL2 receptor population expressed in stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) buffer excessive EPF1 peptide ligands to ensure the proper and adequate level of MUTE inhibition. The idea of signal buffering by sister ERECTA-family receptors is supported by their known partial redundancy with complex genetic interactions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shpak et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2005</a>). Moreover, EPFL4/6 (CHAL/CLL1), which normally act as ligands for ERECTA-mediated inflorescence elongation, interfere with this buffering mechanism and confer stomatal clustering in the stems\u00a0the absence of TMM (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrash and Bergmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abrash et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Uchida et al., 2012</a>). Very recently, a VST-family of membrane-associated proteins was reported as a modulator of ERECTA-family signaling, via specifically interacting with ERL2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ho et al., 2016</a>).

EPF2, but not its main receptor ERECTA, is the direct SPCH target (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lau et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Horst et al., 2015</a>). Conversely, ERL1, but not its main ligand EPF1, is the direct MUTE target (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The biochemical mechanism of MUTE downregulation is unknown, but lines of evidence suggest the involvement of a MAP kinase cascade. First, YODA, MKK4/5, and MPK3/6 are genetically acting downstream of the three ERECTA-family RKs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lampard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bemis et al., 2013</a>). Second, the expression of constitutively-active MKK4/5 by the <i>MUTE</i> promoter led to arrested meristemoids (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lampard et al., 2009</a>), thus phenocopying EPF1 peptide application or overexpression (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Unlike SPCH, however, MUTE does not possess a predicted MAP kinase target domain (<a href=\"#bib8\">Davies and Bergmann, 2014</a>), raising a question of whether MUTE is a MPK3/6 substrate. In any event, functional specialization and re-wiring of regulatory circuits among the paralogs of EPF peptides, ERECTA-family receptor kinases, and stomatal bHLH transcription factors highlight the evolutionary mechanism underlying the sequential steps of stomatal differentiation steps."

Recent studies have revealed that polarized BASL in the stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) enhances the MAP kinase activity, resulting in lowered SPCH abundance (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2016</a>). In the absence of <i>EPF1</i>, GFP-BASL occasionally exhibits improper polar localization to the 'wrong' site within a periphery of the stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs), which predicts the mis-oriented site of asymmetric spacing division (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2009</a>). It would be an interesting future question to address how the\u00a0EPF1-ERL1 signaling pathway influences the location of BASL polarization and stomatal-lineage cell polarity."

                        "text": "It has become evident that plants make use of a myriad of peptide signals to regulate diverse developmental processes. Accumulating evidence suggest that plant peptide signals mediate both local cell-cell communications and long-distance root-to-shoot signaling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brand et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Searle et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hirakawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Okamoto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tabata et al., 2014</a>). In most cases, however, the exact source and recipient cells of signals remains unclear. Previously studies have identified ligand-receptor systems that share the same expression domains. For instance, the tomato cysteine-rich secreted protein LAT52 and its receptor LRR-RK, LePRK2, are both expressed in pollen (<a href=\"#bib31\">Muschietti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tang et al., 2002</a>). It was speculated that pollen may monitor its germination state via LAT52-LePRKs autocrine signaling (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tang et al., 2002</a>). Another example is CLE45-BAM3, a small secreted peptide ligand-LRR-RK pair: both CLE45 and BAM3 are expressed in protophloem tissue in roots, and their signal transduction leads to the inhibition of protophloem differentiation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Depuydt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rodriguez-Villalon et al., 2014</a>). It is not yet known whether these ligand-receptor signaling systems constitute feedback regulation with target transcription factors. In any event, the autocrine signaling may be a prevalent mode of peptide-receptor kinase signaling in plants. Here, focusing on stomatal development, where the differentiation potential of bipotent precursor cells can be monitored at a single cell resolution, one can decipher the contribution of autocrine peptide signaling and the buffering of autocrine vs. paracrine signals between two sister cells with different developmental fate. In animals, both paracrine and autocrine peptide signaling contributes to stem cell proliferation. For instance, Wnt, a key secreted cell-cell signal during animal development (<a href=\"#bib29\">Logan and Nusse, 2004</a>), participates in the autocrine regulation of epidermal stem cell renewal in mice (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lim et al., 2013</a>). A versatile use of peptide ligands for the maintenance and differentiation of adult stem cells may highlight yet another theme in the logic of development in multicellular organisms."

The authors present data supporting a negative feedback loop between ERL1 and MUTE. MUTE upregulates ERL1 expression and ERL1-mediated EPF1 signaling inhibits MUTE to specify the meristemoid-to-GMC transition switch. They further show that loss of EPF1-ERL1 signaling results in MUTE accumulation and stomatal development defects. The authors used an elegant combination of quantitative microscopy and genetic experiments to support this model. The work is novel, provides a function for EPF1 and is of interest to plant (and other) communities. Nonetheless, some aspects of the work are oversold. The authors need to improve the manuscript before publication in the following aspects:"
