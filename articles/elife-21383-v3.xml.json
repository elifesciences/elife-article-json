Unlike actomyosin in sarcomeres, which cycles through contraction and relaxation, the cytokinetic ring disassembles during contraction through an unknown mechanism. Here we find in <i>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</i> and <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> that, during actomyosin ring contraction, actin filaments associated with actomyosin rings are expelled as micron-scale bundles containing multiple actomyosin ring proteins. Using functional isolated actomyosin rings we show that expulsion of actin bundles does not require continuous presence of cytoplasm. Strikingly, mechanical compression of actomyosin rings results in expulsion of bundles predominantly at regions of high curvature. Our work unprecedentedly reveals that the increased curvature of the ring itself promotes its disassembly. It is likely that such a curvature-induced mechanism may operate in disassembly of other contractile networks."

Unlike actomyosin in sarcomeres, which cycles through contraction and relaxation, the cytokinetic ring disassembles during contraction through an unknown mechanism. Here we find in <i>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</i> and <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> that, during actomyosin ring contraction, actin filaments associated with actomyosin rings are expelled as micron-scale bundles containing multiple actomyosin ring proteins. Using functional isolated actomyosin rings we show that expulsion of actin bundles does not require continuous presence of cytoplasm. Strikingly, mechanical compression of actomyosin rings results in expulsion of bundles predominantly at regions of high curvature. Our work unprecedentedly reveals that the increased curvature of the ring itself promotes its disassembly. It is likely that such a curvature-induced mechanism may operate in disassembly of other contractile networks."

During ring contraction, ring components continuously disassemble while maintaining ring contractility (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pollard and Wu, 2010</a>). This is in stark contrast to other actomyosin machineries, particularly the thick and thin filament based sarcomeres in muscle fibers, which undergo contraction and relaxation cycles without disassembly (<a href=\"#bib14\">Murrell et al., 2015</a>). ADF1/Cofilin together with Coronin and WD-repeat protein Aip1 modulate actin turnover by severing actin bundles in many types of actin networks (<a href=\"#bib9\">Jansen et al., 2015</a>). However, their involvement in actomyosin ring contraction and disassembly is still unclear (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen and Pollard, 2011</a>). The F-actin based molecular motor Myosin II may also regulate disassembly of actin networks during cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Guha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</a>), presumably by myosin II mediated actin filaments buckling and breakage (<a href=\"#bib15\">Murrell and Gardel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Reymann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Vogel et al., 2013</a>).

We imaged actin rings in the axial plane to achieve higher resolution by preparing spheroplasts, in which actomyosin rings were oriented randomly and slid along the cell membrane during contraction, consistent with previous work in <i>S. pombe</i> and in reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Mishra et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Miyazaki et al., 2015</a>). In spheroplasts where the actomyosin ring was positioned close to the imaging plane, actin filaments appeared to project outwards from the contracting ring (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Permeabilized spheroplasts retained substantial numbers of actin filaments that remained attached to the ring, indicating that the actin filaments were connected to the contracting ring (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To ensure that the observed actin filaments were not an artifact of LifeAct-GFP used in these experiments, we fixed and stained wild type cells (that did not express any fusion protein) and wild type cells expressing LifeAct-GFP with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also fixed and stained permeabilized spheroplasts generated from these two strains with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. In both cases, we were able to detect actin filaments connected to the contracting actomyosin ring (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), ruling out the possibility that the observed filaments were an artifact of the tag used. When fixed cells expressing Rlc1p-GFP were stained with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, actin filaments attached to the ring colocalized with Rlc1p, suggesting that Rlc1p-GFP (and by extension Myosin II) was also part of the actin filaments attached to contracting rings (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, actin filaments linked to the contracting actomyosin ring were detected in <i>S. pombe</i> cells and permeabilized spheroplasts of wild type cells (with no genetic tag) and of wild type cells expressing LifeAct-GFP or Rlc1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), establishing that this phenomenon is not unique to <i>S. japonicus</i> cells and spheroplasts. Actin and myosin II filaments attached to contracting actomyosin rings have been observed by Wollrab and colleagues in <i>S. pombe</i> cells, although the significance of these structures was not investigated in their work (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wollrab et al., 2016</a>). In the rest of the manuscript, unless specifically indicated, experiments were performed in <i>S. japonicus</i>."

Occasionally, upon the expulsion of actin bundles, the contracting ring seemed to disintegrate at the region of release (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Similar observations of actin bundles being expelled from contracting rings were also made in <i>S. pombe</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Actin bundles were also expelled during contraction in <i>S. japonicus</i> intact cells expressing LifeAct-GFP in which the GFP intensity was reduced and actin appeared disorganized near the end of cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F and G</a>).

To investigate this, we established a <i>S. japonicus</i> cell ghost system (depleted of cytosol) which contained contractile actomyosin rings, as previously described in <i>S.\u00a0pombe</i> and\u00a0<i>S.\u00a0cerevisiae</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Mishra et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Young et al., 2010</a>). Treating <i>S. japonicus</i> cell ghosts with ATP induced contraction of isolated actomyosin rings (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, the actin bundles remained associated with the contracting and fully contracted rings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>) although the F-actin signal as visualized with LifeAct-GFP was lesser than in cells and spheroplasts. To quantitate aspects of actin bundle expulsion in cell ghosts, we fixed and stained contracting and contracted actomyosin rings with CF633-phalloidin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The ring-associated bundles appearing in cell ghosts after ATP addition were similar to those observed during in vivo ring contraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We observed 4.3 \u00b1 1.4 bundles associated with the rings in cell ghosts, with individual average length of 3.9 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; total bundle length 16.1 \u00b1 6.7 \u00b5m). The sum F-actin intensity of cell ghosts (ring actin + bundle actin) following ATP addition showed no significant changes, whereas there was a decrease of actin intensity in the rings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We estimated protein levels of actin and the actin filament binding protein tropomyosin Cdc8p in the supernatant and pellet fractions following centrifugation of contracting actomyosin rings in cell ghosts (treated with ATP for 20 or 40 min). We did not find a significant increase in the amount of actin and Cdc8p in the supernatant in cell ghosts treated with ATP for 20 or 40 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), consistent with the idea that ring contraction resulted in denser actin filaments containing binding proteins such as tropomyosin that remain in the pellet fraction. These results indicated that in cell ghosts treated with ATP for 20 to 40\u2009min, the rings reduced in actin amounts. However, this did not lead to an increase in soluble G-actin during ring contraction, suggesting that most actin was expelled in filaments contained in bundles during this period of time. Furthermore, these experiments established that the\u00a0expulsion of actin bundles was a result of ring contraction and was independent of continuous presence of cytosol. Finally, the absence of cytosolic components such as G-actin also suggests that the actomyosin bundles are expelled as a result of contraction rather than the possibility that these bundles were newly polymerized actin cables that were not incorporated into the highly curved actomyosin ring (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

We had previously noted that actomyosin bundles were expelled at later stages of contraction. As the actomyosin bundles were expelled from contracting rings of smaller diameters, which have higher curvatures, we speculated that the local curvature of rings might induce bundle expulsion. In spheroplasts expressing Rlc1p-GFP, the expelled bundles became visible and their numbers increased with the\u00a0progression of time and increasing the\u00a0curvature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Although rings started with curvatures (1/radius) of even smaller than 0.4 \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup> (translates to a ring diameter of &gt;5 \u00b5m in spheroplasts), the mean curvature at which bundles began to be expelled was 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup> (translates to a ring diameter of ~2 \u00b5m) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Given that bundle expulsion was only observed after a significant reduction in ring diameter, suggesting that bundle expulsion in rings is promoted by increased curvature. Furthermore, even in partially contracted and curved actomyosin rings in ATP treated cell ghosts, the majority (~68%) of ring-associated bundles were detected at regions of increased local curvature where the ring appeared to be bent (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Strikingly, about 95% of the actomyosin bundles were expelled from the curved regions of compressed rings compared to flat regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>; average 5.2 \u00b1 0.9 bundles per ring), and the local curvature at the sites of expelled bundles was 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; mean curvature of compressed rings was 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup>). Whereas actomyosin bundles were expelled when uncompressed rings contracted to a perimeter of 6.3 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), majority of compressed rings started releasing actomyosin bundles when contracted to a perimeter of only 12.5 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b5m, indicating that the curvature change induced expulsion of actomyosin bundles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Curiously, following compression, the ring contraction rate (\u25b3perimeters/time) was 0.37 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5m/min, which was significantly less than the 1.26 \u00b1 0.57 \u00b5m/min observed in uncompressed spheroplasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The bundles were expelled at a reduced rate of 1.18 \u00b1 0.42 \u00b5m/min as compared to 2.19 \u00b1 0.61 \u00b5m/min in uncompressed spheroplasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Furthermore, shortening of the flat regions (\u25b3<i>d</i>) of compressed rings occurred faster than the decrease of ring heights (\u25b3<i>h</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>; \u25b3<i>d/</i>min= 0.16 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5m/min vs. \u25b3<i>h/</i>min = 0.07 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5m/min). Thus, the actomyosin bundles were constrained by the local curvature of contracting rings, and their expulsion depends on the curvature changes during ring contraction. Our results showed that ring disassembly is coupled physically to ring contraction in a ring-geometry coordinated manner."

It is presently unclear if other mechanisms, such as cofilin and myosin II mediated filament severing / breakage and loss of actin monomers also contribute to actin disassembly during cytokinesis. New probes exhibiting reduced photobleaching and directly reporting actin cytoskeleton dynamics will be required to help estimate if other mechanisms are in operation as well. The coupling of bundle expulsion mediated-ring disassembly to ring contraction appears intrinsic to the ring itself, and is potentially driven by a physical mechanism that is independent of cytosolic factors. It is possible that the affinity of binding of unidentified actin binding proteins with F-actin is reduced upon increased curvature of actin filaments. Thus, actomyosin bundles may not be able to bend sufficiently to accommodate the high ring curvature at later times in contraction, leading to their expulsion from the ring. It is likely that attainment of a curved morphology is an energetically unfavorable conformation since actin filaments have a persistence length of ~10 microns (which can increase further with bundling) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ott et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Riveline et al., 1997</a>)."

It is possible that other ring proteins do not associate tightly to actin bundles during ring contraction in a less crowded environment (such as permeabilized cell ghosts), whereas they are able to associate with expelled bundles in a cellular environment of increased molecular crowding. Alternatively, it is possible that, in the presence of cytosol, as in a cellular context (<a href=\"#bib20\">Pelham and Chang, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Wong et al., 2002</a>), loss of ring proteins from actin bundles in the ring is balanced by replenishment from the cytosolic pool. However, in cell ghosts, such replenishment of ring proteins does not occur due to the absence of cytosol. Future work should investigate these possibilities."

Briefly, raw Z stacks containing the actomyosin ring were de-noised with non-local means filter using a plugin installed in Fiji (plugin source: <a href=\"http://imagej.net/Non_Local_Means_Denoise\">http://imagej.net/Non_Local_Means_Denoise</a>). To facilitate shape measurement, the 3D stack was converted to 2D maximum intensity projection along the normal to the ring plane (Fiji/Image/Stacks/3D_project) in each time point. As the\u00a0ring plane was often tilted to the X-Y plane, the projection angle was determined manually for each ring prior to the projection. The shape of the ring at each time point was extracted from 2D projections using segmentation via auto-thresholding by Otsu (Fiji/Image/Adjust/Thresholding) and subsequent skeletonization of the resulting mask (Fiji/Process/Binary/Skeletonize). The centres of skeleton pixels were defined as skeleton points."

Next, a circle with radius R was fitted to these three points. The local curvature at the POI was then derived as the inverse of the radius of that circle (1/radius). For representation in figures, the curvature was smoothened over 10 skeleton points."

Indeed, en face views with a similar/identical label (Rlc1) does not appear to show this expulsion behavior (PMID 25355954). In addition, some, but not all the experiments in this paper have been performed with LifeAct which can induce filament bundling. To ensure that this phenomenon is general and robust and intrinsic to the contractile ring, it would be important to visualize evidence of this behavior in intact cells. It would be best to fix LifeAct-GFP, Rlc1-GFP, and unlabeled cells of both <i>S. pombe</i> and <i>S. japonicus</i> and stain them with phalloidin. It would be critical to detect these extruded filaments in cells that do not express a fluorescent protein (performing the experiment with the FP will allow the authors to assess that these bundles can be preserved and labeled)."

A more poorly understood aspect of ring ingression is that, as its diameter decreases, ring components are likely eliminated to allow continued contraction. In this manuscript, Huang et al. propose that actin and myosin containing filaments can be continuously expulsed from the contractile ring contributing to the completion of cytokinesis in two yeast species. Since the authors only observe such filaments in late stages of cytokinesis they suggest that this represents a separate phase during cytokinesis where filament expulsion promotes ring closure. Furthermore, the authors claim that this expulsion phenomenon is dependent on changes in cell curvature and is driven by mechanical forces generated by high curvature independent of cytoplasmic regulators or polymerization driven elongation of these filaments."

Along the same line, the authors observe bi-directional movement of myosin in expulsed bundles. Is this behavior observed in the ring?

The really interesting observation in my opinion is the relationship between ring perimeter and bundle length. There appears to be a pretty good correlation in phase 2, suggesting that expulsion is a compensatory mechanism for reduction in ring size. However, the quantification of this in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> is confusing and contradictory. What are the units in the graphs? It appears that total length of bundles is larger than ring perimeter (max value 58 vs. 28) but T.I. + perimeter is smaller than perimeter alone? In addition, biphasic behavior of ring intensity (constant in phase 1, decreasing in phase 2), would further substantiate this biphasic concept."

All one can conclude from this is that neither of those proteins is essential for formation of these bundles. What about the kinetics, number of bundle, length or dynamics?

There are three implications from this finding. First, it suggests that at early stages, \"classical\" disassembly is probably responsible for the loss of actin and ABPs. Second, unless ~1/3 of the actin is lost by extrusion during these early stages, the value of 68% of total ring lost by extrusion seems quite high (the solution to this appears to be that this value is calculated from rings that have already constricted significantly \u2013 a 3.5 \u00b5m diameter ring is not a typical early ring, other data in the manuscript indicates that an early ring is ~ 8 \u00b5m in diameter). Thus, this calculation appears somewhat misleading. Third, the manuscript should discuss how these two processes likely work together during ring constriction."

Indeed, en face views with a similar/identical label (Rlc1) does not appear to show this expulsion behavior (PMID 25355954). In addition, some, but not all the experiments in this paper have been performed with LifeAct which can induce filament bundling. To ensure that this phenomenon is general and robust and intrinsic to the contractile ring, it would be important to visualize evidence of this behavior in intact cells. It would be best to fix LifeAct-GFP, Rlc1-GFP, and unlabeled cells of both S. pombe and S. japonicus and stain them with phalloidin.

The poor z-resolution affects the accuracy of curvature analysis. We took precaution not to over-estimate the number, thus, the 68% is a conservative value of this quantification."

There are three implications from this finding. First, it suggests that at early stages, \"classical\" disassembly is probably responsible for the loss of actin and ABPs. Second, unless ~1/3 of the actin is lost by extrusion during these early stages, the value of 68% of total ring lost by extrusion seems quite high (the solution to this appears to be that this value is calculated from rings that have already constricted significantly \u2013 a 3.5 \u00b5m diameter ring is not a typical early ring, other data in the manuscript indicates that an early ring is ~ 8 \u00b5m in diameter). Thus, this calculation appears somewhat misleading. Third, the manuscript should discuss how these two processes likely work together during ring constriction.</i>"

We chose early rings as those with a diameter of ~ 3.5 \u00b5m since in other experiments in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, we only observed bundles when rings reached a diameter of ~ 2.5 \u00b5m. Since the goal of the experiment suggested by reviewer 1 was to estimate the fraction of the ring-associated actin lost through bundle expulsion, an initial diameter of ~ 3.5 \u00b5m seemed like a good starting point. We therefore do not believe the reported calculations are misleading. As to the issue of whether actin is also lost through other \u201cclassical\u201d disassembly pathways, this is an interesting and open question. Further analysis, using better probes for the actin cytoskeleton will be required to fully address this possibility."
