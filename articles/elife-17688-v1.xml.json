In perception, the mechanism explains the effect of stimulus strength, characterized by signal-to-noise ratio, on decision speed, accuracy and confidence. It also makes intriguing predictions about the noise itself. An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy and, paradoxically, higher confidence. To test these predictions, we introduce a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex, which we verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. For both humans and monkeys, increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model."

In perception, the mechanism explains the effect of stimulus strength, characterized by signal-to-noise ratio, on decision speed, accuracy and confidence. It also makes intriguing predictions about the noise itself. An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy and, paradoxically, higher confidence. To test these predictions, we introduce a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex, which we verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. For both humans and monkeys, increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model."

These decisions are not hard wired or reflexive, yet they are experimentally tractable. Psychologists have long sought to understand how the process of decision formation gives rise to three key observables (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cartwright and Festinger, 1943</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Audley, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vickers, 1979</a>). First there is the choice itself (left or right, coffee or tea), which determines accuracy in cases where a correct alternative can be defined. Second, there is the time it takes to reach a decision, which determines reaction-time (RT). RT furnishes a powerful constraint on models of decision-making, and is a defining element of the trade-off between speed and accuracy that characterizes most decisions. Third, decisions are often accompanied by a graded degree of belief in the accuracy or appropriateness of the choice. This belief, referred to as decision confidence, influences many aspects of behavior: how we learn from our mistakes, plan subsequent decisions, and communicate our decisions to others. A model of the decision process ought to explain not just choices but all three of these observables in a quantitative fashion."

These models depict the decision process as a race between competing accumulators, each of which integrates momentary evidence for one alternative and against the others. The decision terminates when the accumulated evidence for one alternative, termed a decision variable (DV), reaches a threshold or bound, thereby determining both the choice and the decision time. Confidence in the decision derives from a mapping between the DV and the probability that a decision based on this DV will be correct. The mapping is thought to incorporate the decision time or the state of the competing (losing) accumulator(s), or both (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vickers, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zylberberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Van den Berg et al., 2016</a>). The noisiness of the momentary evidence causes the DV to wander from its starting point, as in Brownian motion or diffusion, whereas the expectation (i.e., mean) of the momentary evidence increments or decrements the DV deterministically. Noise is the main determinant of both RT and confidence when signal-to-noise is low, that is when choices are more stochastic (less accurate). Recent evidence from neurophysiology (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>), brain stimulation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fetsch et al., 2014</a>), and psychophysics (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>) supports such a mechanism."

The basic insight behind the latter two predictions is that with greater volatility, the DV tends to diffuse more quickly away from the starting point to achieve levels nearer the termination bound which are ordinarily associated with stronger evidence and thus greater confidence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Because the volatility of the stimulus is not explicitly represented in this map, higher volatility would lead to greater confidence, because the decision variable diffuses more quickly from the starting point, leading paradoxically to states that are normally associated with more reliable sources."

On each video frame, a dot that had appeared \u2206t ms ago is either displaced (i.e., moved) or replaced by a new dot at a random location within the stimulus aperture. The determination of displacement versus replacement is in accordance with a flip of a biased coin, and the magnitude of this bias confers the motion strength, which we refer to as a motion coherence (<i>c</i>). The sign of <i>c</i> indicates the direction of the displacement along an axis (e.g., up/down). Thus the probability of displacement (or unfairness of the coin) is |c|. The randomly replaced dots fall in the neighborhood of other dots (recently displayed) and thus contribute random motion in both directions. In the standard RDM, the coherence, <i>c</i>, is fixed for the duration of an experimental trial (e.g., <i>c\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.13; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left, blue line).

We therefore measured the impact of volatility on the response of direction selective neurons in cortical areas MT/MST (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These neurons represent the momentary evidence used by monkeys to guide their choice, reaction time and confidence (<a href=\"#bib54\">Salzman et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Celebrini and Newsome, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ditterich et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fetsch et al., 2014</a>) in motion discrimination tasks. As previously shown (<a href=\"#bib6\">Britten et al., 1993</a>), the firing rate of MT neurons increases linearly, on average, as a function of motion strength in the neuron\u2019s preferred direction (<i>c\u00a0</i>&gt;\u00a00, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, upper panel, blue trace). The firing rate decreases linearly, but less steeply, as a function of motion strength in the anti-preferred direction (<i>c\u00a0&lt;\u00a0</i>0), giving rise to a bilinear function. We refer to the shallower slope for <i>c\u00a0</i>&lt;\u00a00 as rectification (<a href=\"#bib6\">Britten et al., 1993</a>). These features are preserved under high volatility (red trace), but there is a subtle increase in firing rate at the low coherences, which is explained by the rectification of neural responses when the distribution of <i>c</i> spans positive and negative values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, inset). The variance of the neural response is known to scale approximately linearly with firing rate (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tolhurst et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vogels et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Geisler and Albrecht, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>). Thus the variance curves in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> (lower panel) parallel the means.

These considerations also help to reconcile the contrast between the striking effects of volatility on RT versus subtle effects on choice accuracy: the volatility manipulation mainly affects the weakest motion strengths where accuracy is already poor (but see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The important point is that by increasing noise, the volatility manipulation accelerates the dispersion of the decision variable away from its expected value and nearer the termination bounds, hence faster RT. A similar idea guides intuitions about the effect of volatility on confidence in a decision."

In the framework of bounded evidence accumulation, it can be formalized as the conditional probability of a correct choice given the state of the DV, which comprises the accumulated evidence and elapsed decision time (<a href=\"#equ5\">Equation 5</a>). For the motion discrimination task, this can be calculated by considering, for each possible state of the DV, the likelihood that it was the result of motion strength of the appropriate sign. We refer to this as a mapping between DV and probability correct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). It depends on the set of possible motion strengths (the prior distribution of <i>c</i>), the two possible volatility conditions, and the amount of time that has elapsed in the trial. We assume the subject has implicit knowledge of this mapping, and does not adjust it when a low or high volatility stimulus is shown. The latter seems justified because volatility levels were randomly interleaved and not cued or even mentioned to the subjects (we evaluate this assumption, below, in several alternative models)."

To test this prediction, we used two variants of the motion task, tailored to the abilities of monkeys and humans."

On half of the trials, the monkey had the opportunity to opt out of reporting the direction choice and to select instead a smaller but certain reward. The 'sure bet' option was not revealed until at least one-half second after motion offset (i.e., during the delay). The task design thus encouraged the monkey to perform the direction discrimination on every trial. After extensive experience with the standard RDM (&gt;100,000 trials; low volatility condition), we introduced the high volatility RDM on a random half of the trials.

In the model, choice, RT and confidence result from the accumulation of noisy momentary evidence as a function of time, until the integral of the evidence (the decision variable, DV) reaches one of two bounds, or for the PDW and confidence tasks, until the stimulus is curtailed. In the latter case, the sign of the DV determines the choice."

In the language of drift-diffusion, the former gives rise to deterministic drift and the latter to a Wiener process scaled by a diffusion coefficient. The noise is itself comprised of stochastic contributions from the stimulus and its neural representation. Many studies make the simplifying assumption that the variance of the momentary evidence is fixed and independent of motion strength (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ditterich et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Palmer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shadlen et al., 2006</a>). This would be the case if the momentary evidence obeyed the idealization in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and if the neural responses of rightward and leftward preferring neurons exhibited variance that scaled linearly with mean. Then the difference between population responses would have the same variance for all motion strengths. However, the partial rectification (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) implies that the variance of the difference should increase as a function of motion strength."

We capture these observations with a simple parameterization of the diffusion coefficient (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equations 2 and 3</a>). First, we assumed that in the low volatility condition, the variance of the momentary evidence increases linearly with motion strength (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, blue trace; note the log scale of the abscissa).

Thus, we assume that subjects do not infer the noisiness of incoming evidence, or that if they do, they do not revise the mapping accordingly. An alternative is that the brain infers an estimate of the noisiness of the stimulus, in real time, to adjust the parameters of the decision process (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deneve, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Qamar et al., 2013</a>) or the evaluation of confidence (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yeung and Summerfield, 2012</a>).

Positive residuals therefore indicate an excess of activity in the chosen direction. For both low and high volatility conditions, trial-to-trial variation in the neural response was reflected in the monkey\u2019s choices. The fluctuations were more informative in the high volatility condition, presumably because they were induced by exaggerated variance in the motion display itself (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Notably, the time course of choice-related signals evolved with similar latencies in the low and high volatility conditions. The latencies were comparable to that of the direction selective signal itself (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that the choice was informed by the earliest motion information available in the stimulus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>). The influence of neural variation declines over 200 ms, consistent with the idea that the brain terminates some decisions before the end of the stimulus presentation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>)."

Monkeys should opt out of the direction decision when the evidence is weak, and waive the sure bet when the evidence is strong. For positive coherences (i.e., net motion in the preferred direction), the residuals of firing rate were on average negative (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, magenta trace). This implies that the monkey tended to opt out of the direction decision when the neural representation of the evidence was weaker than average. For negative coherences (net motion in the non-preferred direction), the residuals were positive on average (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, blue trace), for an analogous reason. The difference between the two traces furnishes an estimate of the time course over which MT/MST neurons inform the decision to opt out. Notice the similarity in the time course of the choice and confidence signals (compare <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and C</a>). The latency estimate derived from <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> was unreliable (arrow and horizontal error bar, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), but it was corroborated by a complementary analysis of the trials in which the monkey waived the sure bet (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Here we compared the average firing rate residuals on trials when the monkey waived the sure-bet option (green trace) with those on trials when the sure bet was not available (orange trace). We expect these traces to differ if the monkey waves the sure bet on trials when the neural responses are stronger. The point of divergence of the two traces in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> furnishes a more reliable estimate of the latency with which confidence signals are represented in the neuronal response (arrow). These results indicate that early motion evidence simultaneously informs both choice and confidence (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zylberberg et al., 2012</a>). They are inconsistent with the proposal that choice and confidence are resolved in strict succession, as these predict that confidence selectivity ought to emerge later than choice-related signals (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pleskac and Busemeyer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Navajas et al., 2016</a>)."

Testing the influence of volatility on the decision process is difficult, because it requires independent control over the signal and the noise in the evidence. We mimicked a manipulation of noise by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus. Our approach differs from recent studies that have attempted to vary evidence reliability through stimulus manipulations (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Gardelle and Summerfield, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zylberberg et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">de Gardelle and Mamassian, 2015</a>) in that we (<i>i</i>) applied the manipulation to a well studied motion task for which much is known about the underlying physiology; (<i>ii</i>) verified the effect of the manipulation by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of the macaque, and (<i>iii</i>) showed how a framework based on the bounded accumulation of evidence can account for the joint effect of volatility on choice, reaction time and confidence."

The intuition is that increased volatility disperses the decision variable away from its expectation. For low coherences, it accelerates departure from the starting point (i.e., neutral evidence) and closer to one of the decision bounds. This tendency to arrive at larger absolute values of accumulated evidence\u2014in support of either choice\u2014leads to faster and more confident decisions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zylberberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Maniscalco et al., 2016</a>).

On all trials, we assumed subjects applied the same termination policy (i.e., decision bound) and the same mapping between the state of the evidence and confidence, for both volatility conditions as well as for all motion strengths (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gorea and Sagi, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</a>). We considered and rejected alternative models in which the brain uses volatility to adjust the mapping and/or the decision bound. In particular, if different mappings between DV and confidence were used for the low and high volatility conditions, a larger excursion of the DV would be required in the high volatility condition to reach the same level of confidence, predicting a pattern of post-decision wagering behavior that was not supported by our data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In the RT task, volatility could be used to adjust the height of the decision bound in the face of lower reliability in order to maximize reward rate (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deneve, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Drugowitsch et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, the normative solution for a simplified version of the RT task is to increase the bound height on high volatility trials, which nevertheless leads to slightly faster responses than for low volatility trials when the motion is weak (<a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 1</a>). However, this idea presupposes knowledge of reliability on the trials, which ought to predict lower confidence in the high volatility condition. Thus, models that posit an online estimation of reliability [cf., <a href=\"#bib15\">Deneve (2012)</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yeung and Summerfield (2012)</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Qamar et al.

For instance, had we used only a very difficult and a very easy condition, there would be a stronger incentive to ascertain the difficulty of the decision online and use different termination criteria for each condition. However, our experiment\u2014in particular, the mixture of interleaved motion strengths and the volatility manipulation\u2014is representative of a broad class of decisions for which the reliability of the evidence is unknown to the decision-maker before beginning deliberation and not readily apparent from a small number of samples. In such circumstances, an estimate of reliability might be viewed as another decision, which would entail (i) specification of alternative hypotheses about reliability, (ii) defining which stimulus features constitute evidence bearing on these hypotheses, (iii) accumulating the relevant evidence, and (iv) specifying a termination criterion for this decision. Such an evaluation must balance the benefits derived from the use of reliability to adjust the parameters of the decision process trial by trial, with the associated cost in time and effort."

Instead, subjects behaved as if they assumed a common distribution of signals encompassing all stimulus conditions and applied a single decision criterion. Our volatility manipulation was more subtle than an explicit cue, but we do not doubt that our subjects could perform above chance in a 2AFC experiment if they were trained to identify the higher volatility stimulus among a pair sharing the same motion strength. If nothing else, they could monitor their own decision times and confidence. However, when a mixture of different levels of volatility are presented in a sequence of otherwise similar events (trials), subjects appear to combine trials of low and high volatility to form a single internal distribution with signed coherence as the only relevant dimension."

Our study may therefore be of interest to psychologists and behavioral economists (<a href=\"#bib11\">d' Acremont and Bossaerts, 2016</a>). Systems with multiple interacting units, like financial markets, sometimes give rise to 'leptokurtic' distributions, referred to as those where the probability of extreme events is larger than expected from normal distributions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mandelbrot, 1997</a>). A simple way of constructing leptokurtic distributions is by mixing Gaussian distributions that have the same mean but different variances, similar to our doubly stochastic (high volatility) stimulus. When interpreting \u2018leptokurtic\u2019 noise, people appear to overreact to outliers. For instance, when making stock investment decisions, people often misinterpret large fluctuations as evidence for a fundamental change in expected value (<a href=\"#bib12\">De Bondt and Thaler, 1990</a>). Similarly, our subjects interpreted the 'outliers' introduced by our doubly stochastic procedure (motion bursts of unlikely strength given the average motion strength of the trial) as if they were caused by a higher coherence stimulus. In this sense, they behaved as if the noisy samples they acquired were generated by a mesokurtic distribution (e.g., Gaussian). Is intriguing to think that the inferences and biases that people display in simple decisions about stochastic motion may bear on how they interpret and act upon stochastic signals operating over longer time scales."

The left (right) target ought to be selected to indicate that the perceived direction of motion was to the left (right, respectively). Subjects were instructed to select the upper extreme of the targets if they were completely certain of their decision, and the lowermost extreme if they thought they were guessing. Intermediate values represent intermediate levels of confidence. Visual aid was provided by coloring the targets in green at the top, red at the bottom, with a gradual transition between the two. After a variable delay during which participants had to maintain fixation, the random dot motion stimulus was shown for a fixed duration of 200 ms. Dot speed, density and aperture size were identical to the RT experiment. After motion offset, the subjects were required to indicate their response by directing the gaze to one target. Decisions were reported without time pressure and subjects were allowed to make multiple eye movements until they pressed the spacebar to accept the confidence and the choice. The same participants that completed the RT task performed the confidence task (subject S1: 1536 trials; S2: 2103; S3: 2107)."

This difference was used to estimate the latency with which motion information is represented in these neurons, regardless of the choice. For the analyses of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C,D</a>, we obtained the residuals of firing rate by subtracting, from each trial and time step, the average firing rate of the same neuron on trials having the same motion direction, coherence and volatility. To group trials across neurons, we divided the activity of each neuron by a normalization constant, given by the maximum average firing rate at the highest coherence (i.e., c = 0.512). The latencies in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> were estimated with a curve fitting procedure based on the CUSUM method (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ellaway, 1978</a>). In the CUSUM method, the latency of the difference between two conditions is estimated based the cumulative sum of the differences, thereby achieving robustness against the noisiness of individual data point. The cumulative sum of differences was fit to a curve composed of two lines, the first of which was constrained to have a zero slope [similar to <a href=\"#bib37\">Lorteije et al.

For simplicity, we assume that the variance of momentary evidence is known to the decision maker \u2013 or that it can be estimated very rapidly (e.g., <a href=\"#bib18\">Drugowitsch et al. [2014]</a>). As in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rao, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Huang et al., 2012</a>) we derive the optimal strategy by representing the random-dot motion discrimination task as a partially-observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The solution to the POMDP is then derived by recasting it as an MDP (i.e., assuming full observability over the belief states) and using dynamic programming to derive the policy that maximizes average reward."

However, it is unclear from these analyses what an optimal decision maker would do if the volatility condition were known. Therefore, we used dynamic programming to find the decision policy that maximizes average reward (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rao, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>), for a variety of combinations of task parameters. The following examples are meant to convey intuitions about how parameters can change to maximize overall success per unit time. (<b>A</b>) Optimal solution for an experiment in which there is just one nonzero motion strength. Notice that the optimal bound height for low and high volatility trials is independent of time, consistent with a well known property of Wald\u2019s sequential probability ratio test (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wald and Wolfowitz, 1948</a>). The high volatility condition invites a slightly higher bound but not so much to overcome the faster decision times induced by greater noise (<b>A</b>, third row). Unlike the experimental observation, the normative solution assigns lower confidence under high volatility (<b>A</b>, bottom). (<b>B</b>) If the noise level associated with the high volatility condition were exaggerated further, the optimal solution would predict a greater increase in the bound height, thereby compensating for the additional noise. The bound height for the low volatility condition should increase as well. (<b>C</b>) In the situation we study, there are many levels of difficulty which are randomly interleaved across trials. In this situation, the optimal solution asserts a time-dependent collapse of the bounds toward lower magnitude of accumulated evidence (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>). As in the single coherence case, the high volatility condition should induce an increase in bound height at all times, relative to the low volatility condition. Notice, however, that the optimal solution would lead to lower confidence under high volatility\u2014contrary to what we observed empirically. The same pattern holds if there is a substantial time penalty after an error (<b>D</b>) and if the variance in the high volatility condition were exaggerated to six times that of the low volatility condition (<b>E</b>)."

For different sets of parameters (<a href=\"#A1-tbl1\">Appendix 1\u2014table 1</a>) we derive the choice and decision time by solving numerically the Fokker-Planck equations using the optimal bounds, for a fine grid of coherence values and for both volatility conditions (second and third rows of the figure).

First, if the volatility conditions (low or high) were known, the decision maker should adjust the termination criteria and confidence mapping. In other words, it would be desirable to know the volatility conditions and to adjust the decision process accordingly. Second, if subjects approximated the optimal behavior they would have been less confident on high volatility trials. The observation that they were more confident on these trials implies that they were not optimal, or they could not identify the volatility without adding additional costs (e.g., effort and/or time). Third, the faster RT on high volatility trials would have been expected even if the subjects had applied different decision criteria."

The experiment manipulated the mean coherence and the volatility of the coherence with either no frame-to-frame variance (low volatility) or with frame-to-frame variance (high volatility). Choice, response time, and measures of retrospective confidence were collected from three human participants and one macaque monkey. For the monkey, confidence monkey was measured with post-decision wagering. For the humans, confidence was measured via a scale positioned on the left and right of the stimulus allowing a choice to be recorded at the same time a confidence level was recorded. Mean coherence had the typical effects on all 3 measures. Volatility, particularly at the lower levels of coherence, decreased response time and increased the average level of confidence. The results from detailed analyses using a motion energy analysis of the stimulus, firing rate of direction selective neurons in the MT, and behavioral data, are reported as consistent with a bounded evidence accumulation model where sensory information is accumulated as evidence until it reaches a threshold or stimulus offset. This determines the observed choice and response time. Confidence is assumed to reflect the probability the decision is correct given the level of evidence reached, though an important conditional here is that this mapping is not impacted by the so-called volatility of the stimulus."

It's tantamount to the assumption that the system is not estimating volatility on a trial by trials basis as an ideal observer would when high and low viability trials are interleaved. As a result, it is unclear whether or not these results are a product of this assumption or a product of the task itself. We know from human psychophysics that we do estimate volatility (or stimulus variance) on a trial by trial basis and more or less rationally incorporate that information into our decision variables. In this context an ideal observer model should be associated with an accumulator that rises sub-linearly it accumulates evidence that this is a high volatility trial. While the opposite is true in low volatility trials. If there is not enough information to accurately estimate stimulus variability then the author's assumption is valid. But it's not clear that this is the case. Moreover, even an ideal observer model may exhibit the same qualitative behavior as the author's suboptimal model even when there is enough information to estimate variability accurately. It would be nice to know if this is the case, but regardless, some discussion of these issues would be a welcome addition to this work."

Given that confidence can be assessed in animals including rodents, an alternative approach is to empirically assess confidence which may not be optimal. In this context, don't the present findings give important and stern warning to the \"optimality\" approach? This is a key issue that may influence the agenda of the field for years to come, and should be emphasized."

The impact of stimulus noise seems modest, but does it change pair-wise noise correlation between neurons too? Even if it doesn't, what is the correlation to begin with, for these neurons? Since multi-unit recording was performed in at least some of these neurons, we should have some idea? If pairwise noise correlation is high, it limits the efficiency of a readout mechanism (if such mechanism is to do anything resembling averaging of individual neuronal responses), and may thus mean that the readout is noisy too (because individual noise can't be efficiently averaged out). Again, I understand there are relatively few neurons here, but this is an important part of the results, going beyond previous studies, and should perhaps be mentioned in the Abstract, so people will know this is not <i>just</i> a psychophysics paper."

In our original submission, we assumed that the mapping used for both volatility conditions was constructed based on the variance of the lowvolatility condition. The motivation for this assumption was that subjects, especially the monkeys, had extensive experience with the low volatility condition before we introduced the high volatility condition. Given the subtlety of the manipulation, and the lack of a strong effect on accuracy, subjects may have had little impetus to conclude that task contingencies have changed when we introduced the volatility manipulation, and would therefore continue to rely on the mapping that they learned for the low volatility condition. Based on the reviewer\u2019s comments, we now realize that this reasoning was unclear, as we did not specify the conditions under which the mapping is or is not expected to change, and how much experience is required for the mapping to change. Therefore, we now redefine the mapping to include both volatility conditions. The map was derived rationally, meaning that it was obtained marginalizing over the two volatility conditions, as it is explained in Results (subsection \u201cEffects of volatility on confidence\u201d, first paragraph) and Methods (new equation 5). We believe this to be more parsimonious and more consistent with the extensive experience that our subjects eventually developed under the mixture of volatilities. We note, however, that the two models produce almost identical fits. The reason for this is better understood with <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>, which is equivalent to the new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> but for three maps (instead of two): low volatility (dashed lines), high volatility (dotted lines) and mixture of high and low volatilities (solid lines). As can be observed in the maps, the isoprobability contours are approximately scaled versions of one another. Because the criterion \u03a6 that separates high from low confidence is a parameter that we fit to data, we cannot distinguish between a low volatility map with a \u03a6 of (say) 0.6 from a mixture map with a \u03a6 of ~0.56."

First, any mechanism or criterion for establishing confidence in a perceptual decision must be invariant to at least one manipulation that affects probability correct, namely the difficulty or stimulus strength itself. If the brain were able to identify perfectly the difficulty level (motion coherence in our tasks), it would have no need to estimate probability correct from a DV, but would simply assign a level of confidence based on the actual probability correct experienced at that difficulty. In the extreme case, decisions on 0% coherence trials should all be rendered with the lowest possible confidence level (regardless of the DV), but this is not what happens. Volatility is simply another parameter of the visual stimulus that, as we have now shown, does not appear to affect the mapping of a DV to confidence (leaving aside the empirical observation that our volatility manipulation had very weak effects on accuracy, providing little incentive for the brain to adjust to it)."

It's tantamount to the assumption that the system is not estimating volatility on a trial by trials basis as an ideal observer would when high and low viability trials are interleaved. As a result, it is unclear whether or not these results are a product of this assumption or a product of the task itself. We know from human psychophysics that we do estimate volatility (or stimulus variance) on a trial by trial basis and more or less rationally incorporate that information into our decision variables. In this context an ideal observer model should be associated with an accumulator that rises sub-linearly it accumulates evidence that this is a high volatility trial. While the opposite is true in low volatility trials. If there is not enough information to accurately estimate stimulus variability then the author's assumption is valid. But it's not clear that this is the case. Moreover, even an ideal observer model may exhibit the same qualitative behavior as the author's suboptimal model even when there is enough information to estimate variability accurately. It would be nice to know if this is the case, but regardless, some discussion of these issues would be a welcome addition to this work.</i> "

This prediction is not supported by the data.

This is because the increased noise in the high-volatility condition makes it more probable that the DV will reach the space normally occupied by the higher coherences. The same intuition explains our observation that, despite increasing the bound height on high volatility trials, an ideal observer still makes faster decisions on those trials, at least when motion strength is weak (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 1</a>, 3rd row). There certainly may be circumstances where a noise manipulation leads to slower and less confident decisions, in accordance with the reviewer\u2019s intuition.

Given that confidence can be assessed in animals including rodents, an alternative approach is to empirically assess confidence which may not be optimal. In this context, don't the present findings give important and stern warning to the \"optimality\" approach?

To make this claim, we would need to know the cost in time and effort of estimating the volatility online to use it to adjust the parameters of the decision making process. So we would prefer to remain uncommitted on the optimality issue.

Since multi-unit recording was performed in at least some of these neurons, we should have some idea? If pairwise noise correlation is high, it limits the efficiency of a readout mechanism (if such mechanism is to do anything resembling averaging of individual neuronal responses), and may thus mean that the readout is noisy too (because individual noise can't be efficiently averaged out). Again, I understand there are relatively few neurons here, but this is an important part of the results, going beyond previous studies, and should perhaps be mentioned in the Abstract, so people will know this is not just a psychophysics paper.</i> "

Accordingly, we added a short section in Results and a new figure that displays the time course over which the neural response informs confidence as assayed in the PDW task. Previous studies have shown correlations between the fluctuations of neural activity in MT/MST and directional choices in tasks similar to the one studied here. We now show that fluctuations in neural activity are also informative of whether the monkey will waive the sure target if available (new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).
