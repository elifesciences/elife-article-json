                    "text": "Domains in macromolecular complexes are often considered structurally and functionally conserved while energetically coupled to each other. In the modular voltage-gated ion channels the central ion-conducting pore is surrounded by four voltage sensing domains (VSDs). Here, the energetic coupling is mediated by interactions between the S4-S5 linker, covalently linking the domains, and the proximal C-terminus. In order to characterize the intrinsic gating of the voltage sensing domain in the absence of the pore domain, the Shaker Kv channel was truncated after the fourth transmembrane helix S4 (Shaker-iVSD). Shaker-iVSD showed significantly altered gating kinetics and formed a cation-selective ion channel with a strong preference for protons. Ion conduction in Shaker-iVSD developed despite identical primary sequence, indicating an allosteric influence of the pore domain. Shaker-iVSD also displays pronounced 'relaxation'. Closing of the pore correlates with entry into relaxation suggesting that the two processes are energetically related."

In the modular voltage-gated ion channels the central ion-conducting pore is surrounded by four voltage sensing domains (VSDs). Here, the energetic coupling is mediated by interactions between the S4-S5 linker, covalently linking the domains, and the proximal C-terminus. In order to characterize the intrinsic gating of the voltage sensing domain in the absence of the pore domain, the Shaker Kv channel was truncated after the fourth transmembrane helix S4 (Shaker-iVSD). Shaker-iVSD showed significantly altered gating kinetics and formed a cation-selective ion channel with a strong preference for protons. Ion conduction in Shaker-iVSD developed despite identical primary sequence, indicating an allosteric influence of the pore domain. Shaker-iVSD also displays pronounced 'relaxation'. Closing of the pore correlates with entry into relaxation suggesting that the two processes are energetically related."

Further experiments reveal this new channel opens at a voltage when the main Shaker Kv channel is usually closed. This may result in small leaks of ions across the membrane that cause long-lasting changes in the timing, intensity and number of electrical signals in cells and organs. The findings of Zhao and Blunck suggest that different modules of ion channels influence each other more than previously thought."

They comprise four subunits of each six transmembrane segments (S1\u2013S6), which are assembled into two functionally distinct parts: a central ion-selective pore formed by the combined S5 and S6 segments of four domains, surrounded by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) formed by the four helices S1\u2013S4. S4 is considered the principal component of voltage sensing because it contains positively charged residues that are periodically aligned at every third position. The first four arginines (R1-R4) of S4 sense and interact with the surrounding electric field, and move the S4 outward during depolarization and inward during hyperpolarization in a combination of translation, rotation and tilt (<a href=\"#bib16\">Faure et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vargas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</a>). These changes are mechanically transmitted to the pore domain via the S4\u2013S5 linker and the C-terminal S6 of the same and neighboring subunit, leading to gating of the central pore (<a href=\"#bib2\">Batulan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wall-Lacelle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Haddad and Blunck, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Muroi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Long et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Catterall, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bezanilla, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lu et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Labro et al., 2008</a>).

Chimeras of VSD of one and pore domain of another protein were able to gate in a voltage-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arrigoni et al., 2013</a>). The notion that the VSD acts as an independent module is further supported by proteins where the VSD is linked not to a pore domain but instead to a cytosolic enzymatic domain such as the voltage-sensitive phosphatase of <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> (Ci-VSP). It was possible to carry out structural studies on isolated voltage sensor domains (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chakrapani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2003</a>), and the VSD of Ci-VSP has been shown to function in the absence of the phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib24\">Labro et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Murata et al., 2005</a>). Finally, the voltage-gated proton channels (Hv) lack a separate pore domain altogether such that its VSD is directly responsible for proton permeation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ramsey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sasaki et al., 2006</a>). In view of the modular nature of voltage-gated ion channels, VSDs have been considered in structure function studies largely as their own entity with energetic coupling to the pore domain, and they have been directly compared to other VSD-containing proteins such as Ci-VSP and Hv channels. We do not know, however, how possible restraint forces from the pore domain may have obscured conformational changes during VSD activation."

The voltage dependence is much shallower than the voltage dependence of Shaker-WT and it is evident from the development of cation conduction that the voltage sensing domain assumes a different structural conformation than in the full-length channel. The shallower voltage dependence is probably related to a dispersion of the electric field in the voltage sensor; with the 'hydrophobic plug' or 'gating charge transfer center' (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tao et al., 2010</a>) no longer intact, the electric field will be less focussed and thus diminish the effective valence of the gating transition. There are two possible explanations for the rearrangements, (i) the missing interaction with the pore domain leads to a different, energetically more favourable state of the entire voltage sensing domain, or (ii) uncoupling from the pore domain allows the voltage sensor to continue its normal gating movement and enter a deeper resting state not accessible in the wild type. If the second case were true, the deactivation kinetics (i.e. here: return to 0 mV) should remain unaltered, but we observed significant slowing of deactivation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). More importantly, activation of the voltage sensor, monitored by the fast fluorescence change, did not close the ion conduction pathway: the activation kinetics when holding at \u221290 mV (<i>resting</i>), measured via fluorescence, were fast (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>), and the current did not reduce during a 250 ms-pulse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). iVSD thus leaves the conducting state only very slowly, whereas entering is significantly faster albeit slower than the gating kinetics of wild type Shaker channels."

In Shaker, we can therefore assume that every acidic residue in the core of the VSD remains coordinated to an arginine whereas, in Hv1, D112 likely becomes uncoordinated in the activated position because the fifth positive charge in S4 is missing.

Relaxation or mode shift is the displacement of the voltage dependence of charge movement and conductance to more hyperpolarized potentials upon prolonged holding at hyperpolarized potentials. Relaxation has been linked to C-type inactivation, stabilization of the open state, length of the S3-S4 linker and N-terminus in different constructs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Haddad and Blunck, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Piper et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Olcese et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuzmenkin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bruening-Wright and Larsson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Priest et al., 2013</a>). While the S3-S4 linker and the N-terminus (T1 domain) rest intact and may still influence relaxation, in the absence of the pore, neither C-type inactivation nor open state stabilization may have an influence. In the resting and activated state, Shaker-iVSD forms a cation-selective pore whereas this pore is closed in the relaxed state, indicating that the acidic residues responsible for the cation pore are no longer accessible either by reorientation or coordination with a basic residue.

Remarkably, this deletion causes the remaining four voltage-sensing domains to conduct cations over a wide range of voltages where fluorescence experiments show that the sensors fluctuate between resting and activated states, and that the conduction pathway only closes as the sensors enter the relaxed state that predominates at positive voltages. The permeation pathway appears to be relatively non-selective, and the authors estimate the selectivity sequence as H<sup>+</sup>&gt;Na<sup>+</sup>=K<sup>+</sup>&gt;NMDG<sup>+</sup>. Deletion of the pore-domain also has a profound influence on the energetics of voltage-sensor activation, causing a decrease in the valence of <i>FV</i> relations by about 5-fold. The manuscript is well-written and the data support most of the conclusions the authors advance. That the pore has such a substantial impact on the voltage sensors is really quite surprising, and we think the work is appropriate for <i>eLife</i>."
