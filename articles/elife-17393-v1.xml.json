So, we worked hard, we met the milestones on the U, and we published the results in [a Nature specialty journal]. They still didn't renew us. The PI wrote five different grants that year. One was funded, but not in time. All four of us lost our jobs. I went back to Europe and the other three scrambled for industry positions. I am currently doing a second postdoc, but I still have my doubts about staying in science.

I finished my PhD, spent a few months in the lab to wrap up, then took my first faculty job at a university across town, which is pretty normal for my field. They were excited to hire a female engineer. I felt proud of my work. But then, when I tried to take the next step, the funding dried up. NIH said it was too pre-clinical and the study section wasn't sure it would work. The US National Science Foundation (NSF) said it was too clinically oriented. Career award reviewers at both agencies felt there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of university financial commitment, because I was technically in a soft money job. Nobody was willing to take a risk."

Roughly 3% of the recipients of R01 grants from the National Institutes of Health are 36 years old\u00a0or younger, compared with 18% a few decades earlier (<a href=\"#bib2\">Rockey, 2012</a>). As the prospects of a new professor securing a Federal grant decline, university departments must commit more internal funds to each new hire. The most entrepreneurial scientists, like Dr. B, may accept positions without guaranteed funding (\"soft money\"). Unfortunately, the limited resources of such jobs often place the investigator at a continued competitive disadvantage, limiting their success."

Communication is the key to collecting compelling stories from scientists and disseminating information about the state of science funding. As part of Academics for the Future of Science, we are working with local colleagues at MIT and the greater Boston area, as well as other organizations of scientists (such as Future of Research\u00a0(www.futureofresearch.org), to modernize the way our community shares ideas about the uncertain future of science. Through our extensive online presence we have developed a number of resources for advocacy and we have collected many first-hand accounts of the effects of funding on scientists (<a href=\"#bib1\">Academics for the Future of Science, 2015</a>). We continue to develop shareable information in the form of infographics (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> for an example), short social media posts, and even cartoons. Social media and email allows us to reach out to early-career scientists, minorities and others underrepresented in the national dialogue. Social media in particular allows us to connect with scientists who express any level of interest (for example, by liking our Facebook page (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/academicsforthefutureofscience\">www.facebook.com/academicsforthefutureofscience</a>) or following us on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/savescience\">@SaveScience</a>)), then gradually involve them further in advocacy through repeated follow-up."

Community outreach:</b> Individual scientists have powerful stories to tell, but they are often too busy or removed from the political process to advocate for themselves. Advocacy organizations can help coordinate their efforts, and provide the tools and knowledge necessary for scientists to become self-advocates. Our organization has contributed to this goal by creating an online advocacy tool (<a href=\"http://save-science.org\">http://save-science.org</a>) to make it easier for busy scientists to communicate with their representatives. Open-source advocacy platforms now make it possible, in a few weeks, to deploy methods that were once available only to well-funded lobbying groups. We plan to introduce additional easy-to-use tools that enable scientists to represent themselves in legislative conversations. These are optimized for the US Congressional system, but could be tailored for a different representative body."
