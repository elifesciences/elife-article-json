In this study, we combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting state fMRI and demonstrated an inverse relationship between levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA within the primary motor cortex (M1) and the strength of functional connectivity across the resting motor network. This relationship was both neurochemically and anatomically specific. We then went on to show that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), an intervention previously shown to decrease GABA levels within M1, increased resting motor network connectivity. We therefore suggest that network-level functional connectivity within the motor system is related to the degree of inhibition in M1, a major node within the motor network, a finding in line with converging evidence from both simulation and empirical studies."

In this study, we combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting state fMRI and demonstrated an inverse relationship between levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA within the primary motor cortex (M1) and the strength of functional connectivity across the resting motor network. This relationship was both neurochemically and anatomically specific. We then went on to show that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), an intervention previously shown to decrease GABA levels within M1, increased resting motor network connectivity. We therefore suggest that network-level functional connectivity within the motor system is related to the degree of inhibition in M1, a major node within the motor network, a finding in line with converging evidence from both simulation and empirical studies."

These robust, distributed networks, most commonly detected using functional MRI, show correlated fluctuations in their resting signal and have revealed networks formed from spatially widespread but anatomically and functionally closely linked regions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fox and Raichle, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Snyder and Raichle, 2012</a>). Understanding the basis of these resting state networks is of increasing interest, as variation in the strength of functional coupling within these networks has been shown to be highly sensitive to a wide variety of clinical, genetic, or cognitive states (<a href=\"#bib5\">Filippini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Pievani et al., 2011</a>).

However, recent simulation studies have predicted that patterns of local oscillatory activity can emerge spontaneously in a coherent fashion across large networks with specific connectional architectures (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cabral et al., 2011</a>). Such local neuronal dynamics depend on neurochemical inhibitory tone, as shown, for example, by changes in local activity within the primary motor cortices (M1s) caused by pharmacological manipulations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hall et al., 2011</a>). If correlated activity spontaneously emerges through attractor dynamics in distant cortical regions, then extent of these functional correlations should be best predicted by local GABA concentrations."

In a fourth study, we performed an intervention study\u2014to directly assess this relationship by testing whether application of anodal (excitatory) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to M1, an intervention known to decrease local GABA concentration (<a href=\"#bib20\">Stagg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">2011a</a>), resulted in strengthening of functional connectivity within the motor RSN."

This generates subject level maps of functional connectivity for each RSN of interest. Analysis focused on the motor network, the principal RSN containing M1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For the seed-based correlation analysis, we correlated the average resting BOLD timecourses between the left and right M1s as a simpler measure of functional connectivity between left M1, from where our GABA measurements were acquired, and another major network node.

We believe that the fundamental relationship between resting connectivity within the motor network and M1 GABA demonstrated here is robust, as it is replicated across both ICA and seed-based approaches; whether the MRS and fMRI data were collected on the same day or different days; across different scanners; and in young and old healthy cohorts."

A recent simulation-based paper suggested a positive relationship between local oscillatory power in the gamma band and resting state functional connectivity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cabral et al., 2011</a>), something supported in the visual network by a relationship between RSN connectivity and local gamma frequency oscillatory activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Shmuel and Leopold, 2008</a>). Evoked gamma power is also known to be inversely related to extra-synaptic GABA tone (<a href=\"#bib23\">Towers et al., 2004</a>). GABA is present in the human brain in three major pools\u2014in pre-synaptic vesicles, as a metabolite in the cytoplasm, and in the extracellular fluid, where it underlies extra-synaptic GABA tone. It is likely that MRS-assessed GABA, which is sensitive to the total <i>amount</i> of GABA within the voxel, more closely reflects extra-synaptic rather than synaptic GABA activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Stagg et al., 2011b</a>)."

One previous study has observed a correlation between GABA in the posteromedial cortex and the strength of the default mode network (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kapogiannis et al., 2013</a>). Taken together with our findings, this suggests that the relationships we report are not specific to the motor system, but rather a general feature of resting state functional connectivity networks. It is interesting to note, however, that in addition to a relationship with GABA, Kapogiannis et al. demonstrate a significant positive correlation between glutamate in the posteromedial cortex and the strength of the default mode network. There are a number of reasons why we did not find a similar relationship between glutamate and resting state connectivity. Our MRS approach allowed quantification of Glx, a composite measure of glutamate and glutamine, and therefore may be less sensitive to relationships with glutamate specifically. Alternatively, it may be that different networks have different neurochemical profiles, although this seems less likely."

Briefly, this approach consisted of three stages. First, the concatenated fMRI data set was decomposed using ICA into 25 components and RSNs of interest were identified using spatial correlations against previously defined maps (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beckmann et al., 2005</a>). Next, the dual-regression approach was used to identify the subject-specific RSN maps. This process involved using all 25 components to perform a spatial regression against each separate fMRI data set and then using the resulting normalized time-course matrices to perform a temporal regression to estimate subject-specific maps that reflect the subject specific strength of functional connectivity. The resulting subject-specific RSN map was then masked by the group mean RSN map and the mean value within this region extracted for each subject, used as a measure of the strength of functional connectivity within the RSN. Motion is known to have complex effects on resting state connectivity on a subject-by-subject basis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Power et al., 2012</a>), but effects of head motion are greatly ameliorated by the dual regression approach used here, compared against simpler single-regression-based analyses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Zuo et al., 2010</a>)."
