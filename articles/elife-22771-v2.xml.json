Although much is known about how serotonin acts on its cellular targets, how serotonin release is regulated <i>in vivo</i> remains poorly understood. In the nematode <i>C. elegans,</i> serotonin neurons that drive female reproductive behavior are directly modulated by inhibitory neuropeptides. Here, we report the isolation of mutants in which inhibitory neuropeptides fail to properly modulate serotonin neurons and the behavior they mediate. The corresponding mutations affect the T-type calcium channel CCA-1 and symmetrically re-tune its voltage-dependencies of activation and inactivation towards more hyperpolarized potentials. This shift in voltage dependency strongly and specifically bypasses the behavioral and cell physiological effects of peptidergic inhibition on serotonin neurons. Our results indicate that T-type calcium channels are critical regulators of a <i>C. elegans</i> serotonergic circuit and demonstrate a mechanism in which T-type channels functionally gate inhibitory modulation <i>in vivo</i>."

In the nematode <i>C. elegans,</i> serotonin neurons that drive female reproductive behavior are directly modulated by inhibitory neuropeptides. Here, we report the isolation of mutants in which inhibitory neuropeptides fail to properly modulate serotonin neurons and the behavior they mediate. The corresponding mutations affect the T-type calcium channel CCA-1 and symmetrically re-tune its voltage-dependencies of activation and inactivation towards more hyperpolarized potentials. This shift in voltage dependency strongly and specifically bypasses the behavioral and cell physiological effects of peptidergic inhibition on serotonin neurons. Our results indicate that T-type calcium channels are critical regulators of a <i>C. elegans</i> serotonergic circuit and demonstrate a mechanism in which T-type channels functionally gate inhibitory modulation <i>in vivo</i>."

                        "text": "Neuromodulators constitute a class of diverse chemical signals that can cause widespread and long-lasting effects on neural circuits. Many studies of vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems illustrate how the combined impact of multiple neuromodulators on brain circuits can generate a recognizable behavioral state, suggesting that the regulation of neuromodulator release is critical for the generation and control of behavior <i>in vivo</i>. In the vertebrate central nervous system, the neuromodulator serotonin is released by a small population of neurons that project widely and exert influence on neural circuits throughout the brain. Serotonin is required for central control of basic physiological functions such as thermoregulation and respiratory control (<a href=\"#bib50\">Myers, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Morin et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Frazer and Hensler, 1999</a>). Serotonin also functions in the control of affective states and behavioral drives. For example, serotonergic systems control aggression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kravitz, 1988</a>), appetite (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lent, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hatcher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Oh et al., 2015</a>), and sexual behavior (<a href=\"#bib73\">Uphouse, 2014</a>). Dysregulation of endogenous serotonin systems is thought to underlie psychiatric illness, notably affective disorders such as major depression and generalized anxiety (<a href=\"#bib30\">Holmes et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Neumeister et al., 2004</a>). Because serotonin plays critical roles in many different neural circuits that influence affect, cognition, and behavior, components of serotonin signaling pathways are important therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (<a href=\"#bib7\">Celada et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Angoa-P\u00e9rez and Kuhn, 2015</a>). Current targets include serotonin receptors, serotonin transporters that mediate vesicular packaging or reuptake after release, and catabolic enzymes that degrade serotonin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Celada et al., 2013a</a>). Mechanisms that control serotonin release <i>in vivo</i> could be similarly important therapeutic targets. However, little is known about these mechanisms."

                        "text": "A simple behavior of the nematode worm <i>C. elegans</i> offers a powerful model for the study of molecular mechanisms that regulate serotonin circuits <i>in vivo</i>. Female reproductive behavior - egg laying - requires serotonin, which is released from a pair of Hermaphrodite-Specific Neurons (HSNs) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Trent et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Desai and Horvitz, 1989</a>). Egg-laying behavior is highly stereotyped, and when it is disrupted animals visibly bloat with unlaid eggs. This easily identified behavioral change makes the neurochemical systems that generate and modulate egg-laying behavior amenable to genetic analysis. Genes that function in serotonin synthesis, release, and receptor signaling mechanisms mutate to cause egg-laying defects, and unbiased genetic screens for behavioral mutants defective in egg-laying behavior have identified genes and molecules that regulate the function of serotonin neurons (<a href=\"#bib70\">Trent et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Desai and Horvitz, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">S\u00e9galat et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mendel et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brundage et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Koelle and Horvitz, 1996</a>)."

HSNs synapse both onto VM muscle targets and onto VC4 and VC5 motor neurons. VC4 and VC5 motor neurons synapse onto VMs (<a href=\"#bib76\">White et al., 1986</a>) and also provide extrasynaptic inhibitory modulation to the HSNs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bany et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Shyn et al., 2003</a>). In addition to modulation from local neurons, HSNs also receive inhibitory peptidergic inputs from multiple sources. The G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor EGL-6 is expressed by HSNs and mediates their inhibition in response to FLP-10 and FLP-17 neuropeptides. FLP-10 inhibitory neuropeptides are secreted from several neuron types, as well as from epithelial cells of the reproductive system. FLP-17 peptides are secreted by a small number of cells and are principally released by a pair of chemosensory neurons, the BAGs (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kim and Li, 2004</a>). Both inhibitory cholinergic and peptidergic modulation of the HSNs are mediated by the G<sub>o</sub> alpha ortholog GOA-1, which acts through two effectors to mediate neuronal inhibition: the diacylglycerol kinase DGK-1 and inward rectifying potassium channels comprising IRK-1 subunits (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nurrish et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Emtage et al., 2012</a>)."

Inhibition of HSNs by this mutant receptor requires its endogenous ligands (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</a>), indicating that EGL-6(gf) receptors are not constitutively active but rather amplify peptidergic inhibition received by HSNs. To identify factors required for inhibitory peptidergic modulation of the HSNs, we sought mutants that were suppressed for the egg-laying defects caused by <i>egl-6(gf)</i>. Here, we report that <i>cca-1</i>, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel homologous to vertebrate T-type calcium channels, mutates to strongly and specifically suppress the effects of excess peptidergic inhibition onto serotonin neurons. The <i>cca-1</i> suppressor mutation symmetrically shifts the voltage dependencies of channel activation and inactivation, resulting in a T-type channel that operates over more hyperpolarized membrane potentials compared to wild-type channels. Re-tuning the voltage dependency of T-type channels restores activity to inhibited HSNs at the cellular level and, at the whole animal level, restores wild-type reproductive behavior to mutants in which HSNs receive excess peptidergic inhibition. We propose that these data reveal a general mechanism by which T-type calcium channels act as functional gates to enable or disable inhibitory neuromodulatory input to cellular targets and circuits."

We observed that <i>n5209</i> alone had no measurable effect on the developmental stage of newly laid eggs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, bottom). These data suggest that <i>n5209</i> does not grossly affect the timing of egg-laying behavior. We next used high-resolution behavior analysis to quantify parameters of egg-laying behavior of <i>n5209</i> mutants. <i>C. elegans</i> egg-laying behavior is a stochastic process that is well described by a model in which the neuromusculature switches between active and inactive states with dynamics dictated by measurable rate constants (<a href=\"#bib75\">Waggoner et al., 1998</a>). We tracked animals carrying the <i>n5209</i> mutation to determine whether <i>n5209</i> affected state transitions in the egg-laying system and, if so, whether the rate constants determining these transitions were significantly altered by the suppressor mutation. We observed that the behavior of <i>n5209</i> mutants, like that of the wild type, switched between active and inactive states and displayed a very similar temporal structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We noted that one parameter of the model used to describe the behavior is altered in <i>n5209</i> mutants: the time constant that defines the rate with which the egg-laying system \u2018resets\u2019 after a behavioral event (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As a result, <i>n5209</i> mutants display slightly longer intervals between egg-laying events when the system is in an active state. We noted that <i>n5209</i> animals carry slightly fewer embryos <i>in utero</i> than do wild-type animals (average of 7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 embryos vs 11.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 embryos, respectively). This might explain the slight increase in the intracluster time constant. However, the overall structure of the reproductive behavioral program is intact in <i>n5209</i> mutants.

That the <i>n5209</i> and <i>n6122</i> mutations were independently derived is indicated by the large number of unique sequence variants near the <i>cca-1</i> locus in each of the mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because we mapped the <i>n5209</i> mutation to a small interval that contains only one mutation that affects protein-coding sequence and because the identical mutation was recovered independently by our screen, we concluded that the <i>n5209</i> and <i>n6122</i> suppressor mutations affect the T-type calcium channel gene <i>cca-1</i>."

We were unable to express the <i>C. elegans</i> CCA-1 channels in a heterologous system, so we introduced the corresponding mutation into a very highly conserved mammalian homolog of CCA-1, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 is readily expressed in heterologous expression systems such as <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cribbs et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Perez-Reyes et al., 1998</a>). We recorded whole-cell currents from transgenic oocytes expressing either wild-type channels or channels carrying the suppressor mutation. Voltage steps used to measure channel activation and representative traces for wild-type and mutant channels are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>, respectively. We observed that the P262S suppressor mutation shifted the current-voltage relationship of T-type channels towards more hyperpolarized potentials (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The suppressor mutation shifted both the steady-state activation and inactivation curves. The peak conductance was shifted by \u221210 mV, with wild-type channels exhibiting peak conductance at \u221220 mV and mutant channels exhibiting peak conductance at \u221230 mV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

We observed that the suppressor mutation caused a similar shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of T-type channels. Voltage steps used to measure channel inactivation and representative traces for wild-type and mutant channels are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>, respectively.

To determine whether this is the case in the serotonergic HSNs, we tested whether <i>cca-1(n5209)</i> had any effect in the absence of the G<sub>i/o</sub> ortholog GOA-1 or in the absence of neuropeptide ligands for the GPCR EGL-6. Loss of the sole G<sub>i/o</sub> ortholog, GOA-1, potently suppresses <i>egl-6(gf)</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</a>). We found that the <i>cca-1</i> suppressor mutation enhanced the suppression by loss of <i>goa-1</i> function (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), suggesting that the <i>cca-1</i> suppressor mutation has an effect in parallel to G proteins in the control of cellular inhibition. We also found that <i>cca-1(n5209)</i> enhanced the suppression of the <i>egl-6(gf)</i> phenotype by mutation of the ligand-encoding genes <i>flp-10</i> and <i>flp-17</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). However, <i>cca-1(n5209)</i> had no measurable effect on animals that lack HSNs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These data indicate that although CCA-1 acts in parallel to EGL-6, it nevertheless depends on the HSNs to modify reproductive behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

LIN-39 is required for the development of VC neurons but is not required for the development of HSNs, which are born in the posterior part of the embryo and migrate to their final position in the midbody (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Desai et al., 1988</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we calculated the cumulative GCaMP signals (cumulative <i>\u25b3F/F</i>) in HSN somas and axons as a proxy for neuronal activity over time. In HSN somas of <i>egl-6(gf) cca-1(n5209)</i> mutants, cumulative <i>\u25b3F/F</i> was significantly elevated compared to that measured in the somas of <i>egl-6(gf)</i> HSNs but was still lower than cumulative <i>\u2206F/F</i> measured in the somas of wild-type HSNs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In HSN axons, however, cumulative <i>\u25b3F/F</i> of the <i>egl-6(gf) cca-1(n5209)</i> neurons was strikingly similar to that measured in wild-type axons. This complete restoration of cumulative activity in the HSN neurite correlated with the complete restoration of reproductive behavior conferred to <i>egl-6(gf)</i> mutants by the <i>cca-1(n5209)</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These data show that <i>cca-1(n5209)</i> restores activity to HSNs that have been silenced by excess peptidergic inhibition.

In the voltage range covered by the overlap of activation and inactivation curves, not all T-type channels fully inactivate, and so some continue to flux ions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crunelli et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Uchino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Williams et al., 1997</a>). The T-type window current is known to contribute to the resting membrane potential of vertebrate thalamocortical and reticular neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dreyfus et al., 2010</a>). We previously showed that inhibitory neuropeptides require GIRK-like potassium channels to inhibit HSNs, and it is therefore likely that inhibitory neuropeptides hyperpolarize HSNs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Emtage et al., 2012</a>). Re-tuned T-type channels might be active at these hyperpolarized potentials and thereby pass a depolarizing current that brings the membrane potential of HSNs back to their pre-modulator baseline. Importantly, in the absence of inhibitory peptides, the resting potential of HSNs would be such that re-tuned T-type channels are inactivated. Re-tuned T-type channels could have little effect on circuit function in the absence of hyperpolarizing modulatory inputs, which is consistent with our observation that re-tuned T-type channels have little effect on <i>C. elegans</i> reproductive behavior in the absence of peptidergic inhibition.\u00a0"

Because T-type channels are low-voltage-activated, they need only a small depolarization to open, and the current they pass can then bring other ion channels to threshold. Such a role for T-type channels in boosting excitatory inputs has been observed in vertebrate neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Llin\u00e1s and Yarom, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>). T-type channels can also boost depolarizations generated by cell-intrinsic mechanisms, for example in cardiac myocytes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hagiwara et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zhou and Lipsius, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mangoni et al., 2006</a>) and their <i>C. elegans</i> counterparts, pharyngeal muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shtonda and Avery, 2005</a>). A key distinction between this model and the model proposed above is that here, re-tuned T-type channels do not affect the resting potential of cells that receive hyperpolarizing modulatory input. Rather, the re-tuned channels would boost excitatory inputs that would otherwise be below threshold for triggering behavior. The ability of T-type channels to boost excitation would also be limited to a hyperpolarized range of membrane potentials because of channel inactivation. In the absence of neuropeptide-driven hyperpolarization, re-tuned calcium channels would likely be inactivated and not affect cellular or circuit responses to excitatory inputs. Again, this model is consistent with our observation that re-tuned T-type channels only affect behavior when HSNs receive peptidergic inhibition."

Instead, our data indicate that HSN targets integrate signals from HSNs over longer periods. On average, bursts of reproductive behavior are separated by twenty to thirty minutes of quiescence, suggesting that the timescale over which such an integrative mechanism would function is on the order of tens of minutes.

                                "text": "Unlike <i>C. elegans</i>, whose genome encodes only one T-type channel, vertebrates possess three genes that encode T-type channels, each of which is expressed in many central circuits. The duplication of T-type calcium genes in vertebrate phyla could reflect expanded and diversified roles for T-type channels that are analogous to their function in the <i>C. elegans</i> serotonin system. If so, different T-type channel isoforms might be involved in the gating of multiple modulatory systems in the vertebrate brain. Genetic studies of human populations have found associations between T-type channel variants and neurological or psychiatric disorders (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheong and Shin, 2013</a>). Alleles of T-type channel genes are strongly linked to heritable epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Heron et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Khosravani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Singh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Powell et al., 2009</a>) and neuropathic pain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bourinet et al., 2016</a>). A T-type channel variant is also associated with autism spectrum disorders (<a href=\"#bib66\">Splawski et al., 2006</a>). Targeted genetic studies of T-type channels in the mouse brain confirm that these channels play roles in diverse brain circuits. T-type channels are required in thalamic circuits for normal sleep, in midbrain centers for central processing of nociception, and in cerebellar circuits for motor learning (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Park et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ly et al., 2013</a>). Our study raises the intriguing possibility that in these brain regions altering T-type channels might affect receptivity of neural circuits to modulatory inputs and that defective gating of neuromodulation might be an underlying cause of pathologies associated with T-type channel dysfunction."

Furthermore, T-type channel genes encode transcripts that display a high degree of alternative splicing to generate multiple channel isoforms from a single locus (<a href=\"#bib62\">Senatore et al., 2014</a>). Neurons can, therefore, remodel the complement of T-type channels either through genetic programs and mechanisms that couple neural activity to mRNA splicing, or acutely regulate T-type channels through canonical second messenger signaling pathways and effectors (<a href=\"#bib49\">Murbarti\u00e1n et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Senatore et al., 2014</a>). Because of this regulation, in the vertebrate brain a gating function of T-type channels with respect to neuromodulation would be subject to a high degree of selective control and possess a large capacity for plasticity."

Compounds that directly target monoamine and neuropeptide signaling systems are in widespread use for the treatment of psychiatric disease. Based on our studies of a model serotonergic circuit in <i>C. elegans,</i> we suggest that compounds that alter the voltage-dependencies of T-type channels might synergize with therapeutics that directly target monoamine signaling in the brain. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate the possibility that globally manipulating T-type channel function in the brain could affect specific circuits. T-type channels are widely expressed in the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system, as they are in the vertebrate brain, but in <i>C. elegans,</i> re-tuning T-type channels by mutation had a striking effect on the modulation of a circuit that controls reproductive behavior. Our data suggest that the origins of this apparent specificity are in the combination of in the biophysical basis of inhibition of serotonin neurons and the manner in which serotonin signals are processed by a downstream circuit. It is highly likely that similar cellular and circuit mechanisms exist in the vertebrate brain, and when the pharmacological tools become available it will be important to test whether manipulating vertebrate T-type channels restores function to neural circuits in and behavior of animal models of psychiatric disorders associated with monoamine dysfunction."

Whole-cell current recordings were made using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method (Warner Instruments; Hamden, CT). Electrodes had a resistance between 0.2 and 1.0 M\u03a9. Oocytes were continuously superfused with Barium Hydroxide (10 mM Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>1 mM KOH 90 mM NaOH 5 mM HEPES pH 7.4 adjusted with methane sulfonic acid). Data were acquired with a Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed off-line with Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and MATLAB (Simulink; Natick, MA). Each oocyte was only included once in the data analysis, that is, there are no technical replicates. In order to be included in the data analysis, oocytes had to exhibit a leak current of less than \u22120.1 \u00b5A when clamped at \u221290 mV, and they had recover to normal resting membrane potential after the activation and inactivation protocols were done. V<sub>50</sub> for activation and inactivation and the slope factor, <i>k</i>, as well as the confidence intervals, were computed using the Boltzmann sigmoidal fit tool in GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA).

Wild-type, <i>cca-1(n5209)</i>, and <i>egl-6(gf) cca-1(n5209)</i> animals were imaged 24\u201330 hr post-L4. Animals were mounted on 5% agarose pads made in M9 medium, immobilized using Vetbond veterinary surgical glue (3\u00a0M; St. Paul, MN), and placed under a coverslip. All videos were taken using a 10x objective on a Zeiss Axioscope Imager.M2 using Micromanager (MMstudioversion1.4.18). GCaMP6f was excited by 473 nm light using an EXFO metal halide epifluorescence light source at 12% light intensity. Images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (Andor; Belfast, Northern Ireland). Animals were imaged at 0.5 Hz for 15 min. Only animals that survived the imaging protocol were included in the study. At least 16 animals per genotype were analyzed. If both HSNs of one animal could be clearly seen, then both were included in the analysis. Neurites were not always visible, even when the soma was. Each animal was only imaged once. GCaMP6f fluorescence was analyzed as follows: Mean background fluorescence was subtracted from mean fluorescence in the region of interest (ROI). Baseline fluorescence in the ROI was determined by taking a linear regression of the entire video and subtracting it from the raw ROI data. This baseline was used to adjust fluorescence signals within the ROI for photobleaching during the experiment. To calculate the cumulative <i>\u25b3F/F</i> of each trace, the absolute value of the difference between ROI fluorescence at each time point was summed. The MatLab scripts we used to analyze the data as described can be found in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 7\u2014source code 1</a>."

This neural circuit is very highly developed as an experimental system to study how specific genes and signals regulate the activity of the circuit and the behavior it controls. The authors take advantage of all the available tricks in this system to carry out studies that would be difficult or impossible outside of <i>C. elegans</i>, or even within <i>C. elegans</i> in less well-studied neural circuits. The state-of-the-art nature of this study within the neural circuit field in itself makes this study of considerable interest. The results of the study make it of further interest. These results arise from an unbiased genetic screen for genes required for response to neuropeptide inhibition of neural activity, and therefore we find them to be of particular interest and significance, since this approach often leads to novel and physiologically significant findings. The results are indeed novel and interesting and lead the authors to raise the hypothesis that T type calcium channels generally are specific and key regulators of the responsiveness of neurons to neuromodulators."

Although it is a bit of a puzzle to figure this out from the information supplied in the supplemental Materials and methods, it appears that the plasmids injected to carry out cell-specific RNAi knockdown of <i>cca-1</i> in the HSNs are pKEZ93 and pKEZ67, which express antisense and sense versions of <i>cca-1</i> from the fairly HSN-specific <i>egl-6a</i> promoter. The effect of injecting these constructs is to make the animals go from relatively wild-type egg laying to becoming egg-laying defective, and the authors interpret this as showing the knockdown of <i>cca-1(n5209)</i> in the HSN causes this effect, i.e. <i>cca-1(n5209)</i> is necessary in the HSN to suppress <i>egl-69(gf)</i>. Unfortunately, there is possibly a more mundane explanation. A number of labs working on the HSN neurons have found that high copy transgenes carrying HSN-expressed promoters (including the <i>egl-6</i> promoter) can interfere with HSN development. Development of the HSN seems to be unusually susceptible to disruption, so the types of manipulations that would cause no worries for other neurons are indeed potentially problematic for the HSN. Disrupting HSN development would lead to the egg-laying defective phenotype, as the authors themselves show in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>. So, I feel that interpretation of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> would be <i>strongly</i> enhanced by a control showing that \"<i>cca-1(RNAi)</i> in the HSNs\" by itself does not cause an egg laying defective phenotype. I would like to see the authors coinject pKEZ93 and pKEZ67 into a background wild-type for both <i>egl-6</i> and <i>cca-1</i>, at the same concentrations used in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, do their staging of freshly laid egg assay on several lines generated in this way, and determine if the RNAi transgene itself causes an egg-laying defective phenotype. This is a relatively quick experiment to do \u2013 I would estimate 2-3 weeks."

This is work done by the last author, Ringstad, as a postdoc in the Horvitz lab. This is a bit of an unusual way to handle this issue. Isolation of the mutant is the entire basis of the paper, so it is an odd thing to leave out. There needs to be more precise methodology for this screen and some details of the results available to other workers who might want to use this knowledge to design other suppressor of Egl screens."

First, the authors conclude that the intracluster time constant is significantly changed, while the intercluster time constant is not. Is there an appropriate statistical analysis that could be used to determine if the data actually show this? Second, I would like to comment that it appears from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> (although no quantitative data are shown on this point) that <i>egl-6(gf)</i> worms carry many more unlaid eggs than do <i>egl-6(gf) n5209</i> worms. I wonder if the apparent increase in the intracluster time constant in the latter worms is simply a byproduct of the fact that there are less eggs to lay, so that egg-laying muscle contractions are less likely to productively release eggs. That would be a different interpretation from thinking that <i>n5209</i> has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals. The authors, to their credit, do <i>not</i> try to conclude that <i>n5209</i> has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals, but rather simply conclude that the overall pattern of egg laying (alternating inactive and active phases) remains intact."

The apparent discrepancy between the language in the Results and in the figure/figure legend should be resolved so that this issue does not confuse the readers. Perhaps the resolution has to do with <i>cca-1</i> being the only gene with sequence variants in both sequenced <i>egl-6(gf)</i> suppressor alleles, but that doesn't become apparent until one has read on to later in the paragraph."

So, the <i>n5209</i> phenotype shares some similarity with the null phenotype and <i>n5209</i> may have some loss of function character.

The second section (subsection \u201cHow T-type channels alter the activity of HSNs suggests an integrative mechanism in targets receiving serotonergic input\u201d) analyzes results of the calcium imaging. Because the calcium imaging was done with immobilized animals on agarose pads, a condition in which \"normal\" egg laying behavior with active and inactive phases cannot occur and in which HSN activity is not correlated with egg laying behavior, there are limits to how well one can interpret what the data mean for normal egg laying behavior. The final Discussion section hypothesizes that T type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels generally \"gate\" neuromodulation and therefore could be good drug targets for psychiatric diseases that seem to involve neuromodulation.

Although it is a bit of a puzzle to figure this out from the information supplied in the supplemental Materials and methods, it appears that the plasmids injected to carry out cell-specific RNAi knockdown of cca-1 in the HSNs are pKEZ93 and pKEZ67, which express antisense and sense versions of cca-1 from the fairly HSN-specific egl-6a promoter. The effect of injecting these constructs is to make the animals go from relatively wild-type egg laying to becoming egg-laying defective, and the authors interpret this as showing the knockdown of cca-1(n5209) in the HSN causes this effect, i.e. cca-1(n5209) is necessary in the HSN to suppress egl-69(gf). Unfortunately, there is possibly a more mundane explanation. A number of labs working on the HSN neurons have found that high copy transgenes carrying HSN-expressed promoters (including the egl-6 promoter) can interfere with HSN development. Development of the HSN seems to be unusually susceptible to disruption, so the types of manipulations that would cause no worries for other neurons are indeed potentially problematic for the HSN. Disrupting HSN development would lead to the egg-laying defective phenotype, as the authors themselves show in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>. So, I feel that interpretation of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> would be strongly enhanced by a control showing that \"cca-1(RNAi) in the HSNs\" by itself does not cause an egg laying defective phenotype. I would like to see the authors coinject pKEZ93 and pKEZ67 into a background wild-type for both egl-6 and cca-1, at the same concentrations used in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, do their staging of freshly laid egg assay on several lines generated in this way, and determine if the RNAi transgene itself causes an egg-laying defective phenotype.

That would be a different interpretation from thinking that n5209 has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals. The authors, to their credit, do not try to conclude that n5209 has a specific effect on regulation of intracluster intervals, but rather simply conclude that the overall pattern of egg laying (alternating inactive and active phases) remains intact.</i> "
