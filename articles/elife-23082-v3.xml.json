Targeted disruption of <i>CatSperz</i> reduces CatSper current and sperm rheotactic efficiency in mice, resulting in severe male subfertility. Normally distributed in linear quadrilateral nanodomains along the flagellum, the complex lacking CatSper\u03b6 is disrupted at ~0.8 \u03bcm intervals along the flagellum. This disruption renders the proximal flagellum inflexible and alters the 3D flagellar envelope, thus preventing sperm from reorienting against fluid flow <i>in vitro</i> and efficiently migrating <i>in vivo</i>. Ejaculated <i>CatSperz</i>-null sperm cells retrieved from the mated female uterus partially rescue <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF) that failed with epididymal spermatozoa alone. Human CatSper\u03b5 is quadrilaterally arranged along the flagella, similar to the CatSper complex in mouse sperm. We speculate that the newly identified CatSper\u03b6 subunit is a late evolutionary adaptation to maximize fertilization inside the mammalian female reproductive tract."

Targeted disruption of <i>CatSperz</i> reduces CatSper current and sperm rheotactic efficiency in mice, resulting in severe male subfertility. Normally distributed in linear quadrilateral nanodomains along the flagellum, the complex lacking CatSper\u03b6 is disrupted at ~0.8 \u03bcm intervals along the flagellum. This disruption renders the proximal flagellum inflexible and alters the 3D flagellar envelope, thus preventing sperm from reorienting against fluid flow <i>in vitro</i> and efficiently migrating <i>in vivo</i>. Ejaculated <i>CatSperz</i>-null sperm cells retrieved from the mated female uterus partially rescue <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF) that failed with epididymal spermatozoa alone. Human CatSper\u03b5 is quadrilaterally arranged along the flagella, similar to the CatSper complex in mouse sperm. We speculate that the newly identified CatSper\u03b6 subunit is a late evolutionary adaptation to maximize fertilization inside the mammalian female reproductive tract."

Only a few of these cells manage to travel up the female\u2019s reproductive tract to reach the egg, and usually only one sperm fertilizes it. Freshly ejaculated sperm are incapable of fertilizing eggs and have to undergo several changes within the female to become able to do so. One crucial change occurs in the sperm tail, which starts to beat vigorously in a whip-like motion. This type of movement \u2013 known as hyperactivated motility \u2013 enables the sperm to swim towards the egg, push through a sticky coating that surrounds it, and then burrow into it."

CatSper channels form groups (known as complexes) with several other proteins that are arranged in a unique pattern of four straight \u2018stripes\u2019 running down the tail of the sperm. This arrangement is necessary for hyperactivated motility and mutations in the genes that encode these proteins can lead to infertility in males. The CatSper channel complex is known to contain seven proteins: four that form a pore through which calcium ions can enter, and three accessory proteins whose roles in hyperactivated motility are less clear."

Moreover, fewer calcium ions were able to pass through the channels to enter the cell. Together, this made the sperm tail more rigid, which prevented it from moving efficiently within the female, resulting in reduced fertility.

In hyperactivated spermatozoa, the transverse flagellar force is larger than the propulsive flagellar force due to the increase in mid-piece curvature (\u03b1 angle), which enables a larger range of motion and typical figure-of-eight swimming trajectories compared to the nearly straight paths of non-hyperactivated spermatozoa (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ishijima, 2011</a>). Transverse force facilitates sperm penetration through the cumulus and ZP (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ishijima, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Yanagimachi, 1966</a>).

CatSper channels form unique Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains in linearly quadrilateral arrays along the principal piece of sperm flagella. The integrity of these domains is necessary to time and/or maintain hyperactivated motility (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2014</a>).

Genetic disruption of mammalian-specific CatSper\u03b6 reduces the\u00a0CatSper current in the sperm flagellum and hyperactivated motility, resulting in severe subfertility. We use high speed video microscopy and digital image analysis to determine swimming trajectory and the\u00a0flagellar waveform in detail. Surprisingly, abrogation of CatSper\u03b6 renders the proximal flagellum inflexible but preserves overall motility, thus resulting in restriction of the 3D flagellar envelope, inefficient sperm rheotaxis <i>in vitro</i>, and delayed sperm migration <i>in vivo</i>. Using super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrated that the structurally distinct CatSper Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains along the flagellum (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2014</a>) becomes fragmented in the absence of <i>CatSperz</i>. We demonstrate that IVF failure of <i>CatSperz</i>-null spermatozoa is partially rescued by using ejaculated sperm recovered from the uterus of mated females, explaining the discrepancy between <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> fertilizing ability. Finally, we show that mouse and human spermatozoa have a\u00a0similar macroscopic organization of the CatSper complex."

As the most biochemically complex ion channel known to date, it has not been possible to express functional CatSper channels in heterologous systems. This includes many attempts in many cell types, including simultaneous injection of all 7 <i>CatSper</i> mRNAs into <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes (<i>data not shown</i>). Therefore, we continued to seek potential additional components to more thoroughly understand CatSper channel assembly and trafficking. We identified a mouse homolog of human <i>C1orf101</i> (<i>C1orf101-like</i>, currently <i>Gm7068</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) based on its sequence homology to the C-terminal extracellular domain of CatSper\u03b4 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This testis-specific gene (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) is predicted to encode a single transmembrane (TM) protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). In addition, a small soluble protein encoded by another testis-specific gene, <i>Tex40</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), was found to be associated with the CatSper channel complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In this study, we refer to the <i>C1orf101-like</i> and <i>Tex40</i> genes as <i>CatSpere</i> and <i>CatSperz</i>, respectively (see Molecular Cloning, Materials and methods). Like the other CatSper accessory subunits (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chung et al., 2011</a>), both <i>CatSpere</i> and <i>CatSperz</i> mRNAs express specifically in germ cells and are detected before <i>CatSper1</i> expression during postnatal development (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). Moreover, mouse CatSper \u03b5 and \u03b6 proteins partition into the testis microsome fraction (P) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), complex with CatSper1, and exhibit interdependence with the\u00a0expression of the other CatSper subunits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u20131F</a>). In both human and mouse sperm cells, CatSper \u03b5 and \u03b6 proteins are localized to the principal piece of the tails (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G and H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013G</a>)."

While CatSper \u03b4 and \u03b5 share high C-terminal sequence homology (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), CatSper\u03b4 appears later in evolution (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, CatSper\u03b6 has no conserved domains and, like hyperactivated motility, is only present in mammals (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), leading us to speculate that CatSper\u03b6 is a required evolutionary adaptation to mammalian fertilization. Based on sequence homology and conservation, we anticipated that deletion of CatSper\u03b5 would likely be the same as the existing knockout of other CatSper subunits, but deletion of CatSper\u03b6 might provide new insights into spermatozoan adaptations to changes concomitant with the evolution of mammalian fertilization. To test this idea, we began by generating a <i>CatSperz-</i>null mouse line from <i>Tex40</i> gene targeted ES cell clones. <i>Tex40</i> is a small gene composed of 5 exons that spans only\u00a0~3 kb on chromosome 11 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Deletion of exons 2\u20134 was confirmed in the homozygous null mouse (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

The percentage of motile spermatozoa was not significantly different and most motility parameters of <i>z-</i>null spermatozoa were comparable to those of <i>z-</i>het sperm cells. However, the characteristic increase of lateral head displacement upon capacitation was not observed in <i>z-</i>null spermatozoa (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), suggesting that hyperactivated motility was reduced. Ninety minutes after capacitation, there was a less marked difference in swimming trajectories of <i>z-</i>null spermatozoa compared to <i>z-</i>het spermatozoa, supporting this notion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Further analysis of flagellar amplitude and waveforms of tethered spermatozoa revealed a striking rigidity of <i>z-</i>null spermatozoa from their midpiece to midway down the principal piece (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This phenotype was also observed from hyperactivation-deficient <i>CatSper2-</i>null patients (<a href=\"#bib36\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). After incubation under capacitating conditions for 90 min, we observed that <i>z-</i>null spermatozoa beat only at the very distal end of a flagellum (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Moreover, <i>CatSperz-</i>null spermatozoa remain bent in the anti-hook direction (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ishijima et al., 2002</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). The anti-hook bend predominates as the pro-hook bend (initiated by the CatSper-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang and Suarez, 2011</a>) is dysregulated in <i>CatSperz-</i>null spermatozoa."

Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> has high affinity to calcium-selective pores (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almers et al., 1984</a>), CatSper permeation of monovalents increases when external calcium is removed (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Navarro et al., 2007</a>). In divalent-free (DVF) solutions, wt spermatozoan <i>I<sub>CatSper</sub></i> conducts a large Na<sup>+</sup> current, which is completely absent in mice lacking <i>CatSpers1, 2, 3, 4</i>, or <i>d</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Qi et al., 2007</a>). However, in <i>CatSperz-</i>null spermatozoa, monovalent CatSper current is present but reduced to\u00a0~60% of normal (\u2212426\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050 pA at \u2212100 mV; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) compared to control <i>CatSperz-</i>het spermatozoa (\u2212683\u00a0\u00b1\u00a077 pA at \u2212100 mV; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, in the absence of CatSper\u03b6, the CatSper channel complex is still targeted to the flagellar membrane and forms functional channels. We hypothesize that the reduction in CatSper current reflected decreased protein expression levels."

The ATP-activated cation-nonselective current in the midpiece of murine sperm is mediated by the P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> purinergic receptor (<a href=\"#bib28\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>). In <i>CatSperz-</i>null spermatozoa, <i>I<sub>ATP</sub></i> did not differ substantially from heterozygous spermatozoa (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>), supporting the assumption that there is selective down regulation of CatSper channels. Smaller <i>I<sub>CatSper</sub></i> explains, in part, the attenuated hyperactivated motility, delayed sperm migration, and male subfertility (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u20132E</a>). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation (P-Tyr), a hallmark of sperm capacitation, is potentiated and delocalized in <i>CatSper</i> knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2014</a>) or when Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is pharmacologically blocked (<a href=\"#bib25\">Navarrete et al., 2015</a>). Upon capacitation, P-Tyr was more prominent in <i>CatSperz-</i>null spermatozoa than wt, but to a lesser extent than <i>CatSper1</i>-null spermatozoa (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), consistent with the reduced calcium current. It is, however, also possible that an altered arrangement of the CatSper complex and/or its interaction with target proteins in the linear domains could have contributed to these functional deficits."

We thus measured rheotactic parameters and the rotation rate of <i>CatSperz</i>-null spermatozoa with a particular focus on whether their proximal tail rigidity and subsequent low amplitude lateral movement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) affects sperm movement. In flow-directed capillary tubes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>), we observed that the rheotactic ability of <i>CatSperz</i>-null spermatozoa was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). At all flow rates tested, most motile <i>CatSperz</i>-null spermatozoa were unable reorient to swim against the flow and were swept out of the tube (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In contrast, 85% of motile heterozygous spermatozoa displayed rheotactic behaviors by maintaining their position or swimming upstream for more than 2 s of the 9 s period of recording (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) Working model illustrating the integrity of CatSper Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains and their relation to flagellar envelopes during sperm rotation. In wt spermatozoa, the CatSper channel forms four linear continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains confined to the principal piece of the flagella. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through the CatSper channels potentiates sperm rotation during capacitation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>). With the resulting increased asymmetry and change in wave amplitude, the flagellar envelope is mapped out as a 3-dimensional cone in space, orienting sperm into the flow. Deficits in <i>I<sub>CatSper</sub></i> and loss of the continuity of the linear domains in <i>CatSperz</i>-/- null spermatozoa compromise Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and result in rigidity in the proximal region. The inflexibility of <i>CatSperz</i>-null spermatozoa from midpiece to halfway through the principal piece constrains the flagellar envelope to a narrower, rod like spatial map. The still active distal tail rotation then drives the more static rod-like structure. This causes the sperm to rotate faster but with less torque, thereby inefficiently orienting them into the flow and yielding less force in orthogonal directions needed to push aside the cumulus cells.

We tested the relation of calcium transients to hyperactivated motility in <i>CatSperz</i>-het and null sperm. In <i>z</i>-het spermatozoa, an A23187-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse followed by washout, enables full hyperactivation, characterized by wide lateral displacement with large midpiece <i>\u03b1</i> angle within 30 min (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Videos 9</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">10</a>). However, in <i>z</i>-null sperm, the same treatment improved the flexibility of the proximal flagella, particularly in the principal piece, but the midpiece remained largely inflexible (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Videos 9</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">10</a>).

Cumulus removal did not change the fertilization rate of ZP intact oocytes by <i>CatSperz-</i>null spermatozoa. Furthermore, this rate was only marginally enhanced by destabilization of the ZP by 2 mM glutathione (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Miyata et al., 2015</a>). This indicates that reduced hyperactivated motility alone does not explain the failure of <i>CatSperz-</i>null spermatozoa in IVF. One possibility is that the kinetics of capacitation <i>in vitro</i> is different from that <i>in vivo</i>, resulting from fluctuations in timing or amplitude of known factors (e.g., HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH) or from unknown factors present in seminal and/or female fluids. We then compared IVF rates with ejaculated and epididymal spermatozoa of <i>CatSperz-</i>null mice. When ejaculated spermatozoa flushed from the uterus of the mated females were used in IVF trials, 20% of oocytes incubated with <i>z-</i>null spermatozoa developed into two-cell embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

With four distinct pore-forming gene products (CatSper 1\u20134) and, now, five accessory subunits (\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6), the CatSper channel is the most complex of known ion channels. This may reflect the relatively high evolutionary pressure on spermatozoan evolution (<a href=\"#bib39\">Swanson and Vacquier, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Torgerson et al., 2002</a>), and various adaptations to different modes of fertilization. Like many gamete-specific proteins and the other CatSper proteins reported so far (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cai and Clapham, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chung et al., 2011</a>), mouse and human CatSper \u03b5 and \u03b6 show signs of rapid evolutionary change with only 50% and 45% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. In particular, the sequence regions outside TM segments and the pore loop of CatSper proteins are poorly conserved across species, indicating these regions possibly convey species-specific modulation of flagellar motility (<a href=\"#bib23\">Miller et al., 2015</a>). This is illustrated by striking differences in progesterone-elicited <i>I<sub>CatSper</sub></i> responses in mouse and human (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lishko et al., 2011</a>). Here we have shown that CatSper \u03b5 and \u03b6 are components of the highly organized CatSper complex, that CatSper\u03b6 is required for proper continuity of this complex along the flagellum, and that loss of \u03b6 alters hyperactivation waveforms and reduces fertilizing capacity."

Since their protein expression is strictly interdependent, we speculate that <i>CatSpere</i>-null mice will have the phenotype of <i>CatSper1-4</i>, or <i>d</i>-null mice. In contrast, <i>CatSperz</i> is conserved only in mammals, suggesting that this protein imparts some adaptation, perhaps as a method enabling rheotaxis in the mammalian female reproductive tract."

An intriguing aspect of our observations is that, unlike <i>CatSper1-4</i> and <i>d</i>-null mice, which produce complete infertility, <i>CatSperz</i>-null males exhibit an incomplete loss of fertility. The CatSper current is reduced in <i>CatSperz</i>-null spermatozoa, and may have similar permeation properties (likely dominated by the CatSper1-4 pore subunits), but the effects of <i>CatSperz</i> on channel gating remain to be determined in future studies. This is reminiscent of the non-spermatozoan, voltage-gated Ca<sub>v</sub> channel auxiliary subunits, which are not required for expression but modulate expression levels and gating (<a href=\"#bib5\">Catterall et al., 2005</a>). Most tantalizing is the thinning and disruption of the linear CatSper signaling domains at repeat intervals in the absence of \u03b6. Further detailed examination via mutagenesis experiments has been stymied by our inability to heterologously express functional CatSper channels. New rapid genome editing techniques should enable more mice to be generated that will further the study of CatSper trafficking, subunit interactions, and localized signaling pathways."

In order for CatSper domains to form and function properly, interactions are needed between the CatSper channel complex in the flagellar membrane and the underlying cytoskeletal proteins.

Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that the CatSper channels are distributed on the end of ribs, where they merge with the column (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2014</a>). It seems likely that the\u00a0timing of occurrence and localization of CatSper Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains is coordinated with the assembly of FS proteins along the axoneme. The column appears early in spermiogenesis, forming from the distal tip of the tail along the axoneme, followed by subsequent rib formation in the opposite direction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oko, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Oko and Clermont, 1989</a>). Based on scanning electron micrographs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Danshina et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Miki et al., 2004</a>), we find that the distance between ribs is about 800 nm in mouse spermatozoa.

Here we report that the flagellar envelope is significantly altered in the absence of <i>CatSperz,</i> in part due to the inflexibility of the proximal tail. We previously reported that the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, PP2B-A\u03b3, expresses throughout the tail but localized to the CatSper quadrilateral structures and axoneme (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2014</a>). In <i>CatSper1</i>-null spermatozoa, PP2B-A\u03b3 remains localized primarily to the axoneme but disappears from the quadrilateral structures. Recently, a similar but not identical phenotype (inflexible midpiece, reduced hyperactivated motility, and impaired ZP penetration) was reported in testis-specific calcineurin <i>Ppp3cc-</i>null and <i>Ppp3r2-</i>null spermatozoa (<a href=\"#bib24\">Miyata et al., 2015</a>). Note that the principal piece of both <i>CatSper1-</i>null and <i>Ppp3cc-</i>null spermatozoa are not rigid. The integrity and distribution of CatSper channels in <i>Ppp3cc-</i>null spermatozoa remain to be examined and may clarify midpiece/principal piece disparities. In any case, inflexibility in the proximal regions of flagellum results in a flagellar envelope approximated as a rod with a distal propeller. The sperm can rotate faster but the smaller lateral deviation reduces torque. This limits the sperm\u2019s ability to orient into the flow, as well as penetrate the cumulus and ZP."

These independent studies were interpreted to mean that the initial priming by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, perhaps above a certain threshold, is essential for sperm function.

But it is important to point out that alterations in the structure should also result in changes in mechanical properties, movement of the flagellum, distribution of entering calcium, and downstream kinase activity and the motor elements they regulate. This complexity is illustrated <i>in vivo</i> sperm swimming trajectories, which are modulated by switching between pro- and anti-hook beating patterns. In the absence of CatSper\u03b6, anti-hook beating predominates.

Sperm swimming 3\u20135 mm from the rim were recorded after a 10 min preincubation period that allowed spontaneous dissociation of sperm clumps. To inhibit convective flow, 1 ml of medium was overlaid by 1 ml of mineral oil and covered by a heated glass lid (Bioptechs). Sperm motility at 37\u00b0C was videotaped at 100 fps. Images (HC Image software, Hamamatsu Photonics) were analyzed for swimming trajectory from a 1 s playback movie at 1/5 speed, by head tracing via Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA; <a href=\"http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/casa.html\">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/casa.html</a>). To track swimming trajectory in viscous medium, the sperm motility was videotaped at 50 fps. The images were analyzed using Fiji software (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>) by assembling overlays of the flagellar traces generated by hyperstacking binary images of 20 frames of 2 s movies coded in a gray intensity scale."

The CatSper channel has been known for &gt;10 years now to form the most important Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in sperm tail and is absolutely required for male fertility. However, the complex has been resistant to detailed functional studies by biophysicists because it somehow doesn't form \"functional\" channel in heterologous expression system. One explanation is that we don't have all the subunits in the complex yet despite the 4 pore-forming (CatSper1-4) and 3 \"auxiliary\" (CatSper\u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) reported thus far. The discovery of another two subunits described in this paper is a major step forward. Intriguingly, CatSper\u03b6 doesn't have a transmembrane-spanning domain and is yet membrane-anchored (perhaps in a fashion similar to the \u03b2 subunits of CaVs). The authors show that during evolution, CatSper\u03b6 was \"added\" to the complex in mammals and it presumably reflects an adaptation to the changes of environment of the site of fertilization in the female reproductive tract. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the new proteins are associated with CatSper (using biochemical methods), colocalized within the CatSper nanodomains (with STROM and conventional immuno-staining) and, for CatSper\u03b6, are required for the continuity of the CatSper structural stripes along the sperm tail. Finally, the authors demonstrate that CatSper\u03b6 is required for normal sperm hyperactivated motility, egg penetration and male fertility (sub-fertile in the KO)."

We now also reference work done by Navarette and colleagues\u2014their work recently showed that motility and fertility could be rescued in CatSper KO spermatozoa via A23187 pulsed treatment to induce calcium transients (Navarrette et al., 2016). This directly addresses the question as it demonstrates that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients resulting from A23187 pulsed treatment are sufficient to induce sperm hyperactivation in vitro, bypassing not only the pore but also the spatial arrangement of the CatSper channel complex. We also performed additional motility experiments in varying concentrations of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or with A23187 pulses to determine whether these conditions rescue the observed phenotype of CatSper\u03b6-KO sperm. These results are now added to the main text in the Results and Discussion sections."
