Here we show that <i>MYBL2</i>, a gene within the 20q CDR, is expressed at sharply reduced levels in CD34+ cells from most MDS cases (65%; n = 26), whether or not they harbor 20q abnormalities. In a murine competitive reconstitution model, <i>Mybl2</i> knockdown by RNAi to 20\u201330% of normal levels in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors resulted in clonal dominance of these \u2018sub-haploinsufficient\u2019 cells, which was reflected in all blood cell lineages. By 6 months post-transplantation, the reconstituted mice had developed a clonal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder originating from the cells with aberrantly reduced <i>Mybl2</i> expression. We conclude that downregulation of <i>MYBL2</i> activity below levels predicted by classical haploinsufficiency underlies the clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in a large fraction of human myeloid malignancies."

Here we show that <i>MYBL2</i>, a gene within the 20q CDR, is expressed at sharply reduced levels in CD34+ cells from most MDS cases (65%; n = 26), whether or not they harbor 20q abnormalities. In a murine competitive reconstitution model, <i>Mybl2</i> knockdown by RNAi to 20\u201330% of normal levels in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors resulted in clonal dominance of these \u2018sub-haploinsufficient\u2019 cells, which was reflected in all blood cell lineages. By 6 months post-transplantation, the reconstituted mice had developed a clonal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder originating from the cells with aberrantly reduced <i>Mybl2</i> expression. We conclude that downregulation of <i>MYBL2</i> activity below levels predicted by classical haploinsufficiency underlies the clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in a large fraction of human myeloid malignancies."

The gene, which is called <i>MYBL2</i>, encodes a transcription factor that helps to control the cell division cycle. Myeloid malignancy patients lacking one copy of this gene showed levels of <i>MYBL2</i> expression that were less than 50% of those in healthy individuals. This suggests that additional mechanisms must be acting to reduce expression of their remaining copy of the gene. Surprisingly, <i>MYBL2</i> levels were also reduced in myeloid malignancy patients who possessed two intact copies of chromosome 20, indicating that loss of a single copy represents only one mechanism to reduce <i>MYBL2</i> expression, i.e., the \u2018tip-of-the-iceberg\u2019. Hence, this finding reveals a more general role for <i>MYBL2</i> as it indicates that more patients are likely to be affected by altered expression of this gene."

Moreover, injection of modified cells from these animals into healthy mice also induced symptoms in the recipients. The modified cells are able to expand more robustly than normal cells, and this dominance induced by downregulation of the tumor suppressor increases the risk of malignancy."

Although the silencing of tumor suppressor genes by chromosomal deletions, point mutations, or other mechanisms is an acknowledged factor in myeloid cell transformation, the specific involvement of gene dosage is not well understood. In broadest terms, single-copy loss of a suppressor gene can be sufficient to modify gene function and promote tumorigenesis (classical haploinsufficiency), while in other tumors, the loss of two alleles is required (two-hit paradigm of Knudson) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Knudson, 1971</a>). Recent evidence indicates that more subtle reductions in suppressor gene function may contribute importantly to myeloid malignancy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Rosenbauer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Liu et al., 2007</a>), leading to the need for faithful animal models to establish that such changes are truly involved in tumorigenesis."

Notably, only heterozygous deletions have been found in studies of myeloid malignancies with loss of chromosome 20q, without any evidence of homozygous deletion or mutations of a gene within the affected region (<a href=\"#bib11\">Heinrichs et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Huh et al., 2010</a>). These findings implicate a gene within the 20q CDR that is essential for cell viability, but whose tumor suppressor function is strongly dose-dependent and does not follow the classical Knudson model (<a href=\"#bib13\">Knudson, 1971</a>), which predicts biallelic gene inactivation. Instead, monoallelic loss, with or without additional epigenetic or microRNA (miRNA)-mediated downregulation of the remaining allele, may reduce gene expression levels sufficiently to promote myeloid cell transformation. Thus, we sought to identify candidate tumor suppressor genes within the 20q CDR on the basis of their reduced expression in malignant myeloid progenitor cells, as we have reported previously for <i>CTNNA1</i> in myeloid malignancies with deletions of chromosome 5q (<a href=\"#bib16\">Liu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ye et al., 2009</a>)."

Reductions of <i>MYBL2</i> dosage to levels below those commensurate with single-copy loss conferred a competitive advantage to hematopoietic progenitor cells in both primary and secondary transplantation assays and were associated with histopathologic changes typical of myeloid neoplasia. These findings implicate aberrantly low levels of <i>MYBL2</i> expression as a central mechanism in the development of clonal dominance in MDS and other myeloid malignancies."

We found that <i>MYBL2</i>, which resides near the center of this region (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), was among the top-scoring genes downregulated in MDS cells compared to normal CD34+ controls. <i>MYBL2</i> encodes a highly conserved transcription factor that acts as a major component of the dREAM complex, which controls the G2-to-M phase transition within the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib14\">Korenjak et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lewis et al., 2004</a>). The mean expression level of <i>MYBL2</i> (39%) was less than that of normal CD34+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that mechanisms beyond the deletion of one allele might affect the remaining allele. Thus, on the assumption that some MDS cases with a normal karyotype might also have reduced expression of a gene or genes within the 20q CDR, we undertook an expression analysis of CD34+ cells from 18 MDS cases with a normal karyotype and the eight cases with a 20q aberration (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), compared to CD34+ cells from four normal bone marrow samples. <i>MYBL2</i> was the top-scoring gene among 108 differentially expressed genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Further analysis showed that in 17 (65%) of 26 MDS patients (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), <i>MYBL2</i> expression levels in CD34+ cells were reduced to \u226445% of normal CD34+ cells levels (mean 32.8%). These microarray data were confirmed by QRT-PCR analysis of <i>MYBL2</i> expression levels in 10 MDS cases and eight normal CD34+ bone marrow samples, including four additional normal control CD34+ samples that were not part of the original microarray analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Importantly, <i>MYBL2</i> levels measured by QRT-PCR in MDS samples were highly correlated (r = 0.966) with those determined by microarray analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Hence, <i>MYBL2</i> appears to be expressed at reduced levels in nearly two-thirds of MDS cases, including those with a normal karyotype, suggesting that it functions as a dose-dependent tumor suppressor gene."

To model gene dose insufficiency by RNA interference (RNAi), we used a set of eight shRNA-expression vectors in the MDS/AML cell line SKM1, which reduced <i>MYBL2</i> expression to 5\u201330% of the endogenous <i>MYBL2</i> levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), approximating the endogenous levels we had identified in CD34+ cells from patients (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To identify the genes most highly correlated with decreased <i>MYBL2</i> expression, we introduced our shRNA-expression vectors into normal primary human CD34+ cells and measured gene expression at 48 hr post-transduction.

Both mutations, an amino acid substitution and a nonsense mutation, were located within the C-terminus. To test whether these mutations inactivate the MYBL2 protein, we replaced endogenous <i>MYBL2</i> in SKM1 cells with <i>MYBL2</i> carrying one of the mutations, using a knockdown/rescue approach. SKM1 cells died upon complete knockdown of <i>MYBL2</i> with an shRNA targeting the 3\u2032UTR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This phenotype was rescued by re-expression of the wild-type <i>MYBL2</i> cDNA and the cDNA from patient 28 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), but not by re-expression of the mutated, truncated <i>MYBL2</i> cDNA of patient 27, which failed to restore the viability of the SKM1 cells. Thus, we have documented a somatically acquired gene-specific inactivating mutation that targets <i>MYBL2</i> in one case of MDS. This specific case is highly informative because the inactivating mutation targets <i>MYBL2</i> directly, and not an adjacent gene on 20q."

A potential candidate is aberrant DNA methylation, especially in view of the 921 base-pair CpG island that spans the proximal promoter and the first exon of the <i>MYBL2</i> gene. However, analysis of this site using bone marrow cell DNA from 30 MDS patients failed to detect any methylated cytosines, indicating that DNA methylation is not a frequent mechanism for <i>MYBL2</i> downregulation in MDS (JP Issa, personal communication, 2012). This finding is supported by a recently published study that did not identify methylation affecting the <i>MYBL2</i> gene in cells from 83 MDS cases (<a href=\"#bib7\">Del Rey et al., 2012</a>)."

We pursued this notion in a subset of patient samples (seven with low <i>MYBL2</i> expression and two with normal <i>MYBL2</i> expression, together with three controls) by analyzing the expression levels of <i>mir-29a</i> and <i>mir-30e</i>. Both of these miRNAs target <i>MYBL2</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Han et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Martinez et al., 2011</a>), with aberrant expression of <i>mir-29a</i> leading to clonal dominance and acute myeloid leukemia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Han et al., 2010</a>). Our results show upregulation of either <i>mir-29a</i> or <i>mir-30e</i> in three cases with <i>MYBL2</i> downregulation, but not in controls or cases with normal <i>MYBL2</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Thus, using five independent, specific shRNA-expressing vectors to target <i>Mybl2</i> in primitive hematopoietic cells, we established a competitive reconstitution assay in mice. These vectors downregulated <i>Mybl2</i> expression to levels that ranged from 13% (M1) to 33% (M5) of those expressed by control shRNA-expressing vectors in 32D cells, a murine myeloid cell line (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). After transducing Lin<sup>\u2212</sup> mononuclear bone marrow cells in separate vials with these five vectors, which coexpressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP), or with two different control shRNA vectors coexpressing a red fluorescent protein (RFP) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Strack et al., 2008</a>), we washed the cells, pooled the five <i>Mybl2</i>-specific shRNA knockdown cell aliquots and the two control aliquots, and transplanted equal numbers of these two cell pools into lethally irradiated mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). A second group of mice were transplanted with pooled GFP+ and RFP+ cells expressing control shRNAs only, generating control/GFP vs control/RFP recipients (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Analysis of GFP and RFP levels in peripheral blood at 12 weeks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) showed a strikingly higher median frequency of GFP+ vs RFP+ cells in the peripheral blood of the mice reconstituted with GFP+/<i>Mybl2</i>-shRNA vs RFP+/control shRNA (30.9% vs 2.6%, p&lt;0.0001). By contrast, in mice injected with control/GFP vs control/RFP cells, the median frequencies of both RFP- and GFP-expressing cells were low (1.5% and 3.4%; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

The picture beginning to emerge from these investigations is that a broad array of molecular changes have the potential to drive the biology and clinical phenotypes of MDS in unique ways. Yet, the disease remains very heterogeneous and none of the molecular lesions that have been convincingly linked to MDS pathogenesis affect more than a fourth of cases overall, with a prevalence of 1\u201315% being much more common (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bejar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Shih et al., 2012</a>)."

This result is somewhat surprising given that <i>MYBL2</i> has been implicated as a gene that is typically overexpressed (rather than downregulated) in several types of cancer and whose elevated expression correlates with a poor prognosis in human breast cancer and other malignancies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amatschek et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Paik et al., 2004</a>). However, no direct evidence demonstrating oncogenic activity by overexpressed <i>MYBL2</i> has been reported to date. High levels of expression of this transcription factor in other tumor types may reflect the greater proliferative rate of the tumor cell population compared to resting cells, so that the apparently levels of high <i>MYBL2</i> activity may be a consequence rather than a cause of malignant transformation. By contrast, the proliferative fraction of cells in myeloid neoplasia is generally quite low."

The persistence of clonal dominance in recipient mice for more than 6 months after bone marrow cell transplantation, and in recipients of secondary transplants, indicates that the affected multipotent hematopoietic cells have both self-renewal and long-term repopulating ability (<a href=\"#bib18\">Morrison and Weissman, 1994</a>). Hence, our finding establishes MYBL2 as a key tumor suppressor gene of the 20q CDR affected in human MDS and MPD. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that haploinsufficiency for other genes within the 20q CDR cooperates with aberrantly low expression of <i>MYBL2</i> to move the cells toward malignant transformation, as has been shown for the CDR associated with the 5q-syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of the gene <i>RPS14</i> as well as loss of expression of an miRNA (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ebert et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barlow et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Starczynowski et al., 2010</a>) are critical steps in MDS pathogenesis."

Indeed, low levels of <i>MYBL2</i> were apparent in 10 (56%) of 18 of our normal-karyotype MDS cases, and 38% of those reported by Pellagatti et al. (<a href=\"#bib20\">Pellagatti et al., 2010</a>). We were unable to implicate aberrant methylation of the <i>MYBL2</i> genomic locus as an additional mechanism of gene-dosage reduction; instead, we found elevated expression levels of <i>mir-29a</i> and <i>mir-30e</i>, which are known to target <i>MYBL2</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Martinez et al., 2011</a>), in CD34+ cells from patients with MDS and low levels of <i>MYBL2</i> expression. In addition, others have shown that overexpression of <i>mir-29a</i> in murine bone marrow cells leads to acute myeloid leukemia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Han et al., 2010</a>). Combined with our results, this observation suggests that mir-29a may be oncogenic, at least in part, because it targets <i>Mybl2</i> transcripts. Finally, we identified a case with heterozygous missense mutation in <i>MYBL2</i> that led to the loss of gene function, analogous to the effect of monoallelic gene deletion. Thus, our results indicate that the MYBL2 transcription factor gene is targeted by diverse molecular events in MDS, including not only deletion within the 20q chromosomal region, but also heterozygous loss-of-function mutations and the repression of gene expression by dysregulated miRNAs."

(<a href=\"#bib6\">Clarke et al., 2012</a>) have also described an association between <i>MYBL2</i> expression levels and the occurrence of hematologic disorders, including MDS, in aged <i>Mybl2</i> haploinsufficient mice. These authors were able to show that haploinsufficiency for the <i>Mybl2</i> gene increases susceptibility to age-related myeloid neoplasia. Our data indicate that more pronounced gene dosage reduction of <i>Mybl2</i> might be even more advantageous for clonal dominance. Although our findings do not rule out a causal role for straight-forward haploinsufficiency in myeloid malignancies, they strongly suggest that the oncogenic effects of reduced <i>MYBL2</i> dosage are more pronounced as the dosage level falls to near 30% of normal, in keeping with the continuum model of tumor suppression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berger et al., 2011</a>). We would also stress that in the range of <i>MYBL2</i> dosage reductions in this study were modeled based on those found in CD34+ cells from MDS clinical samples, in which the reductions of <i>MYBL2</i> gene dosage were predominately in the range of 20\u201330% of normal levels, and thus were considerably lower than the 50% predicted by classical haploinsufficiency. Importantly, expression levels lower than 20% appear incompatible with cell growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), consistent with the known function of MYBL2 as a key regulator of G2-to-M transition and the fact that biallelic inactivation of this gene causes early embryonic lethality in the mouse due to a block in inner cell mass formation during embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib28\">Tanaka et al., 1999</a>)."
