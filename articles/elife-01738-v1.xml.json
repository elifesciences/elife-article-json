Despite the survival of Hooke\u2019s inapt analogy, the cell is not a static monastery room. The plasma membrane that surrounds the cell can, for example, be absorbed by the cell in a process called endocytosis. A number of different endocytosis pathways have been identified by researchers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</a>), and with more than 80,000 papers published on the subject, it is surprising that is something left to be categorized. Now, however, in a pair of papers in <i>eLife</i>, Donald Hilgemann of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and co-workers describe the mechanisms responsible for a form of endocytosis in which about half of the plasma membrane is absorbed by the cell (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). This form of endocytosis, which is called massive endocytosis, was discovered at UTSW a few years ago (<a href=\"#bib2\">Fine et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Hilgemann and Fine, 2011</a>)."

The walls of animal cells are downright thin, comprised of lipid bilayers only 40 \u00c5 across, and they form all manner of shapes along energetically defined contours. Endocytosis requires energy, and the creation of a closed spherical vesicle from a flat bilayer takes an estimated 200\u2013250 kcal per mole of vesicle (<a href=\"#bib3\">Helfrich, 1973</a>). The most well-established form of endocytosis involves a scaffold protein called clathrin coupling to the membrane, with the energy needed to drive the process coming from ATP (<a href=\"#bib7\">Kirchhausen, 2012</a>), but a number of other mechanisms have been discovered. Endocytosis is studied by the many forms of light microscopy, and in greater detail by electron microscopy, but no single method directly assays all aspects of the process as it occurs in native membranes."

Now, in a refreshingly original study, Donald Hilgemann and co-workers at UTSW and Cornell\u2014Michael Fine, Maurine Linder, Benjamin Jennings and Mei-Jung Lin\u2014have used a combination of capacitance recording and other techniques to study the mechanism responsible for the massive endocytosis that occurs after a sudden influx of calcium ions into cells called BHK fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>)."

Experimentally, this is accomplished by various mitochondrial insults, such as increasing the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell or poisoning the electron transport chain. Inhibition of calcium uptake blocks massive endocytosis."

In short, mitochondrial damage and the increased availability of substrates for DHHC5 unleash the proteins that initiate endocytosis. One such protein, flotillin, was previously shown to be palmitoylated by DHHC5 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Li et al., 2012</a>). However, proteins are not the only participants in massive endocytosis: cholesterol and PIP<sub>2</sub> (a phospholipid i.e., found in the cell membrane) can also induce massive endocytosis minutes after the sudden increase in the concentration of calcium ions has subsided (<a href=\"#bib8\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>)."

Reoxygenation after anoxia, such as occurs during a heart attack, results in massive endocytosis. Using protocols that raise the levels of calcium or acyl-CoA inside the cell, the UTSW team infers that opening the permeability transition pores, activating protein kinase C, and triggering a calcium-dependent mechanism can all induce massive endocytosis. However, massive endocytosis is strongly inhibited in mice lacking DHHC5, resulting in significantly preserved right ventricular contractile function. Finally, Lin et al. show that a diverse range of protein targets undergo palmitoylation (that is, attachment of the fatty acid group, palmitoyl) after reperfusion injury. This most consequential finding of a reduction of massive endocytosis and the preservation of contractility in DHHC5 knockout mice suggests a potential new approach to ameliorate the problem of reperfusion injury."

The fluorescence is bright when the green protein is on the external membrane of the cell, where the pH is 7.8 (top left, 1), but it gradually declines during endocytosis as the NCX1 is progressively internalized into vesicles, where the pH is 6.5 (middle, 2). The fluorescence can be increased again by using ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) to increase the pH inside the vesicles (right, 3).

This sort of large cytoplasmic calcium entry is widely associated with fast massive exocytosis, presumably required for the resealing of membranes (<a href=\"#bib11\">McNeil and Steinhardt, 2003</a>). The link between initial exocytosis followed by endocytosis via vesicles larger than coated vesicles was described in pituitary cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Thomas et al., 1994</a>). As in those cells, exocytosis in fibroblasts occurs in the first few seconds after a large calcium increase in fibroblasts and is followed by massive endocytosis, but the initial exocytosis is not observed in cardiac muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). This suggests that these cells lack the pool of vesicles used in the fast exocytosis phase. The identities of these exocytotic or endocytic vesicles are not established."
