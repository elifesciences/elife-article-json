In <i>Drosophila</i>, leg motoneurons are organized as a myotopic map, where their dendritic domains represent the muscle field. Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying development of aspects of this myotopic map, required for walking. A behavioral screen identified roles for Semaphorins (Sema) and Plexins (Plex) in walking behavior. Deciphering this phenotype, we show that PlexA/Sema1a mediates motoneuron axon branching in ways that differ in the proximal femur and distal tibia, based on motoneuronal birth order. Importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; PlexB/Sema2a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons. These findings indicate that communication within motoneurons and between glia and motoneurons, mediated by the combined action of different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems, are required for the formation of a functional myotopic map."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, leg motoneurons are organized as a myotopic map, where their dendritic domains represent the muscle field. Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying development of aspects of this myotopic map, required for walking. A behavioral screen identified roles for Semaphorins (Sema) and Plexins (Plex) in walking behavior. Deciphering this phenotype, we show that PlexA/Sema1a mediates motoneuron axon branching in ways that differ in the proximal femur and distal tibia, based on motoneuronal birth order. Importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; PlexB/Sema2a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons. These findings indicate that communication within motoneurons and between glia and motoneurons, mediated by the combined action of different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems, are required for the formation of a functional myotopic map."

While one end of a motor neuron stimulates the muscle it is connected to, the other end receives signals from nerves in the spinal cord that relay messages about movement from the brain. Motor neuron connections in the spinal cord, or its equivalent in insects, the ventral nerve cord, are organized into an arrangement known as a myotopic map, which reflects the anatomical arrangement of the muscles in the body. Much remains to be learnt about how these maps form."

They represent the final common path for convergence of processed information from motor control circuitry in the central nervous system and from sensory feedback circuitry in the periphery (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sherrington, 1906</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pearson, 1993</a>). Moreover, as final common output channels, they represent exclusive control elements of muscle effectors that mediate behavioral action. For their correct function, motoneurons must acquire specific cellular architectures during development such that their input domains, usually manifest as dendrites, receive connections from appropriate pre-motor neurons, and their axonal output domains make connections to correct target muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jessell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Harris et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arber, 2012</a>). How motoneuron development is orchestrated to establish the appropriate and specific dendritic input and axonal output connectivity needed for behavioral action is a central and still important question in neural development (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jefferis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dasen and Jessell, 2009</a>)."

In this system, the developmental processes involved in generating appropriate dendritic and axonal morphology of different types of larval (<a href=\"#bib22\">Landgraf and Thor, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mauss et al., 2009</a>) and adult motoneurons have been studied extensively. For example, the specific architecture of the motoneurons that innervate the adult leg has been shown to depend on their lineage and birth order, in that the majority of the leg motoneurons are postembryonic lineal descendants of neuroblast 15, and these motoneurons manifest a birth order-specific neuroanatomical organization (<a href=\"#bib41\">Truman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brierley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brierley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baek and Mann, 2009</a>). In this lineage, early born motoneurons project their axons to proximal muscles in the leg segments and have dendritic arborization that extends toward the thoracic ganglion neuropile midline, whereas late born motoneurons innervate distal muscles in the leg segments and have dendritic arbors that are restricted to the lateral regions of the ganglionic neuropile. Thus, in terms of their central and peripheral nervous architecture, these leg motoneurons form a myotopic map (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brierley et al., 2009</a>). Although this myotopic map-specific targeting of leg motoneuron dendrites has been shown to require midline signaling through the Slit/Roundabout and Netrin/Frazzled signaling systems (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brierley et al., 2009</a>), the mechanism underlying compartmentalization in terms of birth order and distinct axonal and dendritic targeting is poorly understood. In order to understand the guidance cues responsible for leg motoneuron development, we performed a behavioral screen for locomotor defects caused by targeting RNAi in motoneurons and identified Plexin and Semaphorin as candidates. In this study, we have investigated the development of specific axonal projections and dendritic arbors in leg motoneurons required for walking in adult <i>Drosophila</i> mediated by Plexin/Semaphorin signaling system and, in doing so, discover novel cellular and molecular roles."

Semaphorins and Plexins have evolutionarily conserved guidance function during nervous system development, and both transmembrane and secreted Semaphorin ligands can mediate a diverse set of repulsive and attractive guidance functions. In <i>Drosophila</i>, there are two Plexin receptors and five Semaphorin ligands. PlexinA (PlexA) strongly binds the Sema1a and Sema1b ligands while as Plexin B (PlexB) binds to Sema2a and Sema2b (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bates and Whitington, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ayoob et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lattemann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sweeney et al., 2011</a>) (Sema5c is not expressed in the CNS).

Based on this, we screen for corresponding neuroanatomical defects in the affected leg motoneurons. We find that motoneuron-specific knockdown of Sema1a or PlexA causes defective axonal defasciculation and targeting in motoneurons that innervate leg muscles and these phenotypes differ in proximal femur and distal tibia. In the femur, there occurs a reduction in axon branching and defasciculation of motoneurons, whereas an increase in axon branching of motoneurons occurs in the tibia. This suggests a compartment-specific activity of Plexin/ Semaphorin signaling system."

In contrast, we find the role of glia in positioning dendrites of late born motoneurons that innervate distal muscles of tibia and occupy lateral regions of the thoracic neuropil in adult <i>Drosophila</i>. We demonstrate that motoneuron-specific knockdown of PlexB or knockdown of Sema2a secreted from glial cells results in a shift of dendritic arborization toward the ganglionic midline in late born leg motoneurons.

The absence of locomotor defects in our motoneuron-targeted Sema2a knockdown experiments (see above) suggests that Sema2a might not act in an autonomous manner on leg motoneuron development. Indeed, motoneuron-specific knockdown of Sema2a using the OK371-Gal4 driver did not result in peripheral axon projection defects in leg motoneurons (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that Sema2a might act on leg motoneurons in a non-cell autonomous manner, we first compared the expression pattern of Sema1a and Sema2a in the thoracic ganglia during postembryonic development using immunolabeling."

However, Sema1a and Sema2a expression levels are significantly different at the ganglionic midline. Thus, whereas Sema1a expression decreases toward the midline and has its lowest level of expression there, Sema2a expression is highest at/and near midline where a peak in its expression level is manifest (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This high level of expression in and around midline cells, many of which are glial in nature, suggests that Sema2a ligand secreted from these cells could affect leg motoneuron development within the thoracic ganglia and hence, influence the pattern of dendrite outgrowth in leg motoneurons in a non-cell autonomous manner."

Since immunolabeling studies showed that Sema2a expression in the neuropile is most prominent in/and near midline (glial) cells (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), we carried out a targeted knockdown of Sema2a in glial/midline cells using either the glial-specific Repo-Gal4 driver or the midline-specific Slit-Gal4 driver."

During this process, multiple guidance cues act to ensure that the motoneurons establish their complex innervation patterns with high precision (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Raper and Mason, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</a>). As motoneurons navigate into the periphery, they often initially fasciculate with each other to form nerve branches and, once they reach their general target regions, defasciculate and exit their nerve branches to innervate specific muscles. Repulsive Semaphorin signaling through Plexin receptors has been implicated in this process in vertebrates and invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pasterkamp et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2012</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Plexin/Semaphorin signaling has been studied in the development of the embryonically generated motoneurons that innervate the larval body wall (<a href=\"#bib44\">Winberg et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ayoob et al., 2006</a>). Sema1a acting through PlexA has been shown to be important for the regulation of motoneuron axon defasciculation through axon-axon repulsion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Winberg et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">2000</a>). Similarly, Sema2a acting through PlexB is required for correct motoneuron axon defasciculation, but also has additional functions in motoneuron axon navigation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matthes et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ayoob et al., 2006</a>) implying that PlexA/Sema1a and PlexB/Sema2a have both shared and distinct function in motor axon guidance."

Targeted knockdown of PlexA or Sema1a in leg motoneurons results in prominent defasciculation and targeting defects of their axons in the periphery. Interestingly, different types of defects are seen in the innervation of proximal versus distal leg muscles. In the innervation of the proximal femur muscles, PlexA/Sema1a knockdown results in phenotypes indicative of defective axon defasciculation and decreased branching. In contrast, in the innervation of the distal tibia muscles, PlexA/Sema1a knockdown results in phenotypes indicative of increased axonal branching. Thus, both decrease and increase of motor axon branching can result if PlexA/Sema1a action in leg motoneurons is impaired. At the cellular level, both these phenotypes may be due to\u00a0defects in early\u00a0born femur motoneurons which manifest a loss of appropriate proximal femoral innervation and gain tibial innervation. In addition, increased arborization of targeted late-born tibial motoneurons in the distal tibia is also likely to contribute to the observed phenotypes. These findings suggest that\u00a0the same Plexin/Semaphorin signaling system might have multiple roles in motor axon guidance. Since these different effects appear to be motoneuron-specific, they may be linked to motoneuron birth-order."

In all cases, the motoneurons that manifest these peripheral axonal defasciculation and targeting defects are the only cells in the leg that have impaired levels of PlexA/Sema1a. In this respect, the requirement of both PlexA and Sema1 for correct axonal targeting is autonomous to leg motoneurons. This suggests that PlexA/Sema1a signaling might be at the level of axon-axon interactions. A role of Plexin/Semaphorin signaling in axon-axon interactions has been documented in the developing visual and olfactory systems of <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sweeney et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hsieh et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively, cis-interactions between PlexA and Sema1a within the affected motoneuron axons might also be involved. In murine models, cis- interactions between Sema6A and PlexA4 have been shown to modulate the repulsive response to Sema6A in sympathetic and sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Haklai-Topper et al., 2010</a>). While our experiments document an autonomous requirement of PlexA/Sema1a within the ensemble of leg motoneurons, they do not rule out the existence of PlexA/Sema1a signaling between outgrowing motor axons and their target muscles in the leg. Thus, it will be important to study both the expression and function of Plexin/Semaphorin signaling in the developing leg muscles."

                                "text": "During development, motoneurons must not only project their axons to the appropriate postsynaptic target muscles, they must also ensure that their dendrites, as major input sites, are positioned correctly in the neuropile in order to receive the appropriate presynaptic drive from pre-motor interneurons and sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Parrish et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Harris et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arber, 2012</a>). Although the mechanisms that control this type of targeted dendritogenesis are poorly understood, recent work on embryonic and adult-specific leg motoneurons in <i>Drosophila</i> indicate that their dendrites are organized topographically as myotopic maps that reflect their innervation pattern in the periphery (<a href=\"#bib21\">Landgraf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brierley et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baek and Mann, 2009</a>)."

                                "text": "For leg motoneurons, the majority of which are generated post-embryonically in a single neuroblast lineage, a birth-order dependent pattern of dendritic targeting and of peripheral innervation has been documented (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brierley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">2012</a>). Thus, early-born motoneurons, which innervate proximal muscle groups, position their dendrites in medial and lateral neuropile, while late-born motoneurons, which innervate distal muscle groups, elaborate their dendrites in the lateral neuropile only, and intermediate-born motoneurons target their dendrites to intermediate neuropile positions. Irrespective of their birth-order, all leg motoneurons initiate dendritogenesis synchronously and form their dendritic arbors in a targeted manner by growing into their appropriate area of innervation. Leg motoneuron dendrites attain their final architecture through targeted dendritogenesis. Apart from the intrinsic signaling cues, extrinsic cues could be implicated in this process. Although glia are known to secrete cues and neurotropic factors for axonal morphogenesis and survival (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jacobs, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Martin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zlatic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kl\u00e4mbt et al., 1991</a>), their role in regulation of dendritic morphology is relatively unexplored. While recent findings in vertebrates and invertebrates suggest that glia could play a role in dendritogenesis, the mechanism underlying these effects is not known (<a href=\"#bib34\">Procko and Shaham, 2010</a>). Midline glia extend gliopodia during axonogenesis, and reducing their numbers also leads to the shift in neuropil during embryonic nervous system development in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vasenkova et al., 2006</a>) suggesting that these could also play a role in dendritogenesis. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in dendritic development of leg motoneurons has focused on the role of Slit/Roundabout and the Netrin/Frazzled (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brierley et al., 2009</a>) signaling systems in controlling the precise targeting of motoneuron dendrites along the medio-lateral axis of the ganglionic neuropile. While Slit/Netrin could be derived from midline glia, the role of other midline cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kearney et al., 2004</a>) has not been ruled out. In this context, the substantially broader expression pattern of Sema2a, compared to that of Slit (which is restricted to the midline) is pertinent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Dendritic targeting in larval motoneurons, which are of embryonic in origin is independent of glial differentiation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Landgraf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Landgraf and Thor, 2006</a>). Our investigation of dendritic targeting of leg motoneurons in adult <i>Drosophila</i> provides further insight into the role of glia in the control of dendritogenesis. Moreover, they identify PlexB/Sema2a as additional signaling system that mediates this control. Our data are in accordance with a model in which Sema2a is secreted from midline and other glial cells and acts through the PlexB receptor to restrict dendrites of late-born motoneurons to appropriate lateral neuropile domains. Loss of PlexB in these motoneurons as well as loss of Sema2a from glial cells, as seen by using both Repo-Gal4 and Slit-Gal4 drivers, results in a medial shift in dendritic arbors together with the mis-projection of dendrites toward the midline. As a result, the affected dendrites of late-born neurons acquire the topographic morphology of normal early-born neurons in the ganglionic neuropile. Since cells at/and near the ganglionic midline express high levels of Sema2a, and since targeted knockdown of Sema 2a specifically in glial cells using Repo-Gal4 results in the mis-positioning of late-born motoneuron dendrites, we postulate that glial cells provide the secreted Sema2a, which acts on dendrite targeting in late-born motoneurons. Thus, while the requirement of PlexB for dendrite targeting in late-born motoneurons is cell autonomous, the requirement of Sema2a is non-cell autonomous and presumably is provided through secretion from glial cells. We also observe a dorso-ventral gradient of Sema1a and Sema2a (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests a role in dorso-ventral patterning as well, an aspect which we have not examined."

PlexB/Sema2a is required\u00a0for correct central dendrite targeting, and while this requirement is motoneuron-specific for PlexB, the requirement for Sema2a in motoneurons is non-cell autonomous and likely involves glial cells.

Optical sections were collected at 1 micron interval and imported into NIH Image J (<a href=\"http://rsb.info.nih.gov.nih-image/\">http://rsb.info.nih.gov.nih-image/</a>). For processing dendritic images, sensory axons arbors were removed using Lasso tool if required. The maximum z-projections were then imported into Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA) and minor adjustments were made to the brightness and contrast when required. To view axonal arborization of the motoneurons, we directly imaged GFP labeled motoneurons through the body wall and leg of adult flies. For leg images, auto-fluorescence from the cuticle that marked the outline was removed from each optical section using Lasso tool. The 3D reconstructions were generated using Amira (Visage Imaging, Berlin, Germany). To quantify the distribution of the Sema 1a and Sema2a along the medio-lateral axis of the neuropil, we used the plot profile tool in ImageJ. Analysis was performed as described in <a href=\"#bib6\">Brierley et al., 2009</a>."

In brief, Syed et al. identified a role for Sema/Plexin signaling in adult <i>Drosophila</i> motorneuron (MN) development by RNAi screening and behavioral gait analysis. Sema1/PlexA control innervation of proximal and distal leg muscles in a cell autonomous manner, Sema2a is likely secreted by midline glia and specifically affects late born MNs via neuronal PlexB. The authors show that Sema2a is highly expressed in the midline, thus preventing extension of dendritic arbors to medial positions. The data are considered to be uniformly high quality and sufficiently innovative and of broad enough appeal to justify publication in <i>eLife</i>."
