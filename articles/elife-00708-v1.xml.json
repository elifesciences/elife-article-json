These dimers can include two copies of the same ErbB protein or two different ErbB proteins. However, one of the ErbB proteins\u2014Her2\u2014works in a different way.

In particular, the fact that Her2 cannot bind external ligands, and that it must form a dimer with a different ErbB protein before it can send a signal, has led to suggestions that the role of Her2 is to amplify the signals from other ErbB proteins. Since high levels of Her2 are associated with aggressive forms of breast and ovarian cancer, understanding how it is activated could improve our understanding of these cancers."

They based these simulations on crystal structures of human ErbB proteins and dEGFR, a growth-factor receptor found in fruit flies that closely resembles the ErbB proteins found in humans. They found that the dimers were stable as long as one protein within the dimer was bound to a ligand. Removing this ligand, however, distorted the ectodomain of the host protein, creating a gap that weakened the dimer and prevented Her2 from sending a signal within the cell. Similar results were obtained with the fruit fly dEGFR proteins. These simulations suggest that ErbB proteins form dimers and send signals through a mechanism conserved in evolution. Research in this field might help ongoing efforts to develop new treatments for human tumors characterized by high levels of Her2 expression."

The receptors of the EGFR family activate through dimerization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which is promoted by the binding of ligands from the EGF family (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ushiro and Cohen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schreiber et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chung et al., 2010</a>) to the receptors\u2019 extracellular regions (\u2018ectodomains\u2019). This activation process relies on a number of allosteric interactions in the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular portions of the receptor (<a href=\"#bib14\">Endres et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arkhipov et al., 2013</a>), which lead to the formation of a specific asymmetric active dimer of the intracellular kinase domains (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). Her2 is unique in the family in that it does not homodimerize under normal conditions, and its ectodomain does not bind ligands. Instead, it activates through heterodimerization with other members of the family (EGFR and Her3, in particular) when they are bound to ligands (<a href=\"#bib11\">Citri and Yarden, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baselga and Swain, 2009</a>)."

The increase in the number of EGFR family members, accompanied by increasing diversity of the extracellular ligands they interact with, gave rise to a complex signaling network: homo- and heterodimerization of various EGF receptors, induced by ligand binding, began to generate a variety of unique signaling outputs controlled by the identity of the bound ligands."

The Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimer is particularly prevalent and potent in signaling. The prominence of Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimers is particularly intriguing, since Her2 itself lacks an activating ligand and Her3 is impaired in its kinase activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These receptors act primarily through heterodimerization. The unique partnership of Her2 and Her3 has been aptly dubbed \u2018the deaf and the dumb\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Citri et al., 2003</a>). By activating several downstream pathways, including those of MAPK, PI3K, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and Janus kinase, the Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimer plays a pivotal role in the determination of cell lineage in a variety of tissues in epithelial organs. Experiments have shown that knocking out Her2 and Her3 genes leads to defective development of the heart, mammary gland, and nervous system in mice phenotypes. It is thus not surprising that Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimers are implicated in a number of forms of cancer (<a href=\"#bib10\">Citri et al., 2003</a>) or that Her2 is an important drug target in cancer therapeutics."

The heterodimers were found to be stable when a ligand was bound to the EGFR or Her3 subunit. Our simulations further showed that, when the single bound ligand was removed from a Her2 heterodimer, a substantial gap developed in the dimer interface. A similar gap was also observed in our simulation of the Her2 homodimer, which explains the weak homodimerization of Her2. Structural analysis shows that such a gap arises from the bending of the domain IIs in both subunits due to the absence of bound ligands. These observations are strikingly similar to the findings from the crystal structures of dEGFR homodimers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarado et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2010</a>): the ligand-free, but not the ligand-bound, dEGFR dimer exhibits a gap in the dimer interface, which explains the reduced dEGFR dimerization in the absence of ligands. In agreement with the recent experimental data showing that a single bound ligand is sufficient to activate an EGFR dimer (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>), our simulations demonstrate that the activation mechanism of the receptors of the human EGFR family and of Her2 in particular conserves <i>Drosophila</i> EGFR\u2019s capacity to form stable asymmetric ectodomain dimers upon the binding of a single ligand."

We removed both ligands from the crystal structure of the 2-ligand dEGFR dimer (PDB entry 3LTF) and simulated the resulting system. In two independent simulations, a substantial gap emerged in the dimer interface, and the resulting conformation resembled that of ligand-free dEGFR crystal structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> shows a significant reduction in the surface area buried within the dimer interface, consistent with the buried areas in the crystal structures of the ligand-free dEGFR dimers. We note that the dimer conformation drifted away from that of the ligand-free crystal structure after \u223c2 \u00b5s. This reflected the high flexibility of the simulated dimer, likely a result of the truncation of the domain IVs in the resolved crystal structure from which the simulations were initiated and the lack of inter-subunit contact between the two domains. The fact that our dEGFR simulations were able to reproduce the gap in the dimer interface found in the crystal structures of ligand-free dEGFR dimers lends support to the approach we adopted for the analysis of Her2 dimerization."

The dEGFR gap results in a reduced dimer interface area of \u223c2300 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, compared to \u223c3400 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in the 1- and 2-ligand dEGFR dimers, where the gap is closed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This reduction of the dimer interface area is believed to account for the relatively weak dimerization affinity of the ligand-free dEGFR, which is \u223c30 times lower than that of ligand-bound dEGFR. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows that the reduction of the dimer interface is similarly observed in our simulations of the ligand-free EGFR\u2013Her2 heterodimer and Her2 homodimer: when the gap is wide open, the surface area buried within the interface is \u223c2600 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, compared to \u223c3500 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in the ligand-bound heterodimer. We thus suggest that the same structural mechanism that weakens ligand-free dEGFR homodimers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarado et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2010</a>) also disfavors ligand-free EGFR\u2013Her2 dimerization and Her2 homodimerization. On the other hand, ligand binding in the EGFR subunit helps to keep domain II straight, which prevents the opening of the gap and stabilizes the dimer interface of EGFR\u2013Her2 heterodimer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This is reminiscent of the recent finding (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) that one bound ligand is sufficient to activate an EGFR dimer."

We thus studied the Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimer in ways similar to our study of EGFR\u2013Her2 heterodimers and the Her2 homodimer. We first modeled the Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimer using the resolved crystal structure of the Her3 monomer (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cho and Leahy, 2002</a>) and our model of the EGFR\u2013Her2 heterodimer as templates (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

Without the ligand, the Her3 subunit underwent conformational changes similar to those described above for the ligand-free EGFR subunit, including a bending of domain II. As a result, a gap again emerged in the dimer interface. In the first series of simulations the gap in the Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimer was often partially closed, but re-opened repeatedly and resulted in a significant decrease in the buried surface area in the dimer interface. In the second series, the gap was steadily open once the ligand was removed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These observations suggest that Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimerization, similar to that of EGFR\u2013Her2, is promoted by the stabilization of the dimer interface following ligand binding."

We found that the asymmetric dimers we examined\u2014the EGFR\u2013Her2 and Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimers, the 1-ligand EGFR homodimer, and the 1- and 2-ligand dEGFR homodimers\u2014all shared certain key atomic-level interactions between subunits. In particular, hydrogen bonds between Gln194 (in EGFR or Her3 numbering) of the ligand-bound subunit and Cys213 and His215 (in Her2 numbering; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) of the ligand-free subunit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) were particularly stable. The presence of these hydrogen bonds is consistent with the reported crystal structures of the dEGFR asymmetric dimers after a 180\u00b0 \u03c7<sub>2</sub> rotamer flip at the histidine (which would presumably be consistent with the same electron density). In contrast, these hydrogen bonds are not present in the crystal structure or in simulations of the symmetric 2-ligand EGFR dimer, and they are precluded by the gap in the dimer interface of all ligand-free dimers we examined (including the ligand-free dEGFR crystal structure and our simulations of ligand-free EGFR and Her2 homodimers and EGFR\u2013Her2 heterodimers). Our observations suggest an important role for Gln194 of the ligand-bound subunit in stabilizing 1-ligand dimers. Notably, the glutamine residue is conserved in EGFR, Her3, Her4, and dEGFR, which bind ligands, but not in Her2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), which does not. Mutating Gln194 in EGFR and Her3 may thus hinder their heterodimerization with Her2, and mutating the corresponding residue (Gln189) in dEGFR may hinder its homodimerization."

Our simulations suggest that this difference in stability may be due to unique conformational dynamics in the dimerization arm of Her2. The dimerization arm plays a key role in maintaining dimer stability, and dimerization arm-mediated interactions are very similar in crystal structures of dEGFR and human EGFR dimers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarado et al., 2010</a>). In our simulations, however, the dimerization arm of Her2 in the EGFR\u2013Her2 dimer deviated significantly from its initial conformation in the course of the simulation, whereas the dimerization arms of EGFR and dEGFR in homodimers did not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). A cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction at the tip of the dimerization arm in the 1-ligand EGFR dimer between Tyr251 and Arg285 of the unliganded subunit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) appears to be particularly important in stabilizing the dimer. The residue at the position of Tyr251 is conserved as tyrosine or phenylalanine in dEGFR and all members of the human EGFR family. The residue at the position of Arg285 is conserved as arginine, except in Her2, where it is replaced by leucine (Leu291; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). It is tempting to suggest that this missing arginine in Her2 may explain its weak ectodomain heterodimerization compared to the homodimerization of dEGFR, EGFR, and Her4, and that an L291R mutation in Her2 may promote Her2 heterodimerization and facilitate the crystallization of a Her3\u2013Her2 or EGFR\u2013Her2 dimer."

The long-timescale MD simulations reported here support the notion of a simple and evolutionarily conserved structural mechanism controls homo- and heterodimerization of Her2, and thereby Her2 activation. Our simulations revealed inherent instability in the dimer interfaces of the ligand-free EGFR\u2013Her2 and Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimers and the Her2 homodimer, and indicated that the binding of a single ligand is sufficient to stabilize the heterodimer interfaces. These observations complement the crystallographic analysis, shedding further light on the structural mechanism underlying the preference of Her2 to partner with a ligand-bound EGFR or Her3, rather than with Her2 or ligand-free EGFR or Her3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lemmon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Graus-Porta et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nagy, et al., 2010</a>)."

A ligand bound to EGFR (or to another member of the family) acts as a wedge that pushes domains I and III apart, straightening the otherwise bent domain II (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarado et al., 2009</a>). (Domain II is bent in the crystal structures of ligand-free EGFR, Her2, Her3, Her4, and dEGFR.) We simulated the transition from the straight to the bent conformation of domain II upon removal of the bound ligand in EGFR and Her3 and the consequent development of the gap in the dimer interface. Our simulations suggest that, for the gap to open, both domain IIs of the two subunits in a dimer need to adopt a bent conformation."

Instead of directly participating in the dimerization, a bound ligand regulates the conformation of domain II and potentiates it for dimerization. In this context, it is not surprising that the seemingly minor effect of ligand binding on the conformation of domain II in the heterodimerization partners of Her2 demonstrated by our simulations is of great importance to the regulation of Her2 activity. Our consistent observation of the gap that disrupts the dimer interfaces in the ligand-free EGFR\u2013Her2 and Her3\u2013Her2 heterodimers, and in Her2 and dEGFR homodimers, as well as the fact that domain II is bent in crystal structures of ligand-free EGFR, Her2, Her3, Her4, and dEGFR, suggests that the structural mechanism for the control of dimerization has been preserved from <i>Drosophila</i> to the human EGFR family."

The sequence identity between the ectodomains of EGFR and Her2 is 40%, while that between the ectodomains of EGFR and Her3 is 41%.

The available biochemical data suggest that the activation process upon ligand binding requires formation of a heterodimer consisting of Her2 and Her3. Her2 lacks ligand binding (or binding is weak), whereas Her3 does not have significant kinase activity. Thus, it is only upon hetero-dimerization that ligand binding can initiate kinase activity. Yet, structural studies by x-ray crystallography of the human EGFR-family receptors ectodomains showed only symmetric dimers with ligands bound in both monomers. Intriguingly, crystal structures of <i>Drosophila</i> EGFR ectodomains showed asymmetric dimers with only one ligand bound. The question, however, was if the <i>Drosophila</i> crystal structures are representative, what is going on for the human EGFR receptors as well. This work now suggests that this is indeed the case: starting from the crystal structures of the human Her2 homodimer as well as the Her2-Her3 heterodimer, long-timescale (microsecond) molecular dynamics simulations were performed. The simulations were first successfully tested starting from the <i>Drosophila</i> heterodimer structures."

As the reviewers suggested, we have thus revised the manuscript to place more emphasis on the atomic details of our Her2 heterodimer models, with a particular focus on the dimer interfaces. We have also revised the relevant high-level statements in the manuscript to reflect this understanding. The new version of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> presents important details of the interactions between the N-terminal regions of the domain IIs in the asymmetric dimers, in addition to the interactions around the \u201cdimerization arms\u201d.

Additionally, we have now highlighted the salt bridge between Arg228 (EGFR numbering) and Glu243 (Her2 numbering), which is likely important to the stability of the Her2 dimers.

Specifically, we suggest that a cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction between Tyr251 and Arg285 (EGFR numbering) in the homodimers may be key to the stabilization of the dimerization arms in the dimer interfaces. Furthermore, we suggest that the replacement of the arginine in Her2 by a leucine, which distinguishes it from dEGFR and the other members of the EGFR family, may explain the weak ectodomain heterodimerization of Her2 ectodomains relative to the homodimerization of dEGFR and human EGFR ectodomains. We further speculate that the L291R Her2 mutation, which may stabilize Her2 heterodimers with EGFR and Her3, may facilitate crystallization of Her2\u2013Her3 and Her2\u2013EGFR dimers."
