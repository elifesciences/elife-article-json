Because this is a new prevention strategy, we broadly assessed its effects on the mucosa. In MTN-007, a phase-1, randomized, double-blinded rectal microbicide trial, we used systems genomics/proteomics to determine the effect of tenofovir 1% gel, nonoxynol-9 2% gel, placebo gel or no treatment on rectal biopsies (15 subjects/arm). We also treated primary vaginal epithelial cells from four healthy women with tenofovir in vitro. After seven days of administration, tenofovir 1% gel had broad-ranging effects on the rectal mucosa, which were more pronounced than, but different from, those of the detergent nonoxynol-9. Tenofovir suppressed anti-inflammatory mediators, increased T cell densities, caused mitochondrial dysfunction, altered regulatory pathways of cell differentiation and survival, and stimulated epithelial cell proliferation. The breadth of mucosal changes induced by tenofovir indicates that its safety over longer-term topical use should be carefully monitored."

Because this is a new prevention strategy, we broadly assessed its effects on the mucosa. In MTN-007, a phase-1, randomized, double-blinded rectal microbicide trial, we used systems genomics/proteomics to determine the effect of tenofovir 1% gel, nonoxynol-9 2% gel, placebo gel or no treatment on rectal biopsies (15 subjects/arm). We also treated primary vaginal epithelial cells from four healthy women with tenofovir in vitro. After seven days of administration, tenofovir 1% gel had broad-ranging effects on the rectal mucosa, which were more pronounced than, but different from, those of the detergent nonoxynol-9. Tenofovir suppressed anti-inflammatory mediators, increased T cell densities, caused mitochondrial dysfunction, altered regulatory pathways of cell differentiation and survival, and stimulated epithelial cell proliferation. The breadth of mucosal changes induced by tenofovir indicates that its safety over longer-term topical use should be carefully monitored."

We were therefore interested to extend our findings from the rectum to the vaginal mucosa. We isolated epithelial cells from vaginal tissues donated by three healthy women and tested their response to 50 and 500 \u03bcM tenofovir in vitro for up to 14 days of culture using RNA expression analysis. Preliminary tests showed that these dosages give roughly similar intracellular concentrations of the active drug (tenofovir diphosphate) as measured in the vagina after tenofovir 1% gel use (not shown) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hendrix et al., 2013</a>). Pre-processed microarray expression data were extremely consistent between the three vaginal cell cultures (mean Pearson correlation coefficient 0.9912; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Tenofovir's effects on the purified vaginal epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) were similar to its effects on the rectal mucosa (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), but, as expected, changes likely driven by leukocytes in the biopsies were not seen in the purified epithelial cells, or were differently regulated. In the epithelial cells, tenofovir did not significantly change chemokine, chemokine receptor, and cluster of differentiation (CD) genes, and it suppressed ISG 15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) and MX1 (myxovirus resistance 1), which were induced in the biopsies."

To explore tenofovir's effects on mitochondria, we first confirmed its inhibition of PNPT1 in the 9 cm and 15 cm rectal biopsies of all 15 study participants by RT-ddPCR. PNPT1 copy numbers decreased more than 10-fold at 9 cm (mean fold change 0.09, 95% CI 0.009\u20130.172, p &lt; 0.001) and by half at 15 cm (0.53, 0.34\u20130.73, p &lt; 0.001) after 7 days of treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To directly assess mitochondrial function, we picked one of the 13 genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA, ATP synthase F0 subunit 6 (ATP6), a key component of the proton channel (<a href=\"#bib22\">Houstek et al., 2006</a>), and measured its transcription by RT-ddPCR in the 9 cm biopsies of all 15 study participants in the tenofovir arm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Rather, tenofovir dampened anti-inflammatory factors. Most prominently, it strongly inhibited IL-10 gene and protein expression, likely via blocking of CREB1 and its coactivator CREBBP (<a href=\"#bib35\">Martin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Woodgett and Ohashi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2009</a>). In addition, it suppressed signaling pathways downstream of TGF-\u03b2, a central anti-inflammatory mediator in the gut (<a href=\"#bib26\">Konkel and Chen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Surh and Sprent, 2012</a>). Consequently, a number of chemokines were induced, such as the B lymphocyte chemoattractant CXCL13 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ansel et al., 2002</a>), and CCL19 and CCL21, both ligands of CCR7 on T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Forster et al., 2008</a>). Correspondingly, CCR7, the B cell marker CD19, and the T cell markers CD2, CD3D and CD7 increased. In keeping with this, we observed higher densities of CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD7<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in the rectal mucosa following 7 days of tenofovir 1% gel use. In concert, these changes suggest that tenofovir creates a state of potential hyper-responsiveness to external inflammatory stimuli but does not itself cause inflammation. In populations who, unlike our MTN-007 study cohort, have a high incidence of mucosal infections and associated immune activation, this could potentially diminish the anti-viral protective effect of topical tenofovir prophylaxis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Naranbhai et al., 2012</a>)."

We found that tenofovir consistently inhibited expression of PNPT1, which encodes polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPASE). PNPASE regulates nucleus-encoded RNA import into mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). In PNPT1 knock-out mice, mitochondrial morphology and respiratory capacity are disrupted in a manner quite similar to the disruption in renal proximal tubular cells in patients with tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Perazella, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). In our study, just 1 week of daily tenofovir 1% gel application lowered transcription of mitochondrial ATP6 by sixfold and caused visible ultrastructural mitochondrial changes. These findings suggest that tenofovir's suppression of PNPT1 expression may underlie its reported, but heretofore unexplained, mitochondrial toxicity."

Furthermore, tenofovir's negative effect on mitochondrial function could lead to impairment of tumor progenitor cell apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Modica-Napolitano et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011</a>), as has been specifically reported for loss-of-function mutations of mtATP6, a mitochondrial gene strongly suppressed by tenofovir in our study (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shidara et al., 2005</a>). Neoplastic pressure could also arise from the strong induction of KIAA0101 and UBD (ubiquitin D). KIAA0101 is important for regulation of DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib56\">Simpson et al., 2006</a>), is increased in tumor tissues (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yu et al., 2001</a>), and enhances cancer cell growth (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jain et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Hosokawa et al., 2007</a>). UBD appears to increase mitotic non-disjunction and chromosome instability (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ren et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2011</a>) and is highly up-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ren et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2011</a>). Notably, though, these findings remain circumstantial, as there is no actual clinical evidence for carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, they raise the question of whether the relatively high concentrations of tenofovir achieved in the mucosa during topical use could potentially lead to neoplastic lesions with continuous and long-term use. According to Viread's Product Monograph, gastrointestinal tumorigenicity has been observed in mice after high oral dosing of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Vaginal tumorigenicity has been documented for azido-thymidine, an NRTI and DNA chain terminator like tenofovir, which induced vaginal hyperplasia and carcinomas when delivered to mice intravaginally as a 2% solution (\u223c25% carcinoma rate) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ayers et al., 1996</a>)."

Our findings raise concerns regarding the safety of topical tenofovir 1% gel in the rectum with long-term use. Tenofovir's effects on vaginal epithelial cells suggest similar activities in the vagina, which we are currently verifying in MTN-014, a phase I clinical trial comparing vaginal and rectal tenofovir 1% gel in a cross-over format. Further studies are required to gauge whether tenofovir, which has become a valuable cornerstone drug in treating HIV infection, can also be safely and effectively used as a vaginal or rectal microbicide."

Protein concentration of sponge eluates was determined by BCA assay (EMD Millipore). Equal amounts of total protein from each sample (100 \u03bcg) were then denatured in pH 8.0 urea exchange buffer (8 M Urea [GE HealthCare, United Kingdom], 50 mM HEPES [Sigma-Aldrich]) for 20 min at room temperature, and then placed into 10 kDa Nanosep filter cartridges. After centrifugation, samples were treated with 25 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min, then 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min, followed by a wash with 50 mM HEPES buffer. Trypsin (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) was added (2 \u03bcg/100 \u03bcg protein) and samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight in the cartridge. Peptides were eluted off the filter with 50 mM HEPES, and the digestion was stopped with 1% formic acid. Peptides were dried via vacuum centrifugation and cleaned of salts and detergents by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (high pH RP, Agilent 1200 series micro-flow pump, Water XBridge column) using a step-function gradient. The fractions were then dried via vacuum centrifugation. Equal amounts of peptides were re-suspended in 2% acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1% formic acid (EMD, Canada) and injected into a nano-flow LC system (Easy nLC, Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected in-line to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The effect of tenofovir 1% gel on the rectal mucosa in vivo was tested in paired comparisons between time point I or VII and time point 0. Each treatment arm was considered separately, and researchers were blinded to treatment arm. The effect of tenofovir on vaginal epithelial cell cultures in vitro was tested in paired comparisons between treated and untreated cultures. Each tenofovir dosage (50 and 500 \u03bcM) and time point (1, 4, 7, and 14 days) was considered separately. The Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method for estimating false discovery rates (FDR) was used to control for multiple comparisons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</a>). Criteria for significance and relevance were an estimated FDR \u2264 0.05 and a log<sub>2</sub> fold expression change of \u2265\u00a00.5 (induction) or \u2264 \u22120.5 (suppression), respectively. To confirm the results of the in vivo MTN-007 study, we reanalyzed the data using a double subtraction strategy, where the paired differences between time point 0 and time points I or VII within each treatment arm were first calculated for each probe and study participant. In a second step, the mean paired differences for each probe within each of the three treatment arms were compared to mean paired differences for each probe within the no-treatment arm. Significance testing for this alternative analysis of the in vivo MTN-007 data was performed via a linear fit model using the limma package (<a href=\"#bib49\">Smyth, 2005</a>), with the same significance criteria used for Cyber-T. The resulting gene lists greatly overlapped with the Cyber-T results. For simplicity, the numbers of induced and suppressed genes reported in \u2018Results\u2019 are based on the Cyber-T analysis. Heat maps of differentially regulated genes were generated using MeV 4.8 within the TM4 Microarray Software Suite (<a href=\"#bib47\">Saeed et al., 2006</a>), and hierarchically clustered according to selected gene ontologies found in the databases DAVID 6.7 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang da et al., 2009</a>) and InnateDB (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lynn et al., 2008</a>).

In a ddPCR assay, each sample is partitioned into \u223c20,000 droplets representing as many individual PCR reactions. The number of target DNA copies present per sample can be quantified based on Poisson distribution statistics, because each individual droplet is categorized as positive or negative for a given gene. For rectal biopsies, cDNA was generated using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the ddPCR was carried out using the 2\u00d7 ddPCR Supermix for Probes (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For epithelial cell lines, these steps were combined using the 2\u00d7 One-Step RT-ddPCR Kit for Probes (BioRad). ddPCR was performed on the QX100 droplet digital PCR system (BioRad).

Individual cells were identified based on the nuclear counter-stain. For CD3 and CD7, all positive cells were automatically counted and reported as number of positive cells per mm<sup>2</sup> of tissue section. For IL-10 and UBD, tight regions were manually drawn around all areas of the tissue sections containing columnar epithelial cells. For IL-10, all positive columnar epithelial cells were automatically counted and reported as number of positive cells per mm<sup>2</sup>. For UBD, which stained all epithelial cells, the mean staining intensity (MSI) of each columnar epithelial cell was measured in arbitrary units and overall UBD staining intensity for each section was reported as the average MSI of all epithelial cells."

Using ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib12\">Collins, 2007</a>), the two-dimensional sizes in \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> of all individual mitochondria with a circularity index of \u22650.9 were calculated (for standardization purposes, only mitochondria cut near perfectly along their minor axis were evaluated). 10 images per sample were also acquired at 2,000\u00d7 magnification, always including the epithelial cell brush border. Using ImageJ, a grid of 1.32 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> squares of defined size was overlaid onto each image. All mitochondria in the images were counted, except those in the first row of squares falling on the brush border and in squares along the image rims (which only partially covered the tissue), and the mean numbers of mitochondria per \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> were calculated for each of the acquired 2,000\u00d7 images (range of counted squares per image: 23\u201350)."

Correlations of log<sub>2</sub> fold gene expression changes between 9 cm and 15 cm biopsies in Figure 1C and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 were tested by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Gene and protein expression changes over baseline were compared between study arms by two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney test (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 and Figure 6). The combined expression data from the microarray and RT-ddPCR tests shown in Figure 2C were compared separately for log-fold induction or suppression over baseline using a one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment. Immunohistology measurements in Figure 2D were compared between baseline and after 7 days of treatment by two-tailed paired t tests. Due to high skewness of the CD7<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup>, and IL-10<sup>+</sup> cell counts, these were tested after log<sub>10</sub> transformation. Ratios of induced to suppressed genes in Figure 3A were tested for a difference between cellular compartments using Chi-square statistics. DSP, IL-10, KIAA0101, PNPT1, and ATP6 copy numbers or protein concentrations in Figures 4B,C, 5A,B,F were tested for significant change across three time points by repeated measures ANOVA, and exact Sidak's (Figures 4B,C, 5F) or Tukey (Figure 5A,B) post-tests were run for comparisons between two time points. Due to high skewness of the KIAA0101 copy numbers, these were tested after log<sub>10</sub> transformation. The effect of increasing tenofovir concentrations on the proliferation of primary vaginal epithelial cells in Figure 4E was assessed for significance by a linear model accounting for days and donors. Copy numbers between 9 cm and 15 cm biopsies in Figure 5A were compared by two-tailed paired t test. Copy numbers between baseline tenofovir and N-9 in Figure 5B were compared by a two-tailed unpaired t test. Mitochondria counts and sizes in Figure 5C,D were compared between baseline and Day VII, separately for the two subjects evaluated by electron microscopy, by two-tailed unpaired t tests with Bonferroni adjustment. Microarray chip probe expression values were tested for correlation between the three primary vaginal cell cultures by computing pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Statistics packages used were Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) and Bioconductor/Lumi in R. Statistical results are summarized in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>."

In vivo, each subject only received one treatment, and statistical analysis of the in vivo data has to be done in a longitudinal fashion as pairwise longitudinal comparisons between before and after treatment in each subject. In contrast to the more straight forward analysis of the in vitro data, the in vivo data can therefore be analyzed in two different ways, as described in the Methods."

We knew (since we did have time point information) that one arm showed a particularly large number of gene expression changes. Based on our initial hypotheses we were convinced that this had to be the nonoxynol-9 (N-9) arm. When it turned out to be the tenofovir arm, we at first thought that a mistake had occurred during unblinding. However, further cross-checking confirmed that 1% tenofovir led to many more changes than 2% N-9. This was borne out by the subsequent in-depth pathway analysis, which revealed mitochondrial changes that are typical for NRTIs but not for N-9, and subsequently the good concordance between the in vivo and the in vitro tenofovir data."

However, none explains mechanistically why these two particular ingredients are needed. It is true that cholera toxin could be considered as potentially pro-inflammatory and hydrocortisone as potentially anti-inflammatory. However, they were present in all cultures, and therefore their effect should not contribute to differences between tenofovir-treated and -untreated cultures. The two factors could perhaps lead to some changes longitudinally over time, but this is not tested in the in vitro experiments. In vitro, we compare tenofovir-treated and -untreated cells independently at each time point, but we do not compare between different time points."
