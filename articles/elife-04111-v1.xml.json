In contrast to <i>Drosophila</i>, eggs of the beetle <i>Tribolium</i> are protected by a serosa, an extraembryonic epithelium that is present in all insects except higher flies. In this study, we test a possible immune function of this frontier epithelium using <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi-mediated deletion. First, we show that bacteria propagate twice as fast in serosa-less eggs. Then, we compare the complete transcriptomes of wild-type, control RNAi, and <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi eggs before and after sterile or septic injury. Infection induces genes involved in Toll and IMD-signaling, melanisation, production of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides in wild-type eggs but not in serosa-less eggs. Finally, we demonstrate constitutive and induced immune gene expression in the serosal epithelium using in situ hybridization. We conclude that the serosa provides insect eggs with a full-range innate immune response."

In contrast to <i>Drosophila</i>, eggs of the beetle <i>Tribolium</i> are protected by a serosa, an extraembryonic epithelium that is present in all insects except higher flies. In this study, we test a possible immune function of this frontier epithelium using <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi-mediated deletion. First, we show that bacteria propagate twice as fast in serosa-less eggs. Then, we compare the complete transcriptomes of wild-type, control RNAi, and <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi eggs before and after sterile or septic injury. Infection induces genes involved in Toll and IMD-signaling, melanisation, production of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides in wild-type eggs but not in serosa-less eggs. Finally, we demonstrate constitutive and induced immune gene expression in the serosal epithelium using in situ hybridization. We conclude that the serosa provides insect eggs with a full-range innate immune response."

The humoral immune response is characterized by the massive secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph and is mainly exerted by the fat body. Epithelia and hemocytes play the main role in local immune defenses that comprise melanisation, local AMP production, phagocytosis, and encapsulation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ganesan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Davis and Engstrom, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ferrandon, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ligoxygakis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). The mechanisms regulating these innate immune responses have largely been uncovered with the aid of genetic and molecular studies in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster.</i> When microbes invade the fly, their released peptidoglycans are sensed by peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs) leading to the activation of the main immune signaling pathways. The meso-diaminopimelic acid-type (DAP-type) peptidoglycans of Gram-negative bacteria activate the IMD pathway, whereas the Lys-type peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria activate the Toll pathway. The activation of the Toll pathway is mediated by a proteolytic cascade of serine proteases leading to the cleavage of the cytokine Sp\u00e4tzle, the ligand of the transmembrane receptor Toll. Activation of the immune signaling pathways leads to nuclear localization of the NF-kappaB factors Dorsal, Dif, or Relish that induce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Other upregulated genes are prophenoloxidases (proPOs which mediate melanisation) and dual oxidase (DUOX which produces reactive oxygen species)."

The biochemical details of pathway activation, for instance, have mainly been unraveled using this beetle (See <a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2010</a> for review). With the availability of tools such as RNAseq and RNAi, more insect species are being established as model organism for innate immunity research (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altincicek and Vilcinskas, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Waterhouse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gerardo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Johnston and Rolff, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Johnston et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>). In particular the red flour beetle (<i>Tribolium castaneum</i>) has received much attention in innate immune studies (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Altincicek et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Roth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Contreras et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Milutinovi\u0107 et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Behrens et al., 2014</a>). Comparative genome analysis has revealed that components of intracellular immune signaling pathways (Toll, IMD, and JAK/STAT) in <i>Drosophila</i> are 1:1 conserved in <i>Tribolium</i> (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zou et al., 2007</a>).

Female medflies, for example, cover their eggs with antimicrobial secretions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Marchini et al., 1997</a>) and in the absence of maternal care, eggs of earwigs die of fungal infection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boos et al., 2014</a>).

It is not until late stage 15, (one of the latest stages in development when ectoderm and trachea have differentiated), that eggs show up to 25-fold upregulation of antimicrobial peptides (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). This is incomparable to the upregulation in adult flies that is at least an order of magnitude larger. Except for Cecropin (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tingvall et al., 2001</a>), stage 11 embryos do not show any induction of antimicrobial peptides and cannot contain an infection of non-pathogenic bacteria, leading to reduced survival (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). In strong contrast, we have shown that the eggs of <i>Tribolium</i> which were not even half way during development could upregulate several AMPs to levels comparable to the adult (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013</a>). This upregulation depends on the serosa, an extraembryonic epithelium that envelopes yolk and embryo (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013</a>). This membrane is present in all insects but was lost in a small group of higher Diptera (the Schizophora) to which <i>Drosophila</i> belongs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt-Ott, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rafiqi et al., 2008</a>). Although two maternal extracellular coverings, the chorion and the vitelline membrane, envelop the insect egg, the serosa is the first cellular epithelium surrounding the egg at the interface between the microbe rich external milieu on the one side and the yolk and embryo at the other side. Thus, the serosa could function as an immune competent barrier epithelium. This has been suggested before, as the NF-kappaB factor Dorsal is highly expressed in the presumptive serosa (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2000</a>). The absence of the serosa might account for the poor immune response in <i>Drosophila</i> eggs."

This technique generates <i>Tribolium</i> eggs with an amnion at the dorsal side, but without a serosa (<a href=\"#bib62\">van der Zee et al., 2005</a>). At the relative humidity of the air of the laboratory, normal larvae hatch from these eggs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>). As <i>Tc-zen1</i> is only expressed in the early serosa (<a href=\"#bib62\">van der Zee et al., 2005</a>) and is not expressed anymore by the time the experiments are performed (See discussion), we expect only to find effects that are a consequence of the absence of the serosa. We investigated the growth of bacteria in serosa-less and wild-type eggs, sequenced the whole transcriptome of naive and immune-challenged eggs with and without a serosal epithelium and confirmed constitutive and induced gene expression in the serosa by in situ hybridization. We conclude that the serosa is a frontier epithelium that provides immune competence to the insect egg."

This indicates that our approach does not depend on artefacts generated by pricking eggs (e.g. delayed development) but mainly identifies genes involved in the innate immune response."

This suggests that these pathways are largely functionally conserved between <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Tribolium</i>, although we could hardly detect expression of <i>dredd</i>, the endoprotease that cleaves Relish for nuclear translocation. Similar to larvae and adults (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altincicek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Behrens et al., 2014</a>), JAK-STAT pathway components were not differentially regulated.

AMPs are generally small (less than 30 kDa), cationic, hydrophobic, and possibly have high glycine and/or proline content (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bulet et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bulet and St\u00f6cklin, 2005</a>). Based on the antimicrobial peptide database (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), many proteins encoded in the <i>Tribolium</i> genome fulfil those criteria and are identified as candidate antimicrobial peptides. Using our RNA sequencing data, however, we could select those candidate proteins that exhibit at least a twofold induction upon infection. Based on these criteria, we found 20 potential new AMPs (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, we included the properties of several known AMPs as a reference).

The vast majority, 276 genes, are differentially regulated in both wild-type and control eggs but not in serosa-less eggs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In the serosa-less <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi eggs, merely 57 genes are differentially regulated upon microbial challenge, despite our finding that RNAi rather increases the number of immune responsive genes. Of all 368 <i>Tribolium</i> genes that are annotated as immune genes (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Altincicek et al., 2013</a>), only nine were differentially regulated upon infection in serosa-less eggs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Except for <i>serpin24</i>, all of the other eight genes were also differentially regulated in response to sterile injury, indicating that they do not respond to infection but to wounding.

In contrast, most of the genes of the intracellular signal transduction were present in <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi eggs at similar levels as in wild-type eggs. Notably, the transmembrane receptor <i>toll3</i> exhibits higher expression in unchallenged eggs with a serosa than in eggs without a serosa.

We cannot exclude that some expression differences we found might be due to somewhat delayed development after pricking the eggs.

In <i>Drosophila</i>, Toll1 has been described as the essential immune-related Toll receptor (<a href=\"#bib37\">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</a>). Other Tolls are not essential for the immune response, except for an antiviral function of Toll7 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nakamoto et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, <i>toll3</i> is significantly upregulated upon infection of the egg and not <i>toll1</i>. <i>Toll3</i> is also upregulated in infected adults and larvae (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altincicek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Behrens et al., 2014</a>), suggesting a novel role for <i>toll3</i> in <i>Tribolium</i> innate immunity.

Additional AMPs might still be discovered<i>,</i> as we have not investigated peptides longer than 200 amino acids. Some of these long peptides, for instance the Thaumatins, are known to have antimicrobial properties (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altincicek et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2013</a>). We might also have missed AMPs because some might be specifically expressed at other stages, for instance in larvae or adults. Although activity assays against bacteria and fungi are needed to verify antimicrobial properties, the discovery of 20 new potential AMPs shows the power of our experimental strategy for getting an unbiased understanding of insect immunity."

Formally, it is possible that the lack of the immune response we reported is not caused by the absence of the serosa but by a more direct effect of <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi, for instance if the transcription factor Zen would directly regulate immune genes in the embryo. This is highly unlikely, as <i>Tc-zen1</i> is only expressed in the early serosa (<a href=\"#bib62\">van der Zee et al., 2005</a>) and is not expressed anymore by the time we performed infection. Indeed, we found only three RNAseq reads that map to <i>Tc-zen1</i>, confirming that <i>Tc-zen1</i> is practically not expressed at the time we performed experiments. Thus, we are confident to conclude that the lack of the full-range immune response after <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi is exclusively due to the absence of the serosa."

However, our in situ hybridizations unambiguously demonstrate that it is the serosal epithelium itself that expresses AMPs upon infection, indicating that it is the serosal epithelium itself that harbors the functional immune response reducing bacterial propagation in infected eggs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

The serosal cells will have enveloped the complete embryo before the ectoderm starts to differentiate. These serosal cells can provide the insect egg with an innate immune response long before the embryonic ectoderm or trachea is immune responsive. In addition, the polyploid nuclei allow the serosal cells to quickly synthesize large amounts of proteins providing protection for the vulnerable developing embryo. Thus, the serosa is well suited to provide early immune protection to the egg. <i>Drosophila</i> eggs do not develop a serosa, as this extraembryonic membrane was lost in the Schizophoran flies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt-Ott, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rafiqi et al., 2008</a>). A trade-off with developmental speed might have driven the loss of the serosa in these flies living on ephemeral food sources (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jacobs et al., 2014</a>). We suggest that the absence of the serosa in the Schizophora accounts for the poor immune response of <i>Drosophila</i> eggs. Since all other insects possess a serosa, we propose that early immune competence is a general property of insect eggs."

Eggs were fixed for 20 min in a 1:1 mix of heptane and 3.7% formaldehyde in PBST. As the serosa tightly associates with the vitelline membrane, we used <i>Tc-CHS1</i> RNAi eggs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>), making it possible to manually dissect eggs containing the serosa from the vitelline membrane. The following primers were used to amplify 500-bp fragments of <i>thaumatin1</i>, <i>attacin1</i>, <i>toll3</i>, and <i>scavenger receptor B5</i>."

The authors show that the RNAi induction has an impact on the transcriptional profile of the eggs yet they didn't follow this up with controls. Immune responses have costs. The cost could be that the mother does not endow the egg with the same supplies because the mother is busy fighting a perceived infection. Thus eggs from RNAi treated mothers might have poor immune responses that are poor regardless of what gene was knocked down. I'm making this up but it is plausible \u2013 things like this do happen and it is a simple control.

Presumably these bacteria are growing exponentially in the beginning and the authors have looked at less than one doubling. The formula used for bacteria growth is for exponential growth but the authors have only shown a single timepoint and thus can't tell us anything about the shape of the curve. Wouldn't a logistic function be a better idea? The bacteria presumably aren't going to grow forever and will hit a ceiling. True, the beginning of the growth curve will be exponential but if the authors haven't provided the growth curve, how do we know that they are at the beginning? It could be that these two types of flies simply have different maximum loads of bacteria and the bacteria have already reached their maxima.

We left these data out of the manuscript for the exact concern this reviewer raises: at that point the bacteria might have hit a ceiling. But it makes us confident that after 6h, bacteria are still in their exponential phase. We have added this line of reasoning to the materials and methods. A little bit of calculation supports this assumption: in <i>Tc-zen1</i> RNAi eggs, the bacterial load increases from 49 to 7260 in 6 hours. This requires more than 7 divisions. That means slightly more than one division per hour. This is actually close to what bacteria can reach in LB medium, and likely is exponential."

The authors show that the RNAi induction has an impact on the transcriptional profile of the eggs yet they didn't follow this up with controls. Immune responses have costs. The cost could be that the mother does not endow the egg with the same supplies because the mother is busy fighting a perceived infection. Thus eggs from RNAi treated mothers might have poor immune responses that are poor regardless of what gene was knocked down. I'm making this up but it is plausible \u2013 things like this do happen and it is a simple control.
