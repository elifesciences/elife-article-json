This feedback protects against cholesterol overaccumulation in the plasma membrane (PM). But how does ER know whether PM is saturated with cholesterol? In this study, we define three pools of PM cholesterol: (1) a pool accessible to bind <sup>125</sup>I-PFO*, a mutant form of bacterial Perfringolysin O, which binds cholesterol in membranes; (2) a sphingomyelin(SM)-sequestered pool that binds <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* only after SM is destroyed by sphingomyelinase; and (3) a residual pool that does not bind <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* even after sphingomyelinase treatment. When LDL-derived cholesterol leaves lysosomes, it expands PM's PFO-accessible pool and, after a short lag, it also increases the ER's PFO-accessible regulatory pool. This regulatory mechanism allows cells to ensure optimal cholesterol levels in PM while avoiding cholesterol overaccumulation."

In this study, we define three pools of PM cholesterol: (1) a pool accessible to bind <sup>125</sup>I-PFO*, a mutant form of bacterial Perfringolysin O, which binds cholesterol in membranes; (2) a sphingomyelin(SM)-sequestered pool that binds <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* only after SM is destroyed by sphingomyelinase; and (3) a residual pool that does not bind <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* even after sphingomyelinase treatment. When LDL-derived cholesterol leaves lysosomes, it expands PM's PFO-accessible pool and, after a short lag, it also increases the ER's PFO-accessible regulatory pool. This regulatory mechanism allows cells to ensure optimal cholesterol levels in PM while avoiding cholesterol overaccumulation."

These experiments showed that the plasma membrane contains three different types or \u2018pools\u2019 of cholesterol. Das et al. found that only one of these pools is \u2018labile\u2019: it grows when there is an excess of LDL, and shrinks when cholesterol is running low in the cell. Furthermore, excess cholesterol is first added to this labile pool in the plasma membrane before it is added to the pool in the endoplasmic reticulum. This suggests that the production, uptake, and breakdown of cholesterol are all controlled by partitioning this molecule between the labile pool in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum."

Control is mediated by SREBP-2, a membrane bound protein that activates transcription of genes encoding most, if not all, enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Horton et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Espenshade and Hughes, 2007</a>). SREBP-2 is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes where it binds to an escort protein called Scap. When ER cholesterol is less than \u223c5 mole% of total ER lipids (<a href=\"#bib30\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</a>), the Scap/SREBP-2 complex enters COPII-coated vesicles that move to the Golgi, where two proteases liberate the active fragment of SREBP-2 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sun et al., 2007</a>). The active fragment enters the nucleus where it activates transcription of the cholesterol-synthesizing genes and also the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which supplies the cell with exogenous cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</a>)."

The lysosome-derived cholesterol is delivered to the PM and the ER membrane. When the ER cholesterol rises above a sharp threshold of 5 mole% of total ER lipids (<a href=\"#bib30\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</a>), the Scap/SREBP complex binds to an ER anchor protein called Insig, and this prevents its transport to the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib15\">Goldstein et al., 2006</a>). As a result, cholesterol synthesis and uptake from LDL are reduced. If excess cholesterol accumulates, it is removed from the PM and delivered to the ER where it is esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) for storage as cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester droplets (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</a>)."

Before the current understanding of SREBP was obtained, it was suggested that LDL-derived cholesterol moves from lysosomes to the PM, and after the capacity of the PM is saturated, then secondarily to the ER (<a href=\"#bib43\">Xu and Tabas, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lange et al., 1997</a>). Others proposed a different route whereby cholesterol moves directly from lysosomes to the ER without involving the PM (<a href=\"#bib28\">Neufeld et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Underwood et al., 1998</a>). Studies supporting either route rely on indirect approaches to monitor the arrival of LDL-derived cholesterol at the PM and at the ER. In all studies, arrival of cholesterol at the ER was monitored by measuring the formation of cholesteryl esters mediated by ACAT, a resident ER membrane protein (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 1995</a>). On the other hand, arrival of LDL-derived cholesterol at the PM was monitored using four different methods: (1) treatment of intact cells with cholesterol oxidase, a soluble cholesterol-modifying enzyme that converts cholesterol to cholestenone (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lange et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Underwood et al., 1998</a>); (2) treatment of intact cells with 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HPCD), a soluble acceptor that extracts cholesterol from membranes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Neufeld et al., 1996</a>); (3) treatment of intact cells with amphotericin B, a polyene antibiotic that forms pores in cholesterol-rich membranes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Underwood et al., 1998</a>); and (4) lipid extraction of unfractionated whole cells, followed by thin layer chromatography (<a href=\"#bib43\">Xu and Tabas, 1991</a>).

It is possible that these complexes exist in the PM of living cells.

This predicted cholesterol loss from the PM conflicts with the increase in PFO-accessible cholesterol that is detected with <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup>. To resolve this issue, we performed a time course experiment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Human fibroblasts were treated with compactin to deplete cholesterol and then incubated with [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate in the absence or presence of SMase for varying times. After the incubation, one set of cells was harvested for measurement of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate, and the other was chilled and incubated with <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup>. When incubated in the absence of SMase, the cells incorporated a very small amount of [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate into cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate, and <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding was also low (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In the presence of SMase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding rose rapidly, reaching a peak at 15 min, after which it fell by about 20%. In contrast, the content of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate was low at 15 min, and it rose progressively throughout the rest of the incubation. These data indicate that SM depletion first releases cholesterol into a PFO-accessible pool, and then the excess cholesterol is transported to the ER. The absolute amount of cholesteryl [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate formed at 2 hr (0.38 nmol/mg) was much less than we generally observed when LDL is added (for example, 7 nmol/mg per hr in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This indicates that only a small amount of cholesterol moves to the ER after SMase treatment. From the increase in <sup>125</sup>I-PFO<sup>*</sup> binding in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, we estimate the SM-sequestered cholesterol pool to be 10 mole% of PM lipids in this experiment."

How does a transcription factor residing in the cholesterol-poor ER membrane regulate the cholesterol content of the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane (PM)? Here, we show how the controlled distribution of LDL-derived cholesterol to PM and ER accomplishes this regulatory task. As long as the newly expanding LDL-derived and PFO-accessible PM cholesterol pool remains low, little cholesterol moves to the ER, SREBPs are transported to the Golgi for processing, and the cell acquires cholesterol from endogenous synthesis and uptake of LDL. As this PM pool expands, more cholesterol moves to the ER. Once this ER cholesterol surpasses a 5 mole% threshold, it blocks SREBP transport, reducing the cellular accumulation of cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib30\">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</a>). In the ER, excess cholesterol is esterified for storage as cholesteryl esters, further preventing the accumulation of excess cholesterol in the PM."

One pool is accessible to <sup>125</sup>I-PFO* binding (shown in green). In LDL-treated cells, the PFO-accessible pool accounts for 16% of PM lipids. The second pool, shown in red, is inaccessible to <sup>125</sup>I-PFO, but becomes accessible when cells are treated with SMase. The size of this SM-sequestered pool, as determined from five independent experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20136, 8</a>), ranges from 10 to 23% of total PM lipids, with a mean of 15%. The third pool, shown in purple, is termed the \u2018essential pool\u2019. This pool was also determined from the aforementioned five experiments; it accounts for 12% of PM lipids and is not accessible to <sup>125</sup>I-PFO*, even after SMase treatment. We call it \u2018essential\u2019 because reducing this pool with a high concentration of HPCD (&gt;2%) causes cells to round up and dissociate from the petri dish, which indicates that this pool is essential for PM integrity. Although all of the results in the current study were done with human fibroblasts, we also found that the PM of CHO cells contains three pools of cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

It seems likely that both PFO and cholesterol oxidase recognize the same pool of accessible cholesterol in the PM. While our work does not reveal the molecular basis of cholesterol accessibility, it is worth noting that studies on model lipid membranes have suggested a thermodynamic basis for this pool of accessible cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib32\">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lange et al., 2013</a>). According to these studies, at low concentrations of cholesterol, most of the cholesterol is tied up in complexes with phospholipids and would not be accessible to soluble proteins such as PFO or cholesterol oxidase. At higher concentrations of cholesterol, the bilayer phospholipids become limiting, and a pool of cholesterol emerges that is not tied up in complexes with phospholipids. It is this \u2018free\u2019 cholesterol that is accessible to PFO (or cholesterol oxidase). The free cholesterol concentration is related to thermodynamic quantities termed chemical activity or fugacity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</a>)."

This PFO-inaccessible pool is subdivided into the SM-sequestered pool and the essential pool. Loss of SM upon SMase treatment increases the chemical activity of cholesterol in the outer leaflet of the PM and expands the pool of PFO-accessible cholesterol. Some of this accessible cholesterol could be transferred to the inner leaflet of the PM by cholesterol flip-flop, but there is no mechanism in the PM to convert this excess cholesterol into an inert form as ACAT does in the ER membrane. Instead, the excess PM cholesterol is transported to the ER membrane by vesicular or non-vesicular pathways to shut down SREBP processing and to be converted into cholesteryl esters by ACAT (<a href=\"#bib34\">Scheek et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abi-Mosleh et al., 2009</a>). The physical nature of the SM-sequestered pool of cholesterol is not known, although a model of cholesterol-SM complexes is plausible based on studies in model membranes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">L\u00f6nnfors et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lange et al., 2013</a>). The idea of complexes of cholesterol and phospholipids is not new: more than 60 years ago, an X-ray diffraction study of nerve fibers suggested a 1:1 complex between cholesterol and phospholipid as the structural basis of the myelin sheath (<a href=\"#bib12\">Finean, 1953</a>). Higher-order structures such as the proposed lipid raft domains rich in SM and cholesterol provide an additional mechanism for cholesterol sequestration."

At the highest HPCD concentration tested (2%), the PFO-accessible pool was totally depleted, and the SM-sequestered pool was reduced by 80% (red curve in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). At this point, PM cholesterol was reduced from the control value of 45\u201322% of total PM lipids. Despite this severe reduction in PM cholesterol, the cells appeared normal by phase contrast light microscopy. When we increased the HPCD concentration above 2%, the morphology of the cells was drastically altered. The cells rounded up and many of them dissociated from the petri dish. Thus, the PM cholesterol that is retained at 2% HPCD is essential for normal PM morphology. Inasmuch as most of this residual cholesterol is neither PFO-accessible nor SM-sequestered, we term it the essential pool. The physical nature of this pool is unknown, and it may well represent multiple subpools of cholesterol in complex with PM phospholipids other than SM. The further delineation of the molecular nature of all three pools of PM cholesterol in fibroblasts and other cell types is a challenge for future membrane structural biology."

For one half, the content of unesterified cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipids was determined as previously described (<a href=\"#bib8\">Das et al., 2013</a>). Total phospholipids were estimated by multiplying the measured choline content by 1.53 to account for the proportion of phospholipids that do not contain choline (<a href=\"#bib8\">Das et al., 2013</a>). The second half was used to measure SM and ceramide content. The purified membranes were homogenized by sonication in 1.5 ml of 25 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) buffer. Immediately afterward, 20 \u03bcl of a Ceramide/Sphingolipid Internal Standard Mixture II (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added, and the mixtures were vortexed and sonicated at 40\u00b0C for 10 min. Lipids from the homogenate were extracted with 2 ml of 85:15 (vol/vol) ethyl acetate:isopropanol. SM and ceramide levels were resolved and detected using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS; ABSciex, Framingham, MA) through an electrospray ionization interface (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shaner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hammad et al., 2010</a>). The mole% of individual lipid classes is defined as the moles of the indicated lipid divided by the sum of the moles of cholesterol, phospholipids, and ceramide. The total moles of the four most abundant species of SM and of ceramide, as determined by MS analysis, are referred to as total SM and total ceramide, respectively (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."
