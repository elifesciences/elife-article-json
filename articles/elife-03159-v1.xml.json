We report atypical coupling of neuronal CB1Rs, after activation by endo- or exocannabinoids such as the marijuana component \u2206<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol, to heterotrimeric G<sub>12</sub>/<sub>G13</sub> proteins that triggers rapid and reversible non-muscle myosin II (NM II) dependent contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, through a Rho-GTPase and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). This induces rapid neuronal remodeling, such as retraction of neurites and axonal growth cones, elevated neuronal rigidity and reshaping of somatodendritic morphology. Chronic pharmacological inhibition of NM II prevents cannabinoid-induced reduction of dendritic development <i>in vitro</i> and leads, similarly to blockade of endocannabinoid action, to excessive growth of corticofugal axons into the subventricular zone <i>in vivo</i>. Our results suggest that CB1R can rapidly transform the neuronal cytoskeleton through actomyosin contractility, resulting in cellular remodeling events ultimately able to affect brain architecture and wiring."
