Experimentation in 3-D presents challenges, especially with virulent pathogens. <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) kills more humans than any other infection and is characterised by a spatially organised immune response and extracellular matrix remodelling. We developed a 3-D system incorporating virulent mycobacteria, primary human blood mononuclear cells and collagen\u2013alginate matrix to dissect the host-pathogen interaction. Infection in 3-D led to greater cellular survival and permitted longitudinal analysis over 21 days. Key features of human tuberculosis develop, and extracellular matrix integrity favours the host over the pathogen. We optimised multiparameter readouts to study emerging therapeutic interventions: cytokine supplementation, host-directed therapy and immunoaugmentation. Each intervention modulates the host-pathogen interaction, but has both beneficial and harmful effects. This methodology has wide applicability to investigate infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases and develop novel drug regimes and vaccination approaches."

Experimentation in 3-D presents challenges, especially with virulent pathogens. <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) kills more humans than any other infection and is characterised by a spatially organised immune response and extracellular matrix remodelling. We developed a 3-D system incorporating virulent mycobacteria, primary human blood mononuclear cells and collagen\u2013alginate matrix to dissect the host-pathogen interaction. Infection in 3-D led to greater cellular survival and permitted longitudinal analysis over 21 days. Key features of human tuberculosis develop, and extracellular matrix integrity favours the host over the pathogen. We optimised multiparameter readouts to study emerging therapeutic interventions: cytokine supplementation, host-directed therapy and immunoaugmentation. Each intervention modulates the host-pathogen interaction, but has both beneficial and harmful effects. This methodology has wide applicability to investigate infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases and develop novel drug regimes and vaccination approaches."

Furthermore, the extracellular matrix regulates cell biology (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schwartz and Chen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Parker et al., 2014</a>) and infection biology differs between 2-D and 3-D systems (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barrila et al., 2010</a>). Human disease occurs in 3-D and in the context of extracellular matrix. Consequently, conclusions drawn from 2-dimensional cell culture systems may not fully reflect events in vivo (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</a>). This presents a challenge to progress from standard culture systems, where cells are grown in 2-D on plastic, to more advanced systems that more faithfully replicate events in man (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamada and Cukierman, 2007</a>). These technical difficulties are particularly marked in studying infectious diseases, where experiments must have additional levels of containment to prevent the release of pathogens (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrila et al., 2010</a>)."

Unfortunately, despite major investment in research, recent clinical trials and vaccine studies to reduce the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) have been unsuccessful (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tameris et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ndiaye et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Warner and Mizrahi, 2014</a>), indicating that the model systems that informed these studies require further refinement. In TB, the host-pathogen interaction is highly complex, with the immune response concurrently necessary for containment of infection but paradoxically also driving immunopathology that leads to lung destruction and transmission (<a href=\"#bib60\">Russell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Elkington and Friedland, 2015</a>). The mouse is the principal model system to study TB, but inflammatory conditions in the mouse differ from man (<a href=\"#bib62\">Seok et al., 2013</a>), and lung pathology is different in murine Mtb infection (<a href=\"#bib72\">Young, 2009</a>). Mtb is an obligate human pathogen and has a very prolonged interaction with host cells, surviving within professional phagocytes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Russell, 2011</a>). Therefore, long term human culture experiments are required to investigate pathogenesis. A specific advantage of 3-D cell culture incorporating extracellular matrix is that cellular survival is greatly prolonged (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buchheit et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mueller-Klieser, 1997</a>). Furthermore, inflammatory signalling in TB granulomas is spatially organised (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marakalala et al., 2016</a>), with specific microenvironments (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mattila et al., 2013</a>), and the extracellular matrix regulates cell survival in TB (<a href=\"#bib2\">Al Shammari et al., 2015</a>), indicating that an optimal system to study human disease will need to be 3-D with extracellular matrix."

We addressed the technical challenges of performing these experiments at biosafety containment level three by adopting a bioengineering approach (<a href=\"#bib69\">Workman et al., 2014</a>). We developed a model system that permits interrogation of the host-pathogen interaction in 3-D in the context of extracellular matrix. We demonstrate that cardinal features of human disease develop and that the host immune response is significantly different when cells are adherent to collagen, favouring the host relative to the pathogen. We investigate emerging therapeutic approaches in the system, and demonstrate that each intervention has both beneficial and likely harmful effects. The model permits the concurrent analysis of multiple outcomes and therefore can be used to develop optimal approaches to address the TB pandemic, and can be applied to diverse infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases."

Quantitation demonstrated significantly more aggregates in infected microspheres than unifected microspheres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). One day after infection, a quarter of monocytes had phagocytosed Mtb, analyzed by flow cytometric analysis of cells infected with GFP-expressing Mtb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). After 14 days of incubation, large cellular aggregates are observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Survival of Mtb-infected cells in 3-D collagen-alginate microspheres was much greater than in 2-D culture, as analyzed by LDH release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and cellular cytotoxicity assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). An advantage of the model is that cells can be released from the microsphere by decapsulation by divalent cation chelation with EDTA and sodium citrate in HBSS for 10 min, which causes dissolution of the spheres and releases cells for downstream assays. Decapsulation did not significantly affect cell viability, with over 90% cell viability after decapsulation (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Monocytes mature into macrophages in infected microspheres, with greater expression of CD68 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Within the aggregates, multinucleate giant cells typical of human TB develop, stained for CD68 by immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). These multinucleate giant cells are similar to those that occur in human patients with pulmonary TB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). T cell differentiation occurs within microspheres, with a progressive increase in the proportion of CD4+ T cells, while the percentage of CD8+ T cells declines (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

Therefore, we studied the effect of supplementing cytokines on both host and pathogen in collagen-containing microspheres, investigating IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b2.

Mtb is an obligate human pathogen characterised by a prolonged interaction with the host (<a href=\"#bib60\">Russell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cambier et al., 2014</a>), a spatially organised immune response (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marakalala et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mattila et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Egen et al., 2008</a>) and extensive extracellular matrix turnover (<a href=\"#bib21\">Elkington et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, extended studies of human cells adherent to extracellular matrix in 3-D are likely to be essential to fully understand the host-pathogen interaction. We developed a model of human TB utilising bio-electrospray technology that replicates key features of clinical disease and optimised a multiplex readout to investigate both host and pathogen responses. We demonstrated that the extracellular matrix regulates the host immune response, consistent with reports of the ECM regulating inflammation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sorokin, 2010</a>), and found that collagen favours host control of Mtb. We then used the model to investigate novel therapeutic approaches. The system permitted prolonged culture of primary human cells, and we found that significant differences between experimental conditions often only emerged after more than 7 days, which would not have been observed in 2D culture systems where 3\u20134 days is the standard experimental duration. Our findings are consistent with other infections, where the cellular adaptions to their context determines outcome (<a href=\"#bib63\">Snijder et al., 2009</a>). This cell culture platform is highly flexible for both matrix and cellular composition within spheres and therefore has wide potential applicability within the biomedical field."

The mouse model of TB has many advantages and key findings in the mouse have been replicated in man, such as critical roles for CD4+ T cells, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Flynn and Chan, 2001</a>), but pathology in the mouse differs from human TB (<a href=\"#bib72\">Young, 2009</a>) and humanised mice are required to generate caseating lesions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calderon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Heuts et al., 2013</a>). Other advanced human cellular models of TB have been developed. For example, Altare\u2019s group has studied a prolonged model of PBMC culture with Mtb and demonstrated cell aggregate formation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Puissegur et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lay et al., 2007</a>), but this model lacks extracellular matrix. A collagen matrix-containing model has been developed by Kapoor, showing aggregation and TB dormancy (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kapoor et al., 2013</a>), but lacks the high throughput potential of the bioelectrospray system and rapid cellular recovery for multiparameter readouts. Generation of a complete human granuloma structure will require stromal cells such as fibroblasts, which are present in the periphery of TB granulomas (<a href=\"#bib51\">O'Kane et al., 2010</a>). A key next step will be to compare patients with latent TB with active TB, and those with and without HIV-co-infection, to determine whether the model can differentiate protective immunity to Mtb directly ex vivo."

Our data suggest a predominantly protective effect, and emerging data support this conclusion (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2016</a>). Similarly, we confirmed that augmentation of PGE<sub>2</sub> improves host control of mycobacterial proliferation, consistent with findings in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</a>).

For example, IFN-\u03b3 in high concentrations increases the growth of TB, whereas murine experiments predict improved control. Consistent with our findings, several previous studies have shown that IFN-\u03b3 increases Mtb growth in primary human cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vogt and Nathan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Douvas et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rook et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Crowle and Elkins, 1990</a>). The evidence for a beneficial role of IFN-\u03b3 in humans is principally supported by individuals where there is a complete absence of signalling through the IL-12/IFN pathway (<a href=\"#bib34\">Karp et al., 2015</a>), and this protective effect has clearly been shown in the mouse through both knock-out and vaccination studies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Flynn and Chan, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aagaard et al., 2011</a>). However, cohort studies have shown that a high PPD response, or high IFN-\u03b3 response to ESAT-6 or CFP-10, associates with the subsequent development of TB (<a href=\"#bib15\">Comstock et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Higuchi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">del Corral et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that an excessive IFN-\u03b3 response may be deleterious. We attempted to determine if there was a tipping point of IFN-\u03b3 concentration by adding IFN-\u03b3 neutralising antibodies to the microsphere matrix, and although we were able to demonstrate increased growth with IFN-\u03b3 neutralisation, we found a similar effect with isotype control antibodies, so it was impossible to determine if this was a specific effect. Our longitudinal observations of Mtb growth in a non-destructive manner using luminescent mycobacteria support the emerging concept that a balanced immune response is essential, and either a deficit or excess of a specific mediator may favour the pathogen (<a href=\"#bib50\">O'Garra et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gideon et al., 2015</a>). Combining the model with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will permit further interrogation of each cytokine component of the immune response."

However, the multiparamter analysis in our human system showed that PGE<sub>2</sub> increases secretion of IL-8, which is likely to drive migration of neutrophils, and PGE<sub>2</sub> also reduced host cell viability. Neutrophil recruitment has been described to have a deleterious effect on host control of infection (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kimmey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nouailles et al., 2014</a>) and therefore there is potential that this may favour Mtb, driving increased pathology, lung destruction and transmission. The peak PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration that we studied is similar to that reported in human tissue (<a href=\"#bib58\">Reiker\u00e5s et al., 2009</a>). We also found that immunoaugmentation with ESAT-6 or CFP-10 responsive T cell lines led to increased growth of Mtb. Pathogenic mycobacteria express the RD1 locus but the precise mechanism linking RD1 to pathology is not fully understood (<a href=\"#bib40\">Majlessi et al., 2015</a>). Our findings are consistent with the recent observations that T cell epitopes are hyperconserved in pathogenic mycobacteria (<a href=\"#bib14\">Comas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Coscolla et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2015</a>), indicating an evolutionary advantage to the pathogen of specifically stimulating components of the host immune response to facilitate transmission (<a href=\"#bib52\">Orme et al., 2015</a>). However, an alternative explanation is that the in vitro expansion conditions generated a T cell phenotype that was permissive to Mtb growth, skewing an initially protective phenotype to a deleterious one, and so further confirmation across different\u00a0T\u00a0cell lines is required. Augmented iNKT cells did not increase Mtb growth after ex vivo expansion. The key conclusion of these experiments is that the immunoaugmentation model has potential to dissect protective versus pathological host immune responses."

Our data suggest that simply driving an increased immune response to Mtb will not improve control of mycobacterial growth. Augmenting PGE<sub>2</sub> release by modulating the leukotriene pathway may reduce mycobacterial proliferation but may come at a cost of increased pathology. Vaccination using ESAT-6 as an antigen, which has entered human trials (<a href=\"#bib39\">Luabeya et al., 2015</a>), may actually favour Mtb growth under certain circumstances, demonstrating the fine balance between the host immune response and control of pathogen growth. Critically, our data from the bioengineered model are consistent with clinical phenomena observed in human TB. For example, an excessive immune response in patients is associated with greater pulmonary pathology (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaufmann and Dorhoi, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Comstock et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Philips and Ernst, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nunes-Alves et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, our immunoaugmentation studies concur with the expression of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 by pathogenic mycobacteria, implying a critical role in causing disease (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brites and Gagneux, 2015</a>). The model can be used to investigate approaches currently in development, such as vaccines based on targeting CD1-restricted T cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Van Rhijn et al., 2015</a>) and emerging host-directed therapies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hawn et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zumla et al., 2015</a>), to determine whether they confer greater protection without likely harmful effects."

Integration with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will permit genetic manipulation of both host and pathogen (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chakraborty et al., 2014</a>). The multiparameter readouts define the translational potential of novel interventions over time with longitudinal data acquisition, identifying both beneficial and deleterious effects.

Therefore, the exacerbation of growth when specific T cells were added to the microsphere must be further investigated and validated. First, a titration of T cells should be performed \u2013 is there a tipping point for numbers of T cells, and how was the number of T cells determined? In addition, what is the phenotype of those T cells in terms of cytokine production (a feature of how they were generated)? Since this result is not intuitive, it must be further investigated.</i>"

There is significantly increased secretion of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion in augmented microspheres. We have amended the Discussion (fourth paragraph) to include the evidence that ESAT-6 can be protective, and also cite human data where an increased IFN-\u03b3 response correlates with the subsequent development of TB. These contrasting observations demonstrate that the host immune response to TB is highly nuanced and a greater response does not consistently correlate with greater protection."

We accept that the ex vivo proliferation may have created an adverse T cell phenotype, and so have amended the text discussing whether the expansion protocol has led to a non-controlling phenotype (Discussion, fifth paragraph). We have also included future potential experiments to investigate this possibility."
