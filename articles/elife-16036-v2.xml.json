Here, by combining this approach with correlative light and electron microscopy, we address the role of clathrin in this process. During endocytosis, clathrin forms a cage-like coat around the membrane and associated protein components. There is growing evidence that clathrin does not determine the membrane morphology of the invagination but rather modulates the progression of endocytosis. We investigate how the deletion of clathrin heavy chain impairs the dynamics and the morphology of the endocytic membrane in budding yeast. Our results show that clathrin is not required for elongating or shaping the endocytic membrane invagination. Instead, we find that clathrin contributes to the regularity of vesicle scission and thereby to controlling vesicle size."

Here, by combining this approach with correlative light and electron microscopy, we address the role of clathrin in this process. During endocytosis, clathrin forms a cage-like coat around the membrane and associated protein components. There is growing evidence that clathrin does not determine the membrane morphology of the invagination but rather modulates the progression of endocytosis. We investigate how the deletion of clathrin heavy chain impairs the dynamics and the morphology of the endocytic membrane in budding yeast. Our results show that clathrin is not required for elongating or shaping the endocytic membrane invagination. Instead, we find that clathrin contributes to the regularity of vesicle scission and thereby to controlling vesicle size."

The cage-forming protein clathrin is a major coat component thought to scaffold membrane and protein machinery during vesicle formation. In yeast, clathrin contributes to actin-dependent endocytosis and is present at all endocytic sites but is not essential for endocytic uptake (<a href=\"#bib19\">Newpher et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Payne et al., 1988</a>). Previous research has shown that upon deletion of clathrin heavy chain, there is a 73% reduction in the frequency of endocytic vesicle budding events (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kaksonen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Newpher and Lemmon, 2006a</a>), which can explain the reduced rate of receptor-mediated uptake (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Payne et al., 1988</a>). The clathrin heavy chain deletion phenotype can be partially rescued by overexpression of clathrin light chain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Newpher et al., 2006b</a>). These findings suggest a role for clathrin in efficiently initiating vesicle budding. Although deletion of clathrin heavy chain also causes a strong growth phenotype and accumulation of internal membrane compartments (<a href=\"#bib20\">Payne et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Payne and Schekman, 1985</a>), the reduction of receptor-mediated endocytosis is independent of these effects (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tan et al., 1993</a>). The abnormal morphology and slow growth of clathrin-deficient cells is likely a downstream, cumulative effect of disrupted clathrin-mediated vesicle formation at the trans-Golgi network, endosomes and plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib19\">Newpher et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Brodsky et al., 2001</a>)."

However, roles for clathrin at stages following initiation are not clear. Clathrin is able to induce membrane curvature in vitro (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dannhauser and Ungewickell, 2012</a>), but the distribution of endocytic invagination depths as well as the localization of endocytic coat components observed by immuno-electron microscopy do not change significantly upon clathrin deletion, suggesting that clathrin does not define membrane morphology in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Idrissi et al., 2012</a>). We have previously proposed that clathrin assembles on a flat membrane and only forms a curved lattice upon actin-induced membrane bending in yeast (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kukulski et al., 2012a</a>). In mammalian cells, it was recently shown that the curvature of the clathrin coat changes during vesicle budding (<a href=\"#bib1\">Avinoam et al., 2015</a>). Thus, there is growing evidence that the clathrin coat is not a rigid scaffold that imposes shape to the forming endocytic vesicle."

The Sla1 protein assembles into the endocytic coat before the membrane starts bending and then moves in at the tip of the membrane invagination (<a href=\"#bib22\">Picco et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Idrissi et al., 2008</a>). Although fewer endocytic sites are observed in <i>chc1\u2206</i> cells, Sla1 marks those that successfully initiate budding (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kaksonen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Newpher and Lemmon, 2006a</a>). The distribution of Sla1 on the invagination is not altered by the deletion of clathrin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Idrissi et al., 2012</a>). The movement of the Sla1-GFP centroid, therefore, acts as a marker for the growth of the endocytic membrane invagination (<a href=\"#bib22\">Picco et al., 2015</a>). We tracked the fluorescence intensity and movement of Sla1-GFP in living wild-type and <i>chc1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The total lifetime of Sla1-GFP at the endocytic sites was shortened in <i>chc1\u2206</i> cells, due to an accelerated assembly phase, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kaksonen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Newpher and Lemmon, 2006a</a>), and Sla1-GFP disassembly at the end of the endocytic process was subtly slowed down (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The Sla1-GFP centroids moved slightly further into the cell than in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), probably as a consequence of the slowed disassembly of Sla1-GFP that allowed us to track the patches in the cytoplasm for longer. The rate of the Sla1-GFP centroid movement in <i>chc1</i>\u0394 cells was indistinguishable from that of Sla1-GFP in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). Thus, the speed at which the invagination elongates was not affected by the lack of clathrin."

Rvs167 is an amphiphysin-like BAR domain protein that assembles at the tubular part of the invagination and regulates vesicle scission (<a href=\"#bib22\">Picco et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kukulski et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Youn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Kishimoto et al., 2011</a>). In wild-type cells, the peak in Rvs167-GFP fluorescence intensity coincides with scission (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kukulski et al., 2012a</a>) and the rapid directional disassembly of Rvs167 after scission leads to a fast inward movement of the Rvs167-GFP centroid (<a href=\"#bib22\">Picco et al., 2015</a>). Rvs167-GFP movement and peak fluorescence intensity therefore act as markers for vesicle scission in wild-type cells. The Rvs167-GFP centroid trajectories in <i>chc1</i>\u0394 cells often did not display the characteristic fast inward movement observed in wild-type cells, but appeared highly irregular (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Due to this irregularity, we could not align and average the Rvs167-GFP centroid movements as we did for Sla1-GFP. When we examined the fluorescence intensity of Rvs167-GFP at the endocytic sites, we found that the time taken to assemble Rvs167-GFP molecules at the endocytic site was similar in both <i>chc1</i>\u0394 and wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, after the assembly phase, the fluorescence intensity of Rvs167-GFP persisted significantly longer in <i>chc1</i>\u0394 cells than in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These findings suggest that the disassembly of Rvs167 molecules and thereby the regulation of vesicle scission are impaired in <i>chc1</i>\u0394 cells."

We reconstructed electron tomograms of 59 endocytic sites marked by Abp1-mCherry, or by both Abp1-mCherry and Sla1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, see also 'Materials and methods'). From these data, we extracted membrane profiles of invaginations and analyzed their shapes. We measured invagination depth, curvature of invagination tips (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), appearance of tubular segments and position of the neck (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All parameters showed a similar distribution as in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kukulski et al., 2012a</a>). We next measured the axes of ellipsoids fitted to endocytic vesicles. We calculated vesicle surface areas and found that on average they were similar to wild-type, but the variance was significantly larger (<i>chc1</i>\u0394: mean 7\u2019291 nm<sup>2</sup>,\u00a0SD 4\u2019373 nm<sup>2</sup>, n\u00a0=\u00a051. wt: mean 6\u2019380 nm<sup>2</sup>,\u00a0SD 1\u2019929 nm<sup>2</sup>, n\u00a0=\u00a062. p&lt;0.0001 for variances) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, see also 'Materials and methods').

We thus conclude that the invagination process is unaltered, and neither elongation nor shaping of the invagination requires clathrin. Clathrin has been shown to induce membrane curvature in vitro (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dannhauser and Ungewickell, 2012</a>), and we cannot rule out that it has a membrane sculpting role in other vesicle budding events, for instance when the membrane is subjected to less pressure than the turgor of the yeast cell. Furthermore, we observed that disassembly of Rvs167-GFP, which is a marker for scission in wild-type cells, became highly irregular in <i>chc1\u0394</i> cells and the resulting vesicles were significantly more variable in size. Since invagination morphologies were unchanged, it is likely that the here described variability of vesicle sizes is related to a loss of regulation of the position of the scission site or of the correct timing of the scission event. How clathrin modulates disassembly of Rvs167 is an open question: The two proteins occupy adjacent regions on the endocytic invagination (<a href=\"#bib6\">Idrissi et al., 2008</a>), and in vertebrates, amphiphysins bind directly to clathrin and the endocytic adaptor AP-2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">McMahon et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ramjaun and McPherson, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Slepnev et al., 2000</a>). Thus, we speculate that protein-protein interactions involving clathrin could modulate the disassembly dynamics of Rvs167, either through direct binding or recruitment of other regulatory proteins."

Thus, the parameters extracted from the <i>chc1</i>\u0394 dataset could be directly compared to the wild-type data. In brief, we used the EM package in Amira (<a href=\"#bib23\">Pruggnaller et al., 2008</a>) to click points on the cytosolic leaflet of all invaginating membranes in a virtual tomographic slice showing the long axis of the invagination. The sets of points were aligned to an x-axis that represents the plasma membrane, and interpolated with a local second-degree polynomial fit in MATLAB. We used this data to determine the invagination depth, appearance of tubular segments, radius of the invagination tip and the position of the invagination neck (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kukulski et al., 2012a</a>). The Amira EM package was also used to click points on the cytosolic leaflet of vesicle membranes within the tomographic volume. The points were used to fit an ellipsoid (MATLAB) and extract the three major axes from the vesicle. These were used to calculate the vesicle membrane surface area (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kukulski et al., 2012a</a>). We used GraphPad Prism for statistical analysis and comparisons of data sets."

The authors report that <i>chc1</i>\u2206 does not affect elongation or morphology of endocytic invaginations. However they describe significant persistence of Rvs167 at endocytic invaginations and a greater variability in the size of endocytic vesicles in <i>chc1</i>\u2206 cells. Based on these findings the authors propose that clathrin is not required for membrane invagination but instead regulates vesicle scission and size. Although there are some issues with interpretation of the data, the findings generally support the conclusions and will be of general interest. The work is appropriate as a Research Advance because it extends a previous study published in <i>eLife</i> (Picco et al., v4:e4535) by adding correlative light and EM analysis to investigate the question of clathrin function, which was not considered in the published work."

Thus, we speculate that protein-protein interactions involving clathrin could modulate the disassembly dynamics of Rvs167, either through direct binding or recruitment of other regulatory proteins.\u201d"
