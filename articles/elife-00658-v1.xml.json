TRPM5 was required for PMA and ATP-induced secretion of MUC5AC from the post-Golgi secretory granules. Stable knockdown of TRPM5 reduced a TRPM5-like current and ATP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. ATP-induced MUC5AC secretion depended strongly on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which was markedly reduced in TRPM5 knockdown cells. The difference in ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry between control and TRPM5 knockdown cells was abrogated in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and by inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX). Accordingly, MUC5AC secretion was reduced by inhibition of NCX. Thus TRPM5 activation by ATP couples TRPM5-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> entry to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via an NCX to trigger MUC5AC secretion."

TRPM5 was required for PMA and ATP-induced secretion of MUC5AC from the post-Golgi secretory granules. Stable knockdown of TRPM5 reduced a TRPM5-like current and ATP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. ATP-induced MUC5AC secretion depended strongly on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which was markedly reduced in TRPM5 knockdown cells. The difference in ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry between control and TRPM5 knockdown cells was abrogated in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and by inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX). Accordingly, MUC5AC secretion was reduced by inhibition of NCX. Thus TRPM5 activation by ATP couples TRPM5-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> entry to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via an NCX to trigger MUC5AC secretion."

This protein is activated when the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside the cell increases, and its activation allows sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions to enter the cells. These intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions are then exchanged for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from outside the cell, and these Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions then couple to the molecular machinery that is responsible for the secretion of the mucins."

The next step is to determine how the other 15 genes are involved in mucin secretion and, in the longer term, explore how these insights might be translated into treatments for cystic fibrosis and other conditions associated with defective mucus secretion."

The secretory or gel-forming mucin, Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is one of the major components of the mucus in the airways, and hyper- or hyposecretion of this component is a hallmark of a number of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rose and Voynow, 2006</a>). MUC5AC is also expressed at low levels in the gastrointestinal tract and, surprisingly, expressed de novo, and upregulated in colonic mucus from cancer and ulcerative colitis patients (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kocer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Byrd and Bresalier, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bu et al., 2010</a>).

Basically, mucins are packed (somehow) into MSG at the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN). MSGs undergo fusion to produce mature condensed granules that are stored in the cytoplasm. The cortical actin acts as a barrier that is reorganized in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent reaction through the input of PKC\u03b5-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wollman and Meyer, 2012</a>). The passage of mature MSGs through the actin network also requires Myo II and V. The proteins involved in the docking, priming and fusion of the MSGs are reported to include: Rab3d, Rab27, Hsc70, cysteine string protein, Synaptotagmin 2, Munc13-2, Munc13-4, Munc18b, Syntaxin 2, 3, 11, and VAMP8. However, it is not known how many of these proteins are directly involved in mucin secretion and for some, such as the MARCKS protein, the mechanism is controversial (<a href=\"#bib59\">Stumpo et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arbuzova et al., 2002</a>).

Immunofluorescence analysis of accumulated MUC5AC in secretory granules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) shows the differences between starved and nonstarved cells. The increase in protein production of MUC5AC after starvation was confirmed by dot-blotting cell lysates of nonstarved and starved N2 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Quantification of the dot blot revealed a 45-fold increase of MUC5AC protein levels in starved N2 cells compared to nonstarved N2 cells. Our findings with the dot-blot procedure confirm the lack of MUC5AC production in Hela cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). MUC5AC mRNA analysis by quantitative real-time PCR also confirmed increased MUC5AC mRNA levels in starved cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The fusion of MUC5AC-containing granules with the plasma membrane requires an external signal, which results in the production of DAG and the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores. To induce mucin secretion from the starved N2 cells, we used the DAG mimic, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Starved goblet cells were treated for 2 hr with 2 \u00b5M PMA to induce MUC5AC secretion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The extracellular MUC5AC expands and coats the cell surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We took advantage of the stickiness of the mucin film to quantitate secreted MUC5AC. After 2 hr incubation with PMA, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde followed by incubation with an anti-MUC5AC antibody and a secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody to visualize secreted mucin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To detect the intracellular pool of MUC5AC after PMA-induced release, the cells were washed extensively to remove secreted MUC5AC and then fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-MUC5AC antibody as described above (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

The results reveal that BFA treatment does not affect PMA-dependent MUC5AC secretion under the experimental conditions. Therefore, in our assay, we only measure the secretion of MUC5AC contained in the post-Golgi secretory carriers. This measurement is independent of MUC5AC synthesis, export from the ER to the late Golgi, and its sorting and packing into the secretory granules."

The hits were plotted as median of the B-score and positive hits were selected above and below a B-score of \u00b11.5. siRNAs that scored above 1.5 B-score were considered as hypersecretory phenotype and those below 1.5 B-score were considered as inhibitors of MUC5AC secretion (hyposecretory phenotype) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

TRPM5 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated monovalent cation-selective channel that responds to warm temperature and participates in the taste-receptor signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib45\">Perez et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hofmann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Talavera et al., 2005</a>). We generated a shRNA-dependent stable N2 goblet cell line depleted of TRPM5. This procedure resulted in greater than 80% reduction in the TRPM5 mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and a 50% reduction in the quantity of PMA dependent MUC5AC secreted by starved cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The defect in secretion could reflect a reduction in the total intracellular protein pool of MUC5AC. Therefore, we probed the total cell lysate from TRPM5 knockdown and control cells with an anti-MUC5AC antibody by dot blot. The dot blot was quantified and revealed no difference in the total MUC5AC contents in the TRPM5 knockdown cells compared with control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We also tested whether the reduction in secretion is due to a defect in granule formation. Intracellular granules were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-MUC5AC antibody in starved TRPM5-depleted cells. GFP-positive cells indicate the expression of TRPM5 shRNA and show that secretory granules were formed in TRPM5-depleted cells upon starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, secretion of MUC5AC is BFA-independent and therefore from a post-Golgi pool."

HA-TRPM5 was localized to the apical surface of the polarized non-starved and starved N2 cells while apical MUC5AC staining was only evident in starved N2 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). TRPM5 channel (green, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) appears proximal to the nucleus in non-starved cells because these cells are shorter in height compared with the starved-differentiated cells. Next, we checked the presence of functional TRPM5 channels at the plasma membrane of starved N2 cells. For this purpose, we carried out whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. Dialyzing N2 cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free intracellular pipette solutions resulted in negligibly low cationic current recorded; the presence of 1 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette solution generated an outwardly rectifying TRPM5-like current (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Replacement of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> by the non-permeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine reduced the inward current without affecting the outward current (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPM5 abolished Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cationic currents recorded in starved N2 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Together, these results are consistent with the participation of the TRPM5 channel in the generation of the plasma membrane, nonselective, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cationic current in N2 cells."

Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for the regulated secretion of MUC5AC and TRPM5 channel activity is known to affect cell membrane potential, we reasoned that the role of TRPM5 in MUC5AC secretion is to modulate secretagogue-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We tested whether extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was required for ATP-dependent MUC5AC secretion. N2 cells were differentiated by starvation and washed; MUC5AC secretion was then induced in either Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium for 30 min in the presence of 100 \u03bcM ATP. N2 cells cultured without Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular medium did not secrete MUC5AC upon exposure to ATP. However, there was a sixfold increase in MUC5AC secretion by differentiated N2 cells in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). To further investigate the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in this process we measured MUC5AC secretion in cells treated with thapsigargin, which promotes the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2010</a>) or in response to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin, which mainly facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cytoplasm from the extracellular medium (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). MUC5AC secretion by ionomycin was significantly higher than treatment with thapsigargin, however, these reagents were less effective, compared with ATP, in eliciting MUC5AC secretion. Together, these results indicate that the contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores is not as significant as Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from the extracellular medium for MUC5AC secretion by N2 cells."

The secreted gel-forming mucins MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6 are produced by goblet cells, which are present in the epithelia and submucosal glands of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"#bib62\">Thornton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">McGuckin et al., 2011</a>). Surprisingly, human pathologies such as colon cancer and ulcerative colitis produce MUC5AC de novo, which is then secreted (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kocer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bu et al., 2010</a>). In general, mucins are produced as a result of cell differentiation and the newly synthesized mucins, like all other secretory proteins, are transported from the ER to the Golgi membranes. In the Golgi complex, the secreted forms of mucins are sorted and packed into granules; the granules mature, fuse with the plasma membrane, predominantly by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cells, and release their content. In cells of the gastro-intestinal lining (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bou-Hanna et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barcelo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bertrand et al., 2004</a>) and eye conjunctiva (<a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 2012</a>) influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> participates in the release of mucins from the secretory granules. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent events are also essential for the release of mucins from the respiratory tract, however, the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is unclear. The general view is that mucin secretion in the airways is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores and independent of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kemp et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Davis and Dickey, 2008</a>). However, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for mucin secretion from cholinergic stimulated swine airway submucosal glands (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 2011</a>) as well as by cold and menthol stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2011</a>). The involvement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mucin secretion is therefore likely to be cell type, signal, and mucin specific. The synthesis and secretion of mucins is controlled by a large number of distinct stimuli, which poses additional problems for the identification of proteins involved in mucin homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Forstner et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Stanley and Phillips, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Epple et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Slomiany and Slomiany, 2005</a>)."

Inhibition of synthesis and secretion of mucins is linked to inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib17\">Corfield et al., 2001</a>).

Our antibody-based detection of secreted MUC5AC is relatively easy, quantitative, and highly accurate. It involves starvation-induced synthesis of MUC5AC, which is then released by treating the cells with PMA. It has recently been shown that secretion of total polymeric mucins from goblet-cell metaplastic human bronchial epithelial cultures is inhibited by BFA treatment (<a href=\"#bib44\">Okada et al., 2010</a>). This likely represents secretion of newly synthesized mucin that is secreted at some basal rate. PMA mediated MUC5AC secretion reported here is unaffected by BFA treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Our assay, therefore, measures release of MUC5AC from the post Golgi secretory storage granules."

The identification of SIPA1 and PLEK2 could help reveal the components involved in regulating Rap1, which is known to regulate actin filament dynamics in the events leading to the docking/fusion of the MUC5AC-containing secretory granules. SILV is required for the early stages of melanosome biogenesis, and goblet cells express SILV but are not known to make melanosomes. It is reasonable to propose that SILV performs an analogous function in the maturation of MUC5AC granules in the goblet cells. TAB1 and MAPK15 are likely involved in stress response-mediated synthesis and secretion of MUC5AC. The cell-surface ion channels and the GPCRs are likely involved in signaling events that lead to the secretion of MUC5AC. Future analysis of these proteins will help reveal their significance in MUC5AC homeostasis."

Bitter, sweet and umami tastants are detected by GPCRs that signal through gustducin and PLC\u03b22 in order to produce DAG and IP<sub>3</sub>. IP<sub>3</sub> activates the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER, which then activates TRPM5 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hofmann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu and Liman, 2003</a>). The activated TRPM5 affects membrane potential to control events leading to the sensation of bitterness. Interestingly, bitter taste receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in airway smooth muscle and GPCRs coupled to G<sub>\u03b1q</sub> or G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> control muscle contraction and relaxation, respectively (<a href=\"#bib19\">Deshpande et al., 2010</a>). A large number of GPCRs regulate taste signaling, but it is not clear which family members are expressed in the goblet cells and linked to the activation of TRPM5. We have found several GPCRs and ion channels that are expressed in the goblet cells and required for MUC5AC secretion. It would be important to test whether any of these GPCRs are directly linked to TRPM5 activation in the goblet cells and therefore in the events leading MUC5AC secretion."

Our results provide evidence for a novel link between TRPM5 activity and the control of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via the functional coupling of TRPM5 and NCX. NCX at the plasma membrane is one of the major means to extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup> (in exchange for Na<sup>+</sup>) from the cells. However, this transporter can also function in the reverse mode to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry when intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases. Significant Na<sup>+</sup> entry is expected to occur during activation of TRPM5 following IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Sodium entering through the TRPM5 would accumulate intracellularly, thus promoting NCX to act in the reverse mode and permit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in exchange for the exiting Na<sup>+</sup>. Such a coupling between endogenous NCX and heterologously expressed Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable TRPC3 channel has been reported (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rosker et al., 2004</a>). However, our observation describes for the first time the functional coupling between endogenous TRPM5 channel and NCX, and its physiological relevance in the context of mucin secretion."

The mucin coat is a key protective element of respiratory and intestinal epithelia, and the signals and mechanisms that underlie its synthesis and maintenance are poorly understood. Hence, the work addresses a very important question. Genetic requirements for Mucin 5AC secretion were elucidated with a siRNA-based screen of PMA-induced N2 cells that detects secreted MUC5AC. The reviewers agreed that the screen and hit validation process was rigorously executed, so there is high confidence that the PIMS gene products are key players in Muc5AC secretion, at least in the context of the N2 cell line. The second half of the manuscript uses electrophysiological experiments to address the specific role of one of the hits, TRPM5, in MUC5AC secretion. The results make a convincing case that TRPM5 plays a key and previously unappreciated role in NCX-mediated calcium influx (reverse mode) required for MUC5AC secretion, at least in a colonic cell line. However, the reviewers had three substantive concerns:"

Altogether, this is a useful approach to identify proteins required for the secretion of MUC5AC. This is similar, in principle, to the use of HeLa cells and VSV-G to study the components of the secretory pathway. And like the HeLa cells-VSV-G combination, HT29-18N2 cells-MUC5AC has revealed a number of new components in the PMA mediated, post-Golgi release of MUC5AC from the secretory granules. BFA does not affect the secretion of MUC5AC in our experimental conditions, which gives us the confidence to rule out the effects of PIMS on the synthesis, export, and sorting of MUC5AC at the TGN. The next obvious step is to test the involvement of PIMS in primary cultures of the cells that line the respiratory and digestive tract. We expect many of the PIMS will be required for the secretion of MUC5AC and other secreted mucins in other cell types, but there could be noticeable differences as well. Some of these proteins might have cell type specific isoforms or closely related proteins that function at the same step in other cell types. Identification of PIMS will help address many of these issues as we learn more about the system."
