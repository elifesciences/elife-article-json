The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) is essential for this process. However, despite decades of research, its contribution to the eye position signal remains controversial. LIP neurons have recently been reported to inaccurately represent eye position during a saccadic eye movement, and to be too slow to support a role in high-level visual functions. We addressed this issue by predicting eye position and saccade direction from the responses of populations of LIP neurons. We found that both signals were accurately predicted before, during and after a saccade. Also, the dynamics of these signals support their contribution to visual functions. These findings provide a principled understanding of the coding of information in populations of neurons within an important node of the cortical network for visual-motor behaviors."

This is surprising because the EPS is essential for our ability to perceive and interact with the world around us. For instance, the EPS combined with the visual input falling on the retina allows us to perceive the world as stable even though we move our eyes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Helmholtz, 1867</a>). The EPS also plays a role in accurate visually guided movements (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zipser and Andersen, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Salinas and Abbott, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pouget et al., 2002</a>) and motor learning (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lewis et al., 1994</a>). The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) is one of the areas representing the EPS (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andersen et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Andersen et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gnadt and Andersen, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schall and Thompson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Goldberg et al., 2002</a>). However recent studies have reported that the EPS is too slow to support the functions of spatial stability and coordinate transformations (<a href=\"#bib44\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), or is inaccurate around the time of saccadic eye movement (<a href=\"#bib25\">Morris et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Morris et al., 2013</a>). Here we show that when quantified across neuronal populations and a wide range of oculomotor behaviors, the EPS in LIP is accurate before, during, and after eye movements. Contrary to previous reports, the dynamics of the EPS are consistent with LIP supporting the aforementioned sensorimotor functions."

The population response for each saccade direction was bell-shaped and centered on the neurons that most vigorously responded for the planned saccade. We subsequently inferred the planned saccade direction based solely on these two population activities by computing the probability of a saccade direction given the observed population response (solid lines, red for 135 deg and blue for 270 deg, top panel, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Each population activity perfectly predicted (i.e., with a probability of 1) the planned saccade direction underlying it. We then asked how well saccade directions could be predicted using only one neuron instead of the entire population: the dots in bottom panel represent the responses of this neuron to the two saccade directions, and the dotted lines in the top panel show the corresponding prediction probabilities. We found that while one planned saccade direction could be well, albeit not perfectly, predicted (270 deg, blue dotted line), the other direction (135 deg, red dotted line) could not be predicted (almost uniform distribution). Predictions based on the population activity, however, were informative across all saccade directions, and could thus potentially reveal properties that were hidden at the level of single neurons. The importance of a population representation for inference is further reinforced in LIP because it contains an abundance of simultaneously expressed signals, for example eye position and saccade direction. Surprisingly, LIP has to our knowledge not yet been studied at the population level using simultaneous neuronal recordings or an exhaustive sampling of saccade directions and eye positions."

For this, we assumed that the neurons were independent and that the response statistics of each neuron followed a Poisson distribution (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We computed the time course of the NPC for the three oculomotor variables across the entire task using a population of 20 independently recorded neurons. These neurons were selected to illustrate the contribution of LIP to mediating eye position and movement information (see below). The NPC of saccade direction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) was at chance during fixation, then strongly increased during the visual epoch (transient sensory response), and finally reached a sustained level during the memory epoch. It was best predicted right after the saccade and subsequently decayed. These findings indicate that the NPC contains a prospective component consistent with the well-documented saccade planning signal (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gnadt and Andersen, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Snyder et al., 1997</a>) and a retrospective component that, albeit only available for a limited time, could be used for learning or monitoring of recent saccades. Surprisingly, the presaccade eye position was coded similarly well before and after the saccade (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), despite a new postsaccade eye position being acquired, effectively transitioning the EPS from current state to past state. The long lasting component after the saccade is consistent with a memory of where the eye had been and may be useful for learning and calibration at a longer time scale than for the saccade direction signal. The NPC of the postsaccade eye position (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) had a more intricate nature because it is the combination of the presaccade eye position and saccade direction signals (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As such, it was predictive of the postsaccade position even during the fixation epoch, and its accuracy strongly increased when the saccade direction information was made available (target onset). The NPC anticipated the future eye position long before the saccade, thus showing a prospective coding. This prediction may result from the simultaneous representation of both the presaccade eye position and the planned eye movement direction after the saccade target onset. The NPC was most accurate when the postsaccade eye position was realized, effectively transitioning from a predictive presaccade state to an updated current postsaccade state."

The NPC of the postsaccade eye position strongly increased around the saccade onset, thus transitioning from a predictive to a current state. In some cases the signal rose before, and some cases after the saccade. These findings suggest that the EPS at the saccade onset has corollary discharge and proprioceptive components respectively. This result contrasts with the presaccade signal that began before the fixation was acquired (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We hypothesize that this difference is due to the multiplicative effect (gain field) of a visual inputs (fixation light) and eye position that may lower the threshold for cell activity, thus producing an earlier expression of the presaccade eye position signal. The peak of the NPC occurred after the saccade, consistent with a proprioceptive contribution. Contrary to recent findings (<a href=\"#bib44\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), our results show that the EPS was fast enough to represent eye position, in fact being very prospective, and that gain fields are updated almost instantly."

These findings favor the three hypothesized roles of the EPS. First, visual perceptual stability requires an EPS that is fast, as corroborated by our findings. We however also found that the EPS, at least in LIP, does not reflect visual mislocalization around the saccade (the accuracy of the NPC does not decrease around the saccade), thus suggesting that this might take place in another visual-motor area. Second, we found that the EPS can have a central function for coordinate transformations because the EPS was fast and present immediately before and after the eye movement. The EPS is ideally suited for state estimation because it is composed of sensory feedback (proprioception) and forward model (corollary discharge) signals. It can thus give the best estimate of the current state of the eye and is also consistent with the \u2018remapping\u2019 seen across eye movements (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duhamel et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vaziri et al., 2006</a>).

The animals had to remember the target location for 1300 ms \u00b1 200 ms (drawn from a uniform distribution). Upon extinction of the fixation, they made a saccade to the remembered target location in complete darkness, thus acquiring a postsaccade fixation on a 5 \u00d7 5 grid. They maintained fixation there for 500 ms (fixation I) in the absence of visual input. A fixation light was subsequently turned on at the target location for another 500 ms, possibly triggering a small corrective saccade. Upon completion of this second fixation (fixation II), the stimulus was removed and the animals were rewarded by a drop of water. We only considered correct trials. The animals completed \u223c11 random blocks, for a total of \u223c11 \u00d7 ((3 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 8) = 792 saccades.

One novelty of this task is that eye position and saccade directions were sampled exhaustively on a Cartesian grid, thus yielding a complete set of independent oculomotor variables. In contrast to previous single neurons studies where behaviors were tailored to best drive a given neuron (e.g., preferred and anti-preferred saccade direction), another novelty of the task resides in the fact that we used a fixed and finite set of oculomotor behaviors to drive neuronal populations as a whole."

At the beginning of each recording session, we verified that each electrode tip was located in LIP by obtaining a vigorous sensory, planning and motor activity during a center-out delayed memory saccade task. Each animal was recorded in a different hemisphere. Hence, when combining the neuronal populations recorded in both animals, we were able to overcome the component of the sampling bias associated with the fact that LIP has contralateral response fields for visual stimuli and movement direction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Quian Quiroga et al., 2006</a>).

These behaviors were entangled in a single population response. In each trial, the animal executed one out of a total of 9 \u00d7 8 = 72 oculomotor behaviors. Each population response thus predicted one saccade direction and one presaccade eye position. Because presaccade eye position and saccade direction were independent, their respective NPCs were computed separately, for example the NPC for the saccade direction was determined using the fraction of correct saccade direction estimates across all trials. The postsaccade eye position was the vector sum of the presaccade eye position and the saccade direction. Multiple presaccade eye positions and saccade directions could yield the same postsaccade eye position. The postsaccade eye position was thus dependent on the presaccade eye position and the saccade direction. We explicitly modeled this dependency in the Bayesian framework by translating the vector sum of the behaviors into a marginalization of the posterior distributions: the posterior of the postsaccade eye position was the sum across the posteriors of all presaccade eye positions and saccade directions that yielded the same postsaccade eye position. In other words, the vector sum of the behaviors translated into a sum of their respective posteriors."

The saccade onset (reaction time) was determined offline based on the saccade velocity using a method adapted from (<a href=\"#bib13\">Engbert and Kliegl, 2003</a>). For each neuron, we subsequently computed the spike counts over causal boxcar windows (rectangular windows looking only in the past) of length 250 ms sliding in 10 ms steps. We chose a length of 250 ms because this interval is short enough compared to the length of the epochs in the task, but long enough to have sufficient spike counts for decoding. For each time step, we then computed the prediction accuracy (mean \u00b1 SEM from bootstrap estimates), yielding the time course of the NPC. The inference was thus done on intervals of identical length (250 ms) across the entire task."

RNE finds the subset of most important neurons by iteratively removing neurons that least affect the accuracy of the NPC. We first pooled all recording sessions that had at least nine trials per oculomotor behavior, for a total of 325 independently recorded neurons. We then found the neuron(s) that when removed from the population maximized the decoding accuracy across the remaining neurons. We iteratively applied this procedure to the remaining neurons, thus creating a list of neurons ranked from least to most important. The decoding accuracy was averaged across the three behaviors because the same neuronal subset was used to predict each one of them. Also, we determined the decoding accuracies using the root mean square across the task epochs that best mediate each behavior: the memory, fixation and fixation II epochs for the saccade direction, pre- and postsaccade eye position respectively."

As such RNE can be used to assess the sparseness of the NPC. Also, RNE is a quantitative method to address sampling bias in large neuronal populations. Finally, once an \u2018optimized\u2019 subset is defined, the accuracy of the NPC for this subset can be used to correct the accuracy of the NPC for each empirical population by scaling its average decoding accuracy to mach the one of the \u2018optimized\u2019 subset."
