Human to mosquito transmission was assessed using 171 direct mosquito feeding assays conducted in Burkina Faso and Kenya. <i>Plasmodium</i> <i>falciparum</i> infects <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> efficiently at low densities (4% mosquitoes at 1/\u00b5l blood), although substantially more (&gt;200/\u00b5l) are required to increase infection further. In a site in Burkina Faso, children harbour more gametocytes than adults though the non-linear relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection means that (per person) they only contribute slightly more to transmission. This method can be used to determine the reservoir of infection in different endemic settings. Interventions reducing gametocyte density need to be highly effective in order to halt human\u2013mosquito transmission, although their use can be optimised by targeting those contributing the most to transmission."

Human to mosquito transmission was assessed using 171 direct mosquito feeding assays conducted in Burkina Faso and Kenya. <i>Plasmodium</i> <i>falciparum</i> infects <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> efficiently at low densities (4% mosquitoes at 1/\u00b5l blood), although substantially more (&gt;200/\u00b5l) are required to increase infection further. In a site in Burkina Faso, children harbour more gametocytes than adults though the non-linear relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection means that (per person) they only contribute slightly more to transmission. This method can be used to determine the reservoir of infection in different endemic settings. Interventions reducing gametocyte density need to be highly effective in order to halt human\u2013mosquito transmission, although their use can be optimised by targeting those contributing the most to transmission."

Male and female transmission stages (gametocytes) are ingested by the mosquito and reproduce sexually in its stomach before developing into oocysts. Once oocysts establish, it is assumed that mosquitoes will form infectious sporozoites, so the proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts is used as a measure of mosquito infectivity. In the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, mosquito infection is thought to increase with the number of gametocytes ingested by the mosquito (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jeffery and Eyles, 1955</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Graves et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</a>). However, several studies have failed to find an association (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boudin et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haji et al., 1996</a>), and the precise shape of the relationship has never been rigorously quantified, particularly at very low gametocyte densities. Difficulties arise because estimates of gametocyte density have relied on microscopy, which may miss up to 80% of parasites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dowling and Shute, 1966</a>). More sensitive molecular methods such as Pfs25mRNA quantitative nucleic acid sequence\u2013based amplification (QT-NASBA) have been developed (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schneider et al., 2004</a>). Unlike conventional microscopy, this technique enables gametocyte densities to be quantified over the entire epidemiologically relevant range."

A wide range of novel transmission-reducing drugs and vaccines are currently under development, which aim to reduce malaria incidence by restricting human to mosquito transmission. The transmission-reducing ability of front-line therapeutics (such as artemisinin-based combination therapies [ACTs], or potential combinations of ACTs with gametocytocidal drugs) is also gaining increased attention (<a href=\"#bib44\">WHO, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">White, 2013</a>). It is likely that these interventions will be partially effective, but it remains unclear how much they need to reduce transmission from humans to mosquitoes in a particular location, and to which age groups they should be delivered in order to halt malaria transmission."

Greater complexity, however, will be required to capture fully malaria population dynamics following the introduction of drugs and vaccines that specifically target transmission stages. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently recommended that in pre-elimination or elimination malaria programmes, single-dose primaquine (0\u00b725 mg base per kg) with an ACT should be given to all patients with <i>falciparum</i> malaria except pregnant women and infants &lt;1 year old (<a href=\"#bib44\">WHO, 2012</a>).

Infection rises rapidly with increasing gametocyte density, and by 1 gametocyte per microlitre, \u223c4% (95% Bayesian credible interval [CI], 3\u20135%) of all mosquitoes develop oocysts. The subsequent increase in infection with increasing gametocyte density is best described by the Gompertz model (deviance information criterion [DIC] = 1034), which gave a significantly better fit than the linear (DIC = 1073), power (DIC = 1059), or hyperbolic (DIC = 1062) functions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The best-fit model predicts that increasing density from 1 to 200 gametocytes per microlitre does not appreciably increase infection. Beyond 200 gametocytes per microlitre, infection rises again to finally plateau at \u223c18% infected mosquitoes. Gametocyte density on an arithmetic scale was a better predictor of mosquito infection than gametocyte density on a logarithmic scale.

The efficiency with which <i>P. falciparum</i> gametocytes can infect mosquitoes means that transmission-reducing interventions, which reduce gametocyte density, will need to be highly effective in order to reduce human\u2013mosquito transmission. Gametocytes can infect mosquitoes at very low densities, despite the mosquito needing to ingest both male and female parasites in the same blood meal. Substantial transmission was seen from hosts with &lt;1 gametocyte per microlitre of blood. After this initial increase in infection, considerably more gametocytes are required in order to increase further the proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts. The causes of this are unclear, but experimental systems may be informative. Data from the rodent malaria model <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sinden et al., 2007</a>) suggest that the phenomenon could be associated with parasite mortality during penetration of the mosquito gut wall or due to the mosquito\u2019s immune response. Beyond 200 gametocytes per microlitre mosquito infection rises again (although QT-NASBA measurement error makes the exact gametocyte density for this transition relatively uncertain). If an intervention can keep gametocyte density beneath 200 gametocytes per microlitre in a low transmission area, it may be sufficient to push the basic reproduction number of malaria beneath one and eliminate the disease. However, the highly overdispersed distribution of gametocytes between hosts (adequately described by the negative binomial distribution) means that in the population from Burkina Faso, 30% of transmission comes from hosts with densities beneath the microscopy detection threshold of 16 gametocytes per microlitre. This means that evaluating interventions solely on their ability to reduce microscopically detectable gametocytes, as has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib18\">Graves et al., 2012</a>), may give misleading results."

It is unclear whether asexual parasites directly influence parasite infectivity or are associated with other (here unmeasured) variables such as the multiplicity of infection (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nsango et al., 2012</a>) or factors influencing the blood environment such as immunity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</a>). <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> has asynchronous waves of asexual and sexual parasites. Circulating gametocytes take 2\u20133 days to mature before they can infect mosquitoes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lensen et al., 1999</a>), which may explain the complicated relationship between infectivity and asexual density (i.e., intermediate asexual parasite densities might occur at the start of gametocyte production and have a relatively low proportion of infectious mature gametocytes). On average, older children were more infectious, supporting previous indications that transmission-reducing immunity may predominate in young children (<a href=\"#bib13\">Drakeley et al., 2006</a>)."

Despite this, they are considerably more accurate than conventional microscopy. Molecular techniques may be highly precise in a state-of-the-art laboratory, but the practicalities of collecting and processing samples in non-ideal field settings increases the risks of incurring measurement error. Even though uncertainty is generally accepted by those conducting the experiments, measures of precision such as confidence intervals or standard errors around such density estimates are rarely reported in the scientific literature. Methods such as those presented in this article can allow robust quantitative insight to be gained from uncertain molecular methods. Care should be taken when interpreting gametocyte density estimates as it has been suggested that the marker used in this analysis (Pfs25 mRNA) might be parasite female specific (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schneider, 2006</a>). Even if the current QT-NASBA method does only detect female gametocytes, it will neither change the qualitative conclusions of this study nor their application if other studies use the same technique. However, direct comparison of our results with those of studies using different methods for quantifying gametocyte density should be aware that the shape of the relationship may differ."

The proportion of mosquitoes infected by <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected blood is known to vary substantially within and between studies. This is in part due to methodological issues with the membrane feeding assay (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bousema et al., 2013</a>) but also related to biological differences in the parasite-vector combination and the blood environment (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</a>). Further standardising the membrane feeding assay, improving the accuracy of QT-NASBA technique and the inclusion of additional covariates (such as estimates of gametocyte maturity, which have been investigated in <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chansamut et al., 2012</a>), would improve the accuracy of the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection. It would also permit the patterns described here to be checked for consistency across time and space, and enable a wider range of functional forms to be tested. Care should also be taken when interpreting the results of feeding assays as the mosquitoes used, and their biting behaviour is likely to be different from that seen in wild mosquitoes in field situations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bousema et al., 2013</a>)."

Identifying host age groups that contribute most to the reservoir of infection will allow the optimal targeting of malaria control. In the high transmission site in Burkina Faso, young children harbour the majority of gametocytes but are only slightly more infective to mosquitoes than adults. The per person contribution of adults estimated here is considerably greater than that predicted by other mathematical models (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ross et al., 2006</a>) and may increase further once age-dependent biting rates are taken into consideration (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carnevale et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ross et al., 2006</a>). The contribution of different age groups to overall transmission will depend on local demography, age-dependent protection by malaria interventions (such as the use of bed nets or time spent in the house and therefore personally protected by indoor residual spraying), and human to mosquito contact patterns. The last two of these are difficult to measure and poorly understood, reducing our ability to accurately predict the sources of infection. The reservoir of infection is likely to vary between endemicity settings and over time so multiple cross-sectional surveys may be required. The relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection will allow estimates of the reservoir of infection from cross-sectional gametocytaemia surveys without the need for logistically complicated mosquito feeding assays. The results of this article should be included within mathematical models that capture changes in gametocyte density with time (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lawpoolsri et al., 2009</a>) to evaluate the full impact that different transmission-reducing interventions will have on transmission and prioritise the most appropriate candidates according to transmission setting."

It shows that, given the ability of very low <i>P. falciparum</i> gametocyte densities to establish infection in <i>A. gambiae</i>, transmission-reducing interventions will need to be highly efficacious at reducing gametocyte density in order to halt human to mosquito transmission. The complex and non-linear shape of the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection may explain why the ability of an interventions to reduce the proportion of infected mosquitoes has been shown to depend on the parasite load of the host (<a href=\"#bib9\">Churcher et al., 2012</a>). Gametocyte density also changes with host age so the effectiveness of transmission-reducing interventions that target gametocytes will also vary with age. This should be considered in clinical trials of transmission-reducing candidate drugs and vaccines. The highly overdispersed distribution of gametocytes in the host population and the non-linear relationship between gametocytes/asexual parasite density and mosquito infection means that the impact of different transmission-reducing interventions on overall transmission at the population level will be far from intuitive."

This was done using the cross-sectional data from Burkina Faso to generate a proxy for the human reservoir of infection at this specific time in this location (although it does not take into account how vector biting rate may vary with host age). It is important to use individual host estimates of gametocyte density instead of mean estimates as the high degree of gametocyte overdispersion among hosts may accentuate the non-linear relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection. For each of the 412 hosts, point estimates were obtained of the percentage of feeding mosquitoes (taking a single full blood meal) that would develop oocysts according to the age and the gametocyte/asexual parasite density of the host (<a href=\"#eqn3\">equation 3</a>). <a href=\"#eqn5\">Equation 5</a> was used to fit a relationship between host age and their contribution towards human to mosquito transmission. This best-fit line was used to predict the percentage of overall transmission that originated from hosts who had gametocyte density estimates below the detection threshold of microscopy. Here, we define the detection threshold as the minimum (positive) density that can be estimated by sampling a certain volume of blood. It is assumed that gametocytes are counted against 500 white blood cells (WBC) and that there are on average 8000 WBC per \u00b5l of blood. This gives an average detection threshold of 16 gametocytes per microlitre of blood. This is a conservative estimate of the threshold density since densities above this value may still give false negative results both due reading errors or random sampling of gametocytes on the microscope slide."

All parameters were assigned uninformative priors and were run until convergence was reached using standard methodology (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gelman and Rubin, 1996</a>). The most parsimonious models were selected by comparing deviance information criteria (DIC) values (the lowest value giving the most parsimonious yet adequate fit) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Spiegelhalter et al., 2002</a>). Uncertainly around the best-fit line is indicated by showing the 95% range of 10,000 runs randomly sampled from the posterior distribution. The distribution of gametocytes between hosts was highly overdispersed, with an aggregation parameter of the negative binomial distribution of 0.185 (95% Bayesian credible interval [CI], 0.16\u20130.21)."

Rather, uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients of equation A1 is propagated numerically via equation A2 to yield uncertainty in the estimated gametocyte densities.

However, we feel that our dilution procedure (whereby a gametocyte sample is diluted 5 times and each generates a TTP) provides a strong validation procedure within the model. In this example the fit of the calibration line to these dilutions is relatively poor, which is the reason behind the uncertainty round the individual gametocyte density estimates being so high. We are in the process of refining the nucleic acid extraction and amplification technique and we are generating increasingly precise QT-NASBA estimates, as validated by the dilution procedure. Since this has been done on samples not related to the current study we feel that including these here would confuse the message.

The second hump is less certain since there are relatively few data points at very high gametocyte densities. There is evidence of a second plateau in these data using differently shaped functions, which is why the power and hyperbolic functions give better fits than the linear function.

The mean gametocyte density from these multiple assays was taken to increase the accuracy of the estimates. The precise shape of the relationship was determined by fitting a range of different functional forms (a modified constant, linear, power, hyperbolic, sigmoid and Gompertz functions) and statistically determining which gave the best fit (a full description of the model is given in the Supplementary files). The model quantifying the uncertainty in gametocyte density estimates was fitted at the same time as the regression determining the relationship between gametocyte density (and other covariates) and the proportion of mosquitoes infected using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Fitting the models simultaneously enables the uncertainty in the gametocyte density estimates to be reflected in the uncertainty of the best fit model.\u201d"

It would also permit to see if the patterns described here are consistent across time and space, and enable a wider range of functional forms to be tested.
