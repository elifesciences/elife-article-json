The fundamental basis of the system is the ability to capture small pieces of foreign DNA for incorporation into the genome at the CRISPR locus, a process known as Adaptation, which is dependent on the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins. We demonstrate that Cas1 catalyses an efficient trans-esterification reaction on branched DNA substrates, which represents the reverse- or disintegration reaction. Cas1 from both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Sulfolobus solfataricus</i> display sequence specific activity, with a clear preference for the nucleotides flanking the integration site at the leader-repeat 1 boundary of the CRISPR locus. Cas2 is not required for this activity and does not influence the specificity. This suggests that the inherent sequence specificity of Cas1 is a major determinant of the adaptation process."

This system is based on sections of the microbes' DNA called CRISPRs, which contain repetitive DNA sequences that are separated by short segments of \u2018spacer\u2019 DNA. When a virus invades the cell, some viral DNA is incorporated into the CRISPR as a spacer. This process is known as adaptation.

It provides immunity against viruses and other mobile genetic elements mediated through sequence homology-directed detection and destruction of foreign nucleic acid species (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib28\">Sorek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barrangou and Marraffini, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">van der Oost et al., 2014</a>). Organisms with an active CRISPR-Cas system encode one or more CRISPR loci in their genomes. These comprise a leader sequence followed by an array of short, direct, often palindromic repeats interspersed by short \u2018spacer\u2019 sequences, together with a variable number of CRISPR associated (<i>cas</i>) genes. Spacers are derived from mobile genetic elements and constitute a \u2018memory\u2019 of past infections. The CRISPR locus is transcribed from the leader, generating pre-CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) that is subsequently processed into unit length crRNA species and loaded into large ribonucleoprotein complexes. These complexes, known as \u2018Interference\u2019, \u2018Effector\u2019 or \u2018Surveillance\u2019 complexes, utilize crRNA to detect and degrade cognate invading genetic entities, providing immunity against previously encountered viruses and plasmids."

This process underpins the whole CRISPR-Cas system, but is the least well understood aspect. Fundamentally, acquisition can be separated into two steps: the capture of new DNA sequences from mobile genetic elements, followed by the integration of that DNA into the host genome. New spacers are incorporated proximal to the leader sequence and result in the duplication of the first repeat (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goren et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yosef et al., 2012</a>). The leader sequence proximal to the repeat is important for integration, but transcription of the locus is not required (<a href=\"#bib33\">Yosef et al., 2012</a>). New spacers are frequently incorporated in both possible orientations (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shmakov et al., 2014</a>). The integration process in <i>Escherichia coli</i> results in staggered cleavage of the first CRISPR repeat, where the 3\u2032-end of one strand of the incoming DNA is joined to the end of the CRISPR repeat in a trans-esterification (TES) reaction, with another TES reaction occurring on the other strand (<a href=\"#bib8\">Diez-Villasenor et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, numbered yellow arrows). Intermediates in this reaction have been observed in <i>E. coli</i>, and the sequence of the leader-repeat1 junction is important for the activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arslan et al., 2014</a>). The order of the two integration steps shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is not yet known, although it has been suggested that the reaction on the minus strand (site 2) occurs first in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). The sequence at site 2 is flanked by the end of the first repeat and the first spacer, and is therefore inherently less well conserved. In <i>E. coli</i>, the last nucleotide of the newly copied repeat is derived from the first nucleotide of the incoming spacer, which imposes further sequence requirements on that system (<a href=\"#bib29\">Swarts et al., 2012</a>)."

Recent work by Sorek and colleagues has shown that the <i>E. coli</i> RecBCD helicase\u2013nuclease complex, which processes DNA double-strand breaks for recombination and degrades foreign DNA, is implicated in the generation of viral DNA fragments captured by Cas1 and incorporated into the CRISPR locus as new spacers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Levy et al., 2015</a>). This confirms previous observations linking Cas1 with RecBCD (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babu et al., 2011</a>) and raises some intriguing questions as RecBCD generates ssDNA fragments asymmetrically, generating fragments tens to hundreds of nucleotides long from the 3\u2032 terminated strand and much longer fragments from the 5\u2032 terminated strand (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib9\">Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008</a>). The Cas4 enzyme, which is a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 ssDNA exonuclease (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lemak et al., 2013</a>), may provide ssDNA fragments for Cas1 in systems lacking RecBCD. However, it is difficult to see how two integration reactions could occur without two 3\u2032 hydroxyl termini (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and half-site integration is not observed with a ssDNA substrate (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>).

Initial biochemical analyses of a panel of archaeal Cas2 enzymes revealed an endonucleolytic activity against ssRNA substrates that could be abrogated by mutation of conserved residues (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beloglazova et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, Cas2 from <i>Bacillus halodurans</i> has been shown to be specific for cleavage of dsDNA substrates (<a href=\"#bib21\">Nam et al., 2012</a>). Recently however, Doudna and colleagues demonstrated that <i>E. coli</i> Cas1 and Cas2 form a stable complex in vitro and that the \u2018active site\u2019 of Cas2 was not required for spacer acquisition, suggesting that Cas2 may not have a catalytic role in spacer acquisition in vivo (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2014</a>). It is probable that Cas2 acts as an adaptor protein, either bringing two Cas1 dimers together or mediating interactions with other components necessary for spacer acquisition. Recently, Nunez et al. demonstrated that <i>E. coli</i> Cas1 can integrate a protospacer into a supercoiled plasmid in vitro, in a reaction stimulated by Cas2. Integration events were observed at the boundaries of most CRISPR repeats and in other areas of the DNA close to palindromic regions, implicating a role for palindromic DNA structure in the adaptation process (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>)."

For Cas1, the reaction is strongly sequence dependent with the specificity matching the predicted integration site 1 for both <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Sulfolobus solfataricus</i> Cas1, and does not require Cas2."

One prediction of this hypothesis is that the disintegration reaction could demonstrate some sequence preference if integration, which must happen at a specific, defined site in the CRISPR locus, is partly driven by the sequence specificity of Cas1. We therefore designed a family of related disintegration substrates by systematically varying the nucleotides flanking the TES site and tested how efficiently Cas1 could disintegrate these substrates.

For the first integration site, this should correspond to the last nucleotide of the leader sequence, which is an adenine in both <i>S. solfataricus</i> and <i>E. coli.</i> Although both Cas1 enzymes catalyzed the disintegration of substrates with an adenine at this position, clear sequence preference was not apparent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). For <i>S. solfataricus,</i> the \u22121\u2032 position on the minus strand is variable in sequence. However, in <i>E. coli</i>, site 2 occurs at the penultimate nucleotide of the repeat and therefore has a cytosine at the \u22121\u2032 position (<a href=\"#bib29\">Swarts et al., 2012</a>). In this situation, the incoming 3\u2032 terminal nucleotide of the spacer has to be a cytosine in order to complete the original repeat sequence. To mimic the TES substrate at this site more closely, we tested substrates where the first nucleotide of the 5\u2032 flap, equivalent to the incoming nucleotide in the forward reaction, was a cytosine, but a cytosine at position \u22121 was still not favoured by EcoCas1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Disintegration was analysed by denaturing gel electrophoresis, phosphorimaging and quantification of triplicate experiments. EcoCas1 disintegrated the site 1 substrate quickly, with the reaction reaching approximately 75% conversion in 3 min, which compares favorably with the best model sequence studied. Site 2 was also a good disintegration substrate, though it was converted significantly more slowly than site 1, perhaps due to the presence of a disfavored cytosine at position \u22121."

Consequently we still do not have a clear understanding of the roles of Cas1, Cas2 and host proteins in the acquisition mechanism. In this study we investigated the integration reaction by focusing on the biochemistry of the Cas1 protein from <i>S. solfataricus</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. Efficient TES of branched DNA substrates with a 5\u2032-flap or duplex arm is clearly possible for both <i>S. solfataricus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> Cas1 in vitro. This is a very precise reaction requiring attack by a 3\u2032-hydroxyl at the branch point, generating a perfect DNA duplex. The reaction almost certainly represents the disintegration reaction that is the reverse of the spacer integration step, as observed for many integrases and transposases where it represents a very useful means to study the underlying integration mechanism (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gerton et al., 1999</a>). Evidence for a disintegration activity was recently described by Doudna and colleagues for EcoCas1, but the activity observed was relatively weak, most likely because the branched substrate studied had a non-optimal DNA sequence around the branch point (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>)."

It has also been suggested that CRISPR repeat sequences, which are often palindromic, form four-way DNA junctions in supercoiled DNA, acting as a recognition signal for Cas1, a possibility that is supported by the observation that EcoCas1 can cut four-way DNA junctions in vitro (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babu et al., 2011</a>), and the finding that spacer integration in a plasmid lacking a CRISPR locus occurs preferentially next to a palindromic site (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). However, a palindrome alone is not sufficient to support spacer insertion in <i>E. coli</i> in vivo (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arslan et al., 2014</a>), and this also holds for the type II CRISPR system of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Wei et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that local sequence helps determine the integration site. Furthermore, some CRISPR repeat families, including many in archaea, have little or no palindromic nature and thus cannot form stable hairpin structures (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kunin et al., 2007</a>). Cas1 therefore might be expected to act as a sequence specific integrase, although local DNA structure could also play a part."

In particular, there is a clear preference for a guanine at position +1, corresponding to the first nucleotide of the repeat, suggesting that this residue is recognised specifically in the active site of Cas1. The specificity is particularly strong for EcoCas1, consistent with the presence of a guanine in the repeat sequence at the +1 site in both plus and minus strands. Preference for a guanine at the +1 nucleotide for EcoCas1 catalysed integration events has also been observed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). For SsoCas1, a guanine at this position was preferred over a cytosine, which is the nucleotide present at the +1\u2032 position on the minus strand, by a factor of five. Although the \u22121 position might also be expected to play a role in the selection of integration sites, deep sequencing data for integration catalysed by EcoCas1 revealed no sequence preference at this position (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). In agreement with this finding, we observed little evidence for sequence discrimination at the \u22121 position for the disintegration reactions catalysed by either enzyme, with the exception that EcoCas1 disfavours cytosine at this position (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). A cytosine at position \u22121 is the expected residue on the minus strand, suggesting that the disintegration reaction may better reflect the reversal of integration at site 1 in the leader-repeat junction. Deep sequencing data for integration reactions catalysed by EcoCas1 in vitro did reveal a marked preference for a guanine at position \u22122 in the integration site (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). This corresponds well with the \u22122 position in the plus strand, which is part of the leader sequence and is a guanine in <i>E. coli,</i> but cannot hold for the minus strand where the \u22122\u2032 position is inherently variable in nature. Disintegration of substrates mimicking the integration intermediates relevant for the integration of spacer 3 into the <i>E. coli</i> CRISPR array reinforce these conclusions, with site 1 on the plus strand processed significantly more quickly than site 2 on the bottom strand (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Taken together, both the disintegration specificity and the deep sequencing data for integration support the hypothesis that integration is targeted to the leader-repeat 1 junction on the plus strand at least in part by the inherent sequence specificity of Cas1, which presumably involves specific recognition of these bases within the active site of the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

Furthermore, protospacers with a cytosine at the 3\u2032 end were preferentially incorporated into the minus strand at the junction between repeat 1 and spacer 1. These data are consistent with the requirement for protospacers to supply the final cytosine of the repeat on the minus strand during integration (<a href=\"#bib29\">Swarts et al., 2012</a>). The deep sequencing data also revealed a marked preference for adenine over thymine at the 3\u2032 end of the protospacer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). For disintegration by EcoCas1, we observed a clear preference for adenine or cytosine at the equivalent position, whilst thymine did not support the disintegration reaction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Thus EcoCas1 appears to recognise the nucleotide at the 3\u2032 end of the incoming DNA, although no such discrimination was observed for SsoCas1.

The persistence length of DNA, the distance over which it behaves as a fairly rigid rod, is estimated as 35\u201350 nm (100\u2013150 bp) under conditions found in cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hagerman, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brinkers et al., 2009</a>). This means that the two ends of a viral genome of several kilobases can be looped around and brought close together relatively easily, but a new spacer of 30\u201340 base pairs of dsDNA cannot be manipulated in the same way. Considering the scheme in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, the molecular origami required to achieve the second TES reaction looks challenging. Several related enzymes, including Mu transposase (<a href=\"#bib26\">Savilahti et al., 1995</a>), V(D)J recombinase (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ramsden et al., 1996</a>) and HIV integrase (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gerton et al., 1999</a>) are known to disrupt base pairing of DNA substrates and make sequence-specific contacts during the integration reaction. It is likely that Cas1 also manipulates the local DNA duplex structure, which may help in positioning the DNA strands correctly for the TES reaction. The observation that the incoming DNA (the 5\u2032-flap in the disintegration reaction) can be single stranded, partially or fully duplex in nature suggests that there is some flexibility in the recognition of the incoming spacer. This is also consistent with the recent observation of a link between RecBCD, which generates ssDNA products, and Cas1 in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Levy et al., 2015</a>). There is no formal requirement that the protospacer should be fully duplex in nature, although current understanding of the integration reaction requires that new spacers have two intact 3\u2032-ends for the two integration reactions so must be at least partially duplex in nature. Many integrases process the ends of the integrated DNA using a nuclease activity, which occurs at the same active site as the integrase activity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gerton et al., 1999</a>). There is no reason to expect that Cas1 will differ in that regard, and indeed the reaction products of the RecBCD nuclease are on average much longer than the DNA molecules integrated by Cas1, suggesting the requirement for further processing."

Disintegration is strongly sequence specific, and the specificity fits with the expected sequence for the plus strand at the leader-repeat junction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This site is the logical place for the initiation of integration, as it has a unique, defined sequence, in contrast to the repetitive and more variable sequence found at the second integration site on the minus strand. Doudna and colleagues recently proposed a model based on an initial attack at site 2 on the minus strand (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>). However, this preference was only significant for spacers with a cytosine at the 3\u2032 terminus, and does not explain the marked preference observed by the authors for a guanine at position +2, which is a feature of the positive strand. Future studies of both the forward and reverse integration reactions catalyzed by Cas1 will help to address these issues and delineate the mechanism of spacer integration in the CRISPR system."

Titration of SsoCas1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) showed evidence for inhibition at enzyme:substrate ratios above 10:1. For standard assays, 2 \u03bcM Cas1 protein was mixed with 200 nM substrate in cleavage buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>) and incubated at 55\u00b0C (for SsoCas1) or 37\u00b0C (for EcoCas1). For reactions with Cas1 and Cas2, the proteins were mixed in equimolar concentration and incubated together at either 37 or 55\u00b0C for 30 min before being added to the reaction. At indicated times, reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to 20 mM final concentration and 1 \u03bcl 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The DNA was then separated from the reaction by phenol chloroform extraction. 60 \u03bcl neutral phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was added and the reaction vortexed for 30 s. The sample was then centrifuged (15,000\u00d7<i>g</i>, 1 min) and the upper aqueous phase, containing the DNA, collected. Formamide loading dye (100% formamide with 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added (5 \u00b5l) and the sample heated at 95\u00b0C for 2 min before being chilled on ice. Reaction products were resolved on a pre-run 20% denaturing (7 M urea) polyacrylamide gel containing 1\u00d7 TBE in 1\u00d7 TBE buffer.

The authors define an activity that is an apparent reversal (disintegration) of the natural integration pathway, with a 5'-flap substrate undergoing a transesterification reaction that releases that single-stranded 5'-flap in concert with the joining of the two flanking base-paired segments. This reaction has previously been used to study the activities of other integrases and recombinases, and also of <i>E. coli</i> Cas1/Cas2 in the work of Nunez et al. (Nature, 2015). The appearance of the latter study partly stole a march on the current work, with the primary contributions of this manuscript (i.e. above and beyond the results presented by Nunez et al.) being the inclusion of a separate, distinct Cas1 (SsoCas1) and the more detailed analysis of the sequence preferences of the reactions catalyzed by both Eco and SsoCas1. These contributions are significant, in part because the leader and repeat DNA sequences (where the reactions occur) differ between the relevant strains of <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. solfataricus</i>, allowing comparative tests of substrate specificity, and of the roles of Cas1 in establishing that specificity. The authors do in fact establish such differences, and overall the reaction data that is presented is compelling."

Recent work with recombinant <i>E. coli</i> Cas1 by the Doudna group (Nunez et al., Nature Structural Biology, 2014, 21:528-534 and Nunez et al., Nature, 2015, 519:193-198) provided strong evidence that Cas1 functions as the integrase and that its dual transeserification activity displays sequence specificity and is strongly dependent upon association with the Cas2 protein. Furthermore, Nunez et al. demonstrated that 33 bp double-stranded DNA fragments can be integrated into CRISPR repeats by the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins and both the forward (integration) and reverse (disintegration) reactions were observed and characterized. Here, Rollie et al. report that Cas1 alone (from <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. solfataricus</i> sources) can catalyze a single transesterification reaction on 5' flap DNA substrates that possibly (but not definitively) mimics a disintegration reaction. The main claim in this paper is that Cas1 shows a clear sequence preference for nucleotides at the leader-repeat boundary but this is not true for both sites of integration."

Micro., 2011, 79:484-502). Indeed, much of the analysis reaches the conclusion that Cas1 can carry out transesterification reactions on certain branched DNA substrates\u2013the novelty of this observation is undermined, since a transesterification mechanism was already clearly demonstrated by the recent work by Doudna and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nunez et al., 2015</a>). Another weakness of the paper is that it examines only the putative reverse (disintegration) reaction and the validity of the conclusion that the reaction being studied is reflective of the integration event must await reconstitution of the forward (integration) reaction. Moreover, the claim of clear sequence specificity that coincides with the in vivo integration site is not clear from the data shown. The order of sequential transesterifications resulting in spacer acquisition differs between this work and those of <a href=\"#bib24\">Nunez et al., 2015</a>. Indeed, by systematically varying the nucleotides flanking each transesterification site, it was concluded that there is no obvious sequence specificity for site 2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

In general, the data in the paper is of high quality and the observed nucleotide specificity at +1 position of site 1 seems solid.

Although the authors state that the disintegration reaction occurs at site 2 as well, the design of the substrates for the disintegration reaction seems to be based on site 1, which is the leader-repeat boundary. Because a Cas1-Cas2 complex has recently been shown to start integrating spacers from site 2 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nunez et al., 2015</a>), it would be good to directly compare the kinetics of both disintegration reactions using the exact substrates that are now thought to be representing site 1 (leader - repeat), and other substrates representing site 2 (repeat - spacer 1), for both EcoCas1 and EcoCas1-Cas2. Has this been done? This will help understand the order of events leading to spacer integration, and take this paper to a next level."

Although the authors state that the disintegration reaction occurs at site 2 as well, the design of the substrates for the disintegration reaction seems to be based on site 1, which is the leader-repeat boundary. Because a Cas1-Cas2 complex has recently been shown to start integrating spacers from site 2 (</i><a href=\"#bib24\"><i>Nunez et al., 2015</i></a><i>), it would be good to directly compare the kinetics of both disintegration reactions using the exact substrates that are now thought to be representing site 1 (leader - repeat), and other substrates representing site 2 (repeat - spacer 1), for both EcoCas1 and EcoCas1-Cas2. Has this been done? This will help understand the order of events leading to spacer integration, and take this paper to a next level</i>."

The disintegration activity of EcoCas1 with these substrates has been quantified in triplicate and plotted. Both substrates support disintegration, with the activity at site 1 significantly higher than for site 2. This reinforces our conclusion that disintegration can be viewed as a reversal of the half\u2013integration reaction and that specificity of EcoCas1 for site 1 appears higher than for site 2."
