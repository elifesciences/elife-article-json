Here we show how selective and non-selective lysosomal protein degradation pathways cooperate to ensure cell survival upon nutrient limitation. A quantitative analysis of starvation-induced proteome remodeling in yeast reveals comprehensive changes already in the first three hours. In this period, many different integral plasma membrane proteins undergo endocytosis and degradation in vacuoles via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. Their degradation becomes essential to maintain critical amino acids levels that uphold protein synthesis early during starvation. This promotes cellular adaptation, including the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases to boost the vacuolar catabolic activity. This order of events primes vacuoles for the efficient degradation of bulk cytoplasm via autophagy. Hence, a catabolic cascade including the coordinated action of the MVB pathway and autophagy is essential to enter quiescence to survive extended periods of nutrient limitation."

Here we show how selective and non-selective lysosomal protein degradation pathways cooperate to ensure cell survival upon nutrient limitation. A quantitative analysis of starvation-induced proteome remodeling in yeast reveals comprehensive changes already in the first three hours. In this period, many different integral plasma membrane proteins undergo endocytosis and degradation in vacuoles via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. Their degradation becomes essential to maintain critical amino acids levels that uphold protein synthesis early during starvation. This promotes cellular adaptation, including the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases to boost the vacuolar catabolic activity. This order of events primes vacuoles for the efficient degradation of bulk cytoplasm via autophagy. Hence, a catabolic cascade including the coordinated action of the MVB pathway and autophagy is essential to enter quiescence to survive extended periods of nutrient limitation."

Therefore the induction of autophagy is tightly controlled: under normal growth conditions autophagy operates on a basal level because it is suppressed by signaling from the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kamada et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Loewith and Hall, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Zoncu et al., 2011b</a>). In response to cellular stress, such as nutrient depletion (e.g., of amino acids), TORC1 is inactivated (<a href=\"#bib38\">Loewith and Hall, 2011</a>) and autophagy is strongly induced. Deregulation of autophagic processes is implicated in metabolic and infectious diseases as well as in cancer or neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</a>). Once induced, the autophagic machinery begins to sequester cytoplasmic components, ribosomes and organelles within a large double-membrane compartment termed the autophagosome (<a href=\"#bib79\">Yang and Klionsky, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kraft and Martens, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mizushima et al., 2011</a>). In addition, some core components of the autophagic machinery such as LC3/Atg8 are transcriptionally induced (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kirisako et al., 1999</a>). Direct fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes delivers autophagic bodies and the sequestered cargo into the lysosomal lumen. Alternatively, autophagosomes can first fuse with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to form so-called amphisomes, before they fuse with lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib63\">Seglen et al., 1991</a>). Finally, the breakdown of autophagic bodies and the efficient degradation of autophagic cargo inside lysosomes is required to recycle amino acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates and lipids back to the cytoplasm. The recycling of these key metabolic building blocks protects cells from their fatal depletion and thus maintains cellular homeostasis to survive nutrient limitation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jones et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Suraweera et al., 2012</a>). Therefore evolutionary conserved starvation programs in mammalian cells and yeast expand and strengthen this intracellular recycling system by enhancing the de novo synthesis of vacuolar/lysosomal hydrolases (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gasch et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sardiello et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Settembre et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shen and Mizushima, 2014</a>)."

On the one hand, TORC1 signaling was required to promote the endocytosis of certain plasma membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib39\">MacGurn et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, inactivation of TORC1 either by rapamycin or starvation, triggered the endocytosis of other plasma membrane proteins that were subsequently degraded in an ESCRT (<span class=\"underline\">e</span>ndosomal <span class=\"underline\">s</span>orting <span class=\"underline\">c</span>omplex <span class=\"underline\">r</span>equired for <span class=\"underline\">t</span>ransport)-dependent manner via the MVB pathway (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schmidt et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jones et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lang et al., 2014</a>). The extent to which starvation induces plasma membrane remodeling has yet to be determined. Furthermore, how the subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of membrane proteins via the MVB pathway helps to meet the specific metabolic and energetic demands of cells during nutrient limitation is not fully understood. Therefore it is also not clear how selective (MVB) and non-selective (autophagy) lysosomal proteolysis pathways cooperate to mediate cell survival during nutrient limitation."

Our results demonstrate that within the first 3 hr of amino acid starvation many integral plasma membrane proteins, including high-affinity amino acid permeases, glucose transporters and G-protein coupled receptors, were selectively removed from the cell surface by endocytosis and subsequently targeted into vacuoles via the ESCRT-dependent MVB pathway and degraded, while others remained stable or were up-regulated (e.g., the general amino acid permease, Gap1). This comprehensive and selective remodeling of the plasma membrane appeared to be completed within 3\u20134 hr of starvation. Autophagy was also immediately activated upon starvation and remained active throughout starvation. Surprisingly, early during starvation the selective degradation of membrane proteins via the MVB pathway was mainly responsible to maintain critical levels of free intracellular amino acids that were sufficient to uphold protein synthesis and promote the corresponding adaptation of the proteome. Most notably this included the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases, which boosted the proteolytic activity of vacuoles to support the efficient degradation of autophagic cargo. The continuous delivery and degradation of autophagic cargo further enhanced intracellular amino acid recycling and was ultimately essential to restore intracellular amino acid pools of cells during extended starvation. These findings reveal an unexpected role for the MVB pathway in maintaining intracellular amino acid homeostasis and thereby promoting the up-regulation of vacuolar hydrolases early during starvation, which is tightly coordinated with autophagy. This catabolic cascade is ultimately required to allow starving cells to complete their cell division cycle and enter a quiescent state for survival."

                                "text": "To define the timing of starvation-induced degradation of Mup1-GFP in the context of eukaryotic starvation programs, we compared it to the delivery of bulk cytoplasm via autophagy. Therefore we determined the degradation of highly abundant selective (ribosomes) and non-selective (Fba1) autophagic cargoes. Growing yeast cells contain about 200,000 ribosomes that occupy up to 30\u201340% of the cytoplasmic volume (<a href=\"#bib76\">Warner, 1999</a>). Upon starvation, otherwise stable ribosomes are among the first autophagic cargoes and rapidly degraded by selective (ribophagy) and non-selective autophagy (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kraft et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2014</a>). We monitored the release of free GFP from two different ribosomal proteins by western blotting: Rpl25-GFP (large subunit) and Rps2-GFP (small subunit). Both are fully functional GFP fusion proteins that incorporate into ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kraft et al., 2008</a>). When equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to western-blot analysis, the protein levels of full length Mup1-GFP and the GFP-tagged ribosomal subunits were comparable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lanes 6, 16). After 3 hr, at a time when the majority of full length Mup1-GFP was already degraded, free GFP from Rpl25 was first detected, showing that autophagy was also delivering cytoplasmic contents into the vacuole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lane 8). During subsequent starvation the protein levels of free GFP from both ribosomal subunits increased. Monitoring the autophagy-dependent degradation of Fba1-GFP, one of the most abundant cytoplasmic proteins with approximately 1.000.000 molecules/cell (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</a>), yielded similar results. Free GFP was first detected after 3 hr of starvation and the protein levels free GFP strongly increased during subsequent starvation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To determine the earliest possible starvation-induced autophagic activity, we monitored the transport and degradation of fully functional GFP-Atg8. Atg8 is a core component of the autophagic machinery that remains conjugated to the inner membrane of all selective and non-selective autophagosomes, including <span class=\"underline\">c</span>ytoplasm to <span class=\"underline\">v</span>acuole <span class=\"underline\">t</span>argeting (cvt)-vesicles. Therefore Atg8 is degraded together with autophagic cargo inside vacuoles. To be able to compare the degradation of GFP-Atg8 to Mup1-GFP, 10 times more lysate of cells expressing GFP-Atg8 was subjected to western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Small amounts of free GFP released from GFP-Atg8 inside vacuoles could be readily detected by western blot analysis 1 hr after the onset of starvation and the levels of free GFP strongly increased at 3 hr of starvation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lane 27\u201330). These findings are consistent with the strong increase of endogenous Atg8 levels during starvation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) as observed earlier (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kirisako et al., 1999</a>). Previous work also demonstrated that Atg8 protein levels control the size of autophagosomes but not the frequency (about 9 autophagosomes/hour) by which they are formed (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abeliovich et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Xie et al., 2008</a>). Hence, the increase in Atg8 protein levels during the first 4 hr of starvation would result in the formation of bigger (but not more) autophagosomes that could capture larger volumes of cytoplasm later during starvation. Our results for the early degradation of GFP-Atg8 and the continuous increase in autophagic degradation of highly abundant selective as well as non-selective cargoes throughout starvation are fully consistent with this model. This idea was further supported using the Pho8<i>\u2206</i>60 assay, a sensitive method to measure bulk autophagy (<a href=\"#bib48\">Noda et al., 1995</a>). Pho8<i>\u2206</i>60 activity was low under rich conditions, began to increase during the first 3 hr of starvation and continuously increased during extended periods of starvation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results show that autophagy is immediately activated upon starvation and delivers increasing volumes of cytoplasmic material into the vacuole with ongoing starvation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

It is detected at low levels in proliferating cells reflecting the equilibrium between its rapid degradation and its synthesis. Upon starvation, Ub-GFP was rapidly degraded at 26S proteasomes. The degradation of the reporter was exclusively dependent on proteasomal degradation but did not require autophagy or the MVB pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lanes 5\u20137; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Our results further suggest that both autophagy and starvation induced-endocytosis were simultaneously activated early during starvation. Autophagy continuously delivered ever-increasing volumes of cytoplasm into vacuoles, whereas the starvation-induced degradation of membrane proteins was completed within 3 hr. These findings suggest an important role for the MVB pathway early during starvation."

This conclusion was further strengthened using the Pho8<i>\u2206</i>60 autophagy-reporter assay (<a href=\"#bib48\">Noda et al., 1995</a>).

                                "text": "Our quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that most vacuolar proteases, in particular Prb1, but also Ape1, Cps1 and Pep4, were up-regulated during the first 3 hr of starvation in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig4 fig5\">Figures 4A, 5A</a>). Also other types of vacuolar hydrolytic enzymes were induced during that time, like the alpha-mannosidase Ams1 or the ribonuclease Rny1. To directly assess how the catabolic activity of vacuoles changed during starvation, we measured the enzymatic activity of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase, Pho8. The transmembrane protein Pho8 is delivered to the vacuole via the AP-3 pathway, which functions independently of the ESCRT machinery (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cowles et al., 1997</a>). Pho8 activity requires proteolytic maturation of Pho8 by Pep4 on the C-terminus. An additional uncharacterized endoproteolytic activity further cleaves mPho8 to yield a soluble sPho8 inside the vacuole that can be specifically measured (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Song, 2006</a>). In a yeast mutant that was deficient for three major vacuolar peptidases (<i>pep4\u2206</i>, <i>prb1\u2206</i>, <i>prc1\u2206</i>), Pho8 was not matured (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lane 1) and Pho8 activity was not detected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In <i>vps4\u2206</i> mutants the Pep4-dependent maturation to mPho8 was not impaired under rich growth conditions or starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, lane 3\u20135). In all cells sPho8 levels were low under rich conditions, which corresponded to low Pho8 activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Within the first 3 hr of starvation, sPho8 activity increased at least fivefold in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), consistent with the de novo synthesis of vacuolar proteases resulting in increased endoproteolytic activity generating sPho8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> lane 3). In the following 15 hr of starvation Pho8 activity only doubled (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Hence the major boost for the catabolic activity of vacuoles occurs during the first 3 hr of starvation. In two different mutants that block autophagy (<i>atg8\u2206</i> and <i>atg5\u2206</i> mutants), sPho8 activity still increased 3\u20135 fold during the first 3 hr of starvation similar to WT cells, but failed to increase further upon extended starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that autophagy was not required to boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles early during starvation."

In yeast, starvation results in a stable G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> arrest, which can be scored by the increase of unbudded cells. Starving WT cells grew slowly, but still doubled their optical density (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and the majority (&gt;80%) no longer displayed budding daughter cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Hence WT cells managed to complete a final cell division cycle and efficiently arrested in G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> during starvation. Autophagy mutants (<i>atg8\u2206</i> or <i>atg5\u2206</i>) grew slower when compared to WT cells upon starvation and failed to complete cell division and thus could not enter G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> arrest (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), consistent with recent reports showing that autophagy is essential to overcome a Swe1-dependent checkpoint mechanism (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matsui et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">An et al., 2014</a>). Our proteomic analysis indicated that cell cycle regulatory proteins (including Swe1) were less efficiently down-regulated during starvation in <i>vps4\u2206</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Strikingly, when <i>vps4\u2206</i> mutants were subjected to starvation, their growth slowed down prior to the growth of autophagy mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). ESCRT-I (<i>vps23\u2206</i>), ESCRT-II (<i>vps36\u2206</i>), ESCRT-III (<i>snf7\u2206</i>) and <i>vps4\u2206</i> mutants failed to complete their final round of cell division and hence could not enter a G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> arrest (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). When the partial sorting defect of vacuolar hydrolases of ESCRT mutants was rescued by Vps10 overexpression, <i>vps4\u2206</i> mutants still stopped to grow and failed to enter quiescence during starvation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

In this mutant the sequestration of cargo into MVBs or autophagosomes and their transport into vacuoles is not affected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

Immediately upon nutrient limitation, the degradation of cytoplasmic proteins by the UPS acutely supplies amino acids to maintain protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib72\">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</a>). Starvation also inactivates TORC1 signaling, which probably simultaneously stimulates autophagy as well as starvation-induced endocytosis. Once TORC1 signaling is turned off, Atg13 is quickly dephosphorylated, which allows the formation of the Atg1/Ulk1 kinase complex to induce autophagy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kamada et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2010</a>)."

This enables the de novo synthesis of vacuolar hydrolases that are required to boost the catabolic activity of vacuoles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Thereby, the MVB pathway ensures that the catabolic activity of the vacuole is up-regulated in time to allow subsequent, efficient degradation of autophagic cargo. Only when these conditions are met, autophagy considerably contributes to amino acid recycling during extended starvation to restore intracellular amino acid levels (<a href=\"#bib30\">Komatsu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</a>). Since the MVB pathway is also in part required for the proper targeting of hydrolases into the vacuole, it might even fulfill a dual function. Yet, our results emphasize that a significant fraction of vacuolar hydrolases are sorted into the lumen of vacuoles in ESCRT mutants, where they mature and become active. Furthermore, if the observed phenotypes in ESCRT mutants would be caused solely by mis-sorting of vacuolar hydrolases, this would lead to a delay in autophagy-mediated amino acid recycling. In this case their defects during starvation should be similar or even weaker when compared to autophagy mutants. The partial sorting defects for vacuolar hydrolases are thus not consistent with the stronger defects of ESCRT mutants in maintaining amino acid levels, protein synthesis and cell growth early during nutrient limitation. Moreover it was possible to restore the catabolic activity of vacuoles in ESCRT mutants under rich growth conditions, while this was no longer possible during starvation. Hence it seems that mainly the selective degradation of membrane proteins as a source for amino acids, rather than just the sorting of vacuolar hydrolases, contributes to the key role of the MVB pathway during starvation. At the moment it is not clear why the MVB pathway appears to be more critical than autophagy to maintain intracellular amino acids levels early during starvation. We speculate that membrane proteins that have been selected for degradation via the MVB are for the most part not re-synthesized, while non-selective autophagy will inevitably also capture and degrade proteins that are still needed and thus have to be replaced. Hence, selective protein degradation may at least initially provide a bigger added value for the free intracellular amino acid pool as compared to the non-selective degradation of bulk cytoplasm by autophagy. The ESCRT machinery has recently been described to contribute to selective micro-autophagy on late endosomes in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sahu et al., 2011</a>). Hence, ESCRT-dependent catabolic pathways may not be limited to membrane proteins, although our study did not experimentally address this possibility."

This might provide a safety mechanism to protect cells from the immediate need for non-selective protein degradation. While the ESCRT machinery has acquired additional roles in diverse biological processes in higher eukaryotes, we propose that the central role of the MVB pathway in the catabolic cascade of eukaryotic cells during starvation is evolutionary conserved."

Amino acids were ethanol-extracted and analyzed as described (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altmann, 1992</a>). Norvalin (8 nmol/mg dry weight) was the internal standard. For the representation of each individual amino acid, the measured values were normalized by the maximum measured amino acid content across all conditions and replicates."

The authors reveal that cells act in a consecutive manner to mobilize amino acids from cytosolic proteins (presumably via the proteasome), membrane proteins (via the MVB pathway), and finally bulk cytosolic proteins via autophagy. Taking a proteomic approach to compare MVB mutant and wild-type cells, the authors show that starvation is coupled to a massive remodeling of the proteome, where multiple hydrolases are upregulated to allow degradation of membrane proteins. The authors conclude that the MVB pathway is critical to supply amino acids for survival of cells during the early phase of starvation, which is followed by autophagy activation."

These two possibilities are not clearly distinguished. In particular, the data shown in <a href=\"#fig4 fig6\">Figures 4A, 4B, and 6B</a> suggest that there may be a defect in the vacuolar function even in growing conditions or during a very short starvation period in <i>vps4\u2206</i> cells.

However, this was performed only for data shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Vps10 rescue experiments should be included in other experiments that measure the amino acid pool (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), protein synthesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and autophagic activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These are more relevant to the potential function of the MVB pathway as an amino acid generator. It is also unclear why over expression of Vps10 cannot rescue the pho8 activity under starvation conditions. Taken together, it is likely that defects in protein turnover observed in ESCRT mutants are due to a combination of defects in sorting of vacuolar enzymes and generation of amino acids."

These findings are consistent with the de novo synthesis and the overall increase of endogenous Atg8 during starvation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as observed earlier by the Ohsumi lab (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kirisako et al., 1999</a>). Work from the Klionsky lab (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abeliovich et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Xie et al., 2008</a>) further demonstrated that this increase in Atg8 protein levels was required for the formation of larger (but not more) autophagosomes that could capture larger volumes of cytoplasm during ongoing starvation. Our results showing the early degradation of GFP-Atg8 and the continuous increase in autophagic degradation of highly abundant selective (Rps2, Rpl25) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and non-selective (Fba1, Pho8 60) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) cargoes throughout starvation are fully compatible with this model. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with the essential role of autophagy for amino acid recycling later during starvation (see point b and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Autophagy continuously delivers ever-increasing amounts of cytoplasm into vacuoles and remains active during extended periods of starvation, whereas starvation-induced degradation of membrane proteins via the MVB pathway appears to be completed relatively early (within the first 4 hours of starvation). Our analysis of intracellular amino acid recycling supports this idea and demonstrates that autophagy is essential for amino acid recycling later during starvation, whereas the MVB pathway appears to be more important to maintain intracellular amino acid levels early during starvation (see reply to concern 2 and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

In WT cells the levels of most amino acids continued to decrease for another hour to about 50% of the levels measured under rich conditions.

These results are at large consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib49\">Onodera and Ohsumi, 2005</a>), where a decrease to approximately 30% of intracellular amino acid levels was detected during the first two hours of starvation and autophagy was required for the partial recovery of amino acid levels from 3 to 6 hours of starvation.

In consequence autophagic cargo (Rpl25-GFP) was not efficiently degraded (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In addition, we determined the subcellular localization of the vacuolar master protease Pep4-GFP and Prc1/CPY-RFP in ESCRT mutants under rich growth or starvation using live cell fluorescence microscopy. Pep4-GFP localized to the class E compartment in ESCRT mutants, but a large fraction of Pep4-GFP was also delivered into the lumen of the vacuole (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).
