In particular, we analyze the shape of telomere length distributions underlying stem cell behavior within individuals. Our mathematical model shows that these distributions contain a fingerprint of the progressive telomere loss and the fraction of symmetric cell proliferations. Our predictions are tested against measured telomere length distributions in humans across all ages, collected from lymphocyte and granulocyte sorted telomere length data of 356 healthy individuals, including 47 cord blood and 28 bone marrow samples. We find an increasing stem cell pool during childhood and adolescence and an approximately maintained stem cell population in adults. Furthermore, our method is able to detect individual differences from a single tissue sample, i.e. a single snapshot. Prospectively, this allows us to compare cell proliferation between individuals and identify abnormal stem cell dynamics, which affects the risk of stem cell related diseases."

In particular, we analyze the shape of telomere length distributions underlying stem cell behavior within individuals. Our mathematical model shows that these distributions contain a fingerprint of the progressive telomere loss and the fraction of symmetric cell proliferations. Our predictions are tested against measured telomere length distributions in humans across all ages, collected from lymphocyte and granulocyte sorted telomere length data of 356 healthy individuals, including 47 cord blood and 28 bone marrow samples. We find an increasing stem cell pool during childhood and adolescence and an approximately maintained stem cell population in adults. Furthermore, our method is able to detect individual differences from a single tissue sample, i.e. a single snapshot. Prospectively, this allows us to compare cell proliferation between individuals and identify abnormal stem cell dynamics, which affects the risk of stem cell related diseases."

The model also revealed that patterns of stem cell growth vary among individuals.

These cells are involved in the formation, maintenance, renewal, and aging of tissues (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reya et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Morrison and Kimble, 2006</a>). Their longevity imposes the risk of the accumulation of multiple mutations that potentially induce aberrant stem cell proliferation and can ultimately cause the emergence of cancer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>). The quantification of aberrant stem cell properties in cancer is impeded by the lack of detailed information about the expected patterns of cell replication in healthy human tissues (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rossi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Vermeulen et al., 2013</a>). Dynamic properties of stem cell populations <i>in vivo</i> are predominantly obtained from sequential experiments in animal models (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Orford and Scadden, 2008</a>). Unfortunately, these methods are mostly inapplicable to humans and to infer <i>in vivo</i> properties of human stem cell populations remains a challenge. Indirect methods, i.e. biomarkers that reflect the proliferation history of a tissue, may overcome these limitations (<a href=\"#bib24\">Greaves et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Graham et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kozar et al., 2013</a>).

                        "text": "Telomeres are noncoding repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of all eukaryotic chromosomes. In vertebrates, these sequences consist of hundreds to thousands of repeats of the nucleobase blocks TTAGGG (<a href=\"#bib26\">Griffith et al., 1999</a>). Telomere repeats are progressively lost in most somatic cells with age, as the conventional DNA polymerase is unable to fully copy the lagging DNA strand of chromosomes during cell replication (<a href=\"#bib43\">Olovnikov, 1973</a>). Short telomeres are associated with genetic instability (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hande, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Feldser et al., 2003</a>). They trigger DNA-damage checkpoint pathways and enforce permanent cell cycle arrest ( <a href=\"#bib20\">d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</a>). Thus, telomere length limits the replication capacity of somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961</a>) and can indirectly act as a tumor suppressor (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Campisi, 2005</a>). This effect can be attenuated by the enzyme telomerase, which tags additional TTAGGG repeats to the end of chromosomes by utilizing single stranded RNA templates (<a href=\"#bib25\">Greider and Blackburn, 1989</a>). Telomerase is primarily expressed in compartments of stem and germ line cells, as well as in numerous tumors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 1994</a>). However, telomerase expression levels are insufficient to prevent the progressive loss of telomere repeats in most healthy human tissues with age (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harley et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rufer et al., 1999</a>). This net loss of telomere repeats during cell replication leads to a characteristic telomere length distribution that reflects the replication history of cells. Since telomere length dynamics is important for a number of genetic and acquired disorders (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hastie et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blasco, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Calado and Young, 2009</a>), it is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms of this fundamental process. We have developed a mathematical model that allows us to interpret data of telomere length shortening in hematopoietic cells obtained from 356 healthy humans. Most importantly, we can infer the patterns of stem cell behavior from the underlying telomere dynamics within individuals from a single tissue sample, i.e. a single snapshot."

Since hematopoietic cells proliferate in a hierarchical organised tissue with slowly dividing stem cells at its root, such a model needs to connect properties of cell proliferation and telomere shortening. Telomere length can be assessed on three different levels of resolution, (i) the level of single telomeres, (ii) the level of single cells and (iii) the level of the tissue. Of course these levels are not independent, for example the knowledge of telomere length in all cells allows to obtain the (average) telomere length of a tissue. The processes that drive telomere length dynamics differ at these levels of resolution. Single telomeres are prone to stochastic events such as oxidative stress or recombination and thus may also shorten by effects independent of proliferation associated attrition (<a href=\"#bib56\">von Zglinicki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Antal et al., 2007</a>). Healthy human cells contain 184 telomeres, four on each of the 46 chromosomes. Thus, the noise on the level of single telomeres becomes much smaller on the cell level. We capitalise on this and consider telomere length on the cell level in the following. Thus, the average telomere length of a cell shortens by a constant factor during each division. Such an approach might underestimate the number of senescent cells once telomeres become critically short, since it is the length of the shortest telomere rather then the average telomere length that triggers cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hemann et al., 2001</a>). Our model is sensitive to the accumulation of cells in the state of cell cycle arrest and we can infer this effect experimentally from population wide telomere length distributions. However, this effect can likely be neglected during adolescence and adulthood, but might have important implications in some tumors, at old age or in conditions associated with abnormal telomere maintenance."

                                "text": "We further need to consider properties of a hierarchical tissue organization, where few slowly dividing stem cells give rise to shorter lived progeny. Although some of the progeny, particularly primitive progenitor cells, can be long lived and are able to maintain homeostasis without stem cell turnover for intermediate time intervals, eventually all non hematopoietic stem cells will be depleted without continuous stem cell turn over (<a href=\"#bib14\">Busch et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sun et al., 2014</a>). Age dependent differences in telomere shortening across different lineages of hematopoiesis can only persist in the hematopoietic system if they occur on the level of the maintained self-renewing cell population. Cells leaving the stem cell pool have an approximately constant number of cell divisions before they reach maturation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Takano, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Werner et al., 2011</a>). This shifts the distribution to shorter values of telomere length and consequently, the distribution of telomere lengths of mature cells is a good proxy for the distribution of telomere lengths in stem cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rodriguez-Brenes et al., 2013</a>). We measured telomere length distributions in lymphocytes, granulocytes and bone marrow sections separately. This allows us to investigate the myeloid and lymphoid lineage of hematopoiesis independently."

In the simplest case, each stem cell would proliferate with the same rate <math id=\"inf2\"><mi>r</mi></math> and the cell cycle time would follow an exponential distribution. However, tissue homeostasis requires continuous stem cell turn over in intermediate time intervals, therefore the proliferation rate of the population of stem cells is adjusted, such that a required constant output of differentiated cells per unit of time is maintained. In the simplest case of a constant stem cell population, the effective proliferation rate becomes <math id=\"inf3\"><mi>r</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></math>. However, in more complex scenarios, the number of stem cells could differ with age and the effective proliferation rate of stem cells <math id=\"inf4\"><mi>r</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>N</mi><mfenced><mi>t</mi></mfenced></math> also becomes age dependent (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rozhok and DeGregori, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bowie et al., 2006</a>). This resembles a feedback mechanism and results in an approximately Log-normal distribution of cell cycles, see also <a href=\"#equ30\">Equation S26</a> in Materials and methods for details. In addition, each stem cell clone is characterised by a certain telomere length (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antal et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Simon and Derrida, 2008</a>). This telomere length shortens with each stem cell division by a constant length <math id=\"inf5\"><mi>\u0394</mi><mi>c</mi></math> and consequently the remaining proliferation potential is reduced in both daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rufer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allsopp et al., 1992</a>). If the telomeres of a cell reach a critically short length, this cell enters cell cycle arrest and stops proliferation, reflecting a cell\u2019s Hayflick limit (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961</a>). This can be modelled by collecting cells with the same proliferation potential in states <math id=\"inf6\"><mi>i</mi></math>.

Since the next cell to proliferate is chosen at random from the reservoir, cells progressively distribute over all accessible states with time (<a href=\"#bib42\">Olofsson and Kimmel, 1999</a>).

This is well known and has been confirmed numerous times. Surprisingly, less is known about the detailed dynamics of this decrease. We can derive the dynamics of the average telomere length from the telomere length distributions directly. The average telomere length corresponds to the expected value of the telomere length distribution (in the following denoted by <math id=\"inf14\"><mi>E</mi><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></math>), see <a href=\"#equ9\">Equation S5</a> in Materials and methods for details.

The dynamics changes once a significant fraction of cells enter cell cycle arrest, see <a href=\"#equ13\">Equation S9</a>. The average telomere length transitions from a linear into a power law decline (when the average telomere length becomes very short) and the stem cell pool reaches the state of complete cell cycle exhaustion asymptotically. This transition would enable the identification of an age where a considerable fraction of stem cells enter cell cycle arrest, potentially a mechanism important in aging, carcinogenesis or bone marrow failure syndromes."

This effect emerges naturally in our model due to the increasing number of stem cells with age.

This expansion is combined with a reduction in proliferation rates of single stem cells. The loss of telomere repeats during cell replication has a more pronounced impact on the average telomere length within a small cell population and diminishes in large stem cell populations. This explains the increased loss of telomeric repeats during adolescence (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) naturally as a consequence of growth by an expanding stem cell population. Similarly, a sudden accelerated loss of telomeric repeats in aged individuals could point towards an insufficient stem cell self-renewal.

It shows that symmetric stem cell self-renewals are more frequent in adolescence and their effect on the dynamics of average telomere length reduces with age. However, how robust are our conclusions under variation of model parameters or a change of cell proliferation properties with age? One possibility to address these problems is the implementation of Bayesian inference methods (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dempster, 1968</a>). In a nutshell, such methods draw a random set of model parameters either from an uninformed (objective) or informed (subjective) prior distribution and produce independent realizations of the model. These realizations are compared to some (appropriate) data of interest and fits with a predefined statistic significance are retained while unsatisfactory realizations are rejected. Originally developed for phylogenetic tree reconstruction, such methods are increasingly used in other applications (<a href=\"#bib38\">Marjoram and Tavar\u00e9, 2006</a>). Bayesian inference methods allow to quantify the uncertainty in an analysis by providing posterior distributions of model parameters."

In principle, these parameters could also change with age. To see if we can identify ages with different stem cell proliferation parameters, we investigated a third model that allows for successive phases of stem cell dynamics with independent parameter sets for each phase. We consider an additional parameter <math id=\"inf35\"><msub><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow></msub></math>, which corresponds to a transition time. We perform the above Bayesian approach independently for each random partition of the data set. This approach suggests at most two separate phases, with a transition between the 6th and 7th year of life for lymphocytes, see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f\u2013i</a>, and a transition between the 10th and 15th years of life for granulocytes, see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5j\u2013m</a>. In infants and the first years of life, the probability of stem cell self-renewal shows a significant variance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

This suggests a reduction in the self-renewal probability of stem cells after adolescence and points towards an either slower growing or constant stem cell population in adults.

We find a low probability of symmetric self-renewal (<math id=\"inf39\"><mi>p</mi></math> between 0.005 to 0.03 per cell division) in all individual samples. This agrees with our results on the average telomere length shortening in adults at the population level and supports our observation of an approximately maintained active stem cell number in individuals after adolescence. Also the average telomere loss per year varies between individuals and ranges from 18 bp/year to 110 bp/year. However, the averages of all individual parameter sets agree with the estimated proliferation properties inferred from the population wide data of telomere length. We find differences between individual samples of lymphocytes and granulocytes. While the loss of telomeric repeats slows down with age in granulocytes, it slightly accelerates in lymphocytes, see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. These cells represent the myeloid and lymphoid lineage respectively. In our model, such a reduced rate of telomere loss can be explained with an increased reservoir of myeloid specific stem and progenitor cells and is in agreement with a skewed differentiation potential towards the myeloid lineage of aged hematopoietic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Geiger et al., 2013</a>)."

Telomere length decrease is logarithmic and occurs at a faster rate during adolescence, suggesting a stem cell pool expansion in the first years of human life compatible with growth. This decrease becomes almost linear in adults and is in line with an approximately constant stem cell population. It is an interesting question why the number of stem cells would reach a certain targeted size. This could be simply because of spatial constrains in the bone marrow. Yet, from an evolutionary perspective, intermediate stem cell pool sizes were suggested to minimize the risk of cancer initiation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rodriguez-Brenes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Michor et al., 2003</a>). Such an optimization requires feedback signals that ensures the maintenance of an intermediate sized stem cell population, feedback signals that might be prone to (epi)genetic change and potentially are involved in cancer and ageing."

From a modelling perspective, a population strategy of\u00a0symmetric\u00a0self-renewal and symmetric differentiation was suggested to minimize the clonal load within a stem cell population (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shahriyari et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, experimental findings seem to point towards predominantly asymmetric divisions, but this might also differ across tissues (<a href=\"#bib40\">Morrison and Kimble, 2006</a>). In our model, the stem cell pool is maintained by asymmetric cell divisions. A balance of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions would on average result in the same telomere length dynamics and thus would be indistinguishable from asymmetric divisions on the population level, only the interpretation of <math id=\"inf40\"><mi>p</mi></math>, the probability of symmetric self-renewal would change in this case. Yet, the variance of the distribution would be expected to increase under the presence of symmetric differentiation and symmetric self-renewal.

We expect characteristic changes in telomere length distributions in certain (hematopoietic) stem cell disorders such as chronic leukemias (<a href=\"#bib11\">Braig et al., 2014</a>) and bone marrow failure syndromes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Calado and Young, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Beier, 2005</a>).

Images were acquired at 63x magnification and 1.5-2.0 digital zoom. Multi-tracking mode was used to acquire images. Stacks of DAPI and Cy3 staining were taken with a step size of 1 \u03bcm. Peripheral blood cells and bone marrows were captured including five steps (z-range 4 \u03bcm). Maximum projection of the images was carried out and Definiens XD 1.5 image analysis software (Definiens GmbH) was used for quantitative image analysis. Nucleus and telomere detection was carried out based on DAPI and Cy3 intensity patterns. A valid image analysis was assumed in case of a correct detection of 90% of all visible telomeres. All image analysis was carried out single-blinded. Individual telomere signals were calculated after subtraction of the mean background value per detected nucleus. For bone marrow section and peripheral blood cells, values of all detected telomeres were used for analysis. Paraffin embedded lymphocytes of three healthy donors and granulocytes of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia with a determined telomere length were used as controls for bone marrow biopsies. Linear regression of the control cells was carried out to convert telomere length from arbitrary units to kb. Telomere length in kb of the Q-FISH analysis of peripheral blood cells was calculated based on the linear regression of the corresponding Flow-FISH values."

Thus we restrict ourselves to a numerical solution of <a href=\"#equ25\">Equation S21</a>. The logarithmic decay of the average telomere length has consequences on the interpretation of experimental results of telomere length distributions. In infants an accelerated decrease of telomere length can be observed. This can be explained immediately by an expanding stem cell pool. The stem cell pool contains only a few <math id=\"inf117\"><msub><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></math> stem cells initially (newborns). These stem cells divide symmetrically with probability <math id=\"inf118\"><mi>p</mi></math> and asymmetrically with probability <math id=\"inf119\"><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>p</mi></math> respectively. The symmetric cell divisions cause an increase of the stem cell pool size and an indirect decrease in cell proliferation rates. The logarithmic decay is pronounced initially, but flattens after some time (as the number of stem cells increases). Thus, in adults the logarithmic decay is difficult to distinguish from a linear decay, see for example <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> in the main text."

This implies that the loss of repeats per division is itself a stochastic variable with mean and variance. In this case the distribution of telomere length differs from the distribution of cell states <i>i</i>. This is not discussed. Rather, the distinction is blurred by a confusing mix of language. For example in the subsection \u201cProliferation properties of stem cells differ during adolescence and adulthood\u201d, the units of <i>r/N<sub>0</sub></i> are given as kbp/year even though by definition <i>r/N<sub>0</sub></i> is a rate with units 1 over time."

Again, in the subsection \u201cAsymmetric cell divisions\u201d: \"<i>r</i> represents the proliferation rate of a cell\". However looking carefully at Equation (S1) suggests that the parameter <i>r</i> is not what the authors say it is. The proliferation rate per cell rather appears to be given by the ratio <i>r/N<sub>0</sub></i> when using the terminology of the authors. Similarly, for the case with symmetric divisions, the proliferation rate per cell is <i>r/(rpt+N<sub>0</sub>)</i>. This is consistent with the statement that the proliferation rate of a stem cell decreases with time but is inconsistent with the definition of <i>r</i> in the text."

However, the authors show (e.g. S10, S20) that they can solve for the relevant quantities of their model.

Hence, based on a measured telomere length inferring the number of divisions is probably not unique (e.g. what about a measurement of telomere length = 55? It could have divided once, losing 55bp at once. Or it might have divided twice losing a bit less then 30bp each time).

With a certain probability, asymmetric division occurs, where stem cell division leads to one stem daughter cell and one differentiating cell. With the opposite probability, symmetric division was assumed to occur, where division gives rise to 2 stem cells. This is a biologically reasonable model. However, it is also possible to formulate this differently. For example, you can assume that with a certain probability, a stem cell divides to give rise to 2 stem daughter cells, and with the opposite probability, it divides to give rise to 2 differentiated daughter cells. In this way, you then probably would need to include feedback mechanisms to obtain stable and realistic dynamics. Would such a difference influence your results or not? I am not suggesting analyzing further models, but a discussion on model robustness might be useful for the paper."

Obviously this is infeasible in human populations. However, homeostasis in the hematopoietic system is maintained by rare stem cell differentiations, see for example the very recent papers (Busch et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2014). Non stem cells differentiate further and allow for the diversity of cells in the hematopoietic system. But these cells have a finite life time and are eventually washed out, see for example (Busch et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2014; Werner et al., 2011). Only stem cells are able to maintain homeostasis in the long run. Age dependent differences in telomere shortening across different lineages of haematopoiesis across individuals can thus only persist in the hematopoietic system, if they occur on the level of the maintained self-renewing cell population. But we agree, our inference would only be possible if the differentiation process affects telomeres in a way that does not change with age. To account for this assumption better, we have now extended our explanation in the manuscript."

This shift is assumed to be constant and not age dependent). Consequently, it suffices to analyse the population dynamics of the persistent time dependent component of the system to indirectly infer properties of the stem cell pool.

In Model 2, we pick cells randomly for proliferation to allow for stochastic stem cell behaviour, but we also condition the system on a certain constant output of differentiated cells per unit of time. This condition has several consequences. First, it ensures that the output of the stem cell compartment is not steadily increasing with an increasing stem cell pool size, which would lead to very unrealistic scenarios, particularly in adults, where we can assume that the output of the stem cell compartment is approximately at a constant level during homeostasis. In a sense, this condition describes a feedback of the hematopoietic system on the regulation of stem cell proliferation. This leads to a continuous decrease of the proliferation rate of individual stem cells. As the number of stem cells increase linearly in time, this decrease is proportional to 1/age of healthy individuals during adolescence. This basic property is found in humans and in mice, see for example Rozhok and DeGregori, 2015, and Bowie et al., 2006."

We bravely interpret this variable as a random variable and show that model 2 leads to an approximately lognormal distribution for this variable.
