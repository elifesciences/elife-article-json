Here, we show that Ki-67 controls heterochromatin organisation. Altering Ki-67 expression levels did not significantly affect cell proliferation in vivo. Ki-67 mutant mice developed normally and cells lacking Ki-67 proliferated efficiently. Conversely, upregulation of Ki-67 expression in differentiated tissues did not prevent cell cycle arrest. Ki-67 interactors included proteins involved in nucleolar processes and chromatin regulators. Ki-67 depletion disrupted nucleologenesis but did not inhibit pre-rRNA processing. In contrast, it altered gene expression. Ki-67 silencing also had wide-ranging effects on chromatin organisation, disrupting heterochromatin compaction and long-range genomic interactions. Trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 was relocalised within the nucleus. Finally, overexpression of human or <i>Xenopus</i> Ki-67 induced ectopic heterochromatin formation. Altogether, our results suggest that Ki-67 expression in proliferating cells spatially organises heterochromatin, thereby controlling gene expression."

Here, we show that Ki-67 controls heterochromatin organisation. Altering Ki-67 expression levels did not significantly affect cell proliferation in vivo. Ki-67 mutant mice developed normally and cells lacking Ki-67 proliferated efficiently. Conversely, upregulation of Ki-67 expression in differentiated tissues did not prevent cell cycle arrest. Ki-67 interactors included proteins involved in nucleolar processes and chromatin regulators. Ki-67 depletion disrupted nucleologenesis but did not inhibit pre-rRNA processing. In contrast, it altered gene expression. Ki-67 silencing also had wide-ranging effects on chromatin organisation, disrupting heterochromatin compaction and long-range genomic interactions. Trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 was relocalised within the nucleus. Finally, overexpression of human or <i>Xenopus</i> Ki-67 induced ectopic heterochromatin formation. Altogether, our results suggest that Ki-67 expression in proliferating cells spatially organises heterochromatin, thereby controlling gene expression."

It is therefore widely used as a cell proliferation marker to grade tumours. Ki-67 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein (<a href=\"#bib29\">MacCallum and Hall, 2000</a>) with two human isoforms that have predicted molecular weights of 320kDa and 359kDa (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerdes et al., 1991</a>). The domain structure of Ki-67 is represented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. All homologues contain an N-terminal Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which can bind both to DNA and to phosphorylated epitopes. The most characteristic feature of Ki-67 is the presence of multiple tandem repeats (14 in mice, 16 in human) containing a conserved motif of unknown function, the 'Ki-67 domain'. Two other conserved motifs include a Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding motif (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>) and a 31 amino acid conserved domain (CD) of unknown function, 100% identical between human and mouse, that includes a 22 amino acid motif conserved in all homologues. Ki-67 homologues also have a weakly conserved leucine/arginine rich C-terminus which can bind to DNA and, when overexpressed, promotes chromatin compaction (<a href=\"#bib45\">Scholzen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Takagi et al., 1999</a>)."

Thus, Ki-67 expression can be uncoupled from cell proliferation. Instead, we show that Ki-67 is an essential mediator of heterochromatin organisation and long-range chromatin interactions, controlling gene expression. As it is expressed at high levels only in proliferating cells, our results suggest that Ki-67 links heterochromatin organisation to cell proliferation."

We tested these hypotheses genetically. Ki-67 protein expression is regulated during the cell cycle, and we speculated that it might be a target for the APC/C-Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is active in late mitosis and G1, and triggers degradation of substrates containing D-boxes and KEN boxes. Human Ki-67 isoforms contain two or three KEN boxes, whereas mouse Ki-67 contains two D-boxes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Mouse Ki-67 contains an additional sequence, AQRKQPSR at 2680\u20132687, which is highly similar to the A-box, a third APC/C-Cdh1 recognition motif (<a href=\"#bib26\">Littlepage and Ruderman, 2002</a>). To see whether Cdh1 regulates Ki-67, we analysed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the <i>Fzr1</i> gene that encodes Cdh1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Garcia-Higuera et al., 2008</a>). Asynchronous <i>Fzr1</i> heterozygous MEFs, that are at different stages of the cell cycle, had variable Ki-67 levels, whereas in the <i>Fzr1</i> knockout MEFs Ki-67 was upregulated and more homogeneously expressed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To see whether sustained Ki-67 expression in quiescent cells would have a negative impact on cell cycle arrest in vivo, we analysed <i>Fzr1</i>-knockout mice. Here, Ki-67 was overexpressed and uncoupled from cells that incorporate BrdU in all tissues examined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, Ki-67 expression is regulated by APC/C-Cdh1 in mice and its downregulation is not a prerequisite for cell cycle exit."

                                "text": "We next investigated the functional consequences of Ki-67 downregulation for normal tissue development and homeostasis. To disrupt the gene encoding Ki-67, <i>Mki67</i>, in the mouse germline, we used a TALEN pair targeting the unique ATG start codon. This is predicted to generate null alleles (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). After cytoplasmic injection of these TALEN-encoding mRNAs into zygotes, 10 out of 54 mice had mutations disrupting the coding sequence. We crossed founder mutant mice, and four gave germline transmission of the mutation. Due to mosaicism, this resulted in six lines: two lines with mutations eliminating the initiation codon and four lines with deletions which cause frameshifts immediately downstream of the ATG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). From these, we selected a 2-nucleotide deletion (2nt\u2206) mutant that retains the ATG initiation codon but has a frameshift in the next codon (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and a 21-nucleotide deletion (21nt\u2206) that eliminates the ATG (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We crossed these mice and, unexpectedly, obtained homozygous mutants at the expected Mendelian frequency that were indistinguishable from heterozygous or wild-type (WT) littermates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Both deletion mutant lines showed normal growth and were fertile. Sagittal sections from <i>Mki67<sup>2nt\u2206/2nt\u2206</sup></i> mice did not reveal any obvious defects in tissue morphology (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since the intestinal epithelium is the most highly proliferative adult mouse tissue, we compared its morphology between WT and mutant mice. In WT animals, the proliferative crypt compartment was strongly stained for Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while only minimal levels of Ki-67 were observed in the differentiated cells on the villus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, top), as expected. In contrast, in the mutants, proliferating crypt cells showed only residual levels of Ki-67 staining by IHC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, bottom) or immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Immunoblotting of intestinal epithelium preparations could detect a weak band of similar size to WT Ki-67 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The signal was, however, reduced by at least 90% in both mutants compared to WT tissue. Three different Ki-67 antibodies gave similar results. These are all extremely sensitive as they recognise the highly repeated Ki-67 domain. They should also detect N-terminally truncated Ki-67 that would result from translation from the ATG at position 433. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Ki-67 mRNA level was, unexpectedly, increased rather than reduced in the intestinal tissue (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In the intestinal epithelium, analysis of Wnt signalling and differentiation of goblet and tuft cells showed no differences between WT and <i>Mki67<sup>21nt\u2206/21nt\u2206</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). These results show that high Ki-67 levels and an intact Ki-67 gene are not required for development or differentiation in vivo."

Homozygous <i>Mki67<sup>2nt\u2206/2nt\u2206</sup></i>MEFs had at least 90% lower Ki-67 levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We could not confirm by immunoblotting whether or not the protein was full-length or truncated since SDS-PAGE cannot resolve 15kDa differences between proteins of nearly 400\u2009kDa, and no antibodies are available against the N-terminus of Ki-67. As with intestinal tissue, the loss of Ki-67 expression was not due to mRNA degradation, as shown by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Indeed, in the homozygous mutant, the Ki-67 mRNA level was increased to a level comparable with that of proliferating NIH-3T3 cells. Mutant MEF proliferated comparably to controls, and flow cytometric assessment of EdU incorporation after a 1\u2009hr EdU pulse showed similar numbers of replicating cells in Ki-67 WT and mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

                                "text": "The low level residual Ki-67 expression in homozygous Ki-67 mutants suggests that TALEN or the conceptually-related CRISPR approaches may not lead to complete loss of expression, even when the translation initiation codon has been mutated. To further investigate whether Ki-67 translation can occur with a mutated initiation codon, we used the same TALEN pair to generate monoclonal Ki-67 mutant mouse NIH-3T3 cell lines, allowing analyses of translation that are technically impossible using animal tissues. We also performed the same procedure in the absence of TALENs to isolate wild-type clones. We obtained nine mutants with very low Ki-67 expression. Cloning and sequencing showed that five had biallelic mutations around the ATG codon (<a href=\"#fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). As in mice, even though Ki-67 was visible by immunofluorescence, Ki-67 was barely detectable by Western blot in all clones analysed (<a href=\"#fig3s9\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 9A</a>). All clones proliferated efficiently (<a href=\"#fig3s9\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 9B</a>). qRT-PCR showed that mutants did not have decreased Ki-67 mRNA levels compared to WT NIH-3T3 cells; indeed, like mutant MEFs, clone 14 had a higher level (<a href=\"#fig3s9\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 9C</a>). We selected two clones for further analysis of Ki-67 translation. Clone 14 had lost the ATG codon in one allele, but had acquired an insertion of 4 nucleotides after the ATG in the second allele, generating the same shifted reading frame as the <i>Mki67<sup>2nt\u2206/2nt\u2206</sup></i>\u00a0mice. Clone 21 had lost the ATG codon in both alleles, thus mimicking the situation with <i>Mki67<sup>21nt\u2206/21nt\u2206</sup></i>\u00a0mice. qRT-PCR quantification of Ki-67 mRNA from ribosome purifications shows that in clones 14 and 21 there was no decrease in ribosome association with Ki-67 mRNA; indeed, in clone 14 it increased, probably due to the higher Ki-67 mRNA level (<a href=\"#fig3s10\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). To definitively determine levels of Ki-67 translation in the mutants, we performed SILAC quantitative mass spectrometry from exponentially growing WT or mutant NIH-3T3 cells cultured in light (L) (WT) or heavy-labelled (H) medium (clones 14 and 21). Chromatin was purified and run on SDS-PAGE. Peptides were purified from two gel slices, one around the predicted size of full length Ki-67 (&gt;250\u00a0kDa; band 1) and one at a smaller size (130k\u00a0Da-250\u00a0kDa, band 2). Ki-67 could not be positively identified in clones 14 and 21 (<a href=\"#fig3s11\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 11</a>). In peptides from WT cells (L), 44 peptides derived from Ki-67 were identified by MS/MS. In contrast, in peptides from mutant cell lines (H), no MS/MS spectra for Ki-67 could be identified in either band. Selecting the \u2018re-quantify\u2019 option in MaxQuant (that forces quantitation of identified light peaks against any peaks that have the expected difference in m/z ratio), the ratios H/L observed for putative Ki-67 peaks were in the range of most typical contaminants that are only found unlabelled in a SILAC experiment. In band 1, the median normalised H/L intensity ratio of the 5 corresponding m/z peaks in clone 14 was 0.095 (mean, 0.100, SD, 0.02), and in clone 21 (7 peptides) was 0.191 (mean 0.203, SD 0.05). In band 2, which would result from truncated or degraded Ki-67, there were only 3 corresponding peaks, with median H/L ratios for clones 14 and 21 of 0.358 (mean, 0.402, SD, 0.30) and 0.500 (mean, 0.454, SD 0.33) respectively. Taken together, these results show that if Ki67 is translated in the mutant cell lines, it is at trace levels that are not positively identifiable by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry. At best, translation can occur from the mutated Ki-67 gene with an estimated 10% efficiency. The product is most likely an N-terminally truncated protein lacking the conserved FHA-domain, arising from a downstream in-frame ATG."

To rule out this possibility we devised a 'double TALEN' strategy to completely eliminate Ki-67 expression. We designed and synthesised an additional TALEN pair targeting a sequence downstream of the translation stop codon. We co-transfected the ATG TALEN pair and the Stop TALEN pair with a GFP knock-in construct containing homology arms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We thus isolated several monoclonal cell lines in which Ki-67 mRNA was essentially eliminated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating efficient nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). These cell lines had no residual Ki-67 protein expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), confirming that the basal immunostaining seen in clones 14 and 21 indeed reflected trace level Ki-67 expression. We used Southern blotting of genomic DNA to characterise these alleles. The 3\u2019 end of the <i>Mki67</i> gene remained intact in all clones, while the 5\u2019 end of mutants showed a rearrangement consistent with a tandem insertion of multiple copies of the knockin construct upstream of the <i>Mki67</i> ORF (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the <i>Mki67</i> gene was severely disrupted but not deleted. These Ki-67-negative cells proliferated normally. Growth curves and DNA content profiles were indistinguishable from controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Time-lapse videomicroscopy showed that although individual clones had slightly different cell cycle lengths, cell division time was not significantly different between WT and mutant clones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We noticed that mitotic cells of one of the clones lacking Ki-67 had an altered chromosomal periphery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Such a phenotype has previously been\u00a0reported in Ki-67 knockdown HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). Nevertheless, these cells could divide efficiently."

We generated stable human cell lines with inducible or constitutive expression of shRNA that silenced Ki-67 or a non-silencing control (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">2A</a>). We used the non-transformed human fibroblast cell line BJ-hTERT, and two commonly used cancer cell lines, HeLa and U2OS, which are of epithelial and mesenchymal origin, respectively. In BJ-hTERT, inducing shRNA expression largely prevented Ki-67 expression but had no detectable effect on the kinetics of entry into the cell cycle, as judged by expression of cell cycle regulators and EdU incorporation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Further reducing residual Ki-67 levels with siRNA also did not affect cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Similarly, constitutive knockdown of Ki-67 in stable shRNA-expressing HeLa or U2OS cells had no effect on cell cycle distribution nor on the expression of cell cycle regulators (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Analysing single cells by immunofluorescence showed that knockdown U2OS cells with undetectable Ki-67 expression incorporated EdU in a similar manner to control cells, demonstrating efficient DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

To do this, we expressed FLAG-tagged versions of full-length human Ki-67 or an unrelated protein (TRIM39) in U2OS cells, and pulled down proteins from nuclear extracts with anti-FLAG antibody (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These were analysed by label-free mass spectrometry. This approach identified 406 proteins specific to the Ki-67 pulldown (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These included known Ki-67 partners: CDK1, an established Ki-67 kinase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blethrow et al., 2008</a>), nucleolar protein NIFK (<a href=\"#bib51\">Takagi et al., 2001</a>), protein phosphatase 1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>), and five subunits (HCFC1, HSPA8, MATRIN3, RBBP5 and WDR5) of a histone methylase complex that interacts with the nuclear receptor coregulator NRC (also known as NCOA6; <a href=\"#bib15\">Garapaty et al., 2009</a>). Gene ontology and STRING analysis classified the Ki-67 interactors as being enriched in two general processes: chromatin regulation and ribosomal biogenesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Specifically, interactors could be subdivided into groups involved in chromatin modification and transcription, ribosomal subunit biogenesis, pre-rRNA processing, protein translation, and splicing. These interactions suggested that Ki-67 might be involved not only in ribosomal biogenesis, as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rahmanzadeh et al., 2007</a>), but also in regulating chromatin. Among chromatin regulators interacting with Ki-67, we found the NRC-interacting methylase complex; KMT2D, ASH2L and SUZ12 proteins which are components of MLL and PRC2/EED-EZH1 complexes which regulate histone H3 methylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Patel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pasini et al., 2004</a>); SETD1A, HCFC1, HDAC2, YY1 and RCOR1, which are components of H3K4 demethylase complexes and co-repressors; and UHRF1, which binds to H3K9me3-modified chromatin and is involved in both maintaining DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bostick et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Guetg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rottach et al., 2010</a>). Ki-67 also interacts with TIP5, the major component of the nucleolar remodelling complex (NoRC) which is required to establish and maintain perinucleolar heterochromatic rDNA, as well as NoRC-interacting proteins TTF1 and DNM3."

Briefly, soon after the onset of mitosis, when transcription is shut down, the nucleolus is rapidly disassembled; it then slowly reforms through the formation of intermediary organelles that undergo consecutive transformations, identifying three distinct organelle stages, and the process is complete by telophase. The first of these three intermediary organelles is a sheath of nucleolar proteins that forms around the surface of the mitotic chromosomes, the so-called 'perichromosomal region' or PR. To date, not much is known about the <i>trans</i>-acting factors involved in PR formation. Remarkably, we found that Ki-67 depletion totally disrupted PR formation and PES1 no longer associated with the chromosome surface (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A similar finding, using other nucleolar proteins than PES1 as PR markers, was recently reported (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>)."

We found that Ki-67 knocked\u00a0down U2OS cells, that have essentially undetectable Ki-67, could still incorporate normal levels of 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) in nucleolar RNA. This suggests that rRNA transcription is not altered (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next looked at pre-rRNA processing pathways by Northern blotting of precursor rRNAs or intermediates (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This showed that silencing Ki-67 expression by shRNA or siRNA had no significant effect on pre-rRNA processing in four different cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We did, however, notice a marginal but reproducible increase in the level of the 47S precursor rRNA, indicating a mild delay in the early nucleolar pre-rRNA cleavage steps (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The tumour suppressor TP53 (p53) is a sensor of nucleolar stress resulting from defective ribosome biogenesis, and it represses ribosomal gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bursac et al., 2014</a>). Impairment of early pre-rRNA cleavage steps upon depletion of Ki-67 was independent of p53 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that while Ki-67 is dispensable for efficient pre-rRNA processing, it is essential for the formation of the perichromosomal layer during nucleologenesis."

We next asked whether it is involved in control of mRNA expression. We performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis from U2OS and HeLa cells expressing non-silencing control\u00a0or Ki-67 shRNA, using Agilent gene-microarrays. Ki-67 knockdown led to downregulation (corrected p value &lt;0.02, Fold-change &gt;1.5) of over 200 genes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Expression of cell cycle regulatory genes was not affected. Additionally, Ki-67 silencing caused upregulation (corrected p value &lt;0.02, Fold-change &gt;1.5) of a wide variety of genes involved in neural, testis and cardiovascular system development and differentiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). These were strikingly enriched in genes encoding zinc-finger proteins and olfactory receptors, two gene families that are highly enriched in nucleolar associated-domains (NADs) of perinucleolar heterochromatin (PNHC)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">N\u00e9meth et al., 2010</a>).

We thus hypothesised that Ki-67 might be required for heterochromatin compaction. To directly assess chromatin compaction in living cells, we used a F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer-Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FRET-FLIM)-based assay. In this system, HeLa cells stably co-express versions of histone H2B labelled with eGFP and mCherry. Inter-nucleosomal interactions between H2B-eGFP and H2B-mCherry generates FRET, whose efficiency depends on the distance between nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ll\u00e8res et al., 2009</a>). We depleted Ki-67 by siRNA and studied the effects on FRET efficiency in interphase cells (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ll\u00e8res et al., 2009</a>), a heterogeneous FRET efficiency map was observed throughout control siRNA nuclei, reflecting different chromatin compaction states (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Upon Ki-67 depletion, the mean FRET percentage decreased, reflecting a reduction in total chromatin compaction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The highest FRET populations, including heterochromatin regions at the nuclear periphery and around nucleoli, were largely eliminated upon Ki-67 depletion, with a few remaining condensed foci predominantly located at the nuclear periphery (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>). In contrast, a population of less compact chromatin increased."

To determine whether Ki-67 knockdown also affects long range interactions, we assessed interactions between perinucleolar and pericentromeric heterochromatin. We stained for the centromeric histone variant CENP-A to determine the localisation of centromeric DNA. In HeLa and U2OS cells, CENP-A showed a non-random nuclear localisation and clustered around nucleoli (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>, arrowheads), confirming that CENP-A can be used as a surrogate marker for adjacent pericentromeric DNA. Consistent with our hypothesis, this interaction was disrupted upon Ki-67 knockdown, and the CENP-A signal was no longer grouped around nucleoli but dispersed throughout the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). These results imply that Ki-67 mediates interaction between different regions in the genome that are normally packaged into heterochromatin, and could potentially maintain silencing of genes by recruiting them to constitutive heterochromatin."

We asked whether they were affected by downregulation of Ki-67. Stable shRNA-mediated Ki-67 knockdown in HeLa, U2OS and inducible knockdown in BJ-hTERT fibroblasts caused a visible reduction in nucleolar staining of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig10s3\">3</a>). This mark was relocalised either to foci in proximity to the nucleolus or a punctate pattern dispersed throughout the nucleus. In mouse cells, where pericentromeric heterochromatin is prominent, H3K9me3 staining colocalised with DAPI-dense chromocentres, but TALEN-ablation of <i>Mki67</i> resulted in general nuclear punctate H3K9me3 that was excluded from nucleoli (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). Western blotting revealed that Ki-67 depletion did not affect the overall levels of these chromatin modifications (<a href=\"#fig10s4\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We also analysed the localisation of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which binds to chromatin containing H3K9me3. Immunofluoresence showed that, surprisingly, despite the loss of the intense H3K9me3 staining regions in the <i>Mki67</i> mutant cells, all three HP1 isoforms maintained their localisation at DAPI-dense regions (<a href=\"#fig10s5\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Next, we determined whether heterochromatic histone marks were reduced on specific DNA sequences, or whether they were retained but the sequences themselves were delocalised. To do this we examined co-localisation of H3K9me3 with mouse major satellite DNA, by combining immunofluorescence with fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). In control cells, major satellite DNA, DAPI-dense regions and H3K9me3 largely colocalised (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). In cells lacking Ki-67, major satellite DNA was still present at regions of compacted DNA, despite the loss of H3K9me3 at these regions (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that Ki-67 is required for maintaining heterochromatic histone marks at genomic regions that are organised into heterochromatin."

To see whether Ki-67 is sufficient to promote heterochromatin formation, we cloned a full-length cDNA encoding human Ki-67, that we fused to the eGFP gene, and transfected it into U2OS cells. There was a strong correlation between cells with higher levels of exogenous Ki-67 and appearance of DAPI-dense foci resembling ectopic heterochromatin, marked by H3K9me3 and HP1 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Cells showing this phenotype were negative for cyclin A staining, suggesting that they were unable to enter S-phase, whereas lower expression did not prevent cyclin A accumulation (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). They were also negative for histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation, a mitotic marker (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).\u00a0If controlling heterochromatin organisation is a major function of Ki-67, it is likely to be conserved in more distantly related Ki-67 homologues. In a proteomics-based screen for proteins associated with replicating chromatin in egg extracts, we identified a putative <i>Xenopus</i> Ki-67 homologue (<a href=\"#fig11s2\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To assess whether <i>Xenopus</i> and human Ki-67 are functionally conserved, we cloned and HA-tagged full-length <i>Xenopus</i> Ki-67 and expressed it in U2OS cells. Whereas in interphase, exogenous <i>Xenopus</i> Ki-67 is present ubiquitously on chromatin, it colocalises with endogenous Ki-67 in mitosis at the perichromosomal region (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). Overexpression of <i>Xenopus</i> Ki-67, like human Ki-67, caused extreme chromatin compaction (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). We conclude that controlling heterochromatin is a conserved essential function of Ki-67."

Using various genetic and knockdown approaches, we found no evidence for this in any cell type we tested: HeLa, U2OS, BJ-hTERT and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Our data show that Ki-67 expression can be uncoupled from cell proliferation in both directions. Indeed, not only can cells lacking Ki-67 proliferate efficiently, conversely, interfering with Ki-67 downregulation by disrupting the <i>Cdh1</i> gene did not prevent cell cycle exit in vivo. It remains possible that certain cell lines are more sensitive to inhibition of Ki-67 expression, eg cancer cell lines of bladder (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kausch et al., 2003</a>) or renal (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zheng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">2009</a>) origins. Alternatively, off-target effects of previous antisense or RNAi approaches might have contributed to the cell proliferation defects observed in previous studies, as none of them employed restoration controls using silencing-insensitive constructs. Such rescue experiments are virtually unfeasible given the large size of Ki-67, the targeting of silencing oligonucleotides to the repeated domains, and the fact that Ki-67 overexpression induces ectopic heterochromatin. Several other studies used different approaches. In one, microinjection of an anti-Ki-67 antibody in 3T3 cells did not cause an abolition of cell division (<a href=\"#bib47\">Starborg et al., 1996</a>). Instead, there was a modest reduction, from 80% to 64%, of dividing cells over a 36-hr period. Another study used chromophore-mediated light inactivation of Ki-67 after injecting chromophore-labelled Ki-67 antibodies, and found an inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rahmanzadeh et al., 2007</a>). However, such an approach might cause non-specific collateral damage to nucleolar processes where Ki-67 is localised."

We showed that Ki-67 is required for the maintenance of a high level of compaction typical of heterochromatin, and mediates long-range interactions between different regions of the genome that are packaged into heterochromatin. We speculate that heterochromatin compaction relies on local interactions that depend on Ki-67. Cells lacking Ki-67 show altered gene expression profiles upon long-term Ki-67 silencing, with a striking correlation between upregulation of genes that normally are physically associated with perinucleolar heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib32\">N\u00e9meth et al., 2010</a>). To determine possible mechanisms of action of Ki-67, we comprehensively identified its interacting partners. We thus found at least seventeen proteins that are involved in histone methylation complexes or are interactors of methylated chromatin required for heterochromatin maintenance. This suggests that Ki67 might target these proteins to their genomic sites to promote heterochromatin formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, Ki-67 downregulation led to reduction of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 at heterochromatin, while Ki-67 overexpression caused appearance of ectopic heterochromatic foci enriched in these methylation marks. Unexpectedly, Ki-67 downregulation did not prevent association of HP1 isoforms with heterochromatin. Possibly, low levels of H3K9me3 or H4K20me3 persist and are sufficient for recruitment of HP1, or alternative mechanisms exist to localise HP1 to chromatin. The former hypothesis would be consistent with the observation that loss of the Suv39H methyltransferases that are responsible for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 abrogates HP1 recruitment to heterochromatin in mice, whose late embryonic growth and survival is impaired (<a href=\"#bib36\">Peters et al., 2001</a>). Nevertheless, evidence for the latter possibility has been provided by a study in <i>C.elegans</i>, in which genome-wide distribution of HP1 binding, as assessed by ChIP-seq, was conserved in animals lacking H3K9 di- and trimethylation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garrigues et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Given the requirement for Ki-67 expression in organising heterochromatin, it is perhaps surprising that mouse development is not affected by Ki-67 downregulation. This once again highlights the robustness of biological systems. However, to determine whether mouse development can occur normally in the complete absence of Ki-67 will require a gene deletion rather than a gene disruption mediated by genome-editing, as we found that even deletion of the translation initiation ATG using TALENs did not completely abolish Ki-67 expression. The eight subsequent ATG codons are out of frame, and the next in-frame ATG is 433 bp downstream. Translation from any frameshifted ATG will lead to a premature stop codon within 65 nucleotides. Although NMD of the mRNA did not occur, translation was strongly reduced. This is probably due to the presence of many out-of-frame ATG codons before the next in-frame ATG codon, as well as the distance from the 5\u2019 end of the mRNA. It is likely that the residual Ki-67 in proliferating cells occurred from the next in-frame ATG, thus eliminating the most highly conserved domain of Ki-67, the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. However, the unexpected translation in the mutants suggests that care should be taken to examine possible low level expression of proteins after mutating start sites using genome editing approaches."

                        "text": "Since Ki-67 is degraded upon cell cycle exit, we speculate that this may alter chromatin structure. For example, Ki-67 degradation might be involved in heterochromatin rearrangements observed during senescence onset. Facultative heterochromatic foci, that characterise some senescent cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Narita et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">2006</a>) are not a consistent feature of senescence in all cell types. In contrast, large-scale satellite heterochromatin decondensation is an early step in senescence in all cells studied and it precedes loss of H3K9me3 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Swanson et al., 2013</a>). As Ki-67 is required for heterochromatin compaction, its degradation may be involved in the heterochromatin decompaction occurring upon senescence onset. Heterochromatin reorganisation caused by Ki-67 downregulation does not interfere with cell cycle progression or cell proliferation, but likely contributes to remodelling of gene expression. Heterochromatin is also less compact in highly proliferative pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that heterochromatin organisation is critical for determining transcriptional responses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fussner et al., 2011</a>). Ki-67 overexpression, which led to pronounced chromatin condensation, appeared to arrest the cell cycle in G1, implying that controlled Ki-67 degradation is required to allow unperturbed progression through the cell cycle."

Inhibitors of nucleolar functions have indeed been shown to selectively kill cancer cells, leaving non-cancerous cells intact (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bywater et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Peltonen et al., 2014</a>). It is therefore critical to understand how the nucleolus forms during mitosis. An important step in nucleolar assembly is the formation of a sheath of nucleolar proteins around the chromosome surface on the metaphase plate. This so-called perichromosomal layer has been suggested to play roles in chromosome protection, in the faithful partitioning of nucleolar proteins between daughter cells, and in the segregation of opportunistic passenger proteins. Whether the PR performs any of these functions or has other, unidentified, roles will be a promising field for future studies. In this study, we have identified Ki-67 as one of the first <i>trans</i>-acting factors involved in PR formation during nucleologenesis, corroborating a recent report (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>)."

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) was performed using an inverted laser scanning multiphoton microscope LSM780 (Zeiss) equipped with temperature-controlled environmental black walls chamber. Measurements were acquired at 37\u00b0C, with a 63\u00d7 oil immersion lens NA 1.4 Plan-Apochromat objective from Zeiss. Two-photon excitation was achieved using a Chameleon Ultra II tunable (680\u20131080 nm) laser (Coherent) to pump a mode-locked frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser that provided sub-150-femtosecond pulses at a 80-Mhz repetition rate with an output power of 3.3 W at the peak of the tuning curve (800 nm). Enhanced detection of the emitted photons was afforded by the use of the HPM-100 module (Hamamatsu R10467-40 GaAsP hybrid PMT tube). The fluorescence lifetime imaging capability was provided by TCSPC electronics (SPC- 830; Becker &amp; Hickl GmbH). TCSPC measures the time elapsed between laser pulses and the fluorescence photons. EGFP and mCherry fluorophores were used as a FRET pair. The optimal two-photon excitation wavelength to excite the donor (EGFP) was determined to be 890 nm\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Ll\u00e8res et al., 2007</a>). Laser power was adjusted to give a mean photon count rate of the order 4.10<sup>4</sup>\u201310<sup>5</sup> photons/s. For imaging live cells by FLIM, the standard growth medium was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were acquired over 90\u2009s and fluorescence lifetimes were calculated for all pixels in the field of view (256\u00d7256 pixels) and then a particular region of interest (e.g., nucleus) was selected using SPCImage software (Becker &amp; Hickl, GmbH)."

We consider that it is vitally important that researchers in genetics, and mouse genetics in particular, should be aware that endonuclease-generated \u201cknockouts\u201d may not be functional knockouts. Many researchers these days (including ourselves) target genes in cell lines using CrispR to ablate the translation initiation ATG codon. We did this for Ki-67 in both cell lines and in the mouse using the related (and still recent) technology of TALENs. Because Ki-67 antibodies are highly sensitive (they recognise a highly repeated sequence and have been extensively optimised due to their biomedical use), we can detect what appears to be residual expression in biallelic mutants, both in the mouse and in monoclonal cell lines. Typically, we see many smaller lower intensity bands even in wild-type cells, probably resulting either from protein degradation (even within cells) or alternative splicing isoforms. All bands are strongly reduced on knockdown or mutation, but we do not usually blot the entire membrane. Western blots already presented were not artificially cropped, the membranes had been cut to allow probing for other proteins at different molecular weights. We agree that it is important to investigate further the apparent residual expression in Ki-67 mutants and we have spent the majority of the last three months doing this. Briefly, we have done the following:"

Whereas the first (\u22062nt) mouse retained the ATG translation initiation codon but had an immediate downstream frameshift, the second mouse line (\u220621nt) has lost the initiation ATG codon. We investigated whether this would generate a functional knockout and if not, how this would affect expression. \u220621nt homozygotes show an identical lack of phenotype to the first mouse, and a very similar residual level of Ki-67 protein in proliferating tissues, that we estimated to be around 10%. Additionally, we isolated MEFs from the \u22062nt mouse and performed qRT-PCR and Western blotting. We present an uncropped Western blot demonstrating that there is no appearance of a shorter form. This led to an identical conclusion: destroying the ATG eliminates the majority, but probably not all, of the expression."

Importantly, by Western blotting and immunofluorescence these showed very similar residual Ki-67 expression levels to the mutant mice and MEFs. The use of immortal mouse cell lines rather than proliferative tissues (the intestine is, of course, sensitive to protein degradation) enabled us to undertake a sophisticated analysis of translation. This involved, firstly, qRT-PCR of mRNA levels, showing that mRNA expression is not decreased (there is no nonsense-mediated decay). We confirmed that this is also true in the intestinal tissue and in MEFs. We then performed two series of experiments that are technically virtually impossible in vivo. In the first, we purified and quantified Ki-67 mRNA from different ribosomal fractions. Again, neither mutant showed a decrease in levels that would have indicated a decrease in translation initiation. This implies that the approximately 10-fold reduction seen in protein levels by Western blotting results not from defective translation initiation but from frameshifted (and potentially truncated) translation. Finally, we performed SILAC-proteomics by mass spectrometry to quantify Ki-67 protein in the mutants and attempt to identify whether it is truncated or not. This showed that in both mutants Ki-67 is undetectable \u2013 no Ki-67 heavy peptides were identifiable by MS/MS. Nevertheless, by expected peak m/z isotopic pattern similarity to the control sample peptides, we could identify and quantify a number of peptides in the mutants that may derive from Ki-67. This led to several main conclusions. Firstly, there is probably residual Ki-67 translation in the biallelic mutants but the level is <i>extremely</i> low. No residual expression could be positively identified in either of the two mutants, one of which retains the ATG on one allele but has an immediate frameshift thereafter, the other lacking the ATG altogether. Quantitation of the putative Ki-67 peptides in the mutants revealed that this protein is present at about 10% of the level of full length Ki-67 in the WT. Finally, no putative peptides were detected that could derive from the N-terminus, suggesting that the basal expression is of an N-terminally truncated protein."

Our shRNA was, however, highly optimised to ensure the most effective knockdown possible. We firstly characterised three different shRNA vectors and chose the most efficient. We then used increasingly high levels of puromycin selection after lentiviral infection, and FACs sorting based on intensity of the co-expressed turbo-GFP or RFP, to generate stable cell lines with the highest expression. For inducible shRNA we additionally used high doxycyclin levels for induction of the shRNA. However, the experiment using inducible shRNA in non-transformed cells to prevent Ki-67 expression upon re-entry into the cell cycle shows less effective knockdown. This is because the shRNA is not well induced by doxycyclin in serum-starved cells. We were only able to do this experiment by inducing the shRNA prior to serum starvation. We should add, however, that we also used siRNA for several sets of experiments, notably the H2B-FRET and pre-rRNA processing experiments. Nobody, however, has performed rescue of full-length Ki-67 using si/sh-resistant constructs: careful reading of the Booth et al. paper shows that the siRNA-resistant Ki-67 employed is only a fairly short N-terminal fragment (that nevertheless rescued the nucleolar protein targeting)."

As requested, we have now done time-lapse on the mutant cells that express no residual Ki-67. We thus quantified cell cycle length. Within a clone there is significant variability in cell cycle length between cells. While one of the two mutant clones (60) has a marginally longer cell cycle (p&lt;0.05), this appears to be a clone effect as the other clone (65) does not. The latter clone does, however, show an unusual mitotic chromosome morphology, as the Booth et al., paper also shows using siRNA. Cells could, however, divide normally. And we have quantified EdU incorporation by FACs to determine the sensitivity of the mutant clones to serum starvation. This shows that, indeed, there is a mild effect of loss of Ki-67 in these mutant clones: cells starve more effectively, fewer of them remain able to incorporate EdU after 72h at 0.1% serum. Nevertheless, this does not alter our conclusion that starved cells are perfectly capable of entering into and progressing through the cell cycle in the absence of detectable Ki-67.
