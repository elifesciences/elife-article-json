Whilst essential for meiosis and fertility, the molecular structure of the SC has proved resistant to elucidation. The SC protein SYCP3 has a crucial but poorly understood role in establishing the architecture of the meiotic chromosome. Here we show that human SYCP3 forms a highly-elongated helical tetramer of 20 nm length. N-terminal sequences extending from each end of the rod-like structure bind double-stranded DNA, enabling SYCP3 to link distant sites along the sister chromatid. We further find that SYCP3 self-assembles into regular filamentous structures that resemble the known morphology of the SC lateral element. Together, our data form the basis for a model in which SYCP3 binding and assembly on meiotic chromosomes leads to their organisation into compact structures compatible with recombination and crossover formation."

Whilst essential for meiosis and fertility, the molecular structure of the SC has proved resistant to elucidation. The SC protein SYCP3 has a crucial but poorly understood role in establishing the architecture of the meiotic chromosome. Here we show that human SYCP3 forms a highly-elongated helical tetramer of 20 nm length. N-terminal sequences extending from each end of the rod-like structure bind double-stranded DNA, enabling SYCP3 to link distant sites along the sister chromatid. We further find that SYCP3 self-assembles into regular filamentous structures that resemble the known morphology of the SC lateral element. Together, our data form the basis for a model in which SYCP3 binding and assembly on meiotic chromosomes leads to their organisation into compact structures compatible with recombination and crossover formation."

A protein complex known as the synaptonemal complex acts as a \u2018zipper\u2019, pulling the chromosomes in each pair closer together. The arms of the maternal chromosome and the paternal chromosome are so close that they sometimes cross over and swap a section of DNA. These crossovers perform two critical functions. First, they recombine the genetic information of a cell, so that offspring can benefit from new gene combinations. Second, they help to hold the chromosomes together at a key point of meiosis, reducing the chances that the wrong number of chromosomes ends up in a sperm or egg cell."

Synapsis is achieved by the assembly of an elegant molecular structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), which acts as a \u2018zipper\u2019 to bring in close apposition pairs of homologous chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Page and Hawley, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yang and Wang, 2009</a>). The functional architecture provided by the SC is essential for meiotic recombination and crossover formation; disruption of SC formation in mice leads to meiotic failure, infertility and embryonic death through aneuploidy (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yuan et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">de Vries et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kouznetsova et al., 2011</a>).

These studies have shown that the SC adopts the same characteristic tripartite structure in all sexually reproducing organisms in which it is found, from yeast to humans (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moses, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</a>). Thus, the SC is comprised of two approximately 50 nm wide lateral elements (LEs) that coat the chromosome axes, and a 100 nm wide central region that in almost all organisms contains a mid-line 20\u201340 nm wide central element (CE). The central and lateral elements are continuous along the entire chromosome axis (up to 24 \u03bcm in human spermatocytes) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Solari, 1980</a>) and are joined together by a series of interdigitating transverse filaments, which provide the 100 nm distance between lateral elements that defines the central region. Whilst lateral elements are often amorphous in appearance, in a number of species they present a regular 20 nm pattern of repeating dark and light bands along the longitudinal axis, hinting at structural regularity in the assembly of its underlying protein constituents (<a href=\"#bib57\">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</a>). In recent years, the principal protein components of the mammalian SC have been identified and localised within the structure through immunofluorescence and immunogold staining (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fraune et al., 2012b</a>). According to this initial map of the SC, the SYCE1, SYCE2, SYCE3 and TEX12 proteins form the central element, whilst SYCP2 and SYCP3 are the main constituents of the lateral element (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Costa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hamer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schramm et al., 2011</a>). The transverse filaments are formed by SYCP1, with its N- and C-termini located in the central and lateral elements respectively (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schmekel et al., 1996</a>). SC protein orthologues are present throughout vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Boer and Heyting, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fraune et al., 2014</a>); key SC components such as SYCP1 and SYCP3 also show wider evolutionary conservation across metazoan organisms (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fraune et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2013</a>)."

At this stage, homologous chromosomes are brought into a loose 400 nm-wide alignment, whilst lateral element proteins SYCP2 and SYCP3 are recruited to the chromosome axes in an inter-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pelttari et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). Their recruitment also depends on the prior assembly of a cohesin core that includes meiosis-specific components SMC1\u03b2, RAD21L, REC8 and STAG3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Garcia-Cruz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Llano et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fukuda et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Winters et al., 2014</a>). In zygotene, homologous chromosomes are \u2018zipped\u2019 together into 100 nm synapsis by interdigitation of SYCP1 transverse filaments. This process is dependent on a network of interactions that form within the central element between the SYCP1 N-terminal region, SYCE1-3 and TEX12, including the higher order assembly of the constitutive SYCE2-TEX12 complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Costa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hamer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hamer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Davies et al., 2012</a>). To achieve synapsis also requires axis protein HORMAD1, which assembles on unsynapsed chromosomes independent of SYCP2 and SYCP3 during leptotene to zygotene, and subsequently dissociates upon SYCP1 synapsis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fukuda et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). At pachytene, the SC is fully formed, enabling the completion of meiotic recombination with the formation of typically two crossovers per tetrad. The SC is disassembled in diplotene, leading to the re-association of HORMAD1 on desynapsed chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fukuda et al., 2010</a>). At this stage, homologous chromosomes remain linked solely by crossovers, whose formation is essential for preventing aneuploidy. After disassembly, some SC components remain present at paired centromeres; additionally, SYCP3 is partially retained along chromosome arms until metaphase I (<a href=\"#bib46\">Parra et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bisig et al., 2012</a>)."

In males, it causes complete infertility owing to apoptotic cell death during meiotic prophase, with failure of SC formation and synapsis (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yuan et al., 2000</a>); in females, there is subfertility, with a high aneuploidy rate leading to embryonic death <i>in utero</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2002</a>). SYCP3 deficiency has two intriguing structural consequences for the chromosome axis: a doubling of chromosome axis length with respect to wild type, and premature disassembly of the cohesin cores during diplotene (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kouznetsova et al., 2005</a>). These findings suggest a role for SYCP3 in chromosome compaction and stabilisation of the cohesin core. The ectopic expression of SYCP3 in somatic cells leads to the formation of fibre-like higher order assemblies that show a regular repeating pattern with a periodicity of approximately 20 nm (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baier et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2007b</a>). Their assembly is dependent on the presence of the last six amino acids of SYCP3, which have been well conserved throughout evolution (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baier et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fraune et al., 2012a</a>). At the clinical level, several SYCP3 mutations have been identified in infertile men and women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miyamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bolor et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, SYCP3 is ectopically expressed in a variety of primary tumours, which is associated with an increased rate of aneuploidy caused by inhibition of double-strand break DNA repair through homologous recombination by BRCA2 and RAD51 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hosoya et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the molecular structure and function provided by SYCP3 is essential for meiotic cell division but can lead to apparently pathological consequences in mitosis."

We determine that SYCP3 is a tetrameric protein and that its helical core folds in an elongated rod-like structure spanning 20 nm in length. We show that SYCP3 can bind DNA through the N-terminal regions extending from its tetrameric core. As the DNA-binding sites are located at both tetramer ends, SYCP3 can act as a physical strut to hold distant regions of DNA together. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SYCP3 undergoes self-assembly into regular striated filamentous structures of 23 nm periodicity that resemble the native SC lateral element. We conclude that concurrent DNA-binding and higher order assembly by SYCP3 on meiotic chromosomes lead to compaction and organisation of the chromosome axis, in a manner conducive to SC central region assembly, recombination and crossover formation."

The helical chains of the SYCP3 tetramer are arranged in an alternating anti-parallel fashion, such that each end of the tetramer contains two N-termini and two C-termini. The SYCP3 structure undergoes a left-handed 90\u00b0 rotation along its length so that the two N-termini at each end of the tetramer lie in orthogonal planes. The tetrameric assembly is constructed from a combination of four-helix bundles and coiled-coil motifs. The two halves of the structure (hereafter referred to as arms) are formed of a four-helix bundle leading into a coiled-coil that zips together the C-terminal parallel chains, leaving the N-terminal ends to splay apart. In contrast, the centre of the molecule is asymmetrical, consisting of a coiled-coil between one pair of parallel chains that provides the left-handed 90\u00b0 rotation of the molecule. A noticeable consequence of this asymmetrical assembly is that each of the four SYCP3 chains adopts a unique conformation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The extensive network of hydrophobic and polar interactions within the two helical bundles is likely to be responsible for the high thermal stability of the SYCP3 structure. Each bundle contains a bipartite hydrophobic core consisting of a cluster of aromatic residues proximal to the middle of the tetramer and a more distal region centred around tryptophan W111 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The proximal aromatic-rich core of the four-helix bundle results from the close packing of Y125<sub>A/C</sub>, F129<sub>A/C</sub> and F133<sub>A/C</sub> with Y179<sub>B/D</sub> and F182<sub>B/D</sub>; it is extended by hydrophobic contacts with I175<sub>B/D</sub>, L178<sub>B/D</sub>, I183<sub>B/D</sub> and M186<sub>B/D</sub>, and hydrogen bonding between Y125<sub>A/C</sub> and Q181<sub>B/D</sub>, and between S126<sub>A/C</sub> and Y179<sub>B/D</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The second hydrophobic region is built around the two W111<sub>A/C</sub> residues, surrounded by L100<sub>A/C</sub>, I107<sub>A/C</sub>, F204<sub>B/D</sub> and M208<sub>B/D</sub>. Interestingly, W111 adopts two distinct conformations in chains A and C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>): in both cases, the indole ring packs against L197<sub>B/D</sub>, but engages in alternative hydrogen bonding with Q201<sub>B</sub> (W111<sub>A</sub>) or D194<sub>D</sub> (W111<sub>C</sub>). The two hydrophobic cores of the four-helix bundle are separated by a solvent-rich layer of polar residues, featuring at its centre R118<sub>A/C</sub>, bonded via salt link with E190<sub>B/D</sub>."

Instead, the central region likely oscillates between two conformations, in which the coiled-coil encompasses either chains B and D or chains A and C. In both conformations, the left-handed 90\u00b0 rotation would be retained; interchange between conformations would require a transitory super-helical unwinding of the central region. This dynamic interchange is supported by the abundance of conserved glutamine residues and would allow torsional rotation around the longitudinal axis of SYCP3. In the crystal structure, torsional rotation is precluded by the crystal lattice, freezing the central coiled-coil in a single conformation. Nevertheless, the higher crystallographic B-factors of the backbone atoms in the central region relative to rest of the structure support a dynamic rather than fixed conformation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

Analysis by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and fluorescence anisotropy using SYCP3<sub>\u0394Ct6</sub> (amino acids 1\u2013230) showed double-stranded DNA-binding, with the formation of a discrete protein-DNA complex at a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.20 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,H</a>). DNA-binding was dependent on the N-terminal regions of SYCP3, as it was not detected for SYCP3<sub>Core</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The N-termini of SYCP3 contain two conserved basic patches, BP1 (52-KRRKKR-57) and BP2 (88-KRKR-91) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>): alanine mutation of BP1 or BP2 in SYCP3<sub>\u0394Ct6</sub> (\u0394BP1 and \u0394BP2, respectively) caused a substantial reduction in binding affinity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E,H</a>), whilst mutation of both patches (\u0394BP1+2) completely eliminated DNA-binding by SYCP3<sub>\u0394Ct6</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,H</a>). For all SYCP3<sub>\u0394Ct6</sub> basic patch mutants, the tetrameric structure was confirmed by SEC-MALS (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We further detected DNA binding by a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 49\u201393 (GST-SYCP3<sub>BP1+2</sub>) spanning both basic patches; its significantly lower affinity than that of SYCP3<sub>\u0394Ct6</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) indicates that the tetrameric architecture may be important to orientate correctly the DNA-binding regions of the protein. The difference in DNA-binding affinity between \u0394BP1 and SYCP3<sub>Core</sub>, which includes BP2 but not BP1, suggests that additional amino acids surrounding the basic patch residues contribute to DNA binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). The antiparallel arrangement of chains in the SYCP3 tetramer predicts that SYCP3 can interact simultaneously with two DNA molecules, one at either end of the tetramer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>)."

The comparable size of the repeating unit relative to the length of the SYCP3<sub>Core</sub> structure suggests that the fibre contains stacked layers of SYCP3 molecules brought into parallel alignment by self-associating interactions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Fibre formation is eliminated by removal of the last six amino acids of the protein (SYCP3<sub>\u0394Ct6</sub>), in agreement with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baier et al., 2007a</a>), or by alanine mutation of a short stretch of conserved amino acids, 69-EVQNML-74 (SYCP3<sub>\u0394Nt6</sub>) N-terminal to the SYCP3 core (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A, 5C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, self-assembly of SYCP3 is mediated by specific amino acid motifs in the N- and C-terminal tails of the tetrameric core structure."

The proposed packing of SYCP3 molecules within the fibre would bring into juxtaposition the N- and C-terminal tails originating from tetramers located in adjacent layers. Thus, self-assembly may be driven by co-operative interactions of the terminal regions of the SYCP3 tetramers, extending recursively across the width of the fibre (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Such an arrangement of SYCP3 molecules would explain the regular striation pattern of the fibre, with layers of dense protein packing at the interface and looser, conformationally dynamic regions in the centre of the molecule accounting for the alternating dark and light bands. The presence of self-association and DNA-binding motifs within tetrameric ends suggests that both processes must be closely integrated; accordingly, we find that the presence of DNA is compatible with higher order assembly in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Acting as a molecular spacer, torsional rotation of SYCP3 may be critical in relieving strains in the DNA backbone that build during recombination and crossover formation.

The resultant ultrastructure of the meiotic chromosome axis would contain discrete stretches of chromosomal DNA compacted in a concertina-like manner within the newly formed lateral element, interspersed with chromatin loops protruding from the SC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

The loading of further SYCP3 tetramers may bridge between the initial pinched-off portions, creating a continuous structure that extends along the chromosome axis. Thus, the final assembly consists of a three-dimensional lattice of SYCP3 tetramers that organise the chromosome axis in a concertina-like manner such that the length of the axis is shortened and the chromatin loops (that will flank the SC) are lengthened.

The model provides a molecular basis for the known increase in chromosome axis length in oocytes of SYCP3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yuan et al., 2002</a>). It further predicts the formation of one chromatin loop for every two repeating units in the SYCP3 fibre (46 nm), closely matching the known evolutionarily conserved loop density of \u223c20 per 1 \u03bcm of chromosome axis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kleckner, 2006</a>). We envisage that SC assembly depends upon the regular and compact meiotic chromosome architecture imposed by SYCP3, explaining the formation of only short fragmented SC structures upon SYCP3 deficiency in mice (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yuan et al., 2000</a>). Furthermore, all SYCP3 mutations reported in human male infertility and female recurrent pregnancy loss affect the C-terminal sequence of the protein (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miyamoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bolor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nishiyama et al., 2011</a>); our structural analysis shows that these mutations would block higher order assembly whilst retaining tetramer formation, confirming a key role for meiotic chromosome organisation by SYCP3 in human fertility."

It is interesting to speculate that, instead of a single higher order structure, SYCP3 may compact chromosomal DNA into two parallel assemblies within the lateral element, separating sister chromatid DNA locally in the midline whilst retaining cohesion in the chromatin loops. In such a model, the structural organisation of sister chromatid DNA may inhibit inter-sister recombination whilst permitting inter-homologue recombination. A direct function of the SYCP3-dependent organisation of chromosomal DNA in recombination partner choice may also account for the tumourigenic effect of SYCP3 expression in somatic cells in which a high aneuploidy rate results from inhibition of DNA repair by inter-sister homologous recombination (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hosoya et al., 2012</a>)."

In vivo, SYCP3 function depends upon SYCP2 and the meiotic cohesin core, as SYCP3 recruitment to the chromosome axis is abrogated upon disruption of SYCP2, STAG3 or REC8/RAD21L (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Llano et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fukuda et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Winters et al., 2014</a>). We propose that these factors perform functions that are essential within the cellular context to facilitate DNA-binding and self-assembly of SYCP3 on the chromosome axis. The intrinsic propensity of SYCP3 to self-assemble into higher-order structures in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yuan et al., 1998</a>) suggests that its loading on the chromosome axis must be tightly regulated to prevent formation of unproductive cytoplasmic structures. This may be achieved by protein mediators, possibly SYCP2, that bind to SYCP3 and prevent its self-assembly until delivery onto chromosomal DNA. Whilst SYCP3 readily binds naked DNA in vitro, the meiotic cohesin core must present chromatin-bound DNA in a manner compatible with its binding and incorporation into SYCP3 assemblies. During assembly, additional interactions of SYCP3 with axis components may further facilitate necessary changes in local chromosome structure through sliding of cohesin and condensin rings (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cuylen et al., 2011</a>). The SYCP3 structure explains the constant loop density of compacted chromosomes, but it is presently unclear what determines the loop length and thus the chromosome axis length achieved by compaction. A role for meiotic cohesins is hinted at by the known shortening of the SYCP3-bound chromosome axis length upon disruption of SMC1\u03b2 or REC8 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bannister et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Revenkova et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Novak et al., 2008</a>).

The crystals were washed for 30 s in crystallisation solution supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, or were incubated for 1 hr in crystallisation solution supplemented with 100 mM NaI and 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. For iodide derivatives, X-ray data were collected at beamline PROXIMA1 of the SOLEIL synchrotron facility (Gif-sur-Yvette, France), at 100 K, wavelength 1.77120 \u00c5. Data were indexed and integrated in XDS (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kabsch, 2010</a>) and merged in Aimless (<a href=\"#bib20\">Evans, 2011</a>); the crystal belongs to spacegroup P1 (cell dimensions a = 49.18 \u00c5, b = 90.30 \u00c5, c = 104.22 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 108.25\u00b0, \u03b2 = 101.20\u00b0, \u03b3 = 102.75\u00b0), with two SYCP3 tetramers in the asymmetric unit. Initial SAD structure solution was achieved through the identification of 30 iodide sites using PHENIX AutoSol, and partial automated building into the density-modified experimental map using PHENIX Autobuild (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). The structure was extended and completed, with the identification of 13 additional iodide sites, by iterative manual building in Coot (<a href=\"#bib19\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and refinement using PHENIX Refine (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>).

For the native structure, X-ray data were collected at beamline I03 of the Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility (Oxfordshire, UK), at 100 K, wavelength 1.90740 \u00c5. Data were indexed and integrated in XDS (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kabsch, 2010</a>) and three datasets collected on a single crystal were merged in Aimless (<a href=\"#bib20\">Evans, 2011</a>).

Cor1 or SCP3), a 30-kD protein previously demonstrated to play an important role in the formation of meiotic chromosome axes and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly in mouse meiosis. SYCP3 is conserved among vertebrates, but lacks apparent homologs in other species. Axis formation is a much more broadly conserved feature of meiosis; it is shared by all known sexually reproducing species. The axes are thought to be a platform for assembly of the structurally conserved SC, which holds together homologous chromosomes and regulates recombination."

SYCP3 has a crucial but poorly understood role in establishing the architecture of the meiotic chromosome. Previous work has demonstrated that ectopic expression of SYCP3 in non-meiotic cells results in the formation of striated fibers; the work here demonstrates that the 20-nm extension of the rod-like SYCP3 central core, plus interaction domains at the N- and C-terminus of SYCP3, may account for the 23-nm periodicity observed by transmission EM analysis of these fibers."
