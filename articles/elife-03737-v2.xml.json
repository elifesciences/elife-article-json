At mitotic cycle 8, when few zygotic genes are being transcribed, embryonic chromatin is in a relatively simple state: there are few nucleosome free regions, undetectable levels of the histone methylation marks characteristic of mature chromatin, and low levels of histone acetylation at a relatively small number of loci. Histone acetylation increases by cycle 12, but it is not until cycle 14 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread. Early histone acetylation is strongly associated with regions that we have previously shown to be bound in early embryos by the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda, suggesting that Zelda triggers a cascade of events, including the accumulation of specific histone modifications, that plays a role in the subsequent activation of these sequences."

At mitotic cycle 8, when few zygotic genes are being transcribed, embryonic chromatin is in a relatively simple state: there are few nucleosome free regions, undetectable levels of the histone methylation marks characteristic of mature chromatin, and low levels of histone acetylation at a relatively small number of loci. Histone acetylation increases by cycle 12, but it is not until cycle 14 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread. Early histone acetylation is strongly associated with regions that we have previously shown to be bound in early embryos by the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda, suggesting that Zelda triggers a cascade of events, including the accumulation of specific histone modifications, that plays a role in the subsequent activation of these sequences."

Although several catalogs of blastoderm enhancers exist (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gallo et al., 2011</a>), they are limited in scope. To generate a larger set of likely enhancers, we took advantage of the strong correlation between the binding of transcription factors known to regulate blastoderm expression and enhancer activity (<a href=\"#bib40\">MacArthur et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fisher et al., 2012</a>). We calculated the cumulative in vivo binding landscape of 16 early developmental transcription factors, including the anteroposterior regulators Bicoid, Caudal, Hunchback, Giant, Kr\u00fcppel, Knirps, Huckebein, Tailless, and Dichaete; and the dorsoventral regulators Dorsal, Snail, Twist, Daughterless, Mothers against dpp, Medea, and Schnurri (<a href=\"#bib40\">MacArthur et al., 2009</a>).

This suggests that at least at the enhancers, ZLD binding is likely to play a major role in directing the deposition of the histone acetylation marks in early embryos. To investigate this further and to identify other factors that may play a major role in determining overall histone acetylation patterns, not just the enhancers in early embryos, we carried out k-mer enrichment analysis and used the motif search tool MEME (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</a>) to identify sequence motifs associated with different histone mark peaks identified at each stage. We found that the motif most strongly correlated with the early appearing marks, H3K27ac, H3K18ac and H4K8ac, was ZLD's CAGGTAG binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). A small number of other motifs also showed modest enrichment using these two methods, but they failed to show substantial enrichment when the enrichment is plotted around the histone mark peaks. These analyses thus suggested a close connection between ZLD binding and early histone acetylation in general, which is further highlighted by the extremely high degree of overlap between early (cycle 8) ZLD-bound peaks and early (cycles 8 or 12) peaks for H3K27ac, H3K18ac and H4K8ac (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The relationship is quantitative, with higher levels of ZLD binding coupled to increased levels of the same three marks in cycle 8 and cycle 12 embryos (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The relationship between ZLD binding and these histone marks decays over time (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), likely reflecting the increasingly complex transcriptional profile of the genome. However, the strength of this association in early stages of the MZT suggests that ZLD is indeed a dominant factor shaping the early chromatin landscape."

By combining high-resolution gene expression analysis with precise mapping of nine histone marks throughout this early stage of development, our data suggest that this reprogramming, at least in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, occurs by transitioning through a na\u00efve state in which many histone marks commonly present in somatic cells are absent or at comparably low levels. We further demonstrate that histone acetylation of H3K18, H3K27, and H4K8 precedes most histone methylation.

Immunostaining in mouse and bovine embryos has demonstrated that some histone methylation marks are removed following fertilization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2010</a>). Additionally, studies in zebrafish have demonstrated widespread changes in chromatin marks as the embryo progresses through the MZT. While the extent and location of specific histone modifications in zebrafish is not consistent between recent studies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lindeman et al., 2011</a>), a general widespread increase in histone methylation (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H3K9me3) is evident at the MZT.

By comparing high temporal-resolution transcription data to the quantitative histone modification data, we find that, at least in the early embryo, transcription often occurs in the near absence of these marks. These data confirm and extend the previous observation that H3K4me3 levels are first detectable at the MBT (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2013</a>).

Moreover, recent data has demonstrated that these marks may not be required for transcription later in development. For example, in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc, methylation of H3K4me3 is not required for transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hodl and Basler, 2012</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic tissue culture cells transcriptionally active euchromatin can be divided into two classes and only one of these is enriched for H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Filion et al., 2010</a>). Therefore transcription in the absence of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 is likely not a distinctive feature of early embryonic development. Additionally, data from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> show robust transcriptional activation of a gene localized to heterochromatin in the presence of minimal amounts of H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>)."

Because those genes marked by H3K4me3 early are more likely than most genes to be activated at the MZT, it has been proposed that this mark is preparing genes for activation in the early zebrafish embryo. Thus, while histone marks can be associated with specific transcriptional outputs it appears that they are neither necessary nor sufficient for predicting gene expression."

Our data suggest that there is essentially no condensed chromatin in the early embryo, as nucleosome density is relatively low, nucleosomes are relatively evenly distributed across the genome, and hallmarks of repressed chromatin are absent. This is consistent with the unusually broad binding of ZLD to its target sequences: ZLD binds to more than fifty percent of its target sites in the genome, far more than what is typical for other factors later in development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harrison et al., 2011</a>). We and others have shown that the restricted binding of other factors is largely due to the occlusion of most of their sites by condensed chromatin. Perhaps ZLD binds to a large fraction of its sites because there simply is no condensed chromatin in the early embryo.

First, 7mers enriched in the 2 kb sequences around the peaks for each experiment were identified by comparing the frequency of each 7mer to the 7mer distribution in randomly selected 2 kb sequences throughout the genome. The selection of the random sequences was restricted to the major chromosome arms excluding the heterochromatic sequences, and the distribution of the number of random sequences were set to match the distribution of peaks among different chromosome arms. The enrichment of the 7mers was ranked based on Z scores. In parallel, the motif enrichment analysis was also carried out using MEME (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</a>) with motif length set at 6\u201310 and maximum number of motifs to be found at 10. In this case the sequences located in the 250\u2013650 bp surrounding the maximum of the histone mark peak were used, and random sequences selected using the same criteria as the kmer enrichment analysis were used as negative control. The search was limited to the 150 top ranked peaks for each histone mark. After the candidate enriched motif was identified from these two methods, the motifs were used to map the enrichment around all the peaks by patser (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hertz and Stormo, 1999</a>) using a ln(p-value) cutoff of \u22127.5, and with Alphabet set at \u2018a:t 0.3 c:g 0.2\u2019."

However, the simplest explanation for this is that ZLD-bound regions are nucleosome-depleted and thus do not have H3K27me3 signal. Looking at the average plots of other histone modifications on <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, this dip is certainly observed for all other histone modifications, too (although the scale is different so it's hard to compare). The overlap between ZLD-bound regions and H3K27me3 regions as shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> is actually fairly low (&lt;50%) and could be explained by the fact that both Zelda and H3K27me3 are preferentially found at developmental genes. I would predict that the same relationship would be found between any other early transcription factor and H3K27me3 regions. I do find it very conceivable, however, that the H327ac that accumulates at ZLD enhancers would prevent H3K27me3 (as described by Tie et al. Development 2009) but the data shown in the manuscript have not convinced me yet that this is visible in the genome-wide H3K27me3 data (I am also surprised that the authors do not cite this paper)."

Unfortunately, this is only based on one gene and its published expression pattern. At the very least, one would like to see that the ZLD-bound region is indeed a late enhancer (e.g. based on Kwon et al. Nature 2014) and that this pattern can be observed for multiple enhancers. To my knowledge, early ZLD-bound regions are generally not active late so I would need better evidence to be convinced otherwise."

The authors determine the genomic distribution of histone H3 and different histone marks at 4 stages of embryogenesis using ChIP from tightly staged embryos. They integrate these datasets with previously published data on transcription and the binding of Pol II and the transcription factor Zelda. This allows the authors to investigate the dynamics of these chromatin features in general, at the transcription starting sites of different sets of genes (e.g. genes expressed during early embryogenesis, maternal genes, etc.), and around the locations of putative blastoderm embryo enhancers. Overall, this reveals that the genome appears relatively uniformly at mitotic cycle 8 and acquires the different histone modifications and nucleosome free regions only later between cycles 12 and 14. Correlations between histone modification patterns and Zelda binding strengthens the previous notion that Zelda is involved in zygotic genome activation and in defining embryonic enhancers. The authors repeat some of their experiments and analyses in embryos in which Zelda had been genetically depleted and found that the chromatin structure at intergenic position that bind Zelda in wildtype embryos was strongly affected while little effect was observed at TSS."

While this makes sense for RNA-seq data, it does not account for possible experimental variability in a ChIP experiment and the results are in my opinion difficult to interpret. In other words, the number of reads is unrelated and uninformative regarding the quality of a ChIP enrichment, i.e. if the IP step enriched for the respective antibody epitope comparably strongly or not. Similarly, it cannot control for potential differences in library complexity, i.e. the number of identical reads that can arise during PCR amplification."

While this makes sense for RNA-seq data, it does not account for possible experimental variability in a ChIP experiment and the results are in my opinion difficult to interpret. In other words, the number of reads is unrelated and uninformative regarding the quality of a ChIP enrichment, i.e. if the IP step enriched for the respective antibody epitope comparably strongly or not. Similarly, it cannot control for potential differences in library complexity, i.e. the number of identical reads that can arise during PCR amplification</i>."

Indeed we had done all of the analyses they suggest in the early stages of this paper, and chose to use the simple read-based normalization because the results were the same as when we used peak heights. We note that while it is certainly true that there is a lot of variation between antibodies in the efficacy of the immunoprecipitation, here we are only normalizing between parallel IPs using the same antibody (and carried out at the same time). While it is obviously possible for there to be differences in IP efficiency between experiments with the same antibody, our results here, and more generally, suggest that this is relatively uncommon, meaning that read- based normalization will work in most cases. Nonetheless, we have added an additional figure addressing consistency in the <i>D. pseudoobscura</i> IPs and discuss the use of peak-based normalization in the text."
