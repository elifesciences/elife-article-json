Here, we characterize a non-canonical ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in <i>Escherichia coli</i> that provides energy for maintaining OM lipid asymmetry via the transport of aberrantly localized phospholipids (PLs) from the OM to the inner membrane (IM). We establish that the transporter comprises canonical components, MlaF and MlaE, and auxiliary proteins, MlaD and MlaB, of previously unknown functions. We further demonstrate that MlaD forms extremely stable hexamers within the complex, functions in substrate binding with strong affinity for PLs, and modulates ATP hydrolytic activity. In addition, MlaB plays critical roles in both the assembly and activity of the transporter. Our work provides mechanistic insights into how the MlaFEDB complex participates in ensuring active retrograde PL transport to maintain OM lipid asymmetry."

Here, we characterize a non-canonical ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in <i>Escherichia coli</i> that provides energy for maintaining OM lipid asymmetry via the transport of aberrantly localized phospholipids (PLs) from the OM to the inner membrane (IM). We establish that the transporter comprises canonical components, MlaF and MlaE, and auxiliary proteins, MlaD and MlaB, of previously unknown functions. We further demonstrate that MlaD forms extremely stable hexamers within the complex, functions in substrate binding with strong affinity for PLs, and modulates ATP hydrolytic activity. In addition, MlaB plays critical roles in both the assembly and activity of the transporter. Our work provides mechanistic insights into how the MlaFEDB complex participates in ensuring active retrograde PL transport to maintain OM lipid asymmetry."

The presence of the outer membrane (OM) makes Gram-negative bacteria generally resistant to external insults, including antibiotics and detergents, and allows these bacteria to survive in harsh environments (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nikaido, 2003</a>). Unlike the inner membrane (IM), which is a phospholipid (PL) bilayer, the OM contains lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and PLs in the outer and inner leaflets, respectively (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kamio and Nikaido, 1976</a>). This unique lipid asymmetry, characterized by a tightly-packed LPS outer leaflet, renders the OM impermeable to a wide range of compounds, including hydrophobic molecules (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nikaido, 2003</a>)."

This disrupts the LPS layer and reduces the barrier function of the OM. The cell has developed mechanisms to cope with such perturbations on lipid asymmetry. Two OM \u03b2-barrel enzymes degrade PLs that have accumulated in the outer leaflet of the OM; OmpLA cleaves both acyl chains from the glycerol backbone of PLs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dekker, 2000</a>) while PagP transfers one acyl chain from PLs to LPS (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bishop, 2005</a>) or phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dalebroux et al., 2014</a>). In addition, the OmpC-Mla system is thought to maintain OM lipid asymmetry by removing PLs from the OM and transporting them back to the IM (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chong et al., 2015</a>). Osmoporin OmpC forms a complex with the OM lipoprotein MlaA that likely removes PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chong et al., 2015</a>). The periplasmic chaperone MlaC is believed to transport these extracted PLs across the aqueous periplasm, and hand them over to a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family transporter, MlaFEDB, at the IM (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</a>). Whether these PLs get inserted into the outer leaflet or transported back to the inner leaflet of the IM is not known."

In addition to MlaC, this system is proposed to contain a second substrate-binding protein (SBP), a single-pass membrane protein MlaD, that may be associated with the IM complex. Consistent with this idea, MlaD, along with MlaE and MlaF, are conserved across many species of Gram-negative bacteria and can also be found in actinomycetes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Casali and Riley, 2007</a>) and in plants (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benning, 2009</a>). The Mce4 pathway in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is important for cholesterol uptake (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</a>) while the TGD system in the chloroplasts of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> functions to transport phosphatidic acid (PA) from the plastid OM to the IM (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benning, 2009</a>), providing support for the proposed role of the OmpC-Mla system in lipid transport. In <i>E. coli</i> and a few other Gram-negative bacteria, a small cytoplasmic protein MlaB is also predicted to be part of the ABC transporter (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Casali and Riley, 2007</a>). MlaB contains a Sulfate Transporter and Anti-Sigma factor antagonist (STAS) domain that is believed to have a general nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding function (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aravind and Koonin, 2000</a>).

Within this complex, MlaD forms an SDS-resistant hexamer via its soluble domain, and we demonstrate that this domain binds PLs. We further show that MlaD depresses ATP hydrolytic activity upon association with the MlaFEB sub-complex. Finally, we establish that MlaB is necessary for both the assembly and activity of the ABC transporter, likely by modulating MlaF structure and stability.

His-MlaE is expressed from a \u201cleaky\u201d expression plasmid that has been shown to yield low cellular levels of other proteins (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chong et al., 2015</a>). This construct is fully functional, as it is able to restore SDS/EDTA resistance in the \u0394<i>mlaE</i> mutant strain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Two unique protein bands at ~29 kDa and ~19 kDa co-purified with His-MlaE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These bands represent MlaF and MlaD, respectively, as they are no longer co-purified in the corresponding \u0394<i>mlaF</i> and \u0394<i>mlaD</i> mutant strains. Even though His-MlaE enabled enrichment of MlaF and MlaD, we are unable to detect the His-tagged protein in these samples, which have been heated prior to analysis. As there is a tendency for hydrophobic membrane proteins to aggregate when heated, we wondered if this was true for His-MlaE. Indeed, we are able to detect His-MlaE on immunoblots when the samples are not heated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel). His-MlaE migrates anomalously as a diffuse band around 24 kDa (expected 28 kDa), likely because it is still partially folded in the presence of SDS, a phenomenon commonly observed for multi-pass membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rath et al., 2009</a>). Remarkably, MlaD also migrates differently, now as a high molecular weight species, when the samples are not heated, suggesting that it may be forming oligomers. To examine if the interactions between MlaF, MlaE and MlaD were specific, we performed reciprocal affinity purification experiments using WT cells expressing C-terminally His-tagged MlaF (MlaF-His) or MlaD (MlaD-His) proteins, which we show are functional (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Even though we could not probe for MlaE due to the lack of appropriate antibodies, we demonstrate that MlaF-His and MlaD-His are able to pull down MlaD and MlaF, respectively, likely via interactions with MlaE (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Taken together, these results establish that MlaF, MlaE and MlaD interact specifically in a complex."

To determine whether MlaF, MlaE and MlaD form a stable complex with MlaB, we over-expressed the <i>mlaFEDCB</i> operon engineered to encode His-MlaE, and purified the complex on cobalt affinity resin followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The proteins elute as a single peak, indicating the formation of a stable complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). SDS-PAGE analysis of the complex show three bands at ~29 kDa (MlaF), ~20 kDa (MlaD) and ~10 kDa (MlaB) when the sample is heated. The identities of these bands are confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In the non-heated sample, we are also able to detect His-MlaE (~24 kDa) and the oligomeric form of MlaD (~120 kDa) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Consistent with MlaB being a part of the complex, we are able to show that functional His-tagged MlaB can pull down the other components in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">2B</a>). Even though we also expressed MlaC, it was not co-purified with the rest of the complex. This suggests that interactions between MlaC and the IM complex may be weak and/or transient, in line with the idea that it is a periplasmic binding protein (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</a>). We conclude that MlaF, MlaE, MlaD and MlaB form a stable complex."

To determine whether this oligomeric state is dependent on the transmembrane helix or its association with the complex, we over-expressed and purified the substrate-binding domain (or soluble domain) of MlaD (sMlaD-His) alone for characterization. We found that sMlaD-His does not exist in the monomeric state, as judged by its SEC profile (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) analysis revealed that the absolute molar mass of purified sMlaD-His is ~110.7 kDa, establishing that these are in fact hexamers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Furthermore, the experimental molar mass of the MlaFEDB complex (~285 kDa by SEC-MALS) is consistent with the presence of six copies of MlaD (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Remarkably, hexamers formed by sMlaD-His alone are also resistant to SDS denaturation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

In this system, TGD2 is the direct homolog of MlaD and was found to bind PA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Awai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Roston et al., 2011</a>). We therefore hypothesized that MlaD also binds PLs as part of its role in maintaining lipid asymmetry in the OM. As a first step, we examined whether our purified preparations of sMlaD-His contained bound PLs. We extracted potentially bound PLs from purified sMlaD-His and analyzed these samples using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and <sup>31</sup>P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We use delipidated LolB (dLolB-His), the OM receptor for OM-targeted lipoproteins, as a specificity control. LolB is not expected to bind PLs even though it contains a hydrophobic cavity that allows it to chaperone the triacyl modification found on lipoproteins (<a href=\"#bib45\">Takeda et al., 2003</a>). We detected both phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PG bound to sMlaD-His (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>) but not to dLolB-His (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), indicating that MlaD has affinity for PLs. Since sMlaD-His no longer contains the transmembrane helix and has little tendency to associate with membranes, we believe that bound PLs in sMlaD-His are directly reflective of its proposed role in PL transport. Comparable amounts of PE and PG (~1:1) co-purified with sMlaD-His despite PE being the predominant lipid in <i>E. coli</i> cellular extracts (~72% PE, 17% PG, 11% cardiolipin (CL)) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lugtenberg and Peters, 1976</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

In denaturing MS, the monomeric form of sMlaD-His (deconvoluted mass 17,828 Da) is the only molecular species observed (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In native MS, we detected the hexameric form of sMlaD-His with bound ligands at various charge states (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Deconvolution of the native MS spectrum indicates the molecular weight of the native hexamers to be ~110 kDa, suggesting the presence of at least four bound PL molecules (~750 Da each, in agreement with the average mass of PE and PG) and therefore, strong protein-PL interactions. By increasing the collision energy in the mass spectrometer collision cell, we are then able to destabilize the native structure, revealing the presence of hexamers binding three, two, one or zero PL molecules (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This suggests that the presence of ligands is not strictly required for the formation of sMlaD hexamers. Taken together, our data establish that hexameric sMlaD is a PL-binding complex with at least four binding sites."

MlaD binds PLs, consistent with its proposed role as a periplasmic binding protein; however, it is not clear if MlaD has other roles in the activity of the ABC transporter. The function of MlaB is also unknown. To characterize the importance of MlaD and MlaB in the complex, we attempted to over-express and purify sub-complexes containing His-MlaE, including MlaFE, MlaFED and MlaFEB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We were successful in obtaining purified MlaFEB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), but not MlaFE and MlaFED (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Despite reasonable expression of MlaF (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), it is not co-purified with His-MlaE in preparations of MlaFE and MlaFED (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Therefore, MlaF does not interact with MlaE unless MlaB is present. To exclude artifacts due to over-expression, we also performed affinity purification using His-MlaE expressed at low levels in cells lacking MlaB. Unlike in WT cells, MlaF is not co-purified with His-MlaE in the absence of MlaB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Similarly, we show that MlaF-His could not pull down MlaD (through MlaE) without MlaB (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In fact, the affinity-enriched levels of MlaF-His appear to be reduced in the absence of MlaB, suggesting that MlaB modulates the stability of MlaF. Our results demonstrate that MlaB plays a key role in the assembly of the complex."

To test this, we constructed a variant with a mutation in the STAS domain of MlaB at position 52, which in two other STAS domain proteins have been shown to be important for function (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aravind and Koonin, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Diederich et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rouached et al., 2005</a>). This mutation does not affect the assembly of the MlaFEB complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), allowing us to compare the steady-state ATP hydrolysis rates of purified MlaFEB<sub>WT</sub> and MlaFEB<sub>T52A</sub> complexes. We demonstrate that MlaFEB<sub>WT</sub> exhibits high intrinsic ATPase activity in detergent micelles (<i>k<sub>cat\u00a0</sub></i>= 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcmol ATP s<sup>-1</sup>/\u03bcmol complex) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), comparable to known ABC importers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Reich-Slotky et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tal et al., 2013</a>). In addition, ATP binding is cooperative (Hill coefficient = 1.5 \u00b1 0.5). Remarkably, no activity is detected with the MlaFEB<sub>T52A</sub> complex, similar to a variant of the complex containing a predicted non-functional mutation in the MlaF Walker A motif (MlaF<sub>K47R</sub>EB) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Walker et al., 1982</a>).

For a few well-characterized transporters, ATP hydrolytic activity is intrinsically low and can only be activated upon the binding of the corresponding SBPs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 1997</a>), an arrangement believed to reduce the futile hydrolysis of ATP in the absence of substrate (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davidson et al., 2008</a>). In the OmpC-Mla system, a second SBP (MlaD) with unknown function is associated with the IM ABC transporter (MlaFEB), in addition to the periplasmic SBP (MlaC) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</a>). We have shown that MlaD does indeed bind PLs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the proposed substrates for this system, consistent with its role as an SBP. In addition, we have demonstrated that MlaFEB possesses high intrinsic ATPase activity that is attenuated by MlaD association (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interactions with MlaD may stabilize conformations that are inactive in ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, because our MlaFEDB preparations are solubilized in detergent micelles, which can disrupt lipid binding, it may be possible that MlaD does not have PLs bound. While this idea remains to be tested, the complex may be unstimulated without bound substrates, resulting in low ATPase activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Our results suggest a function for MlaD in ensuring that the full complex conserves ATP, and presumably retains the capacity to be activated only when MlaC binds and/or delivers the PL substrate."

                        "text": "How the OmpC-Mla pathway mediates retrograde PL transport from the OM back to the IM (against a concentration gradient) is not clear. One can posit that ATP hydrolysis by the MlaFEDB complex in the IM is directly coupled to the removal of PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM. Such a scenario would likely require physical interactions between the IM and OM complexes, as is the case for the LPS transport (Lpt) machinery (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chng et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freinkman et al., 2012</a>). However, the facts that the MlaC homolog from <i>Ralstonia solenacerum</i> can be purified and crystallized as a soluble complex with PE (Protein Data Bank ID: 2QGU; DOI: 10.2210/pdb2qgu/pdb), and that we could not detect strong interactions between MlaC and the OmpC-MlaA (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chong et al., 2015</a>) or MlaFEDB complexes, indicate that Mla-mediated PL transport across the periplasm may proceed instead via a soluble intermediate. In this alternative scenario, we posit that PL transfer from the OmpC-MlaA complex to MlaC, and then to MlaD in the IM complex, is largely driven by affinity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We have demonstrated that MlaD forms homo-hexamers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), suggesting a maximum of six PL binding sites within the MlaFEDB complex. At least four of these binding sites have reasonably high affinity for PLs, thereby facilitating co-purification with MlaD and detection in native MS analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). MlaD may have higher affinity for PL substrates than MlaC, driving overall PL transfer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In the MlaFEDB complex, the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis may then be utilized to release bound PLs into the membrane, perhaps by inducing conformational changes that alter PL binding affinities within the MlaD oligomer. The fate of these PL substrates, whether being translocated across the IM or simply released into the outer leaflet of the membrane, remains an intriguing question."

In the chloroplasts of <i>A. thaliana,</i> the TGD pathway has a similar function in PL transport from the OM back to the IM (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benning, 2009</a>). Here, the MlaD-like protein, TGD2, has been proposed to exist as an oligomer (<a href=\"#bib38\">Roston et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2012</a>). In <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, there are four Mce systems, of which Mce4 is essential for cholesterol uptake and catabolism (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</a>), while others may have functions in transporting other lipids (<a href=\"#bib19\">Forrellad et al., 2014</a>). These systems are expressed from operons each comprising genes encoding two MlaE-like permeases and six MlaD-like (MCE) proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Casali and Riley, 2007</a>). The organization of these operons suggests the assembly of ABC transporters containing a hetero-hexameric arrangement of MCE domains. This hexameric MCE structure may thus be a general architecture for binding and transporting various lipid substrates."

The observed preference for PG may reflect a higher affinity of MlaD for this lipid simply during purification conditions. Alternatively, it may indicate specificity for PG during PL transport. Since the OmpC-Mla system is proposed to remove PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM so as to maintain lipid asymmetry, this finding suggests that either PG has a higher tendency to appear on the cell surface during normal growth, or removal of outer leaflet PG is more important to ensure OM stability. Consistent with these ideas, the OM enzyme PagP has been evolved to acylate outer leaflet PG (in addition to LPS), but not PE, as a mechanism to fortify the OM barrier (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dalebroux et al., 2014</a>). It has also been reported that the OM has lower PG content than the IM in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lugtenberg and Peters, 1976</a>) and <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<a href=\"#bib34\">Osborn et al., 1972</a>).

We have shown that MlaB is critical for the assembly of the ABC transporter. In the absence of MlaB, the canonical ABC transporter complex (MlaFE) could not be isolated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), owing to the decreased stability of MlaF and/or weakened interactions between MlaE and MlaF. We have also established a separate role for MlaB in the activity of the complex; a single T52A mutation in the STAS domain protein does not affect complex assembly but abolishes ATPase activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Corroborating these conclusions, we note that STAS domains have similarly been reported to be critical for the assembly and activity of non-ABC family transporters, including the Sultr1;2 sulfate transporter in <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shibagaki and Grossman, 2006</a>). In fact, MlaB-like and MlaE-like domains can be found in the same polypeptides in some organisms (Pfam accession number: PF13466) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finn et al., 2016</a>), further highlighting the importance of MlaB in these transporters. MlaB may regulate ATPase activity via novel mechanisms. The T52A mutation removes a conserved threonine residue in MlaB that is mapped to a serine in the STAS domain anti-sigma factor antagonist, SpoIIAA, in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aravind and Koonin, 2000</a>). This residue can be phosphorylated by its target anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB, which disrupts the ability of SpoIIAA to bind SpoIIAB, presumably due to a conformational change (<a href=\"#bib17\">Diederich et al., 1994</a>). By analogy, we hypothesize that MlaB may become phosphorylated in cells. Due to its influence on MlaF structure and stability, any conformational changes associated with this putative phosphorylation event might indirectly regulate MlaF and affect its function in ATP hydrolysis. Intriguingly, SpoIIAA has also been shown to exhibit NTP binding and hydrolytic activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Najafi et al., 1996</a>). This raises an alternative possibility that MlaB may be directly involved in ATP hydrolysis in conjunction with MlaF, perhaps with T52 serving as an alternative nucleophile. While such mechanistic involvement has not been reported, direct participation by an auxiliary protein in catalysis would necessitate a shift in our understanding of how ABC transporters can operate."

Briefly, 5-mL cultures were grown (inoculated with overnight cultures at 1:100 dilution) in LB broth at 37\u00b0C until OD<sub>600</sub> reached ~0.5\u20130.7. Cells were normalized according to OD<sub>600</sub>, first diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.1 (~10<sup>8</sup> cells), and then serially diluted (ten-fold) in LB using 96-well microtiter plates. 2 \u03bcL of the diluted cultures were manually spotted onto the plates, dried, and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C.

It has been proposed that Mla transports excess phospholipids from the OM to the inner membrane (IM) to keep the outer leaflet of the OM free of phospholipids. Here, Thong et al. present the first biochemical characterization of the Mla IM complex. They demonstrate that MlaBDEF form a stable ABC transporter complex and they study the function of accessory proteins MlaBD. They show that the periplasmic domain of MlaD forms a hexamer that binds phospholipids, the proposed substrates of the Mla system. They demonstrate that MlaD decreases the ATPase activity of the MlaBEF complex, possibly to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis in the absence of substrate. They also show that MlaB is necessary for both the association of the ATPase MlaF with its transmembrane partner MlaF and the ATPase activity of the ABC transporter."

We have previously shown that expression of MlaA from this plasmid is in fact lower than what is produced from the endogenous locus (Chong et al., 2015). Having lower levels of His-tagged proteins means that fewer sites on the affinity column would be occupied, thus leading to higher non-specific binding. Because of the low amounts of His-tagged proteins, we also have to use much higher volumes of bacterial cultures for our experiments, which also lead to higher non-specific binding."
