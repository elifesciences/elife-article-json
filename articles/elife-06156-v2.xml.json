Here, we uncovered an unexpected mechanism of RTK trafficking in this process. By quantitative high-resolution FRET microscopy, we found that phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR) is not randomly distributed but packaged at constant mean amounts in endosomes. Cells respond to higher EGF concentrations by increasing the number of endosomes but keeping the mean p-EGFR content per endosome almost constant. By mathematical modelling, we found that this mechanism confers both robustness and regulation to signalling output. Different growth factors caused specific changes in endosome number and size in various cell systems and changing the distribution of p-EGFR between endosomes was sufficient to reprogram cell-fate decision upon EGF stimulation. We propose that the packaging of p-RTKs in endosomes is a general mechanism to ensure the fidelity and specificity of the signalling response."

Here, we uncovered an unexpected mechanism of RTK trafficking in this process. By quantitative high-resolution FRET microscopy, we found that phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR) is not randomly distributed but packaged at constant mean amounts in endosomes. Cells respond to higher EGF concentrations by increasing the number of endosomes but keeping the mean p-EGFR content per endosome almost constant. By mathematical modelling, we found that this mechanism confers both robustness and regulation to signalling output. Different growth factors caused specific changes in endosome number and size in various cell systems and changing the distribution of p-EGFR between endosomes was sufficient to reprogram cell-fate decision upon EGF stimulation. We propose that the packaging of p-RTKs in endosomes is a general mechanism to ensure the fidelity and specificity of the signalling response."

Activated EGF receptors are marked with a phosphate group (or \u2018phosphorylated\u2019) and are then removed from the surface membrane and packaged into structures within the cell called endosomes. Villase\u00f1or et al. found that different endosomes contain the same mean amount of phosphorylated EGF receptor. When exposed to higher EGF concentrations, the cells respond by increasing the number of endosomes, and so the average number of phosphorylated EGF receptors in each endosome remains almost constant. Villase\u00f1or et al. used mathematical modelling to show that this mechanism, which they refer to as an \u2018analogue-to-digital conversion\u2019, ensures a robust signal, and can regulate the signalling of the activated receptors in both space and time."

Moreover, Villase\u00f1or et al. found that changing how the phosphorylated EGF receptor is distributed between endosomes alters how the cells interpret the signal and differentiate when they are exposed to EGF. These findings mean that the signalling activity of a cell could be predicted from the number and size of its endosomes. Moreover, the findings also suggest that interfering with this mechanism could change cell behaviour, for example, it could stop cancer cells proliferating and force them to differentiate instead."

A remarkable property of this system is that different RTKs can elicit distinct cellular responses through the same signal transduction machinery (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marshall, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kholodenko et al., 2006</a>). In several cases, signalling specificity results from differences in amplitude and duration of the intracellular signalling cascades (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marshall, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Maroun et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nagashima et al., 2007</a>). For example, in PC12 cells, EGF stimulation of EGFR leads to transient Erk phosphorylation and cell proliferation, whereas NGF binding to TrkA leads to sustained Erk phosphorylation and cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marshall, 1995</a>). Differences in signalling amplitude and duration can arise from positive or negative feedback loops within the same signalling pathway (<a href=\"#bib56\">Santos et al., 2007</a>) or activation of additional signalling components (<a href=\"#bib79\">York et al., 1998</a>). To explain such differences, it has been proposed that both EGF and NGF stimulation induce a specific \u2018molecular context\u2019 that determines the topology of the signal transduction network (<a href=\"#bib56\">Santos et al., 2007</a>). How such a topology is determined for different RTKs and whether it is the sole determinant of signal specificity is unclear (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kholodenko, 2007</a>)."

The detection of phosphorylated receptors and signalling adaptors in endosomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Di Guglielmo et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vieira et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sorkin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Teis et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lampugnani et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Galperin and Sorkin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schenck et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Coumailleau et al., 2009</a>) led to the concept that signalling is initiated at the plasma membrane but continues in endosomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Di Guglielmo et al., 1994</a>). Indeed, inhibition of endocytosis by blocking Dynamin function causes significant alterations in signalling specificity (<a href=\"#bib75\">Vieira et al., 1996</a>). However, recent studies challenged this concept arguing that EGFR signalling occurs primarily at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib12\">Damke et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brankatschk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sousa et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, a recent systems survey of endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collinet et al., 2010</a>) revealed an unexpected tight control in the number, size, and cargo content for EGF-positive endosomes, raising the question of why is EGF packaging in endosomes so accurately controlled? Here, we hypothesized that the tight control of the endosomal distribution of EGF could serve to regulate signal transmission. We tested this hypothesis by quantitatively analysing the endosomal distribution of EGFR as an RTK model system in endosomes and evaluating its impact on cell-fate decisions."

First, we modified a FRET-FLIM microscopy assay previously used to measure the spatial distribution of p-EGFR at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wouters and Bastiaens, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Verveer et al., 2000</a>). The assay measured the FRET signal between EGFR-GFP and an anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (p-Tyr-ab) labelled with AlexaFluor 555. Since FLIM microscopy lacks the spatial resolution to analyse the receptor activation at a sub-cellular level, we modified the assay into a high-resolution FRET microscopy assay. However, instead of the total cell signal, we measured the distribution of EGFR and p-EGFR at the level of individual endosomes resolved by high-resolution confocal microscopy and quantitative automated image analysis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rink et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Collinet et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To avoid artefacts of overexpression, we used HeLa cells transfected with a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene stably expressing EGFR-GFP under its endogenous promoter (<a href=\"#bib51\">Poser et al., 2008</a>). In these cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), the uptake of EGF was only \u223ctwofold higher compared to endogenous (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). However, the transport kinetics were similar (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Second, we measured p-EGFR with an antibody against a specific phospho-tyrosine residue (Tyr1068). Both assays gave very similar results (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). As the FRET assay is not restricted to a single phosphorylation site that can change over time (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morandell et al., 2008</a>), we used it as a primary assay in further experiments. Under the fixation conditions used, we observed no significant difference in the morphology (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>) or area (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>) of EGFR-positive endosomes (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). For every time point, \u223c15,000 endosomes from over 200 cells were analysed."

On the other hand, the total p-EGFR levels reached a maximum already at 10 min, followed by a phase of decay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, red curve). Comparison of decay kinetics for both curves after 15 min showed that de-phosphorylation of p-EGFR occurred faster than degradation (\u03c4<sub>decay EGFR</sub> = 88.13 \u00b1 14.49, \u03c4<sub>decay p-EGFR</sub> = 30.97 \u00b1 1.69, for details see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

After a rapid increase, the mean content of p-EGFR in each endosome stabilized to a fairly constant level after \u223c20 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, red curve).

In contrast, the p-EGFR distribution first widened like that of total EGFR but then became almost twofold narrower than that of EGFR (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7A\u2013E</a> compare the red and green curves) and stabilized after 30 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

We stimulated cells with different concentrations of EGF for 30 min, when the amount of p-EGFR per endosome reached its steady state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). Once again, we found that EGFR and p-EGFR behaved very differently. The number of endosomes containing EGFR saturated already at low concentrations of EGF (0.5\u20131.0 ng EGF; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, green curve) whereas the amount of total EGFR per endosome increased almost linearly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, green curve). This is expected because the higher the concentration of EGF, the higher the internalization of EGFR, whereas the number of receiving endosomes does not change significantly. In contrast, the number of endosomes with p-EGFR augmented with increasing EGF concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, see red curve in semi-logarithmic scale, inset in linear scale). Strikingly, the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome remained fairly constant, despite the EGF concentration varying almost over three orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, red curve). Therefore, increasing concentrations of EGF resulted in an increase in the number of endosomes with the same mean package of p-EGFR. Importantly, such a packaging is saturable because at high EGF concentrations the mean p-EGFR content per endosome was no longer constant with time (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>)."

We performed several control experiments to verify that this is not an artefact caused by the FRET method or the assay. First, the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome did increase at EGF concentrations higher than 10 ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>), indicating that the value measured is not artificially fixed, for example, by limited antigen accessibility. Second, a similar constant mean value of p-EGFR per endosomes was estimated with an independent method using the Tyr1068 antibody (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Third, the narrow distribution of p-EGFR per endosome may simply reflect the sorting into endosomes of regular size. Whereas at 10 min the p-EGFR amount per endosome increased with the endosome area (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9A</a>, black curve), at 30 min (steady state, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the same mean amount was present in small and large endosomes alike (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9A</a>, red curve). Therefore, the amount of activated receptors per endosome is independent of endosome area. Finally, we verified that it is not a phenomenon peculiar to HeLa cells but also occurring in non-immortalized, non-cancer cell lines. Using the anti-phosphoTyr1068 antibody, we found that in primary mouse hepatocytes upon EGF stimulation the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome saturated at \u223c20 min whereas the mean amount of EGF continued to grow (data not shown), indicating that the packaging of p-EGFR in endosomes is not peculiar to a signalling-aberrant cancerous cell line."

Very little p-EGFR colocalized with LAMP-1, a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). One possibility is that the packages of p-EGFR may reflect incorporation into intra-luminal vesicles (ILV) of multi-vesicular bodies (MVB). This possibility was ruled out using a previously described differential detergent solubilisation method (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maler\u00f8d et al., 2007</a>). We could determine that a large fraction of EGFR was not accessible to antibodies upon digitonin permeabilization, reflecting sequestration into ILVs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maler\u00f8d et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Piper and Katzmann, 2007</a>) (see Suppl. information and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

After 10 min of EGF stimulation, the pool of p-EGFR in EEA1-positive endosomes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, red curve) decayed faster than total EGFR (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, green curve; \u03c4<sub>decay EGFR</sub> = 56.03 \u00b1 5.72, \u03c4<sub>decay p-EGFR</sub> = 37.08 \u00b1 4.19), possibly due to de-phosphorylation or preferential removal of p-EGFR from early endosomes. The latter can be excluded since the fraction of p-EGFR in EEA1-positive endosomes remained almost constant throughout the time course (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). EGFR ubiquitylation is required for its internalization into endosomes, and this is dependent on EGFR phosphorylation and the recruitment of the c-Cbl E3 ligase (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sigismund et al., 2013</a>). To compare the levels of ubiquitylated EGFR (ub-EGFR) with those of p-EGFR within the endosomal system, we modified the FRET assay using an anti-ubiquitin antibody (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The kinetics of ub-EGFR were significantly different from those of p-EGFR. Whereas the levels of p-EGFR peaked at 15 min, ub-EGFR reached its maximum at 30 min after stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, compare red with blue curves) and decreased more slowly than p-EGFR at later times, probably reflecting deubiquitylation prior to receptor sequestration into ILVs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Piper and Katzmann, 2007</a>). These results are consistent with the fact that the appearance of p-EGFR precedes that of ub-EGFR (<a href=\"#bib71\">Umebayashi et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, ub-EGFR had a similar distribution to that of EGFR (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) but significantly wider than p-EGFR (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for stabilizing the mean levels of p-EGFR per endosome are not correlated with receptor ubiquitylation."

Such a constant mean amount may be due to the formation of small clusters within early endosomes. To test this possibility, we imaged the spatial distribution of p-EGFR in endosomes using the anti-EGFR phosphoTyr1068 antibody by super-resolution microscopy. Using direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lampe et al., 2012</a>), we could indeed visualize clusters of p-EGFR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, left panel) that decreased in size between 10 and 30 min of EGF internalization, in agreement with the narrowing of p-EGFR distribution over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To determine the number of molecules in the clusters, we used two methods. First, we developed a new method to estimate the number of fluorescent molecules in light microscopy images by measuring the intensity fluctuations during photo-bleaching over time (for details see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Based on the fluorescence signal from the anti-phosphoTyr1068 antibody and EGFR-GFP, we estimated an average of 102 \u00b1 38 and 76 \u00b1 29 (Mean \u00b1 SEM) molecules of EGFR and p-EGFR per endosome 30 min after EGF (10 ng/ml) internalization (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), corresponding to 707 \u00b1 265 and 527 \u00b1 202 molecules per \u03bcm<sup>3</sup> of endosomal volume (apparent, assessed by light microscopy), respectively. A hundred EGFR molecules would require \u223c12 clathrin-coated vesicles for delivery to endosomes (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We also estimated the total number of GFP-EGFR per cell and found values (29,000) well in agreement with previous estimates for HeLa cells (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Second, based on the size of receptor from the PDB database (structure ID: 3NJP), we calculated that 83 \u00b1 25 (Mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 1456) receptors could fit in the apparent area of p-EGFR visualized by dSTORM, a value which is remarkably in agreement with the fluorescence intensities estimates."

We found that only Hrs depletion resulted in a continuous accumulation of p-EGFR in endosomes with time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). At the same time, the p-EGFR intensity distribution widened similar to that of total EGFR (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). The silencing of Hrs also caused an increase in the size of p-EGFR clusters within each endosome as revealed by dSTORM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, right panel). Interestingly, this is not due to the inhibition of ILV formation, as down-regulation of Snf8 and Vps24, members of the ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes, respectively (<a href=\"#bib50\">Piper and Katzmann, 2007</a>), reduced the sequestration of EGFR into the endosomal lumen (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>) but did not have significant effects on the amount of p-EGFR per endosome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, blue and green curves). Thus, the constant mean amount of p-EGFR in endosomes likely corresponds to the receptor clusters observed by super-resolution microscopy. This raises the question of whether p-EGFR can be accessible to downstream signalling components. Therefore, we measured the recruitment of a direct downstream effector of p-EGFR, Shc1. The kinetics of Shc1 recruitment to endosomes precisely mimic the kinetics of p-EGFR (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>) arguing that the p-EGFR clusters are signalling competent."

A mechanism must exist that prevents the continuous accretion of p-EGFR upon endosome fusion. A simple mechanism could be that the de-phosphorylation rate increases with the increase in p-EGFR per endosome. When two endosomes fuse, the resulting endosome should contain the sum of EGFR and p-EGFR of the original endosomes. However, given such de-phosphorylation rate dependency, the amount of p-EGFR would return to the level prior to fusion, thus stabilizing the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the kinase activity of EGFR in endosomes controls its own dephosphorylation. To test this, we inhibited the EGFR kinase activity pharmacologically with AG1478, lapatinib or gefitinib 10 min after EGF stimulation (to prevent alterations on receptor internalization) and determined the effects on the receptors already internalized and phosphorylated. We compared low with high concentrations of EGF, that is, under conditions of saturation of p-EGFR packaging in endosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). At low EGF concentrations, when the packaging mechanism is not saturated, the total amount of p-EGFR was not significantly reduced by the inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a> compare black and green curves). This behaviour argues that the packages of p-EGFR in endosomes are protected from the phosphatases. In addition, the inhibitors caused a continuous accumulation of p-EGFR in fewer and larger endosomes over time (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). In contrast, adding the inhibitor after stimulation with high concentrations of EGF caused a sharp reduction in the total amount of p-EGFR (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a> compare red and blue curves), as observed previously (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kleiman et al., 2011</a>). This means that the kinase activity of EGFR is necessary to maintain the levels of p-EGFR in individual endosomes. These results support the idea that the dephosphorylation of p-EGFR in endosomes indeed depends on the EGFR activity within the endosomal packages."

Hits were defined if silencing satisfied three conditions: (1) it increased the total amount of p-EGFR in endosomes and (2) increased the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome, and (3) the phenotype was observed with at least two siRNAs per gene. Five phosphatases, PTP4A1, PTPN11, PTPN9, PTPN18, and PTPRK, increased the amount of p-EGFR in individual endosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8</a>).

                        "text": "What are the consequences of such mechanism for signal transduction? To address these questions and generate testable predictions, we developed a mathematical model that describes the amount of total intracellular p-EGFR over time. Previously, excellent models have been developed that quantitatively describe EGFR endocytosis and signalling (<a href=\"#bib18\">Felder et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">French et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kholodenko et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kholodenko, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Resat et al., 2003</a>). However, although all these models described in detail the dynamics of ligand binding, dimer formation and endocytosis, recycling and degradation of the receptor, they did not consider the trafficking dynamics of the phosphorylated receptors with respect to the dynamics of the endosomal network because these data were not available. Our new experimental data brought two new concepts. First, dephosphorylation and degradation of p-EGFR occur sequentially but are uncoupled. Second, the amount of p-EGFR is controlled at the level of individual endosomes. These new concepts require further development of the existing EGFR mathematical models. Our model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) describing (1) the total amount of EGFR and p-EGFR at the plasma membrane as a function of ligand binding, (2) endocytosis of p-EGFR and its indirect effects on EGFR endocytosis, and (3) distribution of cargo between early endosomes at different stages of maturation (e.g., formation of MVB). For this, we considered the processes of receptor internalization, dephosphorylation, degradation, recycling, endosome fusion and fission. As in previous models (<a href=\"#bib20\">French et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Resat et al., 2003</a>), we described time course kinetics of total cellular p-EGFR, surface and endosomal EGFR and p-EGFR. Importantly, our model also describes the total number of p-EGFR-positive endosomes and mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). To account for the observed stabilization of the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the dependency of p-EGFR dephosphorylation on EGFR kinase activity (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6,7</a>) and the fact that the mechanism is saturable (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>), we included a sigmoidal dependency of the p-EGFR dephosphorylation rate on the amount of p-EGFR per endosome. The model was then fitted to the experimental data from the p-EGFR time course (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows that this simple theoretical model can reproduce our observations of a constant mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome in a wide range of EGF concentrations when fitted to the experimental data. Importantly, a model without this non-linear dephosphorylation dependency could correctly describe the total amount of EGFR and p-EGFR in endosomes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) but did not agree with the measurements for the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), thus supporting the sigmoidal dependency of the p-EGFR de-phosphorylation rate on the amount of p-EGFR per endosome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Previous models did not include this non-linear term because data on the distribution of p-EGFR in individual endosomes was not available."

If so, could this have an effect on signal transduction? To test these hypotheses, we reduced early endosome homotypic fusion by lowering the intracellular concentration of established components of the endosome tethering and fusion machinery, EEA1, Rabenosyn5, Vps45 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christoforidis et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ohya et al., 2010</a>), Syntaxin-6 and Syntaxin-13 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brandhorst et al., 2006</a>) that play no direct role in signalling. These genes were down-regulated by RNAi in combinations and only partially (\u223c50\u201370% depletion for each protein, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) to achieve a significant inhibition of endosome fusion and yet prevent or reduce cell toxicity. This procedure caused a mild redistribution of EGFR to endosomes of smaller size (&lt;0.5 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> cross-section area, for details see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Similar results were obtained upon depletion of a second combination of genes (EEA1, Stx13, Stx6, not shown, see below). Note that these treatments generated a pattern of endosomes similar to that observed in different cell types and under different culture conditions (see below, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and neither altered the surface levels of EGFR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) nor its kinetics of uptake (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and exit from endosomes, that is, recycling and degradation (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We also excluded potential effects on endosome acidification, because blocking it with bafilomycin did increase both p-EGFR and total EGFR (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Remarkably, under our experimental conditions of mild down-regulation of the early endosomal fusion machinery the packaging of active receptors was unaffected as shown by both the time course and the steady-state mean (constant) amount of p-EGFR per endosome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; see above, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast, the total number of endosomes with p-EGFR and their life-time augmented (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), resulting in a net increase in the total amount and life-time of p-EGFR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Notably, reduction of the endosome fusion rate in the mathematical model (\u223c40%, in line with the depletion of tethering proteins, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) is sufficient to reproduce fairly well the experimental increase in p-EGFR endosomes observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results support the hypothesis that EGFR activation can be modulated by the endosomal system. Since p-EGFR de-phosphorylation precedes EGFR degradation (see above, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and EGFR degradation is unaffected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we deduce that the effect on the life-time of p-EGFR caused by reduced endosomal fusion is primarily due to reduced de-phosphorylation."

We asked whether the redistribution of endosomal EGFR could be sufficient to induce sustained Erk activation and c-Fos phosphorylation. Indeed, upon EGF stimulation, both the amplitude and duration of Erk1/2 phosphorylation were increased in the depleted cells compared to control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Consistently, c-Fos phosphorylation was also higher after 30 min of EGF stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>).

                        "text": "The experiments on HeLa cells and the theoretical analysis raise the question of whether modulation of early endosome homotypic fusion is a general mechanism to regulate signal amplitude and duration. If this were the case, we would predict that growth factors with different signalling outputs (amplitude and duration) differentially modulate the endosomal distribution (i.e., endosome number, size, and cargo content). To test this prediction, we examined different growth factors and cellular systems. First, we used primary mouse hepatoblasts where HGF promotes their proliferation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tanimizu et al., 2003</a>). In these cells, HGF but not EGF elicits a sustained Erk response (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed as predicted, stimulation of hepatoblasts with HGF caused a strong shift in the distribution of early endosomes toward smaller sizes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, red curve <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), whereas EGF had the opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, green curve, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Second, we turned to an in vitro model of reference for cell-fate decisions, PC12 cells. In PC12 cells, EGF stimulation leads to transient Erk phosphorylation and cell proliferation, whereas NGF leads to sustained Erk phosphorylation and cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marshall, 1995</a>). Consistent with our results in primary mouse hepatoblasts, NGF stimulation in PC12 cells caused a significant shift in the distribution of early endosomes toward smaller sizes compared with EGF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Moreover, NGF itself was distributed to a larger number of smaller endosomes in comparison with EGF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Altogether, these data argue that the modulation of endosome fusion, reflected by the changes in endosome number and size, is a general property of growth factors. These data further suggest that signalling amplitude and duration can be regulated by changes in the fusion rate of endosomes (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

If so, we would predict that redistributing EGF to a larger number of small endosomes as seen in PC12 stimulated with NGF would be sufficient to switch signalling specificity and induce differentiation of PC12 cells. Therefore, we applied the same protocol of partial protein depletion previously used for HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) in PC12 cells and consistently observed a mild redistribution of EGF into smaller endosomes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,C,D</a>). Also in this case, the partial depletion did not result in major changes in EGF transport kinetics in PC12 cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), but increased the phosphorylation of both Erk (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) and c-Fos (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>) upon stimulation with EGF. Next, we stimulated PC12 cells with EGF or NGF for 24 hr and analysed for neurite formation and \u03b2-III tubulin expression as markers of differentiation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ohuchi et al., 2002</a>) and for EdU incorporation as a measure of proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Stimulation with NGF increased the number of cells with neurites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, quantification in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) and positive for \u03b2-III tubulin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, quantification in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), and reduced cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, quantification in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), the opposite of the stimulation with EGF. Remarkably, upon redistribution of endosomes, EGF increased process formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, quantification in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), \u03b2-III tubulin expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, quantification in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), and reduced cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, quantification in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). The type of response was therefore similar to that of NGF, although the efficacy was lower. Nevertheless, these results show that a mild reduction of homotypic early endosome fusion was sufficient to modify cell fate and induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells."

Parameters such as number of endosomes and size are tightly controlled in the case of EGF endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collinet et al., 2010</a>). Our results provide a rationale for such modulation and a novel framework for interpreting and predicting the signalling response of phosphorylated RTKs. In homogeneous assays (e.g., by Western blot), the total levels of active RTKs can be observed to rapidly decay with time in most signalling systems (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dunn and Hubbard, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burke et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sousa et al., 2012</a>). These methods, however, measure the average steady state of an entire cell population and lack the spatial information. Here, we employed quantitative high- and super-resolution microscopy to resolve details of this process with sub-cellular resolution and high sensitivity. We discovered that the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome was fairly constant over time and p-EGFR was found in small clusters in early endosomes."

Modulation of the endosomal fusion/fission machinery manifests itself as a change in the size of endosomes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sigismund et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Shifting the balance toward smaller endosomes through inhibition of fusion increased the number and reduced the size of endosomes, consequently expanding the number and life-time of p-EGFR clusters. Although the inhibition of endosome fusion was very mild, we cannot exclude the possibility that it may alter the recruitment and/or activity of signalling components by yet unknown mechanisms. On the other hand, for the interpretation of phenotypes upon perturbations on signalling, it is also important to consider the impact they have on the endosomal network (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collinet et al., 2010</a>)."

The concept of phosphorylated RTK <i>quanta</i> is reminiscent of analogue-to-digital communication systems, where a continuous variable (e.g., extracellular growth factor concentration) is transformed into a sequence of binary levels (e.g., phosphorylated RTK <i>quanta</i> in endosomes). An analogue-to-digital switch was described for Ras nanoclusters at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tian et al., 2007</a>). In the case of endosomal digital signalling, our mathematical model predicts that it could serve two functions. First, it provides a mechanism to regulate signal amplitude and duration following RTK internalization. As a consequence, the total de-phosphorylation rate becomes dependent on the fusion/fission rate of the endosomes. This is interesting in view of the specific modulation of the endosome fusion/fission rates by growth factors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, see below). Second, it acts as a noise dampening system (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ladbury and Arold, 2012</a>), suppressing the noise due to, for example, fluctuations of EGF in the extracellular medium, expression levels of EGFR on the cell surface, etc. An increase in the amount of p-EGFR would result in faster de-phosphorylation rates. In contrast, low concentrations of EGF or EGFR would result in low de-phosphorylation rates. The middle point between the two extremes is the hallmark of signalling resilience. In addition, such a digital system may facilitate the integration of signalling information from different RTKs into a single, correct cell-fate decision. Our results highlight the importance of measuring the spatio-temporal distribution of signalling molecules using quantitative image analysis approaches to gain a deeper understanding of signal transduction regulation."

We found that both Hrs and a few phosphatases, notably PTPN11 (SHP2), specifically regulate the amount of receptors within the p-EGFR clusters and their size. Hrs is known to interact with EGFR and regulate its degradation together with other components of the ESCRT machinery (<a href=\"#bib71\">Umebayashi et al., 2008</a>). However, the effect of Hrs on the size of the p-EGFR clusters appears to be independent of the formation of ILVs, as suggested by the fact that Snf8 and Vps24 down-regulation does not produce the same effect."

We can envisage various non-exclusive mechanisms that can account for this correlation. One possible mechanism is a scaffold with a characteristic size that binds to p-EGFR and protects it from phosphatases. This hypothesis correlates higher total EGFR kinase activity to higher p-EGFR dephosphorylation, but only indirectly. Increasing the concentration of EGF in the medium would lead to a higher rate of delivery of p-EGFR to endosomes through vesicles which have no scaffold. If scaffold formation were rate limiting, the increased flux of p-EGFR into endosomes would reduce the fraction of protected p-EGFR thus exposing it to dephosphorylation. A caveat of this model is that, as the fusion of endosomes proceeds over time, multiple <i>quanta</i> would be expected to be brought together, increasing the mean amount of p-EGFR per endosome. This expectation is in contradiction with our experimental data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). With this model, additional factors must thus be taken into account to explain why multiple <i>quanta</i> cannot co-exist on the same endosomes."

Since the activity of Hrs is negatively regulated by p-EGFR (<a href=\"#bib55\">Row et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bache et al., 2002</a>), this model is compatible with the data showing loss of <i>quanta</i> and increase in endosomal p-EGFR levels upon Hrs knock-down (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). However, this hypothesis alone can neither explain the formation of <i>quanta</i> nor the finding that blocking p-EGFR kinase activity does not change the total levels of p-EGFR over time (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014Figure supplement 6</a>)."

This mechanism is perhaps less intuitive but widely spread in biological processes, such as symmetry breaking and pattern formation in morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kondo and Miura, 2010</a>). It is based on the observation that p-EGFR recruits and phosphorylates PTPN11 (SHP2) in a phosphor-tyrosine dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deribe et al., 2009</a>), thus enhancing its phosphatase activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agazie and Hayman, 2003</a>). Briefly, p-EGFR would recruit and activate the phosphatase SHP2, forming a negative feedback loop. The phosphatase would diffuse on the surface of endosomes, dephosphorylating p-EGFR molecules before being itself inactivated in the absence of further interactions with p-EGFR. Such reaction-diffusion mechanism within a specific parameter range is known to form spatially restricted clusters of active molecular species (Turing Instability) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Turing, 1952</a>), in this particular case <i>quanta</i> of p-EGFR on endosomes. A transient increase in p-EGFR after an endosome fusion event would increase the recruitment and/or activity of SHP2, re-establishing the p-EGFR <i>quanta</i> through dephosphorylation. If the characteristic length of Turing Instability is larger than endosome size, then multiple <i>quanta</i> cannot co-exist within a single endosome. The Turing Instability hypothesis explains the observed increase in p-EGFR <i>quanta</i> size after EGFR kinase inhibition, keeping the total p-EGFR levels unchanged (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6,7</a>), as well as the increase in total endosomal p-EGFR upon inhibition of endosome fusion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>).

Hrs and SHP2 are also recruited by other RTKs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agazie and Hayman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Row et al., 2005</a>). The relative affinity of SHP2 to different receptors could lead to larger or smaller quanta, thus tuning the specificity of the signalling response. RTK quanta with different sizes could also result from differential phosphorylation of Hrs by RTKs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Row et al., 2005</a>), given that the relative amount of Hrs on endosomes depends on its phosphorylation state (<a href=\"#bib72\">Urb\u00e9 et al., 2000</a>)."

For example, activation of p38 MAP kinase causes phosphorylation of the Rab5 effectors EEA1 and Rabenosyn-5, enhancing their recruitment to endosomes and consequently stimulating early endosome fusion (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mac\u00e9 et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cavalli et al., 2001</a>). RTK stimulation also modulates the nucleotide cycle of Rab5 via activation of the Rab5 GEF RIN1 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tall et al., 2001</a>) or inactivation of the Rab5 GAP RN-tre (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lanzetti et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, we predict that in general RTK ligands that stimulate the endosomal fusion machinery (such as EGF) will have a short phosphorylation half-life, whereas ligands that change the fusion/fission balance in favour of smaller endosomes (such as NGF) will have a long phosphorylation half-life. The combined effects of <i>quanta</i> size regulation through Hrs and SHP2 and modulation of fusion/fission will give a specific signalling amplitude and duration in different cell types stimulated with different ligands. We propose that the shape of distribution of the endosomal network can serve as a predictive parameter of the signalling status of the cell."

This apparent contradiction can be explained by the fact that, under normal conditions of endocytosis, only the small fraction of p-RTK in endosomes are protected from inactivation and degradation, and can thus contribute to signal propagation. A feature of the p-EGFR clusters is that, with the increase in the local concentration, the stability of the active EGFR dimer (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chung et al., 2010</a>) and signalling properties (<a href=\"#bib74\">Verveer et al., 2000</a>) would also be increased. By blocking endocytosis, the levels of active receptors are artificially increased at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sousa et al., 2012</a>), bypassing the normal requirement for endosomal regulation."

Colocalization was scored by cross-sectional overlap &gt;30%. The FRET signal was corrected for spectral bleed-through (SBT). Two major processes contribute to the SBT: (1) the GFP fluorescence bleed-through in the FRET channel and (2) direct excitation of AlexaFluor 555 by the 458 nm laser. We performed control experiments to estimate SBT for subsequent correction. To estimate GFP fluorescence bleed-through, we imaged EGFR-GFP BAC HeLa cells in the FRET channel (excitation 458 nm) without p-Tyr-ab staining. The signal in the FRET channel was below our detection limit and, therefore, we omitted correction in the subsequent analysis. The SBT by direct excitation of AlexaFluor 555 was estimated by quantification of FRET vesicles that colocalized with p-Tyr-ab or ub-ab, but not with EGFR (bleed-through control).

Unfortunately, this correction method provided a good estimation of the average FRET signal, but when applied to individual endosomes it gave negative intensities for a substantial (30\u201340%) number of cases, thus precluding the estimation of mean intensity per endosome. In order to identify the source of negative intensities, we calculated the distribution of ratios of intensities in the FRET channel to the intensities in the p-Tyr-ab channel per endosome (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This distribution is broad and one can conclude that correction by <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> will inevitably produce negative values in some cases. We fitted the distribution by the sum of three Gaussian components (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, red, green, and blue dashed lines). By using control cells that did not express EGFR-GFP, we tested that the first two components correspond to SBT (direct excitation of AlexaFluor 555 by the 458 nm laser).

One field of view was sequentially acquired to record bleaching of GFP and fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies. The resulting time series was segmented with MotionTracking as described above, individual objects were tracked for consecutive frames, and the fluorescence intensity of every endosome between two consecutive frames was subtracted to build the \u0394Intensity distribution (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>). The width of distribution is mostly determined by the fluctuations of intensities. However, due to bleaching, the distribution is slightly skewed toward negative values. First, the \u0394Intensity was binned. Then the difference between frequencies of negative and positive \u0394Intensity of equal absolute values was plotted as function of \u0394Intensity (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B,D</a>). We named it neg-double-difference function. Since every bin of neg-double-difference function in the vicinity of the first peaks contained \u223c2500 events, random fluctuations were strongly suppressed and the averaging revealed the discrete structure of bleaching, that is, bleaching of individual molecules. The local amplitude positive maxima correspond to discrete intensity changes when 1, 2, 3, \u2026, n molecules are bleached (see e.g., arrows on peaks at 280, 560, and 800 integral intensity units in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). We estimated that one molecule of GFP and alexa555-antibody corresponds to the integral intensity units at the first peak of the neg-double-difference function (280 and 190 integral intensity units for EGFR-GFP and alexa555, respectively). This method estimated directly the number of EGFR-GFP molecules. The total number of EGFR molecules per endosome was corrected for the ratio of endogenous and BAC EGFR-GFP expressions (1.29 \u00b1 0.07, based on WB quantification). Since the method estimated the number of fluorophores, in the case of antibodies with unknown labelling stoichiometry and epitope accessibility, the result has to be corrected for a scaling factor. The scaling factor of antibody labelling was estimated as 1.9 by comparison of EGFR and p-EGFR distributions at 3 and 5 min of EGF stimulation (10 ng/ml), when most internalized EGFR are still phosphorylated (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sorkin and Goh, 2009</a>), with distributions at 30 min."

From geometrical calculations, assuming that an uncoated CCV has a diameter of 90 nm and an EGFR dimer has a diameter of \u223c15 nm and luminal domain of \u223c10 nm, we estimate that a CCV can contain up to 70 EGFR molecules. However, this calculation does not take into account that vesicles contain multiple types of transmembrane proteins and thus, the value can only be an upper limit. Therefore, we estimated the number of EGFR molecules per diffraction-limited, EEA1-negative vesicle that can be observed following 5 min of 10 ng/ml EGF stimulation. Using this method, we estimated 8.5 \u00b1 3.5 molecules/vesicle. Based on this value, we calculated that \u223c12 vesicles are required to deliver the 102 EGFR molecules/EEA1-positive endosome."

Upon digitonin permeabilization, the staining of LBPA, a marker of ILVs and EGF or EGFR was strongly reduced in comparison with saponin permeabilization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), consistent with their localization predominantly within the endosomal lumen. After 30 min of EGF stimulation, the endosomal, but not the plasma membrane EGFR staining was strongly reduced in cells permeabilized with digitonin compared with saponin, probably reflecting the internalization of receptors into ILVs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). In contrast, the p-EGFR levels were only moderately reduced upon permeabilization with digitonin compared with saponin extraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), suggesting that the majority of p-EGFR faced the cytosolic surface of endosomes and was not within ILVs.

                                "text": "To describe the time course of the formation of a mean constant amount of p-EGFR per endosome during endocytosis, we postulated a sigmoidal dependency of the dephosphorylation rate on the amount of p-EGFR per endosome. The rationale for this is that if the amount of p-EGFR per endosome is above a critical value, dephosphorylation is significantly increased, whereas if the amount is lower, dephosphorylation is decreased. The delay between EGF stimulation and onset of internalization of p-EGFR into early endosomes is well documented (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burke et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wiley, 2003</a>). This delay includes EGF binding to receptor (\u223c3 min), CCV formation (\u223c1\u20132 min) and delivery of p-EGFR to early endosomes. In order to keep the model as simple as possible, we described these mechanisms in a coarse grained model by an exponential delay with constant <i>\u03b4\u03c4</i>. Since the dephosphorylation rate depends on the amount of p-EGFR per endosome, we expanded the mass flux equation usually applied in these cases with an equation that describes the number of endosomes carrying p-EGFR. Our experimental data suggest a significant redistribution of EGFR from the plasma membrane into endosomes even at very low doses of EGF (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, green curve. Compare 0.5 with 10 ng/ml). A simple mechanism to explain this is the internalization of ligand-unoccupied EGFR upon EGF stimulation, for example by formation of EGFR oligomers at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ariotti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hofman et al., 2010</a>). Another possible mechanism includes transient activation of p38 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Faust et al., 2012</a>) by EGFR signalling that leads to acceleration of unoccupied receptor internalization (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zwang and Yarden, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Faust et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we modelled the rate of EGFR-positive vesicle formation as <math id=\"inf9\"><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>v</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>v</mi><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mrow><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi></msubsup></mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>Q</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>q</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi></msubsup></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>, where <i>S</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> is p-EGFR on plasma membrane, <i>q</i> is Hill coefficient, <math id=\"inf10\"><mrow><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></math> is a characteristic constant. We considered that the ratio of EGF loaded/unloaded EGFR in the vesicles is equal to the weighted ratio p-EGFR/EGFR on plasma membrane with weight factor <i>w</i>. Importantly, the use of this term in the model gave the best description of the time course of total EGFR, but was not essential to explain the p-EGFR dynamics in individual endosomes (data not shown)."

For quantification, phospho-Erk1/2 intensity values were first normalized by the total Erk1/2 signal to control for differences in lane loading. For every blot, these values were normalized by the mean intensity amplitude per blot and then scaled by the mean difference between knock-down and mock-treated samples per experiment to account for experimental variability. To measure c-Fos activation, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 30 min, fixed with PFA, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton in PBS and 5% BSA as a blocking reagent. Cells were stained with a rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-c-Fos (Ser32) antibody (Cell Signaling, New England BioLabs) and processed for image analysis.

Pregnancies were dated by the presence of a vaginal plug (embryonic day (E) 0.5). Hepatoblasts were prepared from E14.5 liver as described previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kamiya et al., 1999</a>). Delta-like 1 (Dlk1) + hepatoblasts were isolated from the E14.5 hepatic cells as described previously with minor modifications (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tanimizu et al., 2003</a>). Briefly, cells were blocked with an anti-mouse CD16/32 (BD Biosciences) and stained with a FITC-conjugated anti-Dlk1 antibody (MBL International, Massachusetts, USA) followed by anti-FITC Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany). The labelled cells were separated using a MACS Cell Separation Column (Miltenyi Biotec). Dlk1+ cells were resuspended in DMEM (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Austria) containing 5% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA Laboratories GmbH), 100 \u03bcM MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (PAA Laboratories GmbH), 0.1 \u03bcM dexamethasone (Sigma\u2013Aldrich), 100 Units/ml penicillin (PAA Laboratories GmbH), 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (PAA Laboratories GmbH), and 4% BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences), and seeded on a \u03bc-slide 8-well (Ibidi GmbH, Germany) coated with fibronectin (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Germany). To measure Erk1/2 activation, cells were starved for 24 hr before stimulation with either 10 ng/ml EGF or HGF (R&amp;D; systems, Minnesota, USA). Total cell lysates were prepared and analysed using the same protocol and antibodies described above."

It is difficult to envision how regulating something like local enzymatic activities could give rise to such precise levels of p-EGFR in endosomes. Instead, it seems more compatible with a process whereby there is a single scaffold (or similar protein assembly) per endosome that binds p-EGFR and protects it from dephosphorylation. This is supported by your observation that at low concentrations of EGF, blocking kinase activity does not change the total levels of p-EGFR, which would be expected if it controlled phosphatase activity, but does reduce the number of endosomes in which p-EGFR is found. This argues for a role of kinase activity in the segregation process by which a set number of p-EGFR molecules are associated with an endosome, not phosphatase activity."

As a consequence of this correlation, one could develop a good descriptive model that functionally links the two processes and, for example, could give rise to the prediction that the total amount of pEGFR is dependent on the fusion/fission rate of endosomes. If p-EGFR flowed into endosomes too rapidly such that there was insufficient time to assemble the protective scaffold, their net rate of dephosphorylation would be higher, thus give rise to a positive correlation between EGFR kinase activity and dephosphorylation, and the predicted negative relationship between fusion rates and p-EGFR content per endosome."
