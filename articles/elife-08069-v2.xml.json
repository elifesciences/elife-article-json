It is less well understood, however, to what extent entire neural circuits of different individuals are similar. Previously, we reported the neuronal connectome of the visual eye circuit from the head of a <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> larva (<a href=\"#bib16\">Randel et al., 2014</a>). We now report a full-body serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) dataset of another larva of the same age, for which we describe the connectome of the visual eyes and the larval eyespots. Anatomical comparisons and quantitative analyses of the two circuits reveal a high inter-individual stereotypy of the cell complement, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity, including the left-right asymmetry in the connectivity of some neurons. Our work shows the extent to which the eye circuitry in <i>Platynereis</i> larvae is hard-wired."

It is less well understood, however, to what extent entire neural circuits of different individuals are similar. Previously, we reported the neuronal connectome of the visual eye circuit from the head of a <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> larva (<a href=\"#bib16\">Randel et al., 2014</a>). We now report a full-body serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) dataset of another larva of the same age, for which we describe the connectome of the visual eyes and the larval eyespots. Anatomical comparisons and quantitative analyses of the two circuits reveal a high inter-individual stereotypy of the cell complement, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity, including the left-right asymmetry in the connectivity of some neurons. Our work shows the extent to which the eye circuitry in <i>Platynereis</i> larvae is hard-wired."

However, the stereotypy of neuronal circuits between individuals of the same species at the level of synaptic connectivity is not well known. Previously, several studies have addressed nervous system stereotypy at the level of single neurons, neuronal projection patterns, or neuronal activity. For example, in the zebrafish larval brain, neuronal spatiotemporal activity is highly stereotypical between individuals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Portugues et al., 2014</a>). The fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> has stereotypical neuron types, axonal projection patterns, neuronal activity patterns and patterns of synaptic connectivity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Mosca and Luo, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). A recent connectomic study found that the connectivity of interneurons mediating rolling behavior in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae were reproducible between two individuals (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>). Nematodes also have a nervous system that is considered highly stereotypical (<a href=\"#bib21\">White et al., 1986</a>)."

Previously, we reported the neuronal connectome of this circuit, reconstructed from a 72 hr post fertilization (hpf) larva. <i>Platynereis</i> larvae develop following a strict cell lineage (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</a>) and different individuals of the same developmental stage have a stereotypical complement of neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Tomer et al., 2010</a>). However, whether synapse-level connectomes are reproducible among different <i>Platynereis</i> individuals is unclear. To test the stereotypy of the neuronal projection patterns and synaptic connectivity of individual neurons, we have reconstructed the visual eye circuitry of a second individual from the same batch, allowing the detailed comparison of two larval connectomes in <i>Platynereis</i>."

However, the fact that our reconstructions resulted in the same overall circuitry indicates that the reconstructions are robust against noise.
