LAMP2 deficiency causes Danon\u2019s disease, an X-linked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. LAMP2 is needed for chaperone-mediated autophagy, and its expression improves tissue function in models of aging. We show here that human LAMP1 and LAMP2 bind cholesterol in a manner that buries the cholesterol 3\u03b2-hydroxyl group; they also bind tightly to NPC1 and NPC2 proteins that export cholesterol from lysosomes. Quantitation of cellular LAMP2 and NPC1 protein levels suggest that LAMP proteins represent a significant cholesterol binding site at the lysosome limiting membrane, and may signal cholesterol availability. Functional rescue experiments show that the ability of human LAMP2 to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes relies on its ability to bind cholesterol directly."

Lysosomes are crucial for the degradation of substrates from the cytoplasm, as well as membrane bound compartments derived from the secretory, endocytic, autophagic and phagocytic pathways. The limiting membrane of lysosomes is lined with so-called lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (LAMPs) that are comprised of a short cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane span, and a highly, N- and O-glycosylated lumenal domain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Wilke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kundra and Kornfeld, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Granger et al., 1990</a>). Because of their abundance and glycan content, LAMPs have been proposed to serve as a protective barrier to block hydrolase access to the limiting phospholipid bilayer. LAMP1 and LAMP2 are 37% identical and may overlap in function, but knockout of LAMP1 in mouse has a much milder phenotype than depletion of LAMP2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Tanaka et al., 2000</a>): LAMP2-deficient mice have very short lifespans, and show massive accumulation of autophagic structures in most tissues. Indeed, LAMPs are required for fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Huynh et al., 2007</a>) and LAMP2 has also been proposed to serve as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cuervo and Dice, 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</a>)."

Proteome-wide analysis of cholesterol binding proteins included LAMP1 and LAMP2 among a long list of candidate proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hulce et al., 2013</a>). Despite these hints, the precise function of LAMP proteins has remained unclear, and they are often presumed to be structural components. We show here that LAMP proteins bind cholesterol directly and this capacity contributes to their role in cholesterol export from lysosomes."

As mentioned earlier, the NPC1\u2009N-terminal domain binds cholesterol directly (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kwon et al., 2009</a>). Because of a possible connection between LAMP protein cholesterol binding and NPC-mediated cholesterol export, we checked for an interaction between these proteins. Membrane anchored, endogenous LAMP2 co-immuno-precipitated with full length NPC1-GFP but not with the control protein, GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or the lysosomal membrane protein, MCOLN1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), upon expression in HEK293T cells.

In terms of concentrations, 37 femtoliters of lysosome volume would contain 0.3\u00a0mM LAMP2-associated cholesterol binding sites in HeLa cell lysosomes (assuming one mole cholesterol bound per more LAMP2).

While the relative abundance of these proteins matches the values we report here, their total level was 25 fold lower in that study.

LAMP2 also aids in cholesterol export from lysosomes. How might LAMP2\u2019s cholesterol binding site contribute to cholesterol export? Current models suggest that the soluble NPC2 protein binds cholesterol from the internal membranes of lysosomes and delivers it to NPC1 at the limiting membrane of this compartment (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kwon et al., 2009</a>). One possibility is that NPC2 can deliver cholesterol to both NPC1 and to LAMP2, which is more abundant. This would help drive the cholesterol export process by moving cholesterol from the accumulated, lumenal lipid stores to the lysosome\u2019s limiting membrane. Because LAMP2 and NPC1\u2009N-terminal domains bind cholesterol in the same orientation, it makes sense that NPC2 (which binds in opposite orientation,\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib33\">Xu et al., 2007</a>]) could transfer the cholesterol between these two proteins. The recent crystal structure of NPC2 bound to the middle, lumenal domain of NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Li et al., 2016</a>) supports a direct handoff between NPC1 and NPC2 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kwon et al., 2009</a>). In future work, it will be important to elucidate precisely how LAMP2 interacts with both NPC2 and NPC1 to facilitate cholesterol export from lysosomes and how cholesterol binding contributes to LAMP2\u2019s other cellular roles."

They report that soluble, secreted fragments of the lumenal portions of LAMP1 and LAMP2 exhibit specific binding of cholesterol. Specificity of binding is suggested by saturation binding kinetics, competition experiments, and point mutagenesis. Full-length, endogenous LAMP2 is shown to co-immunoprecipitate with GFP-tagged NPC1 and NPC2 expressed by transfection and this association is diminished by treatment of cells to reduce late endosome cholesterol. Co-IP of LAMP2 and NPC1 is correlated with oligomeric state of LAMP1, where cholesterol promotes dissociation of LAMP1 oligomers and results in a decrease in the amount of LAMP2-NPC1 complex. Finally, the authors show that mutations in the lumenal domain of LAMP2 that ablate cholesterol binding do not support NPC1-mediated efflux of cholesterol from the lysosome."

Given that the solubility of cholesterol in water is less than 100 nM, this result raises several critical questions. First, it is possible that a more soluble contaminant (e.g., an oxysterol) is responsible for the competition. Another possibility is that the cholesterol is in some type of micelle with the NP40 detergent. In either case, it is hard to know how to evaluate the concentration of cholesterol in these experiments. The authors need to elucidate the form of cholesterol that is bound by LAMP proteins."

Specifically, previous work has suggested that NPC2 and NPC1-NTD bind cholesterol with opposite orientation of the hydroxyl, which would allow cholesterol to slide from one pocket to the other. If LAMPs and NPC1-NTD have the same orientation, this will not work; cholesterol would remain bound to LAMP. Related to this point, one reviewer raised the point that LAMPs seem better suited to be cholesterol sensors rather than \"reservoirs\". Compared to the capacity of the lysosome membrane to harbor cholesterol, are there really sufficient numbers of LAMP proteins per lysosome to constitute a \"reservoir?\""

Based on the cholesterol data, the competitors should be judged by their ability to compete at 15 \u00b5M. Only 7-ketocholesterol seems to be a strong competitor.

As noted by the referee, at high sterol concentrations, it is not possible to add enough competitor to fully block binding as there are significant solubility issues. Nevertheless, we have now made much more clear how the binding was done, how much cholesterol is present, and added new data for 25-hydroxycholesterol \u00b1 cold competitor (new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In summary, sterol binding is indeed specific and likely tighter than the apparent Kd due to solubility issues."
