We have identified a conserved protein and interactors required for maintaining cell adhesion during a simple collective migration in the developing <i>C. elegans</i> male gonad. LINKIN is a previously uncharacterized, transmembrane protein conserved throughout Metazoa. We identified seven atypical FG\u2013GAP domains in the extracellular domain, which potentially folds into a \u03b2-propeller structure resembling the \u03b1-integrin ligand-binding domain. <i>C. elegans</i> LNKN-1 localizes to the plasma membrane of all gonadal cells, with apical and lateral bias. We identified the LINKIN interactors RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and \u03b1-tubulin by using SILAC mass spectrometry on human HEK 293T cells and testing candidates for <i>lnkn-1</i>-like function in <i>C. elegans</i> male gonad. We propose that LINKIN promotes adhesion between neighboring cells through its extracellular domain and regulates microtubule dynamics through RUVBL proteins at its intracellular domain."

We have identified a conserved protein and interactors required for maintaining cell adhesion during a simple collective migration in the developing <i>C. elegans</i> male gonad. LINKIN is a previously uncharacterized, transmembrane protein conserved throughout Metazoa. We identified seven atypical FG\u2013GAP domains in the extracellular domain, which potentially folds into a \u03b2-propeller structure resembling the \u03b1-integrin ligand-binding domain. <i>C. elegans</i> LNKN-1 localizes to the plasma membrane of all gonadal cells, with apical and lateral bias. We identified the LINKIN interactors RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and \u03b1-tubulin by using SILAC mass spectrometry on human HEK 293T cells and testing candidates for <i>lnkn-1</i>-like function in <i>C. elegans</i> male gonad. We propose that LINKIN promotes adhesion between neighboring cells through its extracellular domain and regulates microtubule dynamics through RUVBL proteins at its intracellular domain."

We identified seven atypical FG\u2013GAP domains in LINKIN that may fold into a \u03b2-propeller domain resembling the \u03b1-integrin ligand-binding domain. We show that the <i>C. elegans</i> LINKIN protein, LNKN-1, is localized to membranes of interconnected cells, most pronouncedly at apical surfaces and cell\u2013cell contacts. In particular, LNKN-1 is required for adhesion among collectively migrating gonadal cells in <i>C. elegans</i>, although it is also expressed in many other interconnected tissues. Taking advantage of the conservation between <i>C. elegans</i> and human LINKIN, we performed SILAC based mass spectrometry on a human cell line and functional testing in <i>C. elegans</i> to identify potential interactors of LINKIN. Members of the highly conserved AAA+ ATPase family, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, and the cytoskeletal protein \u03b1-tubulin physically interacted with LINKIN and were required for collective gonadal migration. Our data support a function for LINKIN as an adhesion molecule that uses its extracellular domain to bind molecules on the surface of neighboring cells and its intracellular domain to regulate microtubule dynamics."

Capping the distal end of the gonad are the two male distal tip cells, which maintain the mitotic germ cells. To form this gonad shape during the L2 through L4 stages of the larval development, the LC leads the elongating gonad from the mid-body region to the cloaca opening in the posterior body, where it dies after completing the migration. During the L3 stage of the migration, the somatic cells of the vas deferens and seminal vesicle precursors divide from seven to 53 cells to form the elongating gonad.

By ablating the LC (15/15), we confirmed the findings of <a href=\"#bib37\">Kimble (1981)</a> that the LC is necessary for migration and is not replaced by a follower cell taking on its migratory role. Without the LC, the gonad stopped elongating but continued to balloon through cell proliferation. The LC, however, was capable of migrating alone if the somatic cells around it were ablated in the L3 stage (8/10). In this case, the LC alone migrated along its normal course while the gonad stopped elongating at the point of LC detachment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Since LC migration was slower than normal, the LC often did not complete its migration by the L4-to-adult transition. The cause of the slower migration may be due to the missing contribution of gonadal cells or other factors such as drag from scarred tissue. The germ cells add to gonadal mass but are not necessary for migration, as the LC reaches the cloaca even when germ cell precursors are ablated."

Since the consortium only reports hermaphrodite expression patterns, we searched their database for genes expressed in the migratory leader cells for the hermaphrodite gonad, the distal tip cells (DTCs), which functionally are the closest cells to the male LC (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</a>). We reasoned that the gonadal leader cells of both sexes may use partially overlapping genes for their migrations.

This detachment resulted in a partially elongated gonad and, further ahead along the normal path, a detached LC alone or with a few adherent follower cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). This phenotype is similar to that of the gonad with ablated follower cells behind the LC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The position of detachment was variable but usually occurred within a few cell lengths behind the LC, suggesting that the pulling force generated by the LC may have caused detachment. Although the LC continued to migrate along its normal course after detachment and occasionally completed the migration, the male was sterile since the gonad did not connect to the cloaca opening. In <i>lnkn-1(gk367)</i> mutant hermaphrodites, the gonadal leader DTCs remained connected but migrated a shorter distance than the wild type and their shape appeared elongated and strained. The mutant also recessively caused maternal effect lethality (n = 30/30).

The FG\u2013GAP is a domain that occurs in seven copies in \u03b1-integrins and folds into a seven-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure that serves as its ligand-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib63\">Springer, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Xiong et al., 2002</a>). We have identified seven atypical FG\u2013GAP domains in the N-terminal of the extracellular domain, based on sequence similarities to the annotated LINKIN FG\u2013GAP domains from <i>H. sapiens</i> and <i>M. musculus</i> and to \u03b1-integrin FG\u2013GAP domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). FG\u2013GAP domains have a loosely conserved Phe-Gly and Gly-Ala-Pro sequence, which are separated by sequence that can include a calcium-binding motif. A comparison of all human \u03b1-integrin FG\u2013GAP domains showed that their calcium-binding motif has a strong DxxxDxxxD signature (D = Asp, x = AA; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chouhan et al., 2011</a>). We found a strong DxxxDxxxD signature in all seven calcium-binding domains of LINKIN, suggesting that these are similar to FG\u2013GAP domains of \u03b1-integrins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The significance of finding seven FG\u2013GAP domains in the N-terminal of LINKIN is the possibility that LINKIN, like \u03b1-integrins, uses a seven-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure to bind ligand. We also identified a highly conserved extracellular region adjacent to the transmembrane domain, which is a yet unrecognized protein domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). LINKIN has a dozen predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (<a href=\"http://uniprot.org\">uniprot.org</a>). Taken together, our investigation shows that LINKIN is a conserved transmembrane glycoprotein pre-dating Metazoa and potentially containing a seven-bladed, \u03b2-propeller, ligand-binding domain."

Previously, <i>lnkn-1</i> localization was categorized to be in cell membrane, when examined by GFP-tagging in a screen of muscle-related genes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Meissner et al., 2011</a>). The only other investigation into LINKIN observed that in mammals the extracellular domain functions as a secreted protein that modulates T-cell dependent immune response (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fiscella et al., 2003</a>). We made both extracellularly and intracellularly YFP-tagged versions of LNKN-1 expressed under its natural regulatory specific promoter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2M,N</a>). Both YFP::LNKN-1 and LNKN-1::YFP are similarly localized to the plasma membrane of many cells. LNKN-1 begins to be expressed in all somatic gonadal cells of the male, including the LC, the vas deferens precursor cells, and seminal vesicle precursor cells, starting in the early L3 stage and continuing through adulthood (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). It is also expressed in all somatic gonadal cells of the hermaphrodite, including the distal tip cells, anchor cell, uterine precursor cells, and spermatheca precursor cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Other expression occurs in pharynx, pharyngeal-intestinal valve, intestine, excretory cell and canal, seam cells, a specialized subset of hypodermal cells, the vulval precursor cells of the hermaphrodite, and hook precursor cells in the male (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). YFP-tagged LNKN-1 is localized to the plasma membrane, exhibiting stronger localization to the sides of cell\u2013cell contact in tissues such as the intestine, seam, and gonad. This broad expression is consistent with our observations that <i>lnkn-1</i> is expressed in the LC but not enriched (<a href=\"#bib61\">Schwarz et al., 2012</a>)."

Immunofluorescence staining was performed on dissected gonads and intestines, which greatly improves antibody penetration over whole animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). Staining of other dissected parts of the worm confirmed expression in the pharynx, excretory canal, and seam cells, indicating that the tissue expression pattern of LNKN-1::YFP is accurate. However, there was an important difference in subcellular localization between the native and YFP-tagged proteins: the antibodies showed stronger localization of LNKN-1 to the apical and lateral domain of the gonad (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) and intestine, while YFP-tagged LNKN-1 is uniformly distributed in the plasma membrane. While both antibodies show heavier localization to the apical and lateral plasma membrane, the extracellular domain antibody shows additional staining in large cytoplasmic puncta (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and the intracellular domain antibody shows nuclear staining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). In <i>lnkn-1</i> mutants and <i>lnkn-1</i> RNAi-treated animals, we do not see plasma membrane staining with antibodies against either the extracellular or intracellular domain, but we do see non-specific staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This indicates that the membrane staining is due to LNKN-1 localization, but the cytoplasmic and nuclear stainings are due to non-specific binding of other proteins. The antibodies also stain the plasma membrane in the germ cells, where YFP expression could not be determined because germ cells do not readily express transgenes. The two antibodies reveal the true localization of native LNKN-1 to be in the plasma membrane with a preference for apical and lateral domains."

The advantage of using a human cell line compared to whole <i>C. elegans</i> is that it is a homogeneous cell type and the conditions for SILAC mass spectrometry are established. By using SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture), experiment and control immunoprecipitates can simultaneously be analyzed by mass spectrometry, enabling both quantitation and background subtraction. SILAC mass spectrometry was performed on immunoprecipitates from human LINKIN-Myc-expressing HEK 293T cells without isotopic labeling and from non-transfected cells with heavy isotopic labeling. Based on the ratio of \u2018light\u2019 to \u2018heavy\u2019 isotopes for each protein, enrichment through specific binding to LINKIN over background non-specific binding was determined. 484 proteins with at least two unique peptides were identified by LC/MS/MS from the immunoprecipitate with LINKIN, excluding common contaminants (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Binding between RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 into heteromeric multimers (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gorynia et al., 2011</a>) and binding between RUVBLs and microtubules have been reported (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gartner et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dobreva et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ducat et al., 2008</a>). To test physical interaction between LINKIN and each of RUVBL1, RUVBL2, \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin, we performed Western blots on co-immunoprecipitates from ITFG1-Myc-expressing HEK 293T cells. Probing with antibodies against RUVBL1, RUVBL2, \u03b1-tubulin, and \u03b2-tubulin, we found that RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and \u03b1-tubulin bound LINKIN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013I</a>).

We therefore investigated whether LINKIN or cleaved domains of LINKIN may also localize to the spindle during cell division. There are precedents for membrane-associated proteins involved in cell adhesion, such as ILK and \u03b2-catenin, to localize to the spindle with RUVBLs and microtubules (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaplan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fielding, et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dobreva et al., 2008</a>). We first examined microtubule localization, which is known to redistribute during mitosis to a formation that radiates out from the mitotic spindle and attaches to the kinetochore and cell cortex. In fixed dissected gonads from L3 stage animals, by using an antibody against \u03b1-tubulin to identify microtubules and DAPI staining to identify condensed chromosomes of dividing cells, we observed the expected microtubule redistribution to the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). The usually dense network of microtubules found in the cytosol and cell periphery of non-mitotic cells was replaced in mitotic cells by radial microtubules. We next examined whether LNKN-1 or domains of LNKN-1 were redistributed during cell division. Both antibodies against LNKN-1 extracellular (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>) and intracellular domains (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>) showed that localization of LNKN-1 remains unchanged at the plasma membrane during mitosis. These observations imply that there is a temporary loss of interaction between \u03b1-tubulin, RUVBL proteins, and LNKN-1 at the membrane and the interactions must be reestablished after cell division."

AJM-1 localizes to apical adhesion junctions in a complex with cadherins (<a href=\"#bib40\">K\u00f6ppen et al., 2001</a>). In the tube-shaped adult gonad, we observed AJM-1::GFP lining the entire lumen composed of the apical surfaces of the surrounding somatic gonad cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>). This apical accumulation begins in the mid-L4 stage as puncta (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>), but it is not present in the L3 stage when gonad detachment usually occurs in the <i>lnkn-1</i> mutant. INX-5 shows expression and localization to cell\u2013cell junctions in a few cells in the distal somatic gonad also starting in the L4 stage and becoming stronger in the adult (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013H</a>). Results based on both adhesion markers are consistent with the timeline of gonadal development, which dictates that cell division and rearrangement occurs during the L3 stage, while differentiation into the mature structure occurs during the latter half of the L4 stage up until the transition into adulthood. Cell dissociation in <i>lnkn-1</i> mutants occurs at a stage when cell junctions are being rearranged; during this growth phase, adhesion-promoting genes like <i>lnkn-1</i> may have a greater effect than later after the establishment of other more secure junctions."

This approximately 600 AA protein has a large extracellular domain of approximately 530 AA and a short 22 AA intracellular domain. We found a number of notable features about LINKIN. First, it is a protein pre-dating metazoans. Second, the size of the protein and organization of the domains have not changed during its evolution. The seven atypical FG\u2013GAP domains, the extracellular region proximal to the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular sequence are all conserved. The identical sequence at the C-terminal of LINKIN suggested that some of its intracellular interactors may also be conserved proteins. In fact, LINKIN interactors, RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and \u03b1-tubulin are all highly conserved proteins that likely pre-date LINKIN. Third, among the genomes we searched, including those of <i>H. sapiens</i>, <i>M. musculus</i>, <i>D. melanogaster</i>, <i>C. elegans</i>, and <i>T. adhaerens</i>, LINKIN has no paralog. Even the highly conserved short 22 AA intracellular domain is not found in other proteins. The lack of paralogs is surprising considering that other highly conserved adhesion molecules like integrins and cadherins have numerous paralogs and have expanded into superfamilies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Angst et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Takada et al., 2007</a>)."

One of the striking phenotypes of the <i>lnkn-1</i> mutant was cell detachment in the migrating gonad. In <i>lnkn-1</i> mutants, gonadal cell dissociation occurs in the L3 stage. At this stage, although the adhesions are strong enough that these cells cannot be mechanically dissociated without lysing, they have not yet formed mature adherens junctions. The expression of adhesion junction markers, AJM (apical junction molecule)-1::GFP, and gap junction marker, INX(innexin)-5::GFP, was absent in the L3 stage, when gonad cells begin detaching in <i>lnkn-1</i> mutants; their expression only begins in the L4 stage and grows stronger in the fully differentiated adult gonad. The role of adhesion molecules, such as LINKIN, may therefore be more important before other, possibly stronger, adhesions are formed. The gonad detachment defect of <i>lnkn-1</i> mutants likely results from the combined effects of the absence of a functional LINKIN adhesion molecule, the lack of other permanent adhesion structures in the L3 stage, and the force generated by the migrating LC."

YFP-tagging also disrupts the function of LINKIN, as neither YFP-tagged LINKN-1 construct rescued the mutant phenotype, suggesting that apical localization may be necessary for LNKN-1 function. Known adhesion molecules have preferential localization at the plasma membrane. Integrins are often enriched in the basal domain since they bind extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schoenenberger et al., 1994</a>), while cadherins are enriched in lateral domains (<a href=\"#bib26\">Halbleib and Nelson, 2006</a>).

Our experiments indicate that in the context of <i>C. elegans</i> collective migration, a secreted extracellular domain is insufficient to rescue the detachment defect.

RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are highly conserved members of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, which use the energy harvested from ATP hydrolysis to perform mechanical functions on macromolecules. In bacteria where they were first identified, RUVBs have a function as a DNA helicase at holiday junctions; but in more complex organisms, the RUVBLs have additional diverse functions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jha and Dutta, 2009</a>). Among its non-nuclear roles, RUVBLs function in R2TP co-chaperone complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kakihara and Houry, 2012</a>) and in spindle assembly by nucleating microtubules and localizing components to the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gartner et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ducat et al., 2008</a>). We have shown through limited cell fractionation that LINKIN is present in the membrane, where it interacts with RUVBL proteins and \u03b1-tubulin. Although we showed that LINKIN does not localize to the mitotic spindle, the latter role of RUVBLs as regulators of microtubule assembly and complex formation may be most relevant to its function with LINKIN and \u03b1-tubulin. Based on previously known RUVBL functions, we propose that RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 form a heterometric ring structure that promotes assembly of a LINKIN complex and nucleation of microtubules (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

They provide structure and rigidity to tissues so that they can withstand high compression forces (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brangwynne et al., 2007</a>), and the bundled cortical microtubules of gonadal cells likely provide such a structure. Microtubules are also involved in creating polarity and trafficking components along polarized tracks. The subunits have a plus and minus end polarity growing out from the centrosome, which in turn can create a front\u2013back polarization in migratory cells through selective stabilization of fibers (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wadsworth, 1999</a>) and polarized trafficking to the membrane (<a href=\"#bib50\">Miller et al., 2009</a>). Microtubules serve as tracks to transport cadherin-containing vesicles to specific areas of the plasma membrane to establish cell adhesion (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mary et al., 2002</a>).

However major flaws were identified in your molecular evidence for the LINKIN-RuvB complex and in your interpretation of the immunolocalization of the different components.

For that, it is necessary to show that LINKIN has a conserved role in adhesion in diverse animals and their closest relatives. In the next sentence, the authors state that \u201cLINKIN is present in Trichoplax, an animal of the most basal phylum Placozoa that is composed of two epithelioid cell layers, fitting with a cell-cell adhesion function for LINKIN.\u201d Again, the presence of a gene in a multicellular organism is not sufficient to infer that the gene plays a role in cell adhesion. There are a multitude of other cellular functions that could be served. The authors should exercise more caution in making inferences about LINKIN function based on its phylogenetic distribution."

For that, it is necessary to show that LINKIN has a conserved role in adhesion in diverse animals and their closest relatives.
