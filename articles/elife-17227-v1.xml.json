We apply our algorithm to show that visually complex, coiled sequences are a superposition of two simpler patterns: the body wave dynamics and a head-curvature pulse. We demonstrate the precise <math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-turn dynamics of an escape response and uncover a surprising new dichotomy in spontaneous, large-amplitude coils; deep reorientations occur not only through classical <math id=\"inf2\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></math>-shaped postures but also through larger postural excitations which we label here as <math id=\"inf3\"><mi>\u03b4</mi></math>-turns. We find that omega and delta turns occur independently, suggesting a distinct triggering mechanism, and are the serpentine analog of a random left-right step. Finally, we show that omega and delta turns occur with approximately equal rates and adapt to food-free conditions on a similar timescale, a simple strategy to avoid navigational bias."

We apply our algorithm to show that visually complex, coiled sequences are a superposition of two simpler patterns: the body wave dynamics and a head-curvature pulse. We demonstrate the precise <math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>-turn dynamics of an escape response and uncover a surprising new dichotomy in spontaneous, large-amplitude coils; deep reorientations occur not only through classical <math id=\"inf2\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></math>-shaped postures but also through larger postural excitations which we label here as <math id=\"inf3\"><mi>\u03b4</mi></math>-turns. We find that omega and delta turns occur independently, suggesting a distinct triggering mechanism, and are the serpentine analog of a random left-right step. Finally, we show that omega and delta turns occur with approximately equal rates and adapt to food-free conditions on a similar timescale, a simple strategy to avoid navigational bias."

Yet, the existence of such collective organization also suggests that living systems, despite their enormous potential complexity, often inhabit only a much smaller region of their potential \u2018phase space\u2019, and evidence for this lower-dimensional behavior is ubiquitous. For example, the motor control system produces movements that are far less complex than what the musculoskeletal system allows (<a href=\"#bib10\">d'Avella et al., 2003</a>) and this hints at the presence of an organizational principle. In a typical daily movement like walking, the central nervous system is thought to produce the full walking gait by combining low-level \u2018locomotory modules\u2019, some of which appear to be universal among species (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dominici et al., 2011</a>).

These shape projections are collective coordinates in the space of natural worm postures and provide a notable reduction in complexity. However, an important limitation of previous work is the inability to deduce the geometry of self-occluding body shapes. Such coiled body postures occur during \u2018omega turns\u2019 (a maneuver during which the worm\u2019s body briefly resembles the Greek letter <math id=\"inf4\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></math>\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib8\">Croll, 1975</a>]) and are a general and important feature of the worm\u2019s behavioral repertoire, ranging from foraging (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stephens et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Salvador et al., 2014</a>), and chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</a>), to escape from noxious stimuli (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mohammadi et al., 2013</a>). For example, during escape behaviors worms use coiled shapes to reorient by <math id=\"inf5\"><msup><mn>180</mn><mo>\u2218</mo></msup></math> and the benefit seems obvious: it steers the worm back to safety. But how does a \u2018blind\u2019 organism achieve this result without any visual reference to the outside world? While some of the neural and molecular mechanisms driving omega turns have been uncovered (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Donnelly et al., 2013</a>) and there has been previous work on crossed shapes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Roussel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nagy et al., 2015</a>), a quantitative analysis of such self-occluded posture dynamics is lacking."

We apply our approach to analyze coiled shapes during two important behavioral conditions: the escape response induced by a brief heat shock to the head, and spontaneous turns while foraging on a featureless agar plate. We find that, in general, complex deep turn sequences can be viewed as a simpler superposition of body wave phase dynamics with a bimodal head swing followed by a unimodal curvature pulse. In the escape response we show that, while turning accounts for much of the ~180\u00b0 reorientation, the full distribution of reorientation angles is shaped by significant contributions from the reversal, turn and post-turn behaviors, a result consistent with the presence and action of the monoamine tyramine during the entire response (<a href=\"#bib14\">Donnelly et al., 2013</a>). In natural crawling, the peak amplitudes of the curvature pulse reveal two distinct coiling behaviors \u2014 the classical omega turn accomplishing large ventral-side reorientations, and a previously uncharacterized \u2018delta\u2019 turn which produces dorsal reorientations by overturning through the ventral side. The omega and delta turns occur independently in time, suggesting a separate triggering process, but have similar rates, as expected if they contribute little overall bias in the trajectories."

For each movie frame, we identified the body of the worm, and applied a thinning algorithm to find the centerline. The worm\u2019s 2D body posture was characterized as a 100-dimensional vector of tangent angles along this centerline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). Principal Component Analysis revealed that more than 95% of the variance in naturally-occurring body postures was captured by just four eigenvectors of the posture covariance matrix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). As a result, any worm posture can be decomposed as a linear combination of these \u2018eigenworms\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Worm behavior then becomes a smooth, low-dimensional trajectory through posture space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

However, when turns do occur, they result in a dramatically different change of overall orientation. As in the escape response, we use our algorithm to track the worm\u2019s overall body reorientation, and in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>,\u00a0we\u00a0show how the worm reorients using both omega (orange) and delta (blue) turns. Simply put, omega turns reorient the worm by large, ventral angles, while delta turns reorient the worm dorsally by \u2018over-turning\u2019 through the ventral side. The difference in reorientation angle may provide a hint as to why these two behaviors exist. Earlier, we saw that the neural mechanisms that produce the escape-response omega turn, are fundamentally asymmetric, producing only ventral turns (through disinhibition of the VD motor neurons) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Donnelly et al., 2013</a>). If the worm uses the same neural infrastructure during free crawling, this would only ever allow it to reorient itself towards its ventral side. Lacking a dorsal \u2018copy\u2019 of the same neural infrastructure, the worm could instead hyper-activate the existing infrastructure to produce ventral \u2018over-turning\u2019. These \u2018over-turns\u2019 are what we call delta turns, and enable the worm to also reorient towards its dorsal side. We also find that delta and omega turns occur seemingly independently; the mutual information between time-binned, time-shifted series for both turning event time series has a maximum of less than a few percent (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3</a>). On the other hand, evidence that the turns can be jointly controlled is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>. Here, we plot the frequency of turning events over the course of the experiment. As the worm searches for food in a larger area, the turn frequency decreases significantly \u2014 a well-known phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Bono and Villu Maricq, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Srivastava et al., 2009</a>) \u2014 and both omega and delta turns show similar frequencies and adaptation."

Our posture tracking algorithm itself is conceptually simple and relies on an optimized image search within the low-dimensional space of worm shapes. Indeed, while the identification of low-dimensionality occupies an important role in quantitative approaches to living systems (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib24\">Machta et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Daniels and Nemenman, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ganguli and Sompolinsky, 2012</a>), here we have leveraged low-dimensionality to elucidate important and previously unknown aspects of <i>C. elegans</i> coils.

This model is consistent with the molecular mechanisms found to orchestrate the escape response (<a href=\"#bib14\">Donnelly et al., 2013</a>). Our results also hint at a possible answer as to how reorientations of 180\u00b0 are accomplished: the worm could use its own body as a \u2018guide\u2019 for reorientation.

Under foraging and chemotaxis conditions, these behaviors are seemingly stochastic (<a href=\"#bib32\">Srivastava et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gallagher et al., 2013</a>), producing a broad distribution of reorientation angles analogous to tumbling in the bacteria <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berg and Brown, 1972</a>). However, unlike bacterial tumbling (which occurs through an instantaneous switch in the rotation direction of a molecular motor and the resulting unbundling of the flagellar tail, see, e.g., <a href=\"#bib1\">Berg, 2006</a>) the worm\u2019s reorientation is driven by a long, controlled sequence of stereotyped postural changes. Thus, an important question is how the worm effectively randomizes its direction of motion. We have shown here that half the variability in <i>C. elegans</i> foraging reorientations is due simply to the initial random choice of delta or omega turns. However, even the level of stochasticity can be modulated, as evidenced by the largely deterministic reorientation in the escape response, differing response variability depending on the strength of a thermal stimulus (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mohammadi et al., 2013</a>), and the slow adaptation of the reversal rate (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Stephens et al., 2011</a>). Overall, such a combination of behaviors, flexible and stochastic combined with patterned and deterministic, is likely to be observed even in more complex organisms, including humans. In initiating the detailed analysis of <i>C. elegans</i> turning behavior, we hope that our work offers a first step towards a general understanding of these processes."

In earlier trials, we found that using five postural eigenmodes gave us significantly better tracking results than only using four.

This means that the search space for our algorithm is six-dimensional, with 5 postural dimensions, and 1 rotational dimension. To find a tracking solution for a frame, we ran hundreds of pattern searches (using MATLAB\u2019s \u2018patternsearch\u2019 function) from randomly distributed starting points in search space, with the error function described above as objective function. Only solutions with an error value less than <math id=\"inf155\"><mn>1.0</mn></math>, a threshold value obtained through trial-and-error, were kept.

This finally resulted in zero, one, or more potential tracking solutions per movie frame. To speed up the optimization, we applied two additional constraints.

We verified that the distributions of eigenvalues <math id=\"inf158\"><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math> found in our tracking data tailed off before reaching these limits. Secondly, we set a limit to the maximum local curvature of the worm\u2019s backbone, so that elements in the resulting theta vector that are 10 indices apart must not be different by more than 1.95\u2009rad. This limit rules out body shapes that were unnaturally coiled."

This fast algorithm yields high-accuracy tracking results for frames with simple, non\u2013self-overlapping body shapes. It also automatically labels crossed frames. For the foraging dataset, the data were cut into smaller segments to allow for faster parallel processing. Each segment consisted of a series of non-crossed frames, followed by a series of crossed frames, followed by more non-crossed frames. This effectively segmented the data by deep turns (936 segments in total for the 12 worm trajectories). For the escape response dataset, such segmentation was not necessary, due to the smaller size of the data for each worm. Frames that were labeled by the \u2018classic\u2019 algorithm as \u2018crossed\u2019 were tracked using the inverse algorithm described above. The result was an interpolated, smooth trajectory through posture space. When using this pipeline as-is, the algorithm would occasionally swap the locations of head and tail between frames. To resolve head/tail orientation correctly throughout a segment, we implemented four steps. (1) During the filtering and interpolation step, we allowed the algorithm to pick, for each non-crossed frame, not just the solution given by the \u2018classic\u2019 algorithm; it could also pick an alternative version in which head and tail were swapped (this version can be trivially computed). (2) We explicitly included a limit for the maximum change of overall orientation <math id=\"inf170\"><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mi id=\"XM91\">\u03b8</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow></math> between frames of <math id=\"inf171\"><mrow><mi></mi><mo>\u223c</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></math> rad per second in the maximum velocity vector <math id=\"inf172\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\">\ud835\udc97</mi><mi>max</mi></msub></math>.

(3) After the filtering and interpolation step had produced a full tracking solution, we computed the error for both that tracking solution, as well as a version in which the head and tail were swapped for all frames in the segment. This fixed the overall head/tail orientation for the full segment. (4) As a final check, we manually verified and, if necessary, corrected head/tail orientations during post-processing.

This ensured that the negative peak in <math id=\"inf185\"><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>4</mn></msub></math>, representing a high-curvature state of the tail at the end of the omega turn, had finished, and that the worm had reached a relatively \u2018straight\u2019 shape.

The same criterion was used, in the opposite direction, to find the start of the omega turn. If no starting point and/or end point of the omega turn could be found, the recording was excluded from the analysis. (In the escape response dataset, this was the case for 15 out of 91 recordings). We used the same criterion to find both omega and delta turns in the foraging condition. For detection of local extrema in <math id=\"inf187\"><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math>, a standard peak-finding algorithm was used to detect both minima and maxima (based on the MATLAB \u2018findpeaks\u2019 function, which defines a peak as a data point with a greater value than its immediate neighbors).

The first reference point was the last frame before the turn\u2019s apex that featured a \u2018straight\u2019 body shape \u2014 i.e., a body shape with a low maximum local curvature.

Similarly, the second reference point was the first frame after the turn\u2019s apex with such a straight body shape. Importantly, our postural tracking algorithm allows us to continuously follow the orientation angle through coiled shapes and this is important for identifying the \u2018overturning\u2019 reorientation effects of delta turns. For the analysis of the worm\u2019s reorientation during the escape response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>), <i>N</i>\u00a0=\u00a091 escape responses were analyzed. Each 30-second recording was segmented by first finding the omega turn.

Turns were detected by using the peak detection algorithm outlined above, applying the amplitude boundaries <math id=\"inf195\"><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub id=\"XM97\"><mi>a</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>\u2265</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow></math>. The total of these extrema consists of three populations: the tail of a dorsal/ventral symmetric distribution of shallower turns, and two types of ventral deep turns, the delta and omega turns. To find the number of omega turns, we counted the number of <math id=\"inf196\"><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math> peaks with an\u00a0amplitude between \u221220 and \u221210 in each time window, and subtracted this from the total number of <math id=\"inf197\"><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math> peaks with an\u00a0amplitude between +10 and +20. We then computed the average number of omega turns per unit time, across the 12 experiments, in a 10-minute sliding window, shifted across the data in 5-minute steps. The first 200 s of each experiment were discarded. An identical procedure with <math id=\"inf198\"><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub id=\"XM98\"><mi>a</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>20</mn></mrow></math> gives the number of delta turns.

The equality of turn counts, within error bars, signals an approximate overall balance in turn events, in agreement with the rate calculations. The total turn rate in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> is comparable to previous work (e.g., <a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2005</a>), though there are notable differences in turn definitions and experimental conditions. We also note, however, that there are spatiotemporal fluctuations in the turn counts, with an increased number of both turns, as well as a specific bias towards omega turns near the location of the copper ring, likely reflecting an increased rate of ring-induced escape responses. In addition, we find an early-time bias towards delta turns, during which we believe that the behavior is strongly influenced by the mechanical perturbation of picking. In future work, it will be fruitful to examine these spatiotemporal patterns in a larger experimental arena and with increased turn statistics."

They develop an automated method for disambiguating coiled postures that builds on their previously published postural analyses that has given rise to the postural eigenmodes by PCA; there are 4 principal eigenmodes. They use this technique to describe turns and the locomotion proceeding and following as movement through the eigenmode space, showing how turns involve the third and fourth eigenmodes and basic crawling the first two eigenmodes. They then apply this techniques to show that escape turns are very stereotyped, while foraging turns have two basic forms; the conventionally recognized omega-turn (similar to the escape turn) and the newly described delta-turn corresponding to the serpentine analog of a left-right step. Moreover in foraging these turns are independent at about the same frequency and show parallel declines with foraging duration. All in all this was an enjoyable paper to read. It introduces a new technique that should be of great interest to the worm community and can serve as an inspiration for automated tracking and dimensionality reduction in other systems. Moreover, it makes a significant discovery the delta-turn that makes unbiased foraging possible."

The agreement in counts, within error bars, signals an approximate balance in overall turning rate, in agreement with the rate calculations. The total turn rate in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> is reasonably consistent with previous work (e.g., Gray et al., 2005), though there are notable differences in turn definitions and experimental settings. We also note, however, that there are spatiotemporal fluctuations in the turn counts. Indeed, as the reviewers suggest, we do see an increased number of <i>both</i> types of turns, as well as a specific bias towards omega turns, near the location of the copper ring. This likely reflects an increased rate of ring-induced escape responses. There is also an early-time (approximately the first 200s) bias towards delta turns, which we believe is due to the mechanical perturbation of picking. We have added these details to the Methods section (subsection \u201cOmega and delta turn frequency adaptation\u201d). In future work, we intend to examine these spatiotemporal patterns in a larger experimental arena and with higher turn statistics. We have also made minor changes to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, correcting both a mislabeling of the color legend as well as an analysis mistake which resulted in slightly higher reported rates in the previous version of our figure."

The points are color-coded, so that red corresponds to omega turns, and blue to delta turns, as classified in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. There is a visible link between the two quantities, and a significant overall correlation of 0.73 +/- 0.03. This suggests that the specific turn-type is determined relatively early in the dynamics.
