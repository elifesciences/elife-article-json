A high throughput in vivo model system is needed to validate gene associations with pathology. We developed a <i>Drosophila</i>-based functional system to screen candidate disease genes identified from Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) patients. 134 genes were tested in the <i>Drosophila</i> heart using RNAi-based gene silencing. Quantitative analyses of multiple cardiac phenotypes demonstrated essential structural, functional, and developmental roles for more than 70 genes, including a subgroup encoding histone H3K4 modifying proteins. We also demonstrated the use of <i>Drosophila</i> to evaluate cardiac phenotypes resulting from specific, patient-derived alleles of candidate disease genes. We describe the first high throughput in vivo validation system to screen candidate disease genes identified from patients. This approach has the potential to facilitate development of precision medicine approaches for CHD and other diseases associated with genetic factors."

A high throughput in vivo model system is needed to validate gene associations with pathology. We developed a <i>Drosophila</i>-based functional system to screen candidate disease genes identified from Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) patients. 134 genes were tested in the <i>Drosophila</i> heart using RNAi-based gene silencing. Quantitative analyses of multiple cardiac phenotypes demonstrated essential structural, functional, and developmental roles for more than 70 genes, including a subgroup encoding histone H3K4 modifying proteins. We also demonstrated the use of <i>Drosophila</i> to evaluate cardiac phenotypes resulting from specific, patient-derived alleles of candidate disease genes. We describe the first high throughput in vivo validation system to screen candidate disease genes identified from patients. This approach has the potential to facilitate development of precision medicine approaches for CHD and other diseases associated with genetic factors."

Functional gene validation systems in model organisms are therefore essential. While a\u00a0definitive assignment of disease association should be established through the\u00a0analysis of mutant gene phenotypes in a mammalian model, this approach is not practical for rapid high-throughput initial screening of large numbers of candidate genes. <i>Drosophila</i>, by contrast, possesses the attributes of a simple animal model system that make it ideally suited for this role (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bier, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chien et al., 2002</a>)."

The heart functions to maintain circulation of hemolymph (insect \u2018blood\u2019) throughout the body cavity. In a typical beating cycle, hemolymph enters the posteriorly-located heart chamber in the abdomen and is pumped anteriorly through the aorta towards the head and brain.

We used <i>Drosophila</i> developmental genetics to quantitatively evaluate the phenotypes associated with heart-specific RNAi mediated gene silencing of fly homologs of mutated candidate disease genes. 174 genes (78%) had clear fly homologs, consistent with the published estimate of 75% conservation of disease gene homologs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Reiter et al., 2001</a>).

We compared the\u00a0levels of Gal4 RNA in heart tissues of transgenic flies carrying the new 4XHand-Gal4 driver construct versus flies carrying the original, established Hand-Gal4 driver (featuring a single <i>Hand</i> enhancer element). As anticipated, 4XHand promoted significantly higher heart cell expression of Gal4 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We then compared the Hand-Gal4 and 4XHand-Gal4 drivers together with UAS-Gene-IR RNAi based silencing constructs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ni et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2011</a>) for gene knock down efficiency when used to silence expression (i.e. lower heart cell RNA levels) of <i>Drosophila</i> genes <i>CG8184</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and <i>Lid</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Consistent with the\u00a0higher Gal4 expression, 4XHand was significantly more effective at silencing target gene expression through RNAi. To further confirm the utility of 4XHand-Gal4 for screening purposes, we comparatively evaluated the Hand-Gal4 and 4XHand-Gal4 constructs driving heart-specific expression of UAS-RNAi transgenes targeting eight <i>Drosophila</i> genes for developmental lethal (death at pre-adult stage) effects. The <i>Hand</i> enhancer is active during development from embryonic stages, and we reasoned that <i>Hand</i> enhancer-driven silencing of genes known to be essential for heart development would cause developmental lethality. For this assay, male and female flies of the appropriate genotypes were crossed to produce progeny carrying the indicated UAS-gene silencing (i.e. RNAi) interfering RNA (IR) construct, the expression of which was driven by Hand-Gal4 or 4XHand-Gal4. Progeny embryos were collected and allowed to develop under standard conditions. The results were quantitatively expressed as a Mortality Index (MI), the percentage of flies that died before adult emergence from the pupa stage. We found that for all eight tested genes, significant developmental lethal effects of heart-specific gene silencing were only observed in flies carrying a 4XHand-Gal4 driver (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We extracted the data for the PCGC top 26 genes, identified as most-promising candidate disease genes on the basis of multiple bioinformatics-based criteria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We reasoned that if these criteria alone were truly informative, the majority of these genes would yield higher MI scores, overall, than observed among all 134 tested genes representing the PCGC total list. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> we observed MI values ranging across a spectrum spanning Normal (\u22646%, equivalent to nonbiased control genes), Low (7\u201330%), Medium (31\u201360%), to High (61\u2013100%). Importantly, we found that the distribution of MI values across all ranges was not significantly different for the top 26 genes compared to the entire cohort of 134 candidate genes tested (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Thus, selection of candidate CHD genes on the basis of bioinformatics criteria alone did not enrich for genes inducing more severe developmental mortality phenotypes (indicative of more genes with essential roles in either heart development, tissue maintenance, or function). This observation emphasizes the importance of screening and selecting most-promising candidate genes on the basis of functional assays. To determine if the set of 134 candidate genes in itself can be demonstrated to be enriched for heart-essential genes, we examined previously obtained data from a screen of approximately 800 <i>Drosophila</i> genes silenced using the 4XHand-Gal4; UAS-RNAi system. These genes were randomly chosen to screen for effects on pericardial nephrocyte function (cardioblast lineage cells in which the <i>Hand</i> enhancer is active), so they are unbiased with respect to essential heart roles. We found that only 6% of these genes showed <i>any level</i> of developmental lethality when silenced (i.e. 94% normal). Thus, the PCGC genomic association study, though not gene selection based upon bioinformatics criteria, did enrich significantly for heart-essential genes as assayed in <i>Drosophila</i>. That such a small number of unbiased genes conferred a phenotype of silencing-induced developmental lethality also suggests that overexpression of 4xHand-Gal4 itself did not sensitize flies to RNAi mediated knockdown effects."

From the outset, of human disease genes, approximately 25% are not represented by <i>Drosophila</i> homologs. False negatives may occur if RNAi expression does not sufficiently reduce mRNA levels. However, we tested a number of RNAi lines by qRT-PCR and found no examples of ineffective gene silencing. False negatives may also occur when missense mutations produce gain-of-function (GOF) alleles, and we cannot accurately predict the degree to which this could confound our analysis. This problem, we note, is mitigated to a degree by the fact that genes altered by GOF mutations would in many instances <i>normally</i> encode proteins with cardiac cell functions, and thus yield silencing induced phenotypes in our functional screening system. False positives can arise from so-called \u2018off target\u2019 effects of a given RNAi targeting construct. We controlled against misleading results from both RNAi silencing inefficiency and off target effects by employing the latest-generation available RNAi lines, and testing multiple such lines for each of the top 26 candidate genes. This precaution against false negative and false positive results further limited the total number of candidate genes we could screen to 134 (60% of the CHD candidate genes published by the PCGC). Nevertheless, our in vivo screening system rapidly and efficiently confirmed roles in heart development, tissue maintenance, or cardiac function for 72 candidate genes."

Increased fluorescence values represent fluorescence at t\u00a0=\u00a030 s minus t\u00a0=\u00a00, and were expressed relative to head fluorescence of control flies not expressing an RNAi targeting transgene."

Alexa Fluor 555 Phalloidin was obtained from Thermo Fisher. Mouse anti-Pericardin antibody (EC11) was used at 1:500 dilutions, followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Lab). Confocal imaging was performed with a Zeiss ApoTome.2 microscope using a 20\u00d7 Plan-Apochromat 0.8 N.A. air objective. For quantitative comparisons of intensities, common settings were chosen to avoid oversaturation. ImageJ Software Version 1.49 was used for image processing. For quantitative comparisons of cardiac myofibrillar density, cardioblast cell numbers, and Pericardin deposition we analyzed six to ten control flies and six to ten flies of each experimental genotype. These features were quantitatively assessed in the same area of the same segment in each fly. Cardiac myofiber levels of Z-stack projections were carefully selected for analysis, avoiding the ventral muscle layer underlying the heart tube. Sample size determinations were based upon extensive previous experience in analyzing fly heart morphology."

Genome-wide RNAi screens have been used previously to identify pathways important for cardiovascular development and cardiac disease in humans (e.g. Kim et al., 2010; Neely et al., 2010; van der Harst et al. 2016), so the approach itself is not particularly novel. In the design used here two RNAis for candidate CHD genes are used to knock down the <i>Dros</i> homologues of disease genes in Hand-positive cardioblasts using for the first time a multimerized (4x) Hand enhancer driving Gal4, a design that likely leads to high efficiency knockdown compared to previous approaches. A number of cardiac-related phenotypes were scored, including mortality, adult longevity, muscle fibre density, cardioblast numbers, collagen deposition, and heart tube function. The authors perform screens of the top 26 genes identified by Zaidi et al. including the genes involved in chromatin modification, as well as the larger set of candidate genes for which there were <i>Dros</i> homologues. They found a high degree of mortality associated with both sets. Interestingly, knockdown of the top 26 did not lead to more severe mortality than the larger set, potentially highlighting the limitations of bioinformatics alone in identifying the most significant players in human disease and the need to combine with functional analysis. Knockdown of a number of chromatin modifying genes were characterised in more detail. The authors conclude from these results that histone methylation but not demethylation, is essential for heart development in flies. Rescue of the <i>Dros</i> knockdown of WDR5 with the human WT gene but not the same gene carrying the candidate disease variant was also presented in a proof-of-principal study."

While all were screened for developmental lethality, only one was categorized as a \"developmentally lethal gene\". The low hit number was potentially due to inadequate RNAi-mediated knockdown relative to that afforded by the 4X-Hand driver described here. Nonetheless, involvement of ~70% of the 26 genes in cardiac development was indeed assessed, and the fact that this highly-related manuscript was not cited and the overlap clarified needs correction."

Unfortunately, excitement is severely tempered due to the use of standard P element-mediated germline transformation. First, we must assume the RNAi does not target the products of the human alleles, since no information regarding design is presented. This should be demonstrated. Second, no data related to transgene expression is given. Perhaps the WDR5-K7Q has lower expression levels than WDR5 and, hence, a distinct rescue potential? Finally, what about insertional effects? Were results consistent among multiple transgenic lines? Use of site-specific recombinase technologies and verification of equivalent transgene expression levels are recommended."

Neely et al. (2010) investigated 18/26 of these genes, many of which when silenced using a similar cardiac-specific approach, reduced lifespan. While all were screened for developmental lethality, only one was categorized as a \"developmentally lethal gene\". The low hit number was potentially due to inadequate RNAi-mediated knockdown relative to that afforded by the 4X-Hand driver described here. Nonetheless, involvement of ~70% of the 26 genes in cardiac development was indeed assessed, and the fact that this highly-related manuscript was not cited and the overlap clarified needs correction.</i>"

Unfortunately, excitement is severely tempered due to the use of standard P element-mediated germline transformation. First, we must assume the RNAi does not target the products of the human alleles, since no information regarding design is presented. This should be demonstrated. Second, no data related to transgene expression is given. Perhaps the WDR5-K7Q has lower expression levels than WDR5 and, hence, a distinct rescue potential? Finally, what about insertional effects? Were results consistent among multiple transgenic lines? Use of site-specific recombinase technologies and verification of equivalent transgene expression levels are recommended.</i>"

In fact, our gene replacement strategy involving heart-specific silencing of fly genes and simultaneous expression of normal or mutant human alleles used a <i>pUASTattB</i> vector for fixed chromosomal docking site to effect germline transformation. We have corrected the text of Materials and methods accordingly and hope that in so doing we have restored reviewer excitement. The RNAi target sequence silencing the endogenous <i>Drosophila</i> WDS gene is not expected to silence WDR5, since there is over one third of the targeting sequence are mismatch when compared to the human WDR5 sequence. In addition, phenotypic rescue effects from human cDNA expression indicated that even if silencing of human genes did occur at very low level it did not prevent our analysis, since it will have same effects to both the wild type and the mutant allele of human WDR5. Insertional effects is no longer an issue since both the wild type and the mutant allele of human WDR5 were indeed inserted to the same chromosome location and should have the same level of expression."
