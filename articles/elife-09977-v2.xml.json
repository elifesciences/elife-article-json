Here, we characterize the phylogenetic turnover of poly-adenylated transcripts in a comprehensive sampling of taxa of the mouse (genus <i>Mus</i>), spanning a phylogenetic distance of 10 Myr. Using deep RNA sequencing we find that at a given sequencing depth transcriptome coverage becomes saturated within a taxon, but keeps extending when compared between taxa, even at this very shallow phylogenetic level. Our data show a high turnover of transcriptional states between taxa and that no major transcript-free islands exist across evolutionary time. This suggests that the entire genome can be transcribed into poly-adenylated RNA when viewed at an evolutionary time scale. We conclude that any part of the non-coding genome can potentially become subject to evolutionary functionalization via <i>de novo</i> gene evolution within relatively short evolutionary time spans."

Most are expected to be non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of which some have been shown to be functional. However, the general conservation level of these additional transcripts tends to be low, which raises the question of their evolutionary turnover dynamics (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kutter et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kapusta and Feschotte, 2014</a>). They are currently receiving additional attention, since they could be a source for <i>de novo</i> gene formation via a proto-gene stage (<a href=\"#bib3\">Carvunis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Neme and Tautz, 2014</a>). It has been shown that <i>de novo</i> gene emergence shows particularly high rates in the youngest lineages (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tautz and Domazet-Loso, 2011</a>), indicating that there is high turnover of such transcripts and genes between closely related species. Indeed, comparative studies of <i>de novo</i> genes between <i>Drosophila</i> species (<a href=\"#bib36\">Palmieri et al., 2014</a>) and within <i>Drosophila</i> populations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>) have confirmed this."

Detailed analyses of specific cases of emergence of a <i>de novo</i> gene have shown that single step mutations can be sufficient to generate a stable transcript in a region that was previously not transcribed and translated (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heinen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Knowles and McLysaght, 2009</a>). The unequivocal identification of <i>de novo</i> transcript emergence can only be made in a comparison between very closely related evolutionary lineages, where orthologous genomic regions can be fully aligned, even for the neutrally evolving parts of the genome (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tautz et al., 2013</a>). While the available genome and transcriptome data for mammals and insects are sufficient to screen for specific cases of <i>de novo</i> transcript emergence, they are still too far apart of each other to allow a comprehensive genome-wide assessment. Our analysis here is therefore based on a new dataset that reflects a very shallow divergence time-frame for relatives of the house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>)."

Depending on read depth and tissue, they constitute about 2\u201312% of the common windows when assessed on a per sample basis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, most of these singletons in a given sample were re-detected in another tissue or another taxon (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), such that less than 2% are present in a given taxon (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and less than 7% cumulatively throughout the whole dataset (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We used the extended brain sample reads, split them into three non-overlapping sets of about 100 Mill reads for each taxon and constructed trees out of these sets using only the singleton reads. This is the equivalent of repeating the same experiment three times. We find indeed differences in the resulting trees, i.e. there is a measureable sampling variance. By constructing a consensus tree, we can partition the data into a variable and a common component. We find that 88% of the branch length is influenced by sampling variance, while the remaining 12% still recover the expected topology (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). When we use a read coverage of 1\u20135 for the same analysis, we find that 52% of the branch length are subject to sampling variance and for all reads combined it is 35% (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Hence, at the 100 Mill read level, we have a noticeable effect of sampling variance, but this does not erase the underlying signal. Also, the analysis in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> is based on 600 Mill reads per taxon, where sampling variance is expected to be further lowered."

To explore this possibility, we used a rarefaction approach to simulate the addition of one taxon at a time and used the curve to predict the behavior of adding more taxa than the ones in the present study. We compared this approach to a curve of increasing depth of sequencing, by taking subsets at 10% intervals to understand whether depth or taxonomic diversity have different behavior in this respect. We assume that in each species only a subset of the genome is transcribed, therefore the increase in depth of sequencing would saturate at some point below 100%. Conversely, if each taxon is transcribing slightly different portions of the genome due to a steady turnover, increasing the total number of sampled taxa should increase the saturation more than the increase that could be achieved by sequencing depth. This is indeed what we find. The addition of taxa indeed leads to a further increase in transcriptomic coverage, with a generalized linear model best describing the data as increasing in a logarithmic fashion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast, we observe an asymptotic behavior of the curve for increasing depth of sequencing, with apparent saturation reached at 84.1%, close to the 83.2% that we have already achieved (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

The significance of this additional transcription has been largely unclear and it has even been considered as noise, either biological or technical. Here we were able to trace the turnover of these extra transcripts. Our data suggest that many have sufficient stability to reflect a phylogenetic distance distribution that mimics the phylogeny of the taxa. Hence, they should not simply be considered as noise. Rather, their lifetime should be sufficient to expose them to evolutionary testing and in this way they become a substrate for <i>de novo</i> evolution of genes. On the other hand, they appear to have only a limited lifetime in case they do not acquire a function, i.e. there is also high turnover of the transcribed regions between taxa. This turnover has as a consequence that within a timespan of a few million years practically the whole genome is covered by transcription at some point in time, i.e. no major transcript-free islands exist."

Still, we expect that the turnover of transcribed regions between taxa would also apply to the other tissues and stages, i.e. evolutionary testing of new transcripts would relate to all tissues and stages. This turnover is contrasted by the set of conserved genes across taxa, for which even the expression levels may be maintained across larger evolutionary distances (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pervouchine et al., 2015</a>)."

Although this is partially influenced by sampling variance of low expressed transcripts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), this suggests that at the very short evolutionary distances (thousands of years) there is an even higher turnover of transcripts than at the longer time frames (millions of years). Such a pattern of unequal rates suggests that weak selection could act against many newly arising transcripts, such that they can exist for a short time at a population scale, but not over an extended time. Hence, we expect that the presence of such transcripts will be polymorphic at the population level, similar as it has been shown in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>). We have done a preliminary analysis of transcriptional variance between four individuals of each of the taxa and find this expectation fulfilled, but a more extensive study is required to obtain reliable data at this level."

Our data do not allow at present to speculate on how large this 'functional' fraction would be, but this could become subject to future experimental studies. It is also as yet open whether the transcripts exert their functions as RNAs or via translation products. The analysis of ribosome profiling data has shown that many RNAs that were initially classified as non-coding can be associated to ribosomes, i.e. are likely translated (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wilson and Masel, 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib3\">Carvunis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2014</a>).

Global analyses of new gene emergence trends suggest that the <i>de novo</i> evolution process has been active throughout the evolutionary history (<a href=\"#bib34\">Neme and Tautz, 2013</a>).

Library preparation was done using the Illumina TruSeq library preparation, with mRNA purification (poly-A<sup>+</sup> selection), following manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Sequencing was done in Illumina HiSeq, 2000 sequencer. Libraries for each group were tagged, pooled and sequenced in a single lane, corresponding to approximately one third of a HiSeq2000 lane. Library insert size is ~190bases and paired-end reads were 100 bases long. Additional sequencing of the brain samples was performed to identify potential limitations in depth of sequencing. For this, each brain library was sequenced on a full lane of a HiSeq2000. All library preparation and sequencing was done at the Cologne Center for Genomics (CCG).

Thus by enforcing coverage on both levels, and in all taxa at the genomic level, we reduce mapping artifacts and errors.

Mutated versions of chromosome 19 were generated with a python script by choosing to randomly substitute a given fraction of the nucleotides in the sequence in random positions along the genome. From each mutated version we simulated sequencing reads with ART (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2012</a>), with a mean fold coverage of 5x (1x standard deviation) and using the same conditions as in our main sequencing experiment (100 bp paired end reads, 190bp fragments) and the options for empirical read quality of the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer."

Reads were also mapped with Bowtie2, following default parameters except for --very-sensitive. Information about uniquely mapping reads from NGM was derived directly from the bam files and from Bowtie2 was derived from the standard error log files. From <a href=\"#Atbl1\">Appendix table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Appendix 1 figure 1</a>, we observe that NextGenMap performs extremely well with increasing divergences, and greatly outperforms the standard mapper. While the average difference between the most distant genomes analyzed is about 6%, it must be noted that fast evolving regions of the genome can quickly exceed the mean. NextGenMap is able to capture most of the regions of the genome to allow comparisons across very divergent taxa."

This allowed the control of accuracy in read placement across divergent sequences by testing the position of each read in each mapping exercise (<a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix 1 figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#Atbl2\">Appendix table 2</a>). This was done with the bedtools suite, intersecting reads from each divergent genome to the original, and counting the reads which were in the same location. Reads were allowed to be offset by 20% (80% overlap), for example in in cases where ends would not map successfully. From this we also derived comparable statistics for total uniquely mapped reads, proper paired reads, paired reads regardless of location and single reads mapped where the pair failed to map (<a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix 1 figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#Atbl3\">Appendix table 3</a>)."

In the authors' experimental design, it seems possible to call a region \"transcribed\" in taxon #1 and \"not transcribed\" in taxon #2 even if the region is in fact transcribed at exactly the same expression level in both taxa. This is because statistical fluctuation can cause even exactly the same region (even in the same taxon) to pass the simple coverage threshold (of coverage &gt;= 1 or &gt;= 5) in one sample but not another. For example, suppose a region is actually expressed at a level equivalent to a coverage of 1 read per base. With a Poisson probability of about 60%, one or more reads will fall over the position, and satisfy the \"transcribed\" threshold; with a probability of about 40%, zero reads will fall over the position, and then it will be called \"not transcribed\". The authors call the &gt;=5 read threshold \"more stringent and therefore more reliable\" but this is not correct, because it is just as prone to the problem; for a region with an expression level of 5, in about half of samples you would observe a coverage of &lt; 5 and call the region not transcribed, and in the other half you would observe a coverage of &gt;= 5 and call the same region transcribed. Of course only low-expressed regions (close to the &gt;=1 or &gt;=5 thresholds) will suffer the problem of fluctuating above and below the thresholds, but many regions are lowly expressed, and indeed this is the point in a study of \"pervasive transcription\"."

This is an alternative explanation for the authors' observation that the closely related taxa have disproportionately large distances, undermining one of the paper's main conclusions that there is larger turnover at shorter evolutionary divergence. (The fact that the tree is reasonably concordant with the expected mouse tree does suggest that there is signal in the data, though, so my expectation is that there's a mixture of artifact and signal going on.)"

For example you might seek to reject the hypothesis that e1=e2 given the observed c1, c2 (though this would only test for significant changes in expression level, not gain/loss of txn), or that e1&gt;threshold for \"on\" and e2=epsilon where epsilon is some chosen background \"off\" level.

The authors indicate that cumulatively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) ~36% present in the \"common genome\" (~70% of total genome) for each taxa is transcribed, resulting in a total of ~76% of the common genome being transcribed considering all 3 tissues of all 10 taxa. What proportion of these uniquely mapped reads correspond to annotated vs. unannotated (i.e. novel transcribed regions found in these experiments)? Are the turnover rates observed different between these two categories of genomic regions? If they are different is the turnover rate observed driven by one or the other regions? This seems important since the underlying assumption seems to be that the novel regions (i.e. as yet unannotated regions) are driving the rapid turning. Additionally, do the <i>de novo</i> transcripts that survive this turnover possess more coding or non-coding characteristics? If they are non-coding mostly, are there \"observations\" that can be made about the evolution of genomes as being driven by the ongoing emergence of non-coding genes?"

If less well expressed loci exist, they will also contribute to the singleton counts, each detected with lower probability.

But the reason that the probability of detecting a locus transcribed at 1 read/100M reads in a sample of 600M reads is high is that the expected number of reads is 6. Under the authors' assumptions, the Poisson probability of detecting a singleton in a 100M read sample is 40% (40% probability of 0 counts, 40% of 1 count, 20% of &gt;1 count). The Poisson probability of detecting a singleton in a 600M read sample is 15% (5% probability of detecting 0 counts; 15% of 1 count; 80% of &gt;1 count; mean expected number of counts = 6). Thus if the authors' assumptions are correct, the number of singletons should <i>decrease</i> in a larger sample, not increase. Indeed, this is what saturation means! Instead, the data in Appendix 2 consistently show <i>more</i> singletons in the 300M sample than the 100M sample.

Oddly, though they get very good \"fits\", with \"expected\" counts almost exactly equal to observed counts \u2013 how could this be? It took me a while to figure this out. First, note that if these were really \"expected\" vs. \"observed\" counts, the observed counts c would have sampling errors of about sqrt(c), about +-700 here; it's a red flag that the agreement between \"expected\" and \"observed\" is far too good. What's happening is that the authors' \"expected\" counts aren't really expected counts under a model. Instead what the authors are doing (I believe) is a numerical fit to the observed data: given observed counts a1 and a2, from sample sizes n1 and n2, they ask if they can fit an unknown \"predicted number in sample\", N, that satisfies both a1/N = 1 \u2013 (1-x)^n1 and a2/N = 1-(1-x)^n2. Because they can fit N, they conclude that the data are \"compatible\" with their conclusion that there is a \"minimum\" (actually, the analysis requires it to be constant, not just minimal; see above) expression level of ~1 read/100M reads. The trouble with this analysis (which, again, is set up wrong in the first place), and the reason that it appears to work, is that if n2/n1 &gt; a2/a1, I believe you can <i>always</i> find a \"predicted number in sample\" N that satisfies the two (inappropriate) cumulative binomial distribution equations. That is, the fit shows nothing other than the fact that the number of singletons is increasing slower than the increase in sample size, which is expected under <i>any possible model</i>. It does not say anything about the minimum concentration t. Indeed, again, the fact that the number of singletons is increasing, not decreasing, as we go from 100M to 300M sample size says that we are not at saturation, and the 300M sample is starting to detect singletons at even lower-expressed loci."

But there are two things about <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> that reduce my confidence in the authors' conclusions about it. One is that if we extrapolate the other direction (to lower coverage), the authors' model fit predicts that with no sequencing reads at all (the y intercept of the graph at x=0), 40% of the genome is detected by (nonexistent) sequencing reads with coverage of &gt;= 1 read! If the model fit can't extrapolate safely to low coverage, I'm not sure why I would trust its extrapolations to high coverage. Second, the authors comment that the standard deviations on the data points in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> are \"too small to display\". To obtain a standard deviation, you have to make measurements on multiple independent samples. The top data point is measured on all the data \u2013 I believe there is only one measurement, which is why the std deviation is too small to display (it's zero). The other data points are measured (I understand) on subsets of the data. For any depth &gt;0.5, the measurements cannot be independent (because to get measurements at depth 0.5 of the total, you can only split the data in half, to get two independent measurements). This will result in underestimating the variance. Small shifts in those data points could lead to a different appearance of whether these data are saturating or not, and I suspect something like that is going on."

I think the authors need to rethink how they're doing their data analysis. I think the only way to do it is to look for loci that have statistically significantly increased expression in one taxon relative to another. Differential analysis of RNA-seq gene expression data is a well understood area, with good existing methods, and I think one of them could be used in a redesigned analytic strategy here."

If instead there is a small sampling artifact, they will see \"novel transcription\" for low-level expressed regions, created merely by sampling variation between replicates. I suggested this control in the previous review; I do not understand the authors' response. They say they can't do it because they \"cannot use different individuals\". The idea of a replicate control (in this case) is to take multiple samples from the same individuals/same taxon.

The authors say that \"the analogous analysis is done in our use of the brain samples at 100M vs. 300M read depth in Appendix 2\". I don't understand that response either, because nothing in Appendix 2 measures the false positive rate of \"detected transcription\" between different sequence read samples of the same size from the same source. They could, for example, given an even deeper sample (1200M reads, for example), compare 600M to 600M subsets to see how much novel transcription they see, to try to validate their analysis at a 600M sample size. It might also be possible to use bootstrap resampling statistics, resampling the 600M with replacement, which could be done without needing more sequencing depth."

In agreement to previous published results, the authors find that majority of the genome is transcriptionally active. By focusing on the portions of the genomes that are shared across the taxa studied they find that many of these regions are commonly transcribed across multiple taxa. They are capable of recapitulating the phylogenic tree, counteracting the common view that most of these lowly transcribed regions are mostly biological and technical noise. The evidence that pervasive transcription might be a resource to promote non-functional regions to selection is a valuable finding."

However, as one of the reviewers points out, 7% of the 200bp windows are singletons (only contain a single read supporting transcription), suggesting many windows are right at the threshold of detectability. Nonetheless, the authors show that the lowly transcribed regions are able to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of the taxa, indicating that the biological signal is significantly higher than any technical noise due to sequencing depth and thresholding. We believe that despite the limitations of the saturation analysis with respect to sequencing depth being important, in the revision of the manuscript this area has been modified, but some technical details remain that do not help the authors\u2019 arguments (maybe remnants of the first submission)."

In the authors' experimental design, it seems possible to call a region \"transcribed\" in taxon #1 and \"not transcribed\" in taxon #2 even if the region is in fact transcribed at exactly the same expression level in both taxa. This is because statistical fluctuation can cause even exactly the same region (even in the same taxon) to pass the simple coverage threshold (of coverage &gt;= 1 or &gt;= 5) in one sample but not another. For example, suppose a region is actually expressed at a level equivalent to a coverage of 1 read per base. With a Poisson probability of about 60%, one or more reads will fall over the position, and satisfy the \"transcribed\" threshold; with a probability of about 40%, zero reads will fall over the position, and then it will be called \"not transcribed\". The authors call the &gt;=5 read threshold \"more stringent and therefore more reliable\" but this is not correct, because it is just as prone to the problem; for a region with an expression level of 5, in about half of samples you would observe a coverage of &lt; 5 and call the region not transcribed, and in the other half you would observe a coverage of &gt;= 5 and call the same region transcribed. Of course only low-expressed regions (close to the &gt;=1 or &gt;=5 thresholds) will suffer the problem of fluctuating above and below the thresholds, but many regions are lowly expressed, and indeed this is the point in a study of \"pervasive transcription\".</i> "

The equation P = 1-(1-x)^n gives (as the authors correctly say) \"the probability for finding a read at least once among n total reads\" \u2013 this is a cumulative distribution, P(counts &gt;= 1). The authors then compare this to the number of singletons: which is the number of windows with exactly one mapped read, P(counts = 1). The number of windows with exactly one mapped read is not calculated by the authors' equation; it would instead be calculated by the binomial distribution for P(counts=1), n * x * (1-x)^(n-1). Second, you cannot extrapolate this calculation to the total number of expected singletons in the 100M or 300M read sample unless you assume that all loci are expressed at the same low level t. This is obviously not the case. For starters, known coding genes are expressed at far higher levels. If less well expressed loci exist, they will also contribute to the singleton counts, each detected with lower probability. The authors' analysis assumes that all loci have the same expression level t and therefore no lower expressed loci exist.

But the reason that the probability of detecting a locus transcribed at 1 read/100M reads in a sample of 600M reads is high is that the expected number of reads is 6. Under the authors' assumptions, the Poisson probability of detecting a singleton in a 100M read sample is 40% (40% probability of 0 counts, 40% of 1 count, 20% of &gt;1 count). The Poisson probability of detecting a singleton in a 600M read sample is 15% (5% probability of detecting 0 counts; 15% of 1 count; 80% of &gt;1 count; mean expected number of counts = 6). Thus if the authors' assumptions are correct, the number of singletons should decrease in a larger sample, not increase. Indeed, this is what saturation means!

In agreement to previous published results, the authors find that majority of the genome is transcriptionally active. By focusing on the portions of the genomes that are shared across the taxa studied they find that many of these regions are commonly transcribed across multiple taxa. They are capable of recapitulating the phylogenic tree, counteracting the common view that most of these lowly transcribed regions are mostly biological and technical noise. The evidence that pervasive transcription might be a resource to promote non-functional regions to selection is a valuable finding. The criticisms raised by the reviewers are mostly reasonable. Indeed, some of the analyses presented by the paper, especially the saturation of sequencing depth, are not as robust as they could be. The authors claim that the fraction of the genome transcribed should saturate with increasing sequencing depth at approximately 85%. However, as one of the reviewers points out, 7% of the 200bp windows are singletons (only contain a single read supporting transcription), suggesting many windows are right at the threshold of detectability. Nonetheless, the authors show that the lowly transcribed regions are able to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of the taxa, indicating that the biological signal is significantly higher than any technical noise due to sequencing depth and thresholding. We believe that despite the limitations of the saturation analysis with respect to sequencing depth being important, in the revision of the manuscript this area has been modified, but some technical details remain that do not help the authors\u2019 arguments (maybe remnants of the first submission).</i> "
