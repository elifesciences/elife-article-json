However, because muscle performance is constrained by trade-offs between contraction speed and force, it is unclear how animals evolve the ability to produce both unusually fast appendage movement <i>and</i> limb force needed for locomotion. To address this issue, we compare the twitch speeds of forelimb muscles in a group of volant passerine birds, which produce different courtship displays. Our results show that the two taxa that perform exceptionally fast wing displays have evolved 'superfast' contractile kinetics in their main humeral retractor muscle. By contrast, the two muscles that generate the majority of aerodynamic force for flight show unmodified contractile kinetics. Altogether, these results suggest that muscle-specific adaptations in contractile speed allow certain birds to circumvent the intrinsic trade-off between muscular speed and force, and thereby use their forelimbs for both rapid gestural displays and powered locomotion."

From male fiddler crabs waving their claws to attract females, to the leaping dances of whooping cranes, these displays often involve remarkably fast limb movements. However, in many cases it is puzzling how animals can perform these behaviors, because the muscles that move the limbs are often geared to produce strength for walking, running or flying, and not speed. Indeed, decades of research in animal physiology has confirmed that limb-moving muscles can contract with either great strength or great speed, but never both."

In fact, this muscle can move the wing at speeds that are more than twice as fast as those required for these birds to fly, and appears to be the fastest limb muscle on record for any animal with a backbone. Fuxjager et al. also show that the manakins\u2019 other wing muscles are no different from other birds, and suggest that these muscles are preserved to produce the strength needed for flying."

Little is understood about how these displays evolve, and their emergence represents a functional feat in animal design (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fuxjager and Schlinger, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Irschick et al., 2007</a>). Most physical displays, for example, involve rapid limb movements, which are controlled by the same neuro-motor architecture that governs the otherwise 'normal' movements used to power locomotion. However, because motor performance is constrained by a trade-off between muscle contraction force and speed (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rome et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Young and Rome, 2001</a>), limb muscles should in theory be unable to generate <i>both</i> the swift appendage movements incorporated in showy physical displays <i>and</i> the force needed to drive locomotion (<a href=\"#bib39\">Young and Rome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rome and Lindstedt, 1998</a>). How, then, do limb motor systems and their underlying musculature control extraordinarily fast limb movements necessary for the production of adaptive behavioral displays?"

Trade-offs between muscle force and contraction speed clearly exist in the wing muscles of birds within this size range (<a href=\"#bib6\">Biewener, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Biewener and Roberts, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Biewener et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dial and Biewener, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hedrick et al., 2003</a>), and evidence suggests that such muscles maintain sufficient force-generating abilities to power flight and regulate flying speeds (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biewener et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dial and Biewener, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hedrick et al., 2003</a>). Of the species we study, however, both golden-collared (<i>Manacus vitellinus</i>) and red-capped manakins (<i>Ceratopipra mentalis</i>) produce exceptionally rapid wing movements as part of their acrobatic courtship displays (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bostwick and Prum, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fusani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fuxjager et al., 2013</a>). For example, male golden-collared manakins perform <i>roll-snaps</i>, whereby they hit their wings together above their backs at \u224860\u2009Hz to produce a loud mechanical sonation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fusani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fuxjager et al., 2013</a>). Kinematic analyses suggest that this behavior is performed by elevating the opened (extended) wings and then by repeatedly retracting the wings to force the wrists to collide in quick succession (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bostwick and Prum, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fusani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fuxjager et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, male red-capped manakins produce a similar wing sonation called a <i>clap</i>, in which the wings are laterally extended slightly above the body and then immediately retracted back to the sides (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bostwick and Prum, 2003</a>). <i>Claps</i> are also produced in rapid succession, with the wing-extension and wing-retraction phases occurring at \u224845\u2009Hz (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bostwick and Prum, 2003</a>). In both species, the wing oscillation frequencies used for courtship displays exceed those that similarly sized birds use for flight (\u224825\u201330\u2009Hz) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Donovan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pennycuick, 2001</a>); thus, the forelimb motor system is likely modified to actuate courtship movements, while preserving the force-generating ability needed to drive powered locomotion. However, the nature of these modifications has never been explored."

This idea is rooted in the kinematic studies that suggest that retraction of the wings is a major feature of the <i>roll-snap</i> and <i>clap</i>. Building on this notion, we expect that the other primary wing muscles that supply the main force for forelimb movement during flight are unmodified. To test our hypothesis, we therefore measure twitch contraction frequencies in situ from the three main wing muscles: (<i>i</i>) the <i>supracoracoideus</i> (SC), which raises the wing by elevating the humerus; (<i>ii</i>) the <i>pectoralis</i> (PEC), which lowers the wing by depressing the humerus, and (<i>iii</i>) the <i>scapulohumeralis caudalis</i> (SH), which retracts the wing via the humerus [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Biewener, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">Dial, 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Dial et al., 1991</a>]. Because the SH acts as the main wing retractor and generates the least aerodynamic force necessary for powered flight, we predict that its contractile kinetics are significantly increased in golden-collared and red-capped manakins, compared to the SC and PEC. In this vein, we predict that these latter two muscles show similar contractile kinetics, as they appear to contribute less to the rapid wing movements that are incorporated into these two birds\u2019 displays. Inasmuch, these muscles are likely more constrained by natural selection to generate aerodynamic force for powered flight (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biewener et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dial and Biewener, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hedrick et al., 2003</a>)."

The first of these is the blue-crowned manakin (<i>Lepidothrix coronata</i>), which is a close relative of the aforementioned manakins and produces an elaborate physical display without rapid wing-snaps or wing-flicks (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dur\u00e3es, 2009</a>). The second species is the dusky antbird (<i>Cercomarca tyrannica</i>), which inhabits the same niche as the manakins described above but produces elaborate vocalizations in lieu of a physical display (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morton and Derrickson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Morton, 2000</a>). The last bird is the house wren (<i>Troglodytes aedon</i>), a more distant relative within the same avian order that sings to attract mates and does not produce a robust physical display (<a href=\"#bib23\">Johnson and Kermott, 1991</a>). These comparisons collectively provide a framework for evaluating how the muscular properties that control twitch frequencies vary across species, and whether rapid wing maneuvering used for courtship is related to this variation. Therefore, based on our hypothesis described above, we predict that rapid kinetics of a humeral retractor muscle will be absent from blue-crowned manakins, dusky antbirds, and house wrens, as these species do not produce rapid wing maneuvers as part of their courtship displays."

For each muscle, we therefore compared the half-relaxation frequency among species (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D,E and F</a>). This measure is the regression models\u2019 estimate of intrinsic contractile behavior, and it is defined as the maximum stimulation frequency at which the muscle\u2019s percent relaxation is half of its predicted functional range (see Methods for further details). We used this measure because it provides a consistent and unbiased metric by which we can compare muscle contraction speeds across birds. For both the PEC and the SC, half-relaxation frequencies averaged \u224850\u2009Hz and were indistinguishable among species (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, PEC: <i>F<sub>4,10\u00a0</sub></i>=\u00a00.85, p\u00a0=\u00a00.53; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, SC: <i>F<sub>4,11\u00a0</sub></i>=\u00a01.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.39).

Kinematic studies suggest that these species generate their wing sonations by moving their forelimbs at frequencies of 55\u201363\u2009Hz and 45\u2009Hz, respectively (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bostwick and Prum, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fusani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fuxjager et al., 2013</a>). Our results show that these rates fall well within the range of stimulation frequencies at which significant recovery of the SH is observed (at least 85%), and we find that\u00a0individual stimulations are accompanied by observable\u00a0wing movements. In addition, these same kinematic studies suggest that the bulk of the rapid forearm movement is driven by repetitive humeral retraction, and such movement of the wing is fully consistent with the biomechanical role of the SH (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dial, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dial et al., 1991</a>).

Therefore, one intriguing possibility is that other wing muscles, like the 'slower' SC and PEC, also contribute to display production by helping position the wings (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fusani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schlinger et al., 2013</a>). In doing so, these muscles may limit the overall speed with which a given maneuver can be performed, owing to the effects of natural selection that presumably preserve these tissues\u2019 force-generating properties for powered flight (see below). If this is the case, then display speed itself may be constrained by neural circuits that integrate and/or coordinate the activation of numerous forearm motor units, as opposed to only the speed of the SH."

This, in effect, is rooted in our finding that muscle twitch speeds are modified in the SH, but not the SC or PEC. Rather, the latter two muscles maintain half-relaxation rates of \u224850\u2009Hz, which are similar to the half-relaxation frequencies of all three muscles in the non-wing-displaying blue-crowned manakin, dusky antbird, and house wren. Thus, in golden-collared and red-capped manakins, the SC and PEC twitch speeds are largely conserved, which means that the ability of these muscles to generate aerodynamic force needed for powered flight is not compromised by the mutually exclusive ability to contract rapidly (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rome et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Young and Rome, 2001</a>). Flight in these two manakins is therefore unencumbered (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moore et al., 2008</a>). To this end, this model is consistent with the biomechanical role of the SH, which contributes to aerodynamic force by adjusting the wings\u2019 angle of attack, area, and/or camber (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dial, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dial et al., 1991</a>). The SH therefore likely contributes least to the generation of power for flight, and thus presents more opportunity for evolutionary modification without severely compromising flight ability. To our knowledge, this is the first glimpse into how evolution might circumvent trade-offs between muscle contraction speed and force generation to favor the emergence of rapid appendage displays, while maintaining normal locomotion."

Past work shows that both golden-collared and red-capped manakins are strong fliers, relative to other similarly sized tropical birds (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moore et al., 2008</a>). This result indicates that dramatically enhancing the contraction speed of the SH does not altogether impede or diminish locomotion. However, studies have noted that both of these species produce a muffled fluttering sound when they fly (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bostwick and Prum, 2003</a>). It is unclear if this sound, like the other sonations these birds produce, is a sexual signal, or whether it is a by-product of physiological and/or biomechanical adaptations that enable elaborate courtship maneuvering. If the latter is true, then our results might provide a mechanism for such action, as the ability of the SH to appropriately control wing positioning (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dial, 1992</a>) might be altered by this muscle\u2019s performance shift. With this in mind,\u00a0it will be interesting to pursue putative 'costs' of sacrificing force for speed in the SH, but not the SC and PEC."

Thus, our study provides evidence not only for the emergence of the fastest known vertebrate limb muscle, but also a unique evolutionary design of the forelimb muscular system that enables <i>both</i> rapid movement for displaying and force-generating movement for locomotion."

Contraction-relaxation speed within a stimulus period was assessed by measuring the degree to which each muscle relaxed relative to its un-stimulated length (i.e., percent recovery) in response to different frequencies of electrical stimulation (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). All muscles were subjected to the following stimulation frequencies: 10\u2009Hz, 20\u2009Hz, 30\u2009Hz, 40\u2009Hz, 50\u2009Hz, 60\u2009Hz, 70\u2009Hz, 80\u2009Hz, 90\u2009Hz, and 100\u2009Hz.

Stimulation trains were always delivered from low frequency (10\u2009Hz) to high frequency (100\u2009Hz).

For all preparations, birds were restrained on a soft foam pad that was securely attached to the surgical bench. Birds were then anesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20134% in O<sub>2</sub>). To prepare the PEC and SH, we first cut a small (1 cm) incision in the skin. We then exposed the moist surface of the muscle by gently pushing apart the skin. Once the muscle was in clear view, we implanted it with the stripped ends (1\u20132\u00a0mm) of two insulated silver wire electrodes (diameter: 0.14 mm). These electrodes were then connected to a nearby stimulator (Model 2100, A-M Systems, WA, USA). We next fastened a stainless steel hook (0.1 mm diameter) to the muscle directly adjacent to the\u00a0implanted electrodes. This hook was connected through a monofilament line to a force transducer (Model FT03, Grass Technology, RI, USA), which was tightly clamped to a heavy stand (\u22486\u2009kg). As soon as this preparation was completed, we placed a drop of normal avian saline (0.9%) over the exposed muscles to prevent tissues desiccation during the\u00a0recording session. We adjusted the slack in the line to the force transducer by slightly moving the heavy stand; this allowed us to maintain tension in the line between the muscle and force transducer, and thus optimize the sensitivity of muscle twitch recordings without overloading the force transducer signal. When the recordings were completed, the electrodes and monofilament line from the force transducer were removed from the muscle, and the incision was closed using Vetbond tissue adhesive. All surgical preparations occurred at room temperature, which was similar to the outside ambient temperature (\u224830\u00b0C)."

First, we cut a small (1.5 cm) incision in the skin above the furcula. We then gently moved aside the underlying fat-pad and exposed the inter-clavicular air-sac. To gain access to the SC, we carefully moved the membrane of this air-sac to the side, taking great caution not to puncture it. From this angle, we could then see the SC positioned above the keel and below the PEC. We quickly implanted the SC muscle with the stripped ends of the silver electrodes, and allowed the inter-clavicular air-sac to fall back into position. Finally, we gently moved the fat pad back over the furcula to prevent desiccation during the recordings and placed a small drop of normal avian saline over this tissue. Given the deep (and difficult) position of the SC, it was not possible to fasten the hook from the force transducer directly to the muscle for twitch speed recordings. Instead, we attached the hook to the bird\u2019s elbow, and recorded the action of the stimulated SC as movement of the wing. When recordings were completed, we lightly pulled the electrodes from the muscle, removed the force transducer line from the elbow, and closed the dissection with Vetbond glue."

We collected all recordings in AviSoft-RECORDER (v.4.2.22) and measured the data in Praat software (v.5.4.21, P. Boersma and D. Weenink). This was accomplished by measuring the percentage at which muscles relax after each stimulatory pulse within a given stimulation train. Complete muscle relaxation (100% relaxation) occurred when the extra tension detected by the force transducer in response to stimulation was fully relieved (i.e., the signal returned to its baseline level). Partial muscle relaxation occurred when the extra tension placed on the force transducer in response to stimulation was <i>less than</i> fully relieved (i.e., summation occurred). Inasmuch, the values of partial relaxation ranged between 99% and 0% (full fusion) and were calculated by dividing the actual amount of relaxation by the amount of relaxation that would otherwise be necessary for full recovery."

One exception to this analysis occurred in red-capped manakins, as 20\u2009Hz stimulations elicited 100% recovery in all cases. Variation across biological replicates is therefore 0.0, which means that statistics cannot be performed. We interpret these results to indicate no significant difference in muscle recovery in response to 20\u2009Hz stimulations before or after the experimental series, which is entirely consistent with the results of the paired <i>t</i>-tests obtained from the other species (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

This type of model characterizes data that form a reverse sigmoidal curve, and it is widely used to assess a variety of biological functions [e.g., <a href=\"#bib25\">Kent et al., 1972</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson et al., 2003</a>]. We constrained model thresholds at or below 100% (maximum possible percent relaxation) and model saturations at or above 0% (minimum possible percent recovery). Each model produced an estimated inflection point (\u00b1 1 SEM), which represents the muscle\u2019s half-relaxation frequency. This metric is defined as the stimulation frequency at which the muscle\u2019s average recovery equals half of its predicted functional range. The half-relaxation point is biologically significant, in that it represents a change in muscle length that is still highly effective in actuating movement of the appendage (wing). This was validated in all species by watching the wings move in response to such stimulations (also see Results). Thus, at the level of muscle fusions associated with the half-relaxation frequency, generation of the display behavior is still highly feasible. To this end, we statistically compared models and their estimates of half-relaxation frequency only within muscle type, considering that differences in the preparations of the separate muscles might affect model parameters. Therefore, we used extra sum-of-squares tests to compare models across species and one-way ANOVAs to compare half-relaxation frequencies across species. Significant effects from ANOVAs were followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post-hoc comparisons to control for multiple pairwise contrasts."

In this regard, please note that our muscle recordings were performed in situ, such that the muscle was never removed from the bird. Our methodology is relatively more straightforward than many studies that collect muscle twitch speeds in vitro. We realize that fact, which is subtle but important, may have been lost in the paper, and we therefore have added statements in the Introduction (third paragraph) and Results (subsections \u201cValidation of in situ muscle twitch recordings\u201d and \u201cSpecies differences in forelimb muscle twitch speed dynamics\u201d) that specifically state that muscle recordings were collected in situ."
