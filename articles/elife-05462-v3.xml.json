                    "text": "Aneuploidy is linked to myriad diseases but also facilitates organismal evolution. It remains unclear how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve. Although laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, we show here that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes, to show that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10\u201330% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations\u2014but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. We find that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Our work presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution."

It remains unclear how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve. Although laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, we show here that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes, to show that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10\u201330% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations\u2014but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. We find that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Our work presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution."

Earlier studies suggested that these cells fail to grow properly if they contain extra copies of chromosomes. Now, Hose et al. have studied nearly 50 wild strains of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. In these, extra copies of chromosomes are commonplace, and seemingly have no detrimental effect on growth. Instead, Hose et al. found that cells with too many copies of a gene use many of those genes less often than would be expected. This process is known as \u2018dosage compensation\u2019.

The genomic era has largely borne out that hypothesis, and many studies have characterized the outcomes of whole and partial genome amplification (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jaillon et al., 2009</a>). The immediate consequence of duplication is assumed to be increased expression of the affected genes, and in some cases the increased expression provides a selective advantage (e.g., <a href=\"#bib59\">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Edi et al., 2014</a>).

However, aneuploidy comes with a fitness cost, most famously in cases of human aneuploidies such as Down syndrome (DS) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antonarakis et al., 2004</a>). The reasons for aneuploidy toxicity are not entirely clear but may be due to increased expression from genes that are toxic when overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib63\">Siegel and Amon, 2012</a>). Several studies have used <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as a model for aneuploidy syndromes, since laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to chromosomal amplification. Laboratory strains with forced aneuploidy are extremely slow growing, regardless of the chromosome amplified (<a href=\"#bib68\">Torres et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pavelka et al., 2010</a>). Transcriptomic and proteomic studies in these strains reported proportionately higher expression from virtually all amplified genes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Torres et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pavelka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Torres et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sheltzer et al., 2012</a>), with a handful of exceptions recently identified at the protein level (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dephoure et al., 2014</a>). The apparent lack of dosage compensation is consistent with another study by <a href=\"#bib65\">Springer et al. (2010)</a>, which found that expression at hemizygous genes is not up-regulated to compensate for reduced gene copy. While these studies have generated important results on aneuploidy intolerance in these particular strains, one caveat is that they were all done in laboratory strains, which have lost many features inherent in wild strains (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kvitek et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lewis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lewis and Gasch, 2012</a>).

The higher incidence of Chr 8 amplification may reflect a higher frequency of mitotic error, since diploid mutation-accumulation (MA) lines propagated in the near-absence of selection amplify Chr 8 at a higher rate (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>)."

Furthermore, natural aneuploids showed no significant growth reduction compared to closely related euploid reference strains (p = 0.19, paired T-test), although there was a slight negative correlation between growth rate and extra DNA content (R = \u22120.3, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This is in stark contrast to aneuploid laboratory strains, which show extreme growth retardation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Torres et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pavelka et al., 2010</a> and below). We also found that chromosomal amplification was stable for &gt;200\u2013400 generations in four interrogated wild strains, whereas the W303 laboratory strain generally loses aneuploidy within 20 generations. To distinguish if the tolerant strains have adapted to aneuploidy or if non-W303 strains can inherently accommodate chromosome amplification, we selected aneuploid derivatives of several naturally euploid parents (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We found little to no growth defect in derived aneuploid strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

However, we detected a weak signature common to several aneuploid strains, including the up-regulation of 69 unamplified genes (enriched for oxidoreductases) and reduced expression of 269 unamplified genes (strongly enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal protein (RP) genes and genes involved in respiration) in at least three of the six aneuploid strains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We tested the respiratory capabilities of naturally aneuploid yeast with variable chromosome copy number and found no growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In contrast, a diploid W303 strain trisomic for Chr 12 (\u2018W303_Chr12-3n\u2019) displayed an exacerbated growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources, and we were unable to make the tetrasomic W303_Chr12-4n strain that retained its mitochondrial genome, despite numerous backcrossing attempts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

New mutations, through adaptation or drift, could heritably reduce expression at toxic amplified genes. Alternatively, wild strains may actively down-regulate expression in proportion to gene dose, known as dosage compensation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated isogenic aneuploid\u2013euploid strain pairs for three wild strains. We isolated euploid derivatives of strain T73_Chr8-4n (denoting four copies of Chr 8 in the diploid strain) and YJM428_Chr16-4n by serial passaging for many generations. We also used drug-based selection to isolate a mutant of naturally euploid oak-soil strain YPS163 in which Chr 8 was amplified (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We then conducted duplicate RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in the isogenic aneuploid\u2013euploid pairs and identified genes on Chr 8 or Chr 16 with lower-than-expected expression, as above. Because the strains are nominally isogenic (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), most expression differences between the strain pairs are an active response to the aneuploidy."

One possibility is that the genes are mis-classified or are affected by both heritably reduced expression and a mode of dosage compensation\u2014while the latter was true for a handful of the NCYC110 genes, most displayed high membership in Class 2a and had a slope and fit that was inconsistent with dosage compensation.

Our results show that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression. The reduced expression is in part due to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes, some of which may have been selected for during the adaptation to aneuploidy. But reduced expression of other amplified genes\u2014up to 30\u201336% in some strains\u2014appears to be actively regulated in proportion to increased gene dosage. The prevalence of the dosage compensation found here is likely true for other species and may explain the lack of expression increase previously noted for amplified autosomal genes in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antonarakis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schuster-Bockler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Woodwark and Bateman, 2011</a>)."

While we did not find overwhelming support for the balance hypothesis, dosage compensated genes include several multi-subunit protein complexes and pathways. In the case of RP genes, dosage compensation most likely occurs via feedback to modulate mRNA abundance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Feedback is known to occur for several RP genes, including excess, unassembled L32 that binds a stem loop structure in its own transcript and inhibits intron splicing, perhaps triggering mRNA degradation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dabeva and Warner, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Vilardell and Warner, 1997</a>). Our results imply that feedback pertains more broadly to other RP genes, including <i>RPL15A</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)\u2014notably, this transcript lacks an intron and thus must utilize a mechanism distinct from <i>RPL32</i>. The mechanism of dosage compensation at nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes is less clear; however, several mitochondrial proteins are known to regulate translation or stability of other transcripts in shared pathways. For example, unassembled Cox1 protein can suppress translation of the <i>COX1</i> transcript (<a href=\"#bib70\">Van Loon et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mick et al., 2011</a>), while several TCA-cycle enzymes double as RNA-binding proteins that report on TCA activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elzinga et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Jong et al., 2000</a>). A mode of dosage compensation that functions at the level of transcript abundance may provide an additional level of regulation to control protein stoichiometry."

We did observe a common expression response in different aneuploid strains, including the up-regulation of oxidoreductases and the down-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial translation and respiration. Interestingly, these trends are also seen in DS cells, which are extremely sensitive to reactive-oxygen species (ROS), and perhaps consequently, down-regulate mitochondrial respiration that in turn limits ROS production (<a href=\"#bib29\">Helguera et al., 2013</a>). We found no defect in respiratory capacity in naturally aneuploid yeast, and so the implications of this response in yeast are not clear. Human patients display significant variability in their sensitivity to DS, suggesting genetic effects on DS pathologies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Roper and Reeves, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Prandini et al., 2007</a>). Our results also implicate strain-specific responses to Chr 8 amplification, in particular in the genes subject to dosage compensation vs heritably reduced expression. While some of the Class 2a genes could be mis-classified, these results raise the possibility of natural genetic variation in dosage compensation."

Whole and partial chromosome amplification is common in laboratory selection experiments (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dunham et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gresham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yona et al., 2012</a>) and is particularly prevalent in laboratory mutants that have an extreme fitness defect (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hughes et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koszul et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rancati et al., 2008</a>). Yet the <i>Saccharomycotina</i> karyotype is extremely stable, holding at eight or sixteen chromosomes in most pre- and post-genome duplication species, respectively. This suggests that aneuploidy may serve as a transient intermediate, one that can be readily generated\u2014and readily lost\u2014depending on the selective pressures. <a href=\"#bib77\">Yona et al. (2012)</a> showed that selection for increased stress tolerance in the laboratory produced aneuploid strains that eventually gave way to other solutions even when the selective pressure persisted. Our results show that aneuploidy is frequent and tolerated in nature and may provide an important route toward natural genetic variation."

                                "text": "A novel MLR model was developed to classify genes based on their expression across the two wild-strain panels. Preprocessed mRNA and DNA abundance data were analyzed further in the context of a new mixture of linear regressions (MLR) model in order to cluster genes according to their DNA/mRNA relationship. Within a given strain panel we modeled the relationship between DNA abundance at gene g from sample i, say X<sub>g,i</sub>, and mRNA abundance Y<sub>g,i</sub>, where both are normalized to euploid controls and considered on the logarithmic scale. Briefly, we first filtered genes that exhibited a nonlinear relationship using a likelihood ratio test (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). The interpretation of these profiles is not clear and therefore they were removed from further consideration. Data from the remaining genes, which exhibited a linear relationship Y<sub>g,i</sub> = A<sub>g</sub> + B<sub>g</sub> X<sub>g,i</sub> + error<sub>g,i,</sub> were fit to a discrete, random-effects mixture model in order to produce a relationship classifier (<a href=\"#bib46\">McLachlan and Peel, 2000</a>). In the proposed MLR model, the five discrete classes correspond to constraints on the intercept \u03b1 and slope \u03b2 parameters of the linear regression: (Class 1) \u03b1<sub>g</sub> = 0, \u03b2<sub>g</sub> = 1, (Class 2a) \u03b1<sub>g</sub> &lt; 0, \u03b2<sub>g</sub> = 1, (Class 2b) \u03b1<sub>g</sub> &gt; 0, \u03b2 = 1, (Class 3a) \u03b2 &lt; 1, (Class 3b) \u03b2<sub>g</sub> &gt; 1. Class 1 represents genes with no dosage compensation and statistically indistinguishable expression between the 2n strain and paired euploid control. Class 2 represents genes whose expression increases linearly across the strain panel, but whose expression in the aneuploid derivatives is lower (Class 2a) or higher (Class 2b) per gene copy than the paired euploid. In contrast, Class 3 genes show expression changes across the strain panel that are disproportionate to the change in DNA copy, either showing lower (Class 3a) or greater (Class 3b) expression per gene copy as the aneuploidy increases. The inference is stabilized by treating the gene-specific slopes and intercepts as random effects that are constrained by the class structure; this effectively reduces the dimension of the parameter space. Fortuitously, explicit formula is available for the probability density of data within each class. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate the MLR parameters; subsequently, genes were clustered together if they had a high posterior probability of arising from the same discrete class. Genes were classified based on the maximum posterior probability (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Further details are provided in Appendix 1. Unamplified genes in the two strain panels that displayed linear increases in expression in proportion to the amplified chromosome copy number were identified based on the probability of linear fit in R, using Benjamini and Hochberg multiple test correction (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</a>)."

V<sub>m</sub> was taken as the variance in expression across MA lines generated in the absence of selection by (<a href=\"#bib34\">Landry et al., 2007</a>). The ratio of V<sub>g</sub>/V<sub>m</sub> represents the effects of mutation + selection as measured in natural strains vs the effects of mutation in the near absence of selection as measured in MA lines. CNV data were taken from (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dunn et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carreto et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dunn et al., 2012</a>), which measured gene copy number by aCGH. Strains whose aCGH profiles were correlated &gt;0.9 were represented by a single, randomly chosen strain, to avoid over-representing strains that are highly related. This left 103 strains with aCGH values for each gene. Amplified genes were identified if the relative gene abundance was at least 1.6\u00d7 higher than the S288c reference. Genes that showed CNV in at least one of the 103 strains were compared in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>. To calculate <i>B</i><sub><i>v</i></sub>, a measure of the buffering capacity of each gene, we summed the number of strains in which the gene was amplified, weighted by the aCGH similarity weights (described in <a href=\"http://bonsai.hgc.jp/%7Emdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm\">http://bonsai.hgc.jp/\u223cmdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm</a>) as a proxy for strain relatedness. The weighting was applied to control for genetic similarities in the strains, to therefore highlight independent gene amplification events. For each gene, this value was divided by its calculated V<sub>g</sub>/V<sub>m</sub> ratio. Larger values represent a higher propensity for CNV coupled with more stringent expression constraint (i.e., small V<sub>g</sub>/V<sub>m</sub>)."

An approximate EM algorithm was constructed to compute these probabilities and thus determine the clustering of genes according to their probable regime of linear DNA/RNA relationship."

First, they are not performed with isogenic strains that only differ by presence/absence of a CNV. The additional variation in gene expression introduced by all the other genetic differences going on could be partly responsible for the observed differences. I think it is crucial to also show at least a few paired euploid samples of similar relatedness to demonstrate the degree of expression difference expected in the absence of any CNVs. The reason this is important can be best explained by imagining that the base expression really does change proportional to the copy number. Now imagine additional genetic differences cause many genes to change in expression by, say 1.5-fold up or down, a result that has frequently been observed in comparisons between natural isolates. In the simplest possible additive model of expression, many genes in the CNV would now show greater or less than expected changes in expression, but not due to dosage compensation."

I think it is crucial to also show at least a few paired euploid samples of similar relatedness to demonstrate the degree of expression difference expected in the absence of any CNVs. The reason this is important can be best explained by imagining that the base expression really does change proportional to the copy number. Now imagine additional genetic differences cause many genes to change in expression by, say 1.5-fold up or down, a result that has frequently been observed in comparisons between natural isolates. In the simplest possible additive model of expression, many genes in the CNV would now show greater or less than expected changes in expression, but not due to dosage compensation</i>."

Thus, our results cannot be explained by differences in rDNA copy number on the amplified chromosome."

First, we compared the slope across biological replicates that were normalized with each of the two methods; because these are replicates, the slope across all genes is expected to be 1.0. Indeed, the average slope across replicates for spike-in normalization (1.052 +/- 0.042) was very similar to the average slope across replicates normalized by RPKM (0.992 +/- 0.026). The slope when comparing spike-in normalized data to RPKM normalized data was effectively 1.0, indicating that the values across the transcriptome were nearly identical when normalized with the two approaches. Second, we compared the slope across the transcriptome when comparing aneuploid strains to their isogenic euploid partners: the average slope is essentially the same (1.07 or 1.01) when the data were normalized by spike-in controls versus RPKM, although the standard deviation was significantly lower for RPKM (0.019) compared to spike-in controls (0.15), likely owing to the challenges with cell -based spiking. Third, we used the replicated NCYC110_Chr8 strain panel data to assess the fit between the mRNA and DNA abundance across NCYC110_Chr8 cells carrying two, three, or four copies of Chr 8. Recall that for a given gene, an mRNA <i>versus</i> DNA slope &lt;1.0 is indicative of dosage compensation, whereas cells that escape compensation display a slope of the mRNA-DNA fit of 1.0 (or in some cases higher). The mRNA-DNA slopes across the panel are virtually indistinguishable when the data are normalized by RPKM versus spike-in controls (slope of the slopes = 0.9997). This indicates that the mRNA-versus-DNA fits across the dataset are the same whether the data are normalized by spike-in controls or RPKM."
