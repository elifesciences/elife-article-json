This phenomenon of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is often interpreted as reflecting phase coding of neural representations, although evidence for this link is still lacking in humans. Here, we show that PAC indeed supports phase-dependent stimulus representations for categories. Six patients with medication-resistant epilepsy viewed images of faces, tools, houses, and scenes during simultaneous acquisition of intracranial recordings. Analyzing 167 electrodes, we observed PAC at 43% of electrodes. Further inspection of PAC revealed that category specific HFA modulations occurred at different phases and frequencies of the underlying low-frequency rhythm, permitting decoding of categorical information using the phase at which HFA events occurred. These results provide evidence for categorical phase-coded neural representations and are the first to show that PAC coincides with phase-dependent coding in the human brain."

This phenomenon of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is often interpreted as reflecting phase coding of neural representations, although evidence for this link is still lacking in humans. Here, we show that PAC indeed supports phase-dependent stimulus representations for categories. Six patients with medication-resistant epilepsy viewed images of faces, tools, houses, and scenes during simultaneous acquisition of intracranial recordings. Analyzing 167 electrodes, we observed PAC at 43% of electrodes. Further inspection of PAC revealed that category specific HFA modulations occurred at different phases and frequencies of the underlying low-frequency rhythm, permitting decoding of categorical information using the phase at which HFA events occurred. These results provide evidence for categorical phase-coded neural representations and are the first to show that PAC coincides with phase-dependent coding in the human brain."

This electrical activity repeatedly rises and falls, and can therefore be represented as a series of waves. All waves have three basic properties: amplitude, frequency and phase. Amplitude describes the height of a wave's peaks (and the depth of its troughs), and frequency defines how many waves are produced per second. The phase of a wave changes from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 between two consecutive peaks of that wave and then repeats, similar to the phases of the moon."

For instance, neural firing (when nerve impulses are sent from one neuron to the next) is related to \u2018high frequency activity\u2019; and the amplitude of high frequency activity can be altered by the phase of other, lower frequency brain activity. It has been suggested that this phenomenon, called \u2018phase-amplitude coupling\u2019, might be one way that the brain uses to represent information. This \u2018phase coding\u2019 hypothesis has been demonstrated in rodents but is largely untested in humans."

The analysis also revealed that the phase of the lower frequency activity at which the high frequency activity occurred was different for each of the four image categories. This provides support for the phase-coding hypothesis in humans. Furthermore, it suggests that not only how much neural firing occurs but also when (or specifically at what phase) it occurs is important for how the brain represents information. Future studies could now build on this analysis to see if phase-amplitude coupling also supports phase coding and neural representations in other thought processes, such as memory and navigation."

Here, we tested this prediction, a form of the phase-coding hypothesis in humans, by examining the relation between PAC and neural representations for categories. We analyzed intracranial recordings from 167 electrodes in six patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy as they viewed pictures of houses, tools, scenes, and faces. First, we identified PAC on individual electrodes by using a recently developed metric which allows for the characterization of PAC across individual HFA events. On electrodes exhibiting PAC, we then assessed the distinctiveness of each category's phase-coded representation during periods with and without pronounced HFA. Our results suggest that during periods with pronounced HFA, categorical representations can be recovered based on the phase of low-frequency oscillations, supporting the idea of phase-coded neural representations in humans."

Calculating the proportion of trials showing a period of significantly increased HFA (95th percentile, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for \u2018HFA windows\u2019) on each PAC+ electrode and category, we found that HFA occurred throughout the period of stimulus presentation but increased \u223c150 ms after stimulus onset (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). 66% of trials had at least one HFA window and this prevalence did not vary by category (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; one-way ANOVA, F(3,284) = 0.6, p &gt; 0.61).

As expected from the analysis using DS, 42 (25% of all) electrodes showed significant decoding accuracy (using LFO phases during HFA windows as features) compared to category label shuffled surrogates and this proportion was significantly higher than would be expected by chance (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221210</sup>, binomial test, chance level: 8.3 electrodes, Cohen's d = 0.6). Next, we assessed whether phase-coding of categorical information indeed depended on HFA, as would be expected if PAC supports phase-coding. We compared decoding accuracy during HFA events to decoding accuracy during randomly selected surrogate events. 19 (11%) electrodes showed significantly higher decoding accuracy during HFA events as compared to random event surrogates, and this proportion was significantly higher than would be expected by chance (p &lt; 0.0003, binomial test, chance = 8.3 electrodes, Cohen's d = 0.22). Moreover, 17 (10%) electrodes showed significant enhancements of decoding accuracy during HFA events relative to both label and event shuffled surrogates, with at least two electrodes in each patient showing this pattern. This proportion of electrodes far exceeded that expected by chance (p &lt; 10<sup>\u221210</sup>, binomial test, chance = 0.41 electrodes, Cohen's d = 0.46). These findings complement the above results using DS and indicate that the phase at which HFA events occur carries sufficient information to decode image category, suggesting such information may be a relevant component of the neural code."

First, if slow oscillatory phase relates to category-specific representations, we expect phase-locking across trials to different categories. We observed significant phase locking on many electrodes to specific categories (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, Rayleigh test, p &lt; 0.000001), similar to previous studies which have identified phase-locked activity (e.g., <a href=\"#bib22\">Fell et al., 2008</a>). Second, we excluded the possibility that our PAC+ or phase-clustering inclusion criteria biased our findings by computing a composite measure of phase representation (PR) on each electrode (see \u2018Supplement results\u2019). This analysis again revealed that phase coding is largest on PAC+ electrodes and is enhanced during HFA windows. Third, for comparison with prior PAC methods, we recomputed PAC using the modulation index (MI, <a href=\"#bib56\">Tort et al., 2009</a>) in different low-frequency bands, again finding PAC that was most prevalent in the delta band (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We therefore recalculated phase-clustering and DS at the minimum modulatory frequency (F<sub>MIN</sub>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for individual subject values) using the same criteria detailed above.

Moreover, only 20% (15/72) of PAC+ electrodes showed significant phase-clustering at F<sub>MIN</sub> for all 4 categories and only 1 electrode showed category-selective phase-clustering of HFA events. Given that the phase of slower frequencies varies less over time and that we primarily identified F<sub>max</sub> at slow frequencies, this result might be biased towards finding enhanced phase clustering at F<sub>max</sub>. We therefore recalculated phase clustering across the full range of frequencies (1\u201312 Hz, 0.1 Hz steps). Again, we found enhanced phase-clustering around 0.5 and 1 Hz (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), but not at adjacent frequencies as would be expected from this alternative account.

In other words, there could be PAC without phase coding. This is in fact the null hypothesis we have tested and would manifest as PAC with DSs of zero. On the other hand, categorical information may be represented by specific low-frequency phases independent of HFA, leading to DS without phase-clustering across HFA events (PAC; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right). We did not find a complete overlap between PAC+ and phase-coding electrodes, indicating that each can occur in isolation, but instead found a compromise between these extremes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, middle).

Next, the PAC metric allows for assessment of the modulatory signal.

It has recently been shown that the frequency of LFOs contributes to several neuronal properties such that relatively slower LFOs lead to decreased firing threshold and increased spike timing variability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cohen, 2014</a>). It is not immediately clear how this relates to our finding that PAC predominantly occurs with modulating frequencies in the delta band, particularly around 1 Hz. It is possible that our findings reflect the activation of assemblies during \u2018up\u2019 states which show a similar frequency profile (<a href=\"#bib18\">Destexhe et al., 2007</a>) or that the applied method of identifying peaks in the spectrum biased our findings to find PAC at lower frequencies."

First, we randomized the category labels associated with HFA events and assessed classification accuracy. Second, we used random time points (also corresponding to random phases) as surrogate HFA events and assessed classification accuracy. Each type of permutation test was performed 50 times, resulting in a distribution of pseudo classification accuracy values for each test.

To this end, we created a composite measure of PR on each electrode. Direct comparison of the observed DS value to a surrogate distribution is problematic because DS assumes values between 0\u20133. Therefore, in the case of an observed DS of 3, it is impossible to identify any surrogates larger than our observation. We thus created a composite and continuous measure of PR by multiplying DS and phase clustering values on each category\u2013electrode pair."

This method is similar to a method used previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Axmacher et al., 2008</a>). Specifically, we randomly reordered the positions of HFA and non-HFA windows and then recalculated DS, phase-clustering, and PR values for each category. Notably, this method maintains the distribution of HFA and non-HFA window durations while shuffling these windows relative to the phase series. Surrogate PR values were calculated 200 times per electrode and the observed PR value was compared against the 95th percentile of this surrogate distribution. PR values were also extracted during non-HFA windows as a second control condition."

This measure combines two intuitive features of phase-coding, namely that information is represented at different phases and that activity is concentrated at these phases (captured by DS and phase-clustering values, respectively). Testing the specificity of HFA windows for phase coding, we found that 56% (94/167) of electrodes showed PR that was larger during HFA windows compared to both time-shifted surrogates and non-HFA windows for at least one category. Moreover, PR values were significantly larger on PAC+ electrodes compared to electrodes without significant PAC (two-sample t-test, p &lt; 0.000005). Thus, we find that phase coding is largest on PAC+ electrodes and is enhanced during HFA windows."

Following surrogate control analyses, in which we randomly shuffled gamma values 500 times prior to calculating MI, we observed significant PAC in each band relative to shuffled gamma MI values. Consistent with our primary results, PAC was most prominent in the delta band using these methods. Furthermore, the magnitude of gamma band activity was maximal at a similar phase of delta oscillations (180\u00b0, oscillatory trough) as when assessed using the OTC method. Based on the MI based metric, we found that 102/167 electrodes exhibited significant PAC with delta band phase. These results are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>."

This putative phase-coding mechanism provides an interesting means of coordinating population coding, and makes clear predictions about temporal constraints on computation. To date, phase-coding has been studied in rodent models and non-human primates. In their submission, Watrous et al. seek to quantify a correlate of phase-coding in human cortex using direct intracranial recordings. As a means of quantifying phase-coding, the authors focus on phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the cortical surface potential, specifically low frequency phase modulation of high-frequency amplitude (HFA). This approach is supported by the correlation between HFA and local population spiking, and previous evidence of phase modulation of HFA. In this regard, HFA PAC reflects a macro-scale measure of population phase-coding."

Recording sites across subjects come from a wide variety of regions; this strikes me as a challenge when interpreting the specific coding of visual categories. The supplemental movie suggests a range of distant regions, not typically associated with higher-level vision, display some degree of phase-coding/representation of visual categories. This seems inconsistent with previous electrophysiology and functional imaging work (which is not cited or discussed in any detail). On a related note, the diversity of recording sites also makes the use of count statistics as somewhat arbitrary. Percentage of electrodes displaying an effect of interest can be equally meaningful for large or small percentages (e.g. low % for anatomically specific effect or high % for a trivial global effect). The authors should clarify why macro-scale phase-coding exists for visual categories across many cortical regions, rather than focused to the more classical regions of categorical selectivity."

While this may serve to aid mnemonic encoding, it does limit the claim of categorical decoding. Specifically, in developing a category decoder, the large number of stimulus repetitions limits insight, given the similarity between any training and test set. On a related note, I found the reporting of the basic decoding results unclear (is the decoder working above expected chance levels? &gt;25%). Given the authors\u2019 aims, it seems that a better use of the data would be quantifying the consistency of phase-coding metrics across repetitions of stimuli, as well as within/between class comparison. This approach would focus more on extracting single trial features and testing similarity across repeated trials (I note issues of repetition suppression come into play here). This approach of displaying consistency of stimulus phase-coding would provide more robust evidence for the authors\u2019 claims."

This low gamma has been argued to be distinct from more \u201cbroadband\u201d high gamma (Kai Miller and Dora Hermes' work), which is correlated with population spiking (Mukamel, Science; Manning, J.

We assessed PAC as both an increase in HFA and a phase-locking of HFA to slow oscillation phases.

This becomes apparent in our alternative metric (see response to concern #2).

Following surrogate control analyses, we observed significant PAC in each band. Consistent with our primary results, PAC was most prominent in the delta band using these methods. Furthermore, the magnitude of gamma band activity was maximal at a similar phase of delta oscillations (180\u00b0, oscillatory trough) as when assessed using the OTC method. Based on the MI based metric, we found that 102/167 electrodes exhibited significant PAC with delta band phase. However, we found more electrodes showing significant PAC using the more traditional MI based metric compared to the OTC metric (72/167 PAC+ electrodes).

For comparison, the right panel shows HFA windows for each category (similar to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Consistent with prior work (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib61\">Watrous et al., 2015</a>), these examples indicate that some categorical information is contained in each measure. In the electrode example in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, faces can be well distinguished from the other categories based on power information between around 300-700ms, based on low-frequency phase between around 100-150ms, and based on HFA between around 250-300ms. Critically, however, maximal phase and HFA differences scores (e.g. for faces) do not overlap and these enhanced DS periods do not neatly map onto HFA windows (compare to right panel). In this example, faces can be decoded via phase-clustered HFA (i.e. PAC) at many time points throughout the entire stimulus presentation period, while decoding based on low-frequency phase or power alone or based on the magnitude of HFA alone is only possible in restricted time periods. Moreover, unlike what we observe in our primary analysis based on PAC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), categorical decoding for all categories is not possible with HFA alone (which in this example only allows distinguishing faces from non-faces, but not between any of the other categories)."

Importantly, our PAC results were strongest in the delta band using both OTC and MI methods (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tort et al., 2009</a>, PNAS) and thus do support some level of visual entrainment to stimulus presentation as described in the Discussion. However, overall only relatively small numbers of electrodes showed category specific phase-clustering (5 percent of all electrodes for all categories apart from tools, where 16 percent showed phase-clustering), while PAC-based decoding of each of these categories was possible in more than twice as many electrodes (12 to 17 percent of all electrodes had a difference score of 3 for each of the four categories).

In this study, it was no real option for us to use different electrodes because a main aim was to first assess PAC, which has primarily been characterized as a local phenomenon. Although some reports indicate that information might be represented between electrode sites (Canolty et al., 2010 PNAS; <a href=\"#bib40\">Majima et al., 2014</a> Neuroimage), we believe this is the most straightforward way to understand phase coding.

We also find the strongest PAC effects in the delta band using the Modulation Index (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tort et al., 2009</a>) and can thus exclude the possibility that our comparatively new analytic method (OTC) influenced this finding.

First, our stimulus presentations occurred in the delta band (with some jitter) and may have therefore partially entrained the visual system. Second, the literature is dominated by PAC findings using phases in a pre-defined frequency band. This is typically theta band activity, in large part motivated by findings in rodents. Recent evidence suggests that the closest analog to rodent theta is in fact human delta oscillations (<a href=\"#bib62\">Watrous et al., 2013</a>; Hippocampus; Jacobs et al., 2014, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B). Thus, it is conceivable that previous studies would have also observed strong delta band PAC effects had they considered this band. We note that one strength of the OTC method is that it does not require assumptions about the coupling frequency."
