It is widely believed that this process uses an internal model, which describes our prior beliefs about how the limb responds to motor commands. Here, we leveraged a brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm in rhesus monkeys and novel statistical analyses of neural population activity to gain insight into moment-by-moment internal model computations. We discovered that a mismatch between subjects\u2019 internal models and the actual BMI explains roughly 65% of movement errors, as well as long-standing deficiencies in BMI speed control. We then used the internal models to characterize how the neural population activity changes during BMI learning. More broadly, this work provides an approach for interpreting neural population activity in the context of how prior beliefs guide the transformation of sensory input to motor output."

It is widely believed that this process uses an internal model, which describes our prior beliefs about how the limb responds to motor commands. Here, we leveraged a brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm in rhesus monkeys and novel statistical analyses of neural population activity to gain insight into moment-by-moment internal model computations. We discovered that a mismatch between subjects\u2019 internal models and the actual BMI explains roughly 65% of movement errors, as well as long-standing deficiencies in BMI speed control. We then used the internal models to characterize how the neural population activity changes during BMI learning. More broadly, this work provides an approach for interpreting neural population activity in the context of how prior beliefs guide the transformation of sensory input to motor output."

But on icy roads, these predictions will often not reflect how the car would behave. Applying the brakes sharply in these conditions could send the car skidding uncontrollably rather than stopping. In general, a mismatch between one\u2019s inner beliefs and reality is thought to cause errors and accidents. Yet this compelling hypothesis has not yet been fully investigated."

To justify the study of internal models in a BMI context, we first asked whether subjects show evidence of internal prediction during BMI control. Next, we asked whether interpreting M1 activity through extracted internal models could explain movement errors that are present throughout proficient BMI control and long-standing deficiencies in control of BMI movement speed. Finally, because a key feature of internal models is their ability to adapt\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib56\">Shadmehr et al., 2010</a>), we altered the BMI mapping and asked whether the internal model adapted in a manner consistent with the new BMI mapping."

First, native limb control involves effectors with non-linear dynamics, and the causal relationship between the recorded neural activity and limb movements is not completely understood. In contrast, the causal relationship between recorded neural activity and BMI cursor movements is completely specified by the experimenter (through <math id=\"inf6\"><mi>A</mi></math>,\u00a0<math id=\"inf7\"><mi>B</mi></math>\u00a0and <math id=\"inf8\"><mi>b</mi></math> in <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>), and can be chosen to be linear (as in <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). Second, native limb control involves multiple modalities of sensory feedback (e.g., proprioception and vision), which makes it difficult for the experimenter to know how the subject combines sources of sensory information. In the BMI, task-relevant sensory feedback is limited to a single modality (vision), which is completely specified by the experimenter (<math id=\"inf9\"><msub><mi>x</mi><mtext>t</mtext></msub></math> in <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). Finally, the neural activity that directly drives the BMI is completely specified by the recorded population activity (<math id=\"inf10\"><msub><mi>u</mi><mtext>t</mtext></msub></math> in <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>), whereas typically only a subset of neurons driving limb movements is recorded. We can thereby reinterpret the full set of BMI control signals using an internal model in a more concrete manner than is currently possible with limb movements."

A hallmark of internal prediction is compensation for sensory feedback delays (<a href=\"#bib42\">Miall et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shadmehr et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Farshchiansadegh et al., 2015</a>). To assess the visuomotor latency experienced by a subject in our BMI system, we measured the elapsed time between target onset and the appearance of target-related activity in the recorded neural population (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The delays we measured (<math id=\"inf11\"><mn>100</mn></math> ms, monkey A; <math id=\"inf12\"><mn>133</mn></math> ms, monkey C) are consistent with visuomotor latencies reported in arm reaching studies of single-neurons in primary motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schwartz et al., 1988</a>). Next, we asked whether subjects produced motor commands consistent with the current cursor position, which was not known to the subject due to visual feedback delay, or whether motor commands were more consistent with a previous, perceived position (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). If subjects did not compensate for visual feedback delays and aimed from the most recently available visual feedback of cursor position, we would expect errors to be smallest at lags of 100 ms and 133 ms relative to the current cursor position for monkeys A and C, respectively (dashed red lines in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Rather, we found that these error curves had minima at lags close to 0 ms (dashed black lines in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that motor commands through the BMI mapping pointed closer to the targets when originating from the current cursor position than from any previous position. This finding suggests that subjects use an internal model to internally predict the current cursor position."

In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 8</a>, velocity commands were evaluated as originating from a range of lagged cursor positions.

The two types of structure are (i) temporal structure in the dynamics of low-dimensional velocities (<math id=\"inf86\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>t</mi></msub></math>), and (ii) hidden, task-appropriate structure in the high-dimensional neural activity (<math id=\"inf87\"><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>raw</mi></msubsup></math>). Here we asked to what extent each type of structure contributes toward IME\u2019s overall explanatory power. In the internal model of <a href=\"#equ11\">Equation 10</a>, <math id=\"inf88\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>A</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>v</mi></msub></math> summarizes temporal dynamics in the low-dimensional velocity predictions, including how velocity feedback informs internal predictions of cursor state and the degree of temporal smoothness across internal velocity predictions within a single whisker. Intended velocity tends to be similar from one timestep to the next, and whiskers with the appropriate temporal structure (as determined by fitting <math id=\"inf89\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>A</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>v</mi></msub></math> to the data) can explain a portion of cursor movement errors. The internal model parameters <math id=\"inf90\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>B</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>v</mi></msub></math> and <math id=\"inf91\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>b</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>v</mi></msub></math> reveal features in the high-dimensional neural activity that are consistent with straight-to-target movement intent and that are often not reflected in the BMI cursor movements. To determine the relative contribution of structure in the high-dimensional neural data toward the explanatory power of IME, we devised a constrained variant of IME that relies entirely on the high-dimensional neural activity to generate whiskers. Specifically, we constrained <math id=\"inf92\"><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>A</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>v</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math> in <a href=\"#equ6\">Equation 6</a>, removing IME\u2019s ability to leverage velocity dynamics within its whiskers while preserving its ability to identify structure in the high-dimensional neural activity (since no constraints are placed on <math id=\"inf93\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>B</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>v</mi></msub></math>).

Because neural-only IME does not incorporate temporal smoothing of velocity predictions, it cannot be directly compared to the BMI mapping via the cursor error presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, which was computed using smoothed cursor velocities. To enable fair comparison with the BMI mapping, we computed cursor errors using single-timestep (unsmoothed) velocity commands, <math id=\"inf96\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>raw</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>B</mi><mi>v</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>raw</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></math> (replicated from <a href=\"#equ8\">Equation 8</a>). Here we compared the angular errors of these <math id=\"inf97\"><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>t</mi><mi>t</mi></msubsup></math> (\u201cneural only\u201d) and <math id=\"inf98\"><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>raw</mi></msubsup></math> (\u201cunsmoothed cursor\u201d). Internal models extracted using neural-only IME explain 54% and 46% of unsmoothed cursor errors in monkeys A and C, respectively, demonstrating that there is considerable structure in the high-dimensional neural activity. For reference, we also include the error from unconstrained IME (i.e., by fitting <math id=\"inf99\"><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>A</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>v</mi></msub></math> to the data; \u201cneural + dynamics\u201d; replicated from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In this view, the large difference between unsmoothed cursor errors and neural-only internal model errors (solid arrow) represents the explanatory power of the structured high-dimensional neural activity without applying any temporal smoothing and without leveraging visual feedback of cursor velocity. The smaller difference between errors through the neural-only internal model and the unconstrained internal model (dashed arrow) demonstrates the additional explanatory power gained by incorporating velocity feedback and temporal smoothing. As in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, angular error was defined as the angle by which the cursor would have missed the cursor-target overlap zone had it continued in the direction of <math id=\"inf100\"><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>raw</mi></msubsup></math> (BMI mapping) or <math id=\"inf101\"><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>t</mi><mi>t</mi></msubsup></math> (internal model) from position <math id=\"inf102\"><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>p</mi><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>t</mi><mi>t</mi></msubsup></math> or <math id=\"inf103\"><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>t</mi></msub></math>, respectively (i.e., <math id=\"inf104\"><msub><mi>\u0398</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></math> in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Under this alternative hypothesis, the subject generates idealized neural commands that, prior to corruption by noise, would produce the desired movement direction through the BMI mapping. We simulated these idealized neural commands and their noisy counterparts by sampling from the recorded neural activity (see Assessing whether internal model mismatch could appear as a spurious result due to correlated spiking variability). (<b>A</b>) By construction, the idealized neural commands had near-zero errors through the BMI mapping. When interpreted through the extracted internal model, those patterns produced substantially larger errors. (<b>B</b>) After corruption by noise, which was matched to the statistics of the recorded neural activity, simulated neural commands had substantially larger errors through the extracted internal model than through the BMI mapping. Thus when assuming the alternative hypothesis, simulation results contrast with the results from the real data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Furthermore, errors increased by roughly the same amount through both the BMI mapping and the internal model.

We asked whether we could account for the data using a simpler form of the internal model, which incorporates straight-to-target aiming without internal prediction. In this alternative model, the subject aims straight to the target from the most recent cursor position available from visual feedback, rather than from an internal forward prediction of cursor position. As in IME, this \u201caim-from-feedback\u201d approach involves an internal model that need not match the BMI mapping. We fit this model via linear regression using the same feedback delays determined from the BMI behavior (<math id=\"inf128\"><mi>\u03c4</mi></math> from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). At timestep <math id=\"inf129\"><mi>t</mi></math>, the intended aiming direction was assumed to be straight to the target center from the feedback cursor position, <math id=\"inf130\"><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow></msub></math>, and intended speed was taken to match that of the single-timestep velocity command through the BMI mapping, <math id=\"inf131\"><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></msubsup></math>. These aiming directions were regressed against single-timestep spike counts, i.e., the corresponding <math id=\"inf132\"><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>raw</mi></msubsup></math>, to yield an internal model. Internal models were fit and errors were evaluated using the same cross-validation practices used to evaluate the IME framework. Shaded regions (barely visible) indicate <math id=\"inf133\"> <mo>\u00b1 </mo></math> SEM (monkey A: <math id=\"inf134\"><mi>n</mi></math>\u00a0=\u00a033,660 timesteps across 4489 trials; monkey C: <math id=\"inf135\"><mi>n</mi></math>\u00a0=\u00a031,214 timesteps across 3639 trials). If subjects intend to drive the cursor from the position given by the most recent visual feedback, internal models fit according to this aim-from-feedback principle should predict intended velocities that point closest to targets when originating from feedback cursor positions (i.e., cursor positions that lag the recorded neural activity by <math id=\"inf136\"><mi>\u03c4</mi></math> timesteps). This was not the case. We found that internal models fit according to the aim-from-feedback principle result in cross-validated velocity commands that point closest to targets when originating from cursor positions more recent than those from the most recently available visual feedback (i.e., curves do not have clear minima at the red lines). This finding is consistent with subjects aiming straight to the target from an up-to-date internal prediction of the current cursor position (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Because of mismatch between the subject\u2019s internal model and the BMI mapping, the subject\u2019s up-to-date estimate of cursor position need not match the actual current cursor position, and as such, we should not necessarily expect minima in these curves at lag = 0. Given this evidence that subjects perform some sort of internal tracking, we implemented a number of different internal models to dissect the exact form of that tracking process. Specifically, we implemented internal models that perform no tracking (aim-from-feedback, presented here), tracking without previously issued motor commands (data not shown), and tracking with previously issued motor commands (main results, which use <a href=\"#equ10\">Equations 9\u201313</a>), among others. Empirically, these internal models all yield similar cross-validated errors. The explanation for this similarity is that the different formulations identify similar high-to-low dimensional mappings that capture the subject\u2019s intent to move straight to the target, and the direction of these intended commands tends to dominate any effect of the position from which those commands originate. This reasoning is consistent with our finding that cursor errors are better explained by structure in the high-dimensional neural activity than by temporal structure in the cursor kinematics (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), structure in low-dimensional behavior (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), or low-dimensional structure in the recorded neural activity (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). We ultimately chose to present results from the internal model of <a href=\"#equ10\">Equations 9\u201313</a> because it performs as well as any internal model we tested, and its formulation is consistent with a number of prominent studies evidencing the use of internal copies of motor commands (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sommer, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Scott, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Miall et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sommer and Wurtz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Azim et al., 2014</a>)."

The alternative to this hypothesis is that the subject\u2019s internal model is well-matched to the BMI mapping, and movement errors result from other factors, such as \u201cnoise\u201d in the sensorimotor system, subjects\u2019 inability to produce certain patterns of neural activity, or subjects disengaging from the task. Our key finding is that recorded neural commands were markedly more consistent with the task goals when interpreted through subjects\u2019 internal models than when viewed through the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Subjects\u2019 internal models deviated from the actual BMI mappings such that control errors evaluated through extracted internal models were substantially smaller than actual cursor errors: extracted internal models explained roughly 65% of cursor movement errors (70%, monkey A; 59%, monkey C). Although this finding does not preclude other factors (e.g., spiking noise or subject disengagement) from contributing toward movement errors, it does suggest their contribution is substantially smaller than previously thought, due to the large effect of internal model mismatch."

Rather, extracted internal models predicted movements that consistently pointed straight to the target, regardless of whether the actual cursor movements did (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) point straight to the target. On most trials, BMI cursor trajectories proceeded roughly straight to the target (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). On these trials, internal model predictions aligned with actual cursor movements, resulting in small errors through both the BMI mapping and the extracted internal model. In a smaller subset of trials, actual cursor movements were more circuitous and thus had relatively large errors. Previously, the reason behind these seemingly incorrect movements was unknown, and one possibility was that the subject simply disengaged from the task. When interpreted through the extracted internal model, however, neural activity during these circuitous trials appears correct, suggesting that the subject was engaged but was acting under an internal model that was mismatched to the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In other words, when armed with knowledge of the subject\u2019s internal model, outwardly irrational behavior (i.e., circuitous cursor movements) appears remarkably rational. Across all trials, the majority of neural activity patterns had low or zero error as evaluated through extracted internal models, regardless of whether errors of the actual cursor movements (i.e., through the BMI mapping) were large or small (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Although M1 cannot readily produce all possible patterns of high-dimensional neural activity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sadtler et al., 2014</a>), we observed that subjects could readily produce the full range of movement directions through the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

Here we define noise as spiking variability not explained by the desired movement direction under the BMI mapping. If spiking variability is correlated across neurons, it is possible to identify a mapping that best attenuates that variability. To determine whether correlated spiking variability could explain the effect of internal model mismatch, we simulated neural activity according to this alternative hypothesis in a manner that preserved the statistics of the real data (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>).

However, it is still an open question as to why BMI speed control is deficient in the first place. In addition to explaining the subjects\u2019 aiming errors, we asked whether mismatch between the internal model and BMI mapping could also explain subjects\u2019 difficulty in controlling cursor speed. Using the extracted internal model, we could compare the subject\u2019s intended speed (from the internal model) to the speed of the actual BMI cursor at each timestep. We found that low intended speeds were systematically overestimated, and high intended speeds were systematically underestimated by the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Furthermore, we discovered that the subjects intended to hold the cursor steadier during the initial hold period and move the cursor faster during the movement than what occurred during experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

These vectors represents the contribution of the single-timestep spike count from panel A toward the cursor (left) or internal model-predicted (right) velocity (i.e., without considering smoothing across previous time steps). Here, intended speed (magnitude of red arrow) is greater than the actual speed through the BMI mapping (magnitude of black arrow). This difference between intended and actual speed arises because the pattern of activated units in the example spike count vector had similar pushing directions through the internal model, resulting in a coordinated push. Through the BMI mapping, however, the same spike count activated a more diffuse set of pushing directions, resulting in a \u201cco-contraction\u201d of units that push against each other more than they did through the internal model. These spike counts were recorded mid-movement, when intended speed ought to peak. Thus, this example demonstrates the systematic underestimation of movement speed through the BMI mapping that results from internal model mismatch, consistent with aggregate findings in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> (movement bars). Also, consistent with aggregate findings in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, the internal-model predicted velocity (red arrow) points closer in direction to the target (green star) than does the actual cursor velocity (black arrow)."

In a BMI paradigm, we hypothesized that a mismatch between the subject\u2019s internal model and the actual BMI mapping could explain errors in BMI cursor movement. To assess this, we first found evidence that subjects compensate for sensory feedback delays. Then, we reinterpreted the neural population activity recorded during closed-loop BMI control in terms of a rich internal model that operates on a timescale of tens of milliseconds. We found (i) that subjects\u2019 neural activity was often correct according to the internal model even when cursor movements were circuitous (thereby explaining 65% of cursor errors), and (ii) that subjects intended to hold the cursor steadier during initial hold periods and to drive the cursor faster during movements, relative to observed behavior.

It is reasonable to ask how it is possible to deduce anything about internal models from M1 activity if we are not recording i) signals from the neural circuits that implement internal models (e.g., cerebellum), nor ii) the internal copy signals that enable internal model computations. The rationale is the following. First, the neural activity recorded in M1 is likely to be downstream of the internal model computations, whether they be in cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shadmehr, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pasalar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Miall et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lisberger, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2013</a>), posterior parietal cortex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shadmehr, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mulliken et al., 2008</a>), dorsal premotor cortex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shadmehr, 1997</a>), or elsewhere. Thus, the internal model is likely to influence the neural activity produced in M1. By relating the neural activity recorded in M1 to the behavioral task on a moment-by-moment basis, we should be able to infer properties of the upstream internal model. Second, previous studies indicate that internal copy signals (e.g., efference copy, corollary discharge) carry information about movement intent, in particular a copy of the movement intent that M1 sends to the motor effector (<a href=\"#bib7\">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Azim et al., 2014</a>). Although we are not directly recording the internal copy signal, the information in the internal copy relevant to movement intent is likely also present in the recorded M1 activity, and this is what we leveraged. In short, we make no claims about the neural circuitry implementing internal models, but rather we infer statistical properties of the internal models from their downstream consequences in M1. Using this rationale, we extracted internal models from M1 population activity."

First, extracted internal models explain a majority of behavioral errors on trials not seen during model fitting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Here, extracted internal models identified structure in the high-dimensional neural activity that indicated straight-to-target movement intent, even when the cursor behavior was circuitous. Internal model predictions on held-out trials could not trivially point toward the targets because that held-out neural activity had not been used during model fitting, and because target positions were never used when constructing internal model predictions from held-out trials. Second, the finding that intended speed is better predicted by internal models than the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) lends an additional independent validation of those internal models, since no assumptions were made about intended movement speed when fitting internal models. Third, when we perturbed the BMI mapping, extracted internal models revealed adaptation consistent with the particular perturbations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Further, we asked whether extracted internal models could explain the observed behavioral errors without access to structure in the high-dimensional neural activity beyond that which defined cursor movements. We considered two different alterations to the data from which internal models were extracted: one in which we replaced the high-dimensional neural activity with low-dimensional cursor velocities (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and another in which we shuffled the neural activity in a manner that preserved cursor velocities through the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

They take a similar mathematical form (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equations 1</a> and <a href=\"#equ2\">2</a>) and both project high-dimensional population activity to a low-dimensional kinematic space. A key difference between internal models and BMI mappings is that internal models are dynamic entities whose properties can change during motor adaptation. In contrast, the BMI mappings are chosen by the experimenter or by a computer algorithm. Critically, in experiments in which we abruptly applied a perturbed BMI mapping, we found that extracted internal models dynamically adjusted in a manner appropriate for the task and at a timescale independent of changes to the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The ability to interpret neural activity through the subject\u2019s internal model, while the subject controls the cursor through some BMI mapping (e.g., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), offers a unique glimpse into the subject\u2019s movement intentions, sensory prediction errors, and motor adaptation."

A way to reconcile these findings is that, in contrast to the frequent movement errors experienced after the BMI mapping was perturbed, there was a relative paucity of errors during the intuitive trials. As a result, there may not have been sufficient pressure to improve upon a \u201cgood enough\u201d internal model (<a href=\"#bib40\">Loeb, 2012</a>). Had the subject been given more experience with the same BMI mapping (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ganguly and Carmena, 2009</a>), the internal model may have converged to the BMI mapping. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the subject\u2019s learning process may be a key limitation in BMI performance (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sadtler et al., 2014</a>). It may be possible to overcome these limitations in the subject\u2019s neural adaptation process through complementary innovations in designing the BMI mapping (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shenoy and Carmena, 2014</a>). For example, applying an extracted internal model as the BMI mapping might improve performance during closed-loop BMI control. Indeed, a recent study incorporating the concept of internal tracking has demonstrated substantial gains in closed-loop BMI performance (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gilja et al., 2012</a>). Future studies will be required to determine whether further improvements in performance might be possible by using the IME framework toward designing the BMI mapping."

The 3D task was similar to the 2D task, except that the cursor was allowed to move in 3D, and targets were distributed about the surface of a workspace-centered sphere.

Details on this closed-loop calibration have been published previously in <a href=\"#bib6\">Chase et al. (2012)</a>. For monkey A, an initial sequence of 8 evenly-spaced radial targets was presented to the subject while the cursor remained stationary at the workspace center. Then, an initial set of BMI parameters was determined by regressing the average spike rates for each trial in this sequence against the corresponding target directions. A second sequence of 8 trials followed, with cursor movements determined by the initial parameter set, but with assistance provided by attenuating velocities perpendicular to target directions. Following this second sequence of trials, new decoding parameters were determined by regressing spike rates from all previous trials against the corresponding target directions. This process was repeated for typically 5 sequences (40 trials), with less assistance in each subsequent sequence until no assistance was provided. The schedule of assistance was determined on an ad-hoc basis. The intuitive BMI mapping calibrated from these trials was then used for the subsequent block of analyzed trials (see 'Behavioral task')."

For each trial, baseline error was defined to be the average of absolute angular errors prior to target onset.

Specifically, velocity commands originating from positions close to the target will have smaller errors under this definition than the same velocity commands originating far from the target (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Without accounting for this distance-to-target bias, absolute angular errors might appear smaller for lags that are less positive because these lagged cursor positions will tend to be closer to the targets than cursor positions with more positive lags (e.g., <math id=\"inf228\"><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub></math> tends to be closer to the target when <math id=\"inf229\"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math> ms than when <math id=\"inf230\"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>300</mn></mrow></math> ms). To ensure that this distance-to-target bias did not influence our conclusions about feedback delay compensation, errors were computed for the same exact subset of cursor positions across lags. This selection process preserves cursor-to-target distances across lags and thus ensures that the same exact error bias is applied at each lag. To this end, we included in this analysis only cursor positions for which all required lags of neural activity were recorded within the corresponding trial. Further, we only considered cursor positions that were presented at least 100 ms following target onset to ensure that recorded neural activity could plausibly reflect target position given a feedback delay of 100 ms. To determine the error value for a particular lag along the curves in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, we first averaged all absolute angular errors for that lag within each trial, and then averaged across trials. A preliminary version of this analysis using different experiments has appeared in conference form (<a href=\"#bib20\">Golub et al., 2012</a>)."

The key insight provided is due to the ability to explicitly define signal versus noise in simulation. Although there are many possible ways to define signal versus noise in the recorded neural activity, here we assume the internal model and the BMI mapping are equal (the alternative hypothesis), and we define signal to be the component of a neural activity pattern that maps to the subject\u2019s desired movement direction through that mapping. We define noise to be the residual neural activity pattern after subtracting out the signal."

The late intuitive internal model was extracted from the last 48 trials during the intuitive session.

In general, these errors describe how task-appropriate the subject\u2019s neural activity was for a particular mapping at a particular moment during the experiments. In the case of the BMI mappings, each whisker equates to how the cursor position and velocity would have evolved from a particular position on the actual cursor trajectory (i.e., the visual feedback) had that BMI mapping been in effect.

We interpreted monkey A neural activity through the BMI mappings and the time-varying internal model, and at each timestep, computed the angle between the velocity predicted by the internal model (i.e., by constructing a whisker) and the velocity computed through each BMI mapping. For experiments with a counter-clockwise rotational component to the perturbation, signs of angles were flipped so that nonzero biases would not cancel out when averaging across experiments. Angles were computed after centering the origins of the two velocity vectors. In contrast to the absolute angles computed relative to the target, which are presented through this work, these angles were signed and computed without using the target position. Analyzing signed angles permits quantification of the bias in these angles, whereas absolute angles are better suited for quantifying the variance of errors. During the intuitive trials, angular errors through the subject\u2019s internal model and through the intuitive BMI mapping tend to be unbiased (i.e., the average signed angular error is roughly zero for both; data not shown) but with different variances (hence the substantial differences in absolute angular errors in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Angular errors relative to the target become biased during the perturbation and washout trials due to the rotational nature of the perturbations.
