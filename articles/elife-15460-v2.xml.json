The MRTFs bind G-actin, and signal-regulated changes in cellular G-actin concentration control their nuclear accumulation. The MRTFs also undergo Rho- and ERK-dependent phosphorylation, but the function of MRTF phosphorylation, and the elements and signals involved in MRTF-A nuclear export are largely unexplored. We show that Rho-dependent MRTF-A phosphorylation reflects relief from an inhibitory function of nuclear actin. We map multiple sites of serum-induced phosphorylation, most of which are S/T-P motifs and show that S/T-P phosphorylation is required for transcriptional activation. ERK-mediated S98 phosphorylation inhibits assembly of G-actin complexes on the MRTF-A regulatory RPEL domain, promoting nuclear import. In contrast, S33 phosphorylation potentiates the activity of an autonomous Crm1-dependent N-terminal NES, which cooperates with five other NES elements to exclude MRTF-A from the nucleus. Phosphorylation thus plays positive and negative roles in the regulation of MRTF-A."

The MRTFs bind G-actin, and signal-regulated changes in cellular G-actin concentration control their nuclear accumulation. The MRTFs also undergo Rho- and ERK-dependent phosphorylation, but the function of MRTF phosphorylation, and the elements and signals involved in MRTF-A nuclear export are largely unexplored. We show that Rho-dependent MRTF-A phosphorylation reflects relief from an inhibitory function of nuclear actin. We map multiple sites of serum-induced phosphorylation, most of which are S/T-P motifs and show that S/T-P phosphorylation is required for transcriptional activation. ERK-mediated S98 phosphorylation inhibits assembly of G-actin complexes on the MRTF-A regulatory RPEL domain, promoting nuclear import. In contrast, S33 phosphorylation potentiates the activity of an autonomous Crm1-dependent N-terminal NES, which cooperates with five other NES elements to exclude MRTF-A from the nucleus. Phosphorylation thus plays positive and negative roles in the regulation of MRTF-A."

However, the extent and function of phosphorylation of the MRTFs, and of myocardin, remain largely unclear. For example, MRTF-A phosphorylation by ERK at residue S549 (numbering for 'fl' form, <a href=\"#bib29\">Miralles et al. 2003)</a> promotes nuclear export by facilitating G-actin binding (<a href=\"#bib32\">Muehlich et al., 2008</a>), but GSK3 phosphorylation of myocardin, and possibly MRTF-A, at the corresponding site and its neighbours promotes its degradation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badorff et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Charbonney et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xie et al., 2009</a>).

We identify four other NES elements in MRTF-A, which functionally cooperate with each other, and with the N-terminal phosphorylations, to control MRTF-A subcellular localisation in resting cells."

Although\u00a0this approach detects only those phosphorylations that significantly alter mobility and which occur at high stoichiometry, and cannot be used to unambigously identify phosphorylation sites, it does provide a useful way to investigate the global factors controlling MRTF-A phosphorylation. Significant MRTF-A phosphorylation persisted for 6\u20138\u00a0hr after serum stimulation, mirroring the nuclear retention time of MRTF-A in this system (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>), while transient transcriptional induction of MRTF-A target genes had declined to basal levels within 2 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Serum washout, or Latrunculin B (LatB) treatment, which restore cytoplasmic localisation of MRTF-A (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>), resulted in the rapid return of MRTF-A phosphorylation to prestimulation levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We previously showed that serum-induced MRTF phosphorylation comprises both ERK- and Rho-dependent components (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">Miralles et al., 2003</a>), and direct activation of ERK signalling by TPA or Raf activation also induced MRTF-A phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast, although the actin-binding drug cytochalasin D (CD), which directly activates MRTF by preventing its association with G-actin, also induced MRTF-A phosphorylation, this occurred independently of ERK (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

                                "text": "The ability of CD to stimulate MRTF-A phosphorylation led us to test whether it could be induced by alterations in actin dynamics alone. Serum-induced MRTF nuclear accumulation in NIH3T3 cells is dependent on Rho signalling to the formin mDia1, which nucleates F-actin assembly (<a href=\"#bib7\">Copeland and Treisman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Miralles et al., 2003</a>). Expression of an activated mDia1 derivative, which promotes MRTF-A nuclear accumulation, also induced its phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">Miralles et al., 2003</a>). In contrast, relocalisation of MRTF-A to the nucleus of resting cells by its fusion to an heterologous NLS, or treatment of the cells with Leptomycin B, did not induce phosphorylation unless the cells were simultaneously stimulated with CD or FCS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). This suggests that phosphorylation requires dissociation of G-actin from MRTF-A, and that in the context of these experiments, phosphorylation is inhibited by interaction between nuclear G-actin and MRTF-A. Indeed, the MRTF-A derivative MRTF-A-123-1A, which cannot bind actin and is constitutively nuclear (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>), exhibited elevated levels of phosphorylation in resting cells and was not sensitive to mDia expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Myocardin also does not bind actin and is constitutively nuclear; however, replacement of its N-terminal sequences with those of MRTF-A was sufficient to restore G-actin binding and regulation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">Guettler et al., 2008</a>). Consistent with this, the MRTF-A/MC fusion protein exhibited CD-induced phosphorylation similar to that seen in MRTF-A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Finally, phosphorylation of the NLS mutant MRTF-A B2A, which cannot accumulate in the nucleus following serum stimulation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Paw\u0142owski et al., 2010</a>) could be induced by serum, but not CD, and this was entirely ERK-dependent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, dissociation of G-actin from MRTF-A underlies its ERK-independent phosphorylation (see Discussion)."

We generated tetracycline-inducible cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged MRTF-A and analysed its phosphorylation following serum stimulation.

MRTF26A exhibited increased and more uniform mobility than the wild-type protein MRTF-A in SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast to wild-type MRTF-A, serum stimulation or expression of activated mDia1 did not alter the mobility of MRTF26A in SDS-PAGE, consistent with decreased phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, unlike wild-type MRTF-A, disruption of the G-actin-binding sites in the RPEL domain of MRTF26A did not detectably induce phosphorylation as assessed by the SDS-PAGE assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Since this reduction was also observed upon expression of MRTF26A-123-1A, which is constitutively nuclear, it cannot reflect defective nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

TPA treatment also substantially increased the proportion of cells with predominantly nuclear MRTF-A; this was also ERK-dependent, and sensitive to both the conventional-PKC inhibitor G\u00f66976 and the pan-PKC inhibitor G\u00f66983 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), although only the latter completely inhibited ERK activation and MRTF-A phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, TPA promotes MRTF-A nuclear accumulation via an ERK- and conventional-PKC- dependent pathway."

We therefore investigated the role of S98 phosphorylation in the assembly of G-actin/RPEL domain complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). S98 phosphorylation was induced by co-expression of activated Raf or MEK, and by TPA in a U0126-sensitive fashion, indicating that S98 is an ERK target, and MRTF-A phosphorylated at S98 was detectable in the nucleus of stimulated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Serum-stimulated phosphorylation of S98 was impaired by mutations that disrupted the ERK-binding motif and was not observed in the MRTF-A BSAC isoform, which lacks it (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Such mutations also impaired the recovery of ERK2 by the MRTF-A N-terminal sequences in pulldown assays (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We found that G-actin inhibited phosphorylation of S98 by recombinant ERK (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>); this suggests that G-actin must occlude the phosphorylation site and/or compete with ERK docking, although we were unable to observe competition between ERK2 and G-actin binding in pulldown assays (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>; see below)."

To simplify the analysis given the numerous phosphorylation sites elsewhere in the molecule, we first investigated their role in regulation of MRTF-A(2\u2013204)-PK, whose regulation is similar to MRTF-A itself (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>). TPA stimulation or co-expression of activated MEK promoted nuclear accumulation of MRTF-A(2\u2013204)-PK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast, the S98A derivative of MRTF-A(2\u2013204)-PK was refractory to TPA stimulation but remained slightly inducible by MEK, possibly reflecting indirect effects of chronic ERK activation, while the S98D phosphomimetic derivative was significantly nuclear in unstimulated cells and unaffected by TPA or MEK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Similar results were seen following short-term activation of Raf (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). G-actin binding occludes the importin \u03b1\u03b2-dependent NLS within the RPEL domain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hirano and Matsuura, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mouilleron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Paw\u0142owski et al., 2010</a>). Our observations therefore suggest a model in which S98 phosphorylation promotes MRTF nuclear import indirectly, by inhibiting G-actin binding and thereby facilitating recruitment of importin \u03b1\u03b2 to the NLS."

Three lines of evidence indicate Rho-mediated MRTF phosphorylation results from the dissociation of G-actin-MRTF complexes following depletion of the G-actin pool: it is induced by (i) active forms of the Rho effector mDia, which promote actin polymerization; (ii) mutation of the RPEL motifs, which render MRTF-A unable to bind actin; and (iii) treatment with cytochalasin D, which prevents G-actin from binding to MRTF-A. These treatments also promote MRTF nuclear accumulation, but relocalisation of MRTF-A to the nucleus by inactivation of Crm1, or by fusion to an active nuclear import signal, does not induce phosphorylation unless actin association is also disrupted. Our data thus support a model in which the interaction of G-actin with MRTF-A either inhibits access of kinases to MRTF or facilitates its interaction with nuclear phosphatase(s) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Consistent with this, although myocardin, which does not bind G-actin and is constitutively nuclear, is constitutively phosphorylated, exchange of its RPEL domain for that of MRTF-A is sufficient to confer actin-regulated phosphorylation. There is significant interaction between MRTF-A and G-actin in the nucleus, and our experiments with NLS fusions and Crm1 inhibitors show that interaction between nuclear G-actin and MRTF-A must contribute to regulation of its phosphorylation."

                                "text": "Within the RPEL domain, S98 is phosphorylated by ERK upon serum stimulation, and exhibits very low basal phosphorylation in unstimulated cells; the corresponding MRTF-B residue is also phosphorylated (<a href=\"#bib33\">Olsen et al., 2006</a>). S98 phosphorylation also requires an ERK docking motif which overlaps the RPEL domain. Biochemical studies show that S98 phosphorylation and G-actin binding are mutually antagonistic, and that S98 phosphorylation promotes the nuclear accumulation of MRTF-A. This could contribute to MRTF regulation in two ways. First, in unstimulated cells high basal levels of S98 phosphorylation might potentiate nuclear accumulation of MRTF-A, adjusting expression of MRTF-SRF target genes accordingly. Second, rapid phosphorylation of S98 following signal-induced G-actin depletion might delay G-actin rebinding, thereby prolonging the effective period of MRTF-A activation, in a manner analogous to the phosphorylation of WASP contingent upon GTPase activation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Torres and Rosen, 2003</a>). In resting cells, the MRTFs interact with G-actin in both compartments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baarlink et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>). Our finding that S98-phosphorylated MRTF-A is mostly nuclear following ERK activation suggests that at least in this context, it must affect nuclear G-actin-MRTF-A interactions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vartiainen et al., 2007</a>)."

These elements functionally cooperate with each other, and with phosphorylation of S98, to promote the cytoplasmic localisation of MRTF-A in resting cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hayashi and Morita, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Muehlich et al., 2008</a>). All except NES4 are conserved between MRTF-A and MRTF-B, and through evolution, although NES3 also overlaps the SAP domain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). NES1 activity is potentiated by phosphorylation or acidic substitution of nearby S33 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). It is likely that this may facilitate Crm1 interaction, since Crm1-dependent NES elements show a strong preference for negatively charged residues at positions 10\u201315 and 24\u201328 N-terminal to the hydrophobic anchor (<a href=\"#bib25\">la Cour et al., 2004</a>). Phosphorylation of S33 was readily detectable in resting cells, and enhanced only slightly by serum stimulation, suggesting that it controls basal activity of NES1 rather than signal-regulated MRTF-A nuclear accumulation. Together, the opposing roles of S33 and S98 phosphorylation potentially allow fine tuning both of the basal levels of nuclear MRTF-A in resting cells, and the kinetics with which the system can return to its initial state following signalling. MRTF-A and MRTF-B express tissue-specific evolutionarily conserved N-terminal isoforms (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ishikawa et al., 2013</a>), that contain both NES1 and the ERK docking sites required for effective S98 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This suggests that coordination of MRTF NES1 activity and S98 phosphorylation is biologically significant, but the biological context for this remains to be determined. Unlike NES1, the other NES elements were not closely associated with phosphorylation sites."

We found that alanine substitution of these residues did not affect MRTF-A nuclear localisation in our system. Phosphorylation of S549 cannot be strictly essential for the RPEL domain itself to display G-actin-regulated shuttling properties, since MRTF-A N-terminal fusion proteins which lack it remain regulated (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guettler et al., 2008</a>), and it is conserved in myocardin, which is nuclear and does not shuttle (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guettler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2001</a>). Further work is clearly required to clarify the apparently complex interplay between phosphorylation by ERK and GSK3, G-actin binding, and MRTF-A nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In related experiments, we found that TPA pretreatment inhibits serum-induced MRTF-A nuclear accumulation through down-regulation of RhoA rather and was independent of ERK."

This suggests that nuclear actin functionally cooperates with Crm1 in MRTF-A export (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), although we cannot rule out the possibility that it reflects competition between cytoplasmic G-actin and importin \u03b1\u03b2 for binding to MRTF-A once the Crm1-MRTF complex reaches the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear pore. It is unlikely that there is direct interaction between Crm1 and the RPEL domain, since the isolated MRTF-A RPEL domain functions neither in the Rev\u0394 assay nor when substituted for the Phactr1 RPEL domain, which is regulated independently of Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wiezlak et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, our experiments show that the isolated N-terminal NES1 can function in the absence of actin binding, even though fusion proteins containing it and the RPEL domain require actin binding for export. We speculate that NES1 may somehow be occluded by the RPEL domain in the absence of bound G-actin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Interestingly, a recent report implicated the Ddx19 helicase in conformation-dependent control of MRTF-A nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rajakyl\u00e4 et al., 2015</a>). It will be interesting to investigate the interplay between phosphorylation, G-actin binding and MRTF nucleocytoplasmic shuttling."

Analysis was with and without TiO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (Titansphere TiO<sub>2</sub> beads GLSciences) on the LTQ Orbitrap Discovery, operated in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS. Survey full scan MS spectra were acquired from m/z 350 to m/z 1500. The two (60-min method) or five (90-min method) most intense multiply charged precursor ions were fragmented in the linear ion trap using collisionally induced dissociation."

Fixed modifications were set as Carbamidomethyl (C) and variable modifications as oxidation (M) and phospho (STY). The estimated false discovery rate was set to 1% at the peptide, protein and site level. For all enzymatic digests a maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed. Other parameters were used as pre-set in the software. The summary table was generated from the MaxQuant output file PhosphoSTY Sites.txt, an FDR-controlled site-based table compiled by MaxQuant from the relevant information about the identified peptides."

It is therefore unclear what Ser98 phosphorylation might do. Studies of full-length MRTF-A are needed to establish the physiological significance of Ser98 phosphorylation.</i>"

Thus ERK must make at least some contribution to S33 phosphorylation, although other kinases may be involved, as there is a high basal level of S33 phosphorylation in resting cells.

Importantly, even when MRTF-A is confined to the nucleus by inactivation of Crm1, regulated actin-MRTF interaction can be detected. Thus, actin- MRTF-A interaction occurs in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Subsequent studies have shown that specific disruption of nuclear actin-MRTF-A interaction can be sufficient to activate MRTF-A (Baarlink et al., Science 340, p864 (2013). Perhaps not surprisingly, in stimulated cells most S98-phosphorylated MRTF-A is nuclear, so it is most likely that its primary point of action is in the nucleus."
