Interestingly, GLS1 and GLS2 display contrasting functions in tumorigenesis with elusive mechanism; GLS1 promotes tumorigenesis, whereas GLS2 exhibits a tumor-suppressive function. In this study, we found that GLS2 but not GLS1 binds to small GTPase Rac1 and inhibits its interaction with Rac1 activators guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, which in turn inhibits Rac1 to suppress cancer metastasis. This function of GLS2 is independent of GLS2 glutaminase activity. Furthermore, decreased GLS2 expression is associated with enhanced metastasis in human cancer. As a p53 target, GLS2 mediates p53\u2019s function in metastasis suppression through inhibiting Rac1. In summary, our results reveal that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of Rac1, and uncover a novel function and mechanism whereby GLS2 suppresses metastasis. Our results also elucidate a novel mechanism that contributes to the contrasting functions of GLS1 and GLS2 in tumorigenesis."

Interestingly, GLS1 and GLS2 display contrasting functions in tumorigenesis with elusive mechanism; GLS1 promotes tumorigenesis, whereas GLS2 exhibits a tumor-suppressive function. In this study, we found that GLS2 but not GLS1 binds to small GTPase Rac1 and inhibits its interaction with Rac1 activators guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, which in turn inhibits Rac1 to suppress cancer metastasis. This function of GLS2 is independent of GLS2 glutaminase activity. Furthermore, decreased GLS2 expression is associated with enhanced metastasis in human cancer. As a p53 target, GLS2 mediates p53\u2019s function in metastasis suppression through inhibiting Rac1. In summary, our results reveal that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of Rac1, and uncover a novel function and mechanism whereby GLS2 suppresses metastasis. Our results also elucidate a novel mechanism that contributes to the contrasting functions of GLS1 and GLS2 in tumorigenesis."

Increased glutamine metabolism (glutaminolysis) has been recognized as a key metabolic change in cancer cells, along with increased aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berkers et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cairns et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hensley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ward and Thompson, 2012</a>). Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human plasma (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hensley et al., 2013</a>). Glutamine catabolism starts with the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, which is converted to \u03b1-ketoglutarate for further metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Two genes encode glutaminases in human cells: GLS1 (also known as kidney-type glutaminase), and GLS2 (also known as liver-type glutaminase). GLS1 and GLS2 proteins exhibit a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity, particularly in their glutaminase core domains. While GLS1 and GLS2 both function as glutaminase enzymes in glutamine metabolism, recent studies show that they have very different functions in tumorigenesis. GLS1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, and its expression can be induced by the oncogene MYC (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gao et al., 2009</a>). GLS1 is frequently activated and/or overexpressed in various types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Thangavelu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiang et al., 2015</a>). GLS1 has been reported to promote tumorigenesis in different types of cancer, including HCC, which is mainly attributable to its glutaminase activity and role in promoting glutamine metabolism (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Thangavelu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiang et al., 2015</a>). By\u00a0contrast, GLS2 is specifically expressed in only a few tissues, including the liver tissue. Recent studies including ours have shown that <i>GLS2</i> is a novel target gene of the tumor suppressor p53. GLS2 is transcriptionally up-regulated by p53 and mediates p53\u2019s regulation of mitochondrial function and anti-oxidant defense in cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Suzuki et al., 2010</a>). Considering the critical role of p53 and its pathway in tumor suppression, the identification of <i>GLS2</i> as a p53 target gene strongly suggests a potentially important role of GLS2 in tumor suppression. Recent studies have shown that, in contrast to the tumorigenic effect of GLS1, GLS2 displays a tumor suppressive function (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Suzuki et al., 2010</a>). GLS2 expression is frequently reduced in HCC (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Suzuki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Xiang et al., 2015</a>). Ectopic expression of GLS2 greatly inhibited the growth and colony formation of HCC cells in vitro and the growth of HCC xenograft tumors in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Suzuki et al., 2010</a>). Given that GLS1 and GLS2 both function as glutaminase enzymes, the mechanisms underlying their contrasting roles in tumorigenesis remain unclear."

The small GTPase Rac1 was identified as a novel binding protein for GLS2. Rac1 cycles between inactive guanosine\u00a05\u2032-diphosphate\u00a0(GDP)-bound and active guanosine\u00a05'-triphosphate\u00a0(GTP)-bound forms in cells, and regulates a diverse array of cellular events, including actin dynamics. The Rac1 signaling is frequently activated in various types of cancer, in\u00a0which it\u00a0plays a critical role in promoting migration, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bid et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</a>). We found that GLS2 binds to Rac1, and inhibits the interaction of Rac1 with its guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Tiam1 and VAV1, which would normally activate Rac1. Thus, GLS2 inhibits Rac1 activity, which in turn inhibits migration, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. This function of GLS2 requires the C-terminus of GLS2 and is independent of its glutaminase activity. In contrast, GLS1 does not interact with Rac1 to inhibit Rac1 activity, and consequently, cannot inhibit cancer metastasis via this pathway. p53 plays a pivotal role in suppressing cancer metastasis, but its underlying mechanism is not fully understood (<a href=\"#bib27\">Muller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Vousden and Prives, 2009</a>). Our results further show that, as a direct downstream target of p53, GLS2 mediates p53\u2019s function in metastasis suppression through inhibiting the Rac1 signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrated that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of Rac1, and plays a critical role in suppression of metastasis through its negative regulation of Rac1 activity. Our results also revealed that GLS2 plays an important role in mediating the function of p53 in suppression of cancer metastasis."

Since the C-terminus of GLS2 (GLS2-C139) does not contain the glutaminase core domain, which encodes the glutaminase catalytic domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and hence lacks glutaminase activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), these results demonstrate that the binding of GLS2 to Rac1 is independent of its glutaminase activity."

PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) is a critical Rac1 effector protein. It has been well\u00a0established that the p21-binding domain of PAK1 binds specifically to the Rac1-GTP but not Rac1-GDP in cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Galic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Palacios et al., 2002</a>). Based on this fact, the GST-p21-binding domain of PAK1 pull-down assays have been widely used to measure the levels of Rac1-GTP in cells as a standard method to analyze the Rac1 activity in cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Galic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Palacios et al., 2002</a>). We found that ectopic expression of GLS2-Flag greatly decreased the levels of Rac1-GTP measured by p21-binding domain of PAK1 pull-down assays in Huh-1 and HepG2 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), as well as Hep3B and Huh-7 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, the expression of GLS2-Flag did not affect the levels of total Rac1 protein in these cells measured by western\u00a0blot assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that GLS2 inhibits Rac1 activity. Consistently, knockdown of GLS2 greatly increased the levels of Rac1-GTP but not total Rac1 in Huh-1 and HepG2 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) as well as in Hep3B and Huh-7 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

It has been known that Rac1 binds to PAK1 and results in the auto-phosphorylation of PAK1 at multiple sites, including Ser199/204, leading to PAK1 activation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chong et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</a>). Therefore, we further investigated the effect of GLS2 on Rac1 activity by detecting the Ser199/204 phosphorylation of PAK1 in cells. Ectopic expression of GLS2-Flag in Huh-1 and HepG2 cells greatly reduced Ser199/204 phosphorylation of PAK1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), whereas GLS2 knockdown enhanced Ser199/204 phosphorylation of PAK1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), which further indicates that GLS2 inhibits the Rac1 activity in HCC cells.

Furthermore, ectopic expression of GLS2-C139 greatly inhibited the Rac1 activity in Huh-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). In contrast, GLS2-\u0394C139, which did not bind to Rac1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), failed to inhibit the Rac1 activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). This result indicates that the interaction between GLS2 and Rac1 is critical for GLS2 to inhibit the Rac1 activity. Furthermore, the function of GLS2 in binding to and inhibiting Rac1 is independent of its glutaminase activity since the C-terminus of GLS2 (GLS2-C139) lacks the glutaminase activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Collectively, these results revealed that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of the Rac1 signaling; GLS2 inhibits the Rac1 activity through its interaction with Rac1-GDP, and furthermore, this function of GLS2 requires the C-terminus of GLS2 and is independent of GLS2 glutaminase activity."

Tiam1 and VAV1 are two most common and critical GEFs of Rac1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Worthylake et al., 2000</a>). Consistent with previous reports, ectopically expressed Tiam1-HA and VAV1-HA specifically bound to Rac1-GDP (shown by their preferential interactions with Rac1-T17N but not Rac1-G12V; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) through the Switch I &amp; II regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), leading to the activation of Rac1 in Huh-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Since both GLS2 and Rac1 GEFs, such as Tiam1 and VAV1, bind to Rac1-GDP through the Switch I &amp; II regions, this raised the possibility that GLS2 may inhibit Rac1 activity through competing with Rac1 GEFs for the Switch I &amp; II regions of Rac1-GDP. To test this possibility, co-IP assays were performed in Huh-1 cells co-transduced with DN Myc-Rac1-T17N vectors and Tiam1-HA or VAV1-HA vectors, as well as increasing amount of vectors expressing GLS2-Flag. Increasing amount of GLS2-Flag resulted in a progressive reduction of Tiam1-HA or VAV1-HA bound to Myc-Rac1-T17N in cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Consistently transducing Huh-1 and HepG2 cells with increasing amount of GLS2-Flag vectors resulted in a progressive reduction of endogenous Tiam1 and VAV1 bound to endogenous Rac1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous GLS2 greatly promoted the interaction of endogenous Tiam1 and VAV-1 with endogenous Rac1 in Huh-1 and HepG2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). These results suggest that GLS2 inhibits the Rac1 activation by interacting with Rac1-GDP to block its interaction with Rac1 GEFs, such as Tiam1 and VAV1."

However, its role in HCC, especially HCC metastasis, is poorly understood. The malignancy and poor prognosis of HCC has been related to the high metastatic characteristic of HCC (<a href=\"#bib10\">El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Tang, 2001</a>). Currently, the mechanism underlying HCC metastasis is not well-understood. Rac1 is frequently activated or overexpressed in various types of cancer, including HCC, which plays a critical role in promoting cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bid et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>, ectopic expression of CA Myc-Rac1-G12V greatly promoted migration and invasion of Huh-1 and HepG2 cells as determined by trans-well assays, whereas expression of DN Myc-Rac1-T17N greatly inhibited migration and invasion of these cells.

Compared with cells transduced with control vectors, ectopic expression of GLS2 by GLS2-Flag retroviral vectors greatly reduced the migration and invasion of above-mentioned different HCC cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Furthermore, knockdown of GLS2 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors greatly promoted the migration and invasion of these cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Serum-free medium was used in the upper chamber to minimize the effect of GLS2 on cell proliferation in the trans-well assays.

GLS2 bound to Rac1-GDP through its Switch I &amp; II regions, which is also the binding domain for Rac1 GEFs Tiam1 and VAV1. Thus, GLS2 blocked the binding of Tiam1 and VAV1 to Rac1-GDP, and inhibited the Rac1 activation by Tiam1 and VAV1. We found that GLS2 inhibited migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and lung metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Blocking the Rac1 signaling by expression of Rac1-T17N or knockdown of Rac1 largely abolished GLS2\u2019s function in inhibiting metastasis. These results demonstrate a novel and important role of GLS2 in suppressing cancer metastasis, and also reveal that GLS2 binding to Rac1-GDP to inhibit Rac1 activity is a critical underlying mechanism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>)."

It is unclear why GLS1 and GLS2 have contrasting roles in tumorigenesis, although they both function as the glutaminase enzymes. While the glutaminase core domains of GLS1 and GLS2 show high homology, their C-termini show relatively low homology. In this study, we found that GLS2 bound to Rac1 through its C-terminus and inhibited the Rac1 activity to suppress migration and invasion of HCC cells. This effect requires the C-terminus of GLS2 and is independent of its glutaminase activity. In contrast, GLS1 does not bind to Rac1 or inhibit Rac1 activity. Considering the critical role of Rac1 in cancer, our results provide a novel mechanism for the different roles of GLS1 and GLS2 in tumorigenesis, particularly with respect to cancer metastasis. In addition to Rac1, GLS2 may interact with other proteins to regulate their functions, which in turn contributes to GLS2\u2019s function in tumor suppression. Future studies should shed light on the further mechanisms of GLS2 in tumor suppression."

This is done independently of enzymatic activity, via the binding of GLS2 to the switch regions of Rac1, preventing the binding of Rac1 GEFs. Through a series of gain-of-function and loss-of-function based experiments in multiple cell lines and in vivo, the authors show that this mechanism is responsible for the migration/metastasis inhibiting activities of GLS2. Furthermore, as GLS2 has been reported to be a target of p53, the authors show that GLS2 inhibition of Rac1 mediates in large part the known suppressive properties of p53 on migration and metastasis."

Recent reports including ours show that GLS2 negatively regulates cell proliferation (Hu et al., PNAS, 2010; Suzuki et al., PNAS, 2010). Results from our recent study suggest that inhibition of AKT signaling is an important mechanism contributing to the inhibitory effect of GLS2 on cell proliferation (Liu et al., Oncotarget, 2014). In the current study, we found that GLS2 inhibits Rac1 activation. Rac1 activation promotes cell proliferation. It is therefore possible that the inhibition of Rac1 by GLS2 is an additional mechanism contributing to the role of GLS2 in negative regulation of cell proliferation, which is worth further investigation in a future study. In this study, we focused the effect of GLS2 on migration, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. Therefore, a serum-free medium was used in in vitrotrans-well assays to determine the abilities of migration and invasion of cells with ectopic expression of GLS2, knockdown of endogenous GLS2 or their control cells. Serum starvation induces G0/G1 cell cycler arrest and inhibits cell proliferation. Under this experiment condition for 36 h (the length for migration and invasion transwell assays), GLS2 (either ectopic expression or knockdown of GLS2) does not have an obvious effect on cell proliferation as well as cell viability (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results strongly suggest that the effect of GLS2 on migration and invasion is not due to the effect of GLS2 on cell viability or proliferation. As suggested, we have also added <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A, B</a> as controls to show that no significant difference in the viability and number of HCC cells among different groups was observed after being cultured in a serum-free medium for 36 h at the end of trans-well assays in HCC cells with Rac1 or p53 knockdown."
