Atg8 proteins are localized to the membrane in an ubiquitin-like conjugation reaction, but how this conjugation is coupled to the presence of the cargo is unclear. Here we show that the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Atg19, Atg34 and the human p62, Optineurin and NDP52 cargo receptors interact with the E3-like enzyme Atg12~Atg5-Atg16, which stimulates Atg8 conjugation. The interaction of Atg19 with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is mediated by its Atg8-interacting motifs (AIMs). We identify the AIM-binding sites in the Atg5 subunit and mutation of these sites impairs selective autophagy. In a reconstituted system the recruitment of the E3 to the prApe1 cargo is sufficient to drive accumulation of conjugated Atg8 at the cargo. The interaction of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and Atg8 with Atg19 is mutually exclusive, which may confer directionality to the system."

Atg8 proteins are localized to the membrane in an ubiquitin-like conjugation reaction, but how this conjugation is coupled to the presence of the cargo is unclear. Here we show that the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Atg19, Atg34 and the human p62, Optineurin and NDP52 cargo receptors interact with the E3-like enzyme Atg12~Atg5-Atg16, which stimulates Atg8 conjugation. The interaction of Atg19 with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is mediated by its Atg8-interacting motifs (AIMs). We identify the AIM-binding sites in the Atg5 subunit and mutation of these sites impairs selective autophagy. In a reconstituted system the recruitment of the E3 to the prApe1 cargo is sufficient to drive accumulation of conjugated Atg8 at the cargo. The interaction of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and Atg8 with Atg19 is mutually exclusive, which may confer directionality to the system."

Upon induction of autophagy, double membrane organelles termed autophagosomes are formed in a de novo manner. Initially, autophagosome precursors appear as small membrane structures referred to as isolation membranes (or phagophores). As isolation membranes expand, they gradually enclose cytoplasmic cargo material. Upon closure of the isolation membranes, autophagosomes are formed within which the cargo is isolated from the rest of the cytoplasm. Autophagosomes subsequently fuse with the lysosomal compartment where the inner membrane and the cargo are eventually degraded."

However, it has become clear that autophagy can be highly selective and even exclusive when induced by the presence of intracellular cargo material (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</a>). Substances including aggregated proteins, cytosolic pathogens and damaged or surplus organelles have all been shown to be selectively degraded by autophagy (<a href=\"#bib24\">Khaminets et al., 2016</a>). Autophagy thereby protects the organism from pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration, cancer and infection (<a href=\"#bib36\">Levine and Kroemer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011</a>). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i> the cytoplasm-to-vacuole-targeting (Cvt) pathway mediates the delivery of the oligomeric prApe1 enzyme as well as Ams1 and Ape4 into the vacuole via small autophagosomes that are referred to as Cvt vesicles (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</a>)."

The interaction of the cargo receptors with Atg8-family proteins is mediated by LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pankiv et al., 2007</a><a href=\"#bib19\">;Ichimura et al., 2008</a>)\u00a0also known as Atg8 interacting motifs (AIMs) in the cargo receptors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib48\">Noda et al., 2010</a>). Atg8-family proteins are ubiquitin-like proteins that are conjugated to the headgroup of the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) rendering the otherwise soluble proteins membrane-bound (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ichimura et al., 2000</a>). This conjugation reaction is also referred to as lipidation. The Atg8 conjugation cascade is analogous to the chain of reactions that mediate the conjugation of ubiquitin to its substrates. Thus, Atg8 is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7 under consumption of ATP and subsequently transferred to the E2-like enzyme Atg3 from which Atg8 is ultimately transferred to the headgroup of PE (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ichimura et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Klionsky and Schulman, 2014</a>). This last step is strongly facilitated by a complex composed of the Atg12~Atg5 protein conjugate and Atg16. The Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex acts in\u00a0an E3-like manner and determines the site of Atg8 conjugation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fujita et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hanada et al., 2007</a>). The Atg8 conjugation machinery acts in concert with other proteins of the autophagic machinery including the Atg1/ULK1 complex, the class III PI3K complex 1, Atg9 and the WIPIs to mediate the efficient generation of autophagosomes or Cvt vesicles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dooley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fujita et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Juris et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Komatsu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kraft et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mizushima et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sou et al., 2008</a>). The precise mechanisms by which the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex\u00a0and\u00a0Atg8 aid the formation, elongation or closure of the autophagosomal membranes are unclear."

Here we show that the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Atg19 and Atg34 as well as the human p62, Optineurin and NDP52 cargo receptors interact with the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex. Employing Atg19 as a model in a fully reconstituted system we show that it is capable of recruiting Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 to the prApe1 cargo. This recruitment is mediated by a direct interaction of the AIM motifs in Atg19 with the Atg5 subunit. In our in vitro system the recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is sufficient to drive accumulation of lipidated Atg8 at the cargo. Since the interaction of the Atg19 cargo receptor with the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is outcompeted by Atg8, the system may have an inherent directionality whereby the final product in form of Atg8~PE could displace the upstream conjugation machinery at the concave side of the isolation membrane."

We therefore asked if autophagic cargo receptors could interact with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 E3-like complex and thereby recruit it to the cargo. Indeed, in pull down experiments GST-Atg19 used as a bait successfully pulled down Atg12~Atg5-Atg16, demonstrating a direct interaction between these two components (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In a complementary approach we imaged the recruitment of Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry to beads coated with GST-Atg19 under equilibrium condition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry was robustly and specifically recruited to these beads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The \u03b1-mannosidase (Ams1) receptor Atg34 was also able to bind the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting that this interaction is a more general property of cargo receptors. In order to test if this interaction occurs in cells we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using Atg5-TAP to pull down 6xmyc-Atg19 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Atg19 was specifically pulled down by Atg5-TAP. Employing the M-Track assay, which is based on the methylation of the human histone 3 N-terminus by the human SUV39H1 methyltransferase when the two components come into close contact (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brezovich et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zuzuarregui et al., 2012</a>), we confirmed that Atg19 and the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex are in close proximity in living cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). It was previously shown that overexpression of a methyltransferase does not result in unspecific methylation of the histone 3 N-terminus (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brezovich et al., 2015</a>). Next, we tested if the interaction of cargo receptors with the E3-like complex is conserved. To this end, we co-expressed human GFP-ATG5 and mCherry-p62 in HeLa cells in which the endogenous p62 had been knocked-down by RNAi. mCherry-p62 was efficiently co-precipitated by GFP-ATG5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We confirmed this result by using a microscopy-based assay in which we imaged the recruitment of mCherry-p62 to GFP-ATG5 coated beads in HeLa cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We extended this analysis by investigating other human cargo receptors and found that NDP52 was also pulled down by GFP-ATG5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). In addition, we detected a weak but consistent co-precipitation of Optineurin (OPTN) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). In summary, the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Atg19 and Atg34 cargo receptors directly interact with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 E3-like enzyme and an interaction with this complex is also detectable for the human cargo receptors p62, OPTN and NDP52."

Atg5 and Atg5-Atg16 showed robust interaction with all Atg19 truncations including the C-terminal domain encompassing amino acids 365\u2013415 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). The presence of Atg12, either in context of the Atg12~Atg5 conjugate or the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex, changed the properties of the interaction and required the presence of amino acids 124\u2013254, which include the cargo binding domain of Atg19 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yamasaki et al., 2016</a>). We corroborated the results of the pull down experiments for the full Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex in a microscopy-based assay under equilibrium conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This assay confirmed that the coiled-coil domain of Atg19 is required for the interaction when Atg5 is conjugated to Atg12 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). To interrogate the role of the C-terminal region of Atg19 we performed further microscopy-based interaction experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Consistent with the pull down experiments the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex bound strongly to full length Atg19 but not to the isolated C-terminus (amino acids 365\u2013415) (compare\u00a0<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and G</a>) . Intriguingly, deletion of the last eight amino acids containing the canonical AIM motif (<a href=\"#bib47\">Noda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>) from the C-terminus of Atg19 strongly reduced the interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) suggesting that this AIM motif contributes to the interaction of Atg19 with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex. Next, we further dissected the contribution of the AIM motifs in the Atg19 C-terminus to the interaction with Atg5. While deletion of the canonical AIM motif in the extreme C-terminus resulted in strong but incomplete reduction in Atg5 binding, further mutation of two additional AIM-like sequences (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abert et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>) completely abolished the interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The AIM-dependent association of Atg19 with Atg5 is relevant for the interaction of the two proteins in vivo as the W412A mutation in the canonical AIM motif of Atg19 results in markedly reduced interaction of the two proteins in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

To test this possibility, we immobilized the C-terminus of Atg19 on beads and added Atg5-mCherry-Atg16 (1\u201346). Subsequently, we added GFP-Atg8 or Atg8 to the beads and determined the signal of Atg5-mCherry-Atg16 (1\u201346) on the beads (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Indeed, Atg8 outcompeted the Atg19-bound Atg5-mCherry-Atg16 (1\u201346) in a dose dependent manner. The loss of the Atg5-mCherry signal correlated with an increased GFP-Atg8 signal at the bead (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Thus, the interaction of Atg5 with the C-terminus of Atg19 is AIM-dependent and mutually exclusive with Atg8 binding. Next, we asked if the interaction of Atg19 with Atg5 is also mutually exclusive with the Atg19 - Atg8 interaction in the context of the entire Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and when Atg19 is bound to the prApe1 cargo. First, we generated cargo mimetic beads by attaching the prApe1 propeptide to them via a GST-tag. Consistent with previous results Atg19 was robustly recruited to these beads (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pfaffenwimmer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>). Next we tested if Atg19 recruited the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the artificial cargo. Indeed, the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex showed a strong Atg19 dependent signal at the beads (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Employing this experimental setup, we then went on by adding GFP-Atg8 to the cargo mimetic beads (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). The complex was displaced in a concentration dependent manner confirming that Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 and Atg8 compete for the same binding sites on Atg19."

Moreover, the interaction of Atg19 with Atg5 and Atg8 is mutually exclusive, strongly suggesting that the AIM motifs in Atg19 directly interact with Atg5. To identify potential binding sites in Atg5 for the AIM motif we employed computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, we used the structure of Atg5-Atg16\u00a0(1\u201346) from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (PDB:2DYO) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Matsushita et al., 2007</a>) and performed molecular dynamics simulations which allowed us to capture the flexibility of the Atg5-Atg16 (1\u201346) complex.

Modelling analysis suggested three possible binding sites for the peptide, two of which mapped to Atg5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>) and one to a site formed by Atg16. Since our pull down experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) did not detect any direct interaction of Atg16 with Atg19 the latter site was excluded from further analysis. The other two sites were analyzed. Both contained residues that were persistently involved in forming salt bridges and/or hydrogen bonds with the TWEEL peptide. These were K57 and K137 in the first binding site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, pose 1) and N84 and R208 in the second binding site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, pose 2). These two sites show a similar architecture composed of a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by positively charged residues. Specifically, molecular dynamics simulations showed that the hydrophobic pocket serves to dock W412 and L415 of the TWEEL peptide, while lysine, arginine and asparagine residues on the surface of Atg5 contact the peptide via salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the glutamic acid residues E413 and E414. Structural superposition showed that the two sites are unrelated to the AIM-binding sites of Atg8 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The wild type Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry complex robustly localized to the beads. Introduction of the K57E into Atg5 resulted in a strongly reduced recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex, while the N84E mutation rendered the recruitment undetectable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). When combined, the two mutations also resulted in a loss of Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry complex recruitment to the beads. Thus, introducing negative charge at positions 57 and 84 in the two predicted AIM binding sites interfered with the interaction of the two proteins. These residues are therefore likely to be directly involved in the formation of binding sites for the AIM motif. Interestingly, in the context of the Atg12~Atg5 conjugate N84 in pose two would be largely covered by Atg12 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This may explain why the C-terminal domain of Atg19 containing the AIM motif is not sufficient for the interaction with Atg12~Atg5 and requires the coiled-coil domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013G</a>), which may reorient Atg12 away from pose 2."

The K57E,N84E double mutant Atg5 showed a strongly reduced ability to interact with Atg19, but the interaction was still detectable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). It was previously shown that Atg16 interacts with Atg21 and that this interaction recruits the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Juris et al., 2015</a>). We therefore asked if the residual interaction of the K57E,N84E mutant Atg5 with Atg19 could be dependent on the recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the PAS by Atg21. To this end, we introduced the E102A mutation into Atg16, which was reported to abolish the Atg16 - Atg21 interaction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Juris et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, the interaction of the Atg5 K57E,N84E with Atg19 became undetectable in context of the Atg16 E102A mutation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

The cargo receptor - E3 interaction might therefore be a minimal axis to couple Atg8 conjugation to the cargo. To test this hypothesis, we developed a fully reconstituted system to recapitulate these reactions. In analogy to the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, we added the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to cargo mimetic beads bound by Atg19. The Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex directly binds to membranes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Romanov et al., 2012</a>) and it may thus be able to link membranes and the cargo. To test this, we added small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) labeled by the incorporation of ATTO390-PE or Rhodamine to Atg19-bound cargo mimetic beads in the presence or absence of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The SUVs were recruited to the beads in an Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The complexes containing the Atg19 binding defective mutants of Atg5 were less efficiently recruited to cargo mimetic beads and were also less efficient in membrane recruitment (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, the complex brings the membrane substrate for Atg8 conjugation in proximity of the cargo. Next we analyzed if this minimal system would allow local accumulation of conjugated Atg8 by adding the ubiquitin-like molecule GFP-Atg8, the E1-like enzyme Atg7, the E2-like enzyme Atg3, and the cofactors MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP to the system. Intriguingly, GFP-Atg8 showed increased signal at the cargo in the presence of ATP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We also detected an increased signal for the membrane and the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), likely due to its association with Atg8 and the membranes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kaufmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Romanov et al., 2012</a>). Since the presence of ATP increased the GFP-Atg8 signal at the beads, this effect may be due to lipidation of Atg8 and thus its stable anchoring and concentration on the membranes. If so, then the lipidated Atg8 should be more strongly bound by the Atg19 receptor (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abert et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>). To test this, we conducted FRAP experiments on the cargo mimetic beads (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Indeed, Atg8 recovered more slowly in the presence of ATP and recovery was slowest for the Atg8 positive puncta, which we interpret as larger Atg8-positive vesicular structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Future work will have to elucidate the biochemical details of the interaction of the human cargo receptors with ATG5 and the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L complex. It is possible that this interaction is at least for p62 in part mediated indirectly by ALFY since it interacts with p62 and ATG5 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Filimonenko et al., 2010</a>). A similar mechanism has been described for <i>C. elegans</i> where EPG-7 binds both, p62/SQST-1 and ATG12/LGG-3 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lin et al., 2013</a>)."

When bound to their respective cargo, cargo receptors cluster and provide a high-avidity binding platform that recruits the autophagy machinery, including the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex. This machinery is able to bring and keep membranes in close proximity to the cargo and to act catalytically by promoting several rounds of Atg8 conjugation. Consistent with the idea of local Atg8 lipidation the E2-like Atg3 enzyme localizes to the site of autophagosome formation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ngu et al., 2015</a>). The Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is able to directly bind lipids (<a href=\"#bib54\">Romanov et al., 2012</a>) and thus it may link the cargo to the membrane. However, in vivo additional interactions with PROPPINs/WIPIs will render the system more robust (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dooley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Juris et al., 2015</a>)."

At the same time the AIM motifs of Atg19 may keep the Atg8-coated isolation membrane close to the cargo excluding non-cargo material from incorporation into selective autophagosomes (4).

In conflict with this hypothesis is the finding that the signal of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex at the bead was not decreased upon addition of ATP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We interpret this result with the previously described interactions of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex with the membrane and lipidated Atg8 on the convex side (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kaufmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Romanov et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with exclusion of Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 from the concave side of the isolation membrane, the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is excluded from the autophagosomal lumen in vivo (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mizushima et al., 2003</a>). On the concave side Atg8 may be subsequently bound with high avidity by the cargo receptors, which could result in close apposition of the membrane and the cargo and thus exclusion of non-cargo material from the autophagosome (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abert et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wurzer et al., 2015</a>). As a consequence, this mechanism would localize the Atg8 conjugation machinery to the highly curved edge of the membrane where the isolation membrane has not yet formed, which may additionally stimulate Atg8 conjugation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nath et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the intricate AIM/LIR-based interplay between the cargo, the cargo receptors, the Atg8 conjugation machinery and Atg8 may serve to confer directionality to the Atg8 lipidation resulting in robust membrane growth exclusively around the cargo. In vivo, this may occur at a permissive site such as the vacuole or the endoplasmic reticulum (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lamb et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</a>)."

Subsequently, the dried lipids were rehydrated with liposome buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl and 1 mM DTT) for 15 min. The lipids were resuspended by tapping and gently sonicated for 2 min in a water bath sonicator. The resuspended SUVs were then extruded 21 times through 0.4 \u03bcm membrane followed by extrusion through a 0.1 \u03bcm membrane (Whatman, Nucleopore,\u00a0UK) using the Mini Extruder from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.. The final SUVs suspension has a concentration of 1 mg lipids/ml buffer. SUVs are stable for 2\u20133 days when stored at 4\u00b0C."

In order to capture the flexibility of the protein, molecular dynamics simulations were used to generate an ensemble of protein structures. These simulations, as well as the preparatory energy minimizations, were performed using GROMOS11 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schmid et al., 2012</a>) in combination with the Gromos force field 54a8 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Reif et al., 2012</a>). Initially, the Atg5-Atg16 complex was minimized in vacuum using steepest descent for 2000 steps. Subsequently, the complex was solvated in a rectangular box with 22,250 SPC water molecules (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berendsen et al., 1981</a>). The overall system was electrostatically neutral and therefore no ions were added. The solvent configurations were relaxed with another round of energy minimization where the solute atoms were position-restrained. Initial random velocities were drawn from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 50 K. Position restraints on the solute atoms were applied with an initial force constant of 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup> kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> nm<sup>\u22122</sup>. With each step of equilibration performed at constant volume, the temperature was increased by 50 K, the force constant of the position restraints was reduced by a factor of 10 and the system was simulated for 20 ps. The final equilibration step was simulated for 40 ps at 298 K, without any position restraints. After these equilibration steps, the system was simulated for 1 ns at a constant temperature of 298 K using weak coupling at constant volume (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berendsen et al., 1984</a>). Two separate temperature baths were used for the solute and solvent and the relaxation time was set to 0.1 ps. All bond lengths were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ryckaert et al., 1977</a>) with a geometric accuracy of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22124</sup>, which enabled the use of a two fs time step. The center of mass translation motion was removed every 1000 steps. A triple range cut-off scheme was used to calculate the non-bonded interactions and a pair-list was generated every fifth time step. Interactions within 0.8 nm were calculated at every time step, whereas the interactions between 0.8 and 1.4 nm were evaluated only when the pair-list was updated and kept constant at intermediate time steps. The interactions beyond 1.4 nm were approximated by a reaction field contribution, representing a homogeneous medium with a dielectric constant of 61, as appropriate for SPC water molecules (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heinz et al., 2001</a>)."

The initial configuration of Atg5-Atg16, as well as ten snapshots obtained from the simulation (sampled every 100 ps) were used to take the flexibility of the proteins into account during the subsequent docking procedure. The C-terminal peptide TWEEL of Atg19 was modeled with NH and COO<sup>-</sup> termini. The NH terminus was chosen to represent the NH group of the peptide bond that would be present in the complete Atg19. AutoDock Vina (<a href=\"#bib63\">Trott and Olson, 2010</a>) was used to dock the peptide into the configurations of the Atg5-Atg16 complex. The exhaustiveness was set to 50 and the search space was defined such that the whole complex was searched. The peptide was completely flexible during the docking process, whereas the Atg5-Atg16 complex was kept rigid. For each of the configurations of Atg5-Atg16, the nine best poses of TWEEL were evaluated. The docking results were manually examined in order to discard any poses in which the Thr amino acid of the peptide was completely buried. These poses would not be possible with the complete Atg19 and are therefore not of interest. Three major interaction sites were found to be reoccurring in multiple snapshots of the Atg5-Atg16 complex. One of them involved residues of both Atg5 and Atg16. Since the focus of the present study was identification of the interactions of TWEEL with Atg5, this interaction site was no longer considered. For other binding sites, the hydrogen bonding patterns were examined for all the poses of the docked peptide in all of the configurations of Atg5-Atg16. Generally, several configurations of the peptide were found in each of the binding sites, but here we focused on the residues that were most prone to be involved in salt bridges or hydrogen bonds to the TWEEL peptide. The first binding site, which was also found in the initial configuration of the Atg5-Atg16 complex, was characterized by persistent salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between the glutamic acids of the peptide with K57 and K137. In the second binding site, the residues N84 and R208 were the ones that were most often involved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with TWEEL."

In order to corroborate this result, we went a step further and investigated the Atg5 \u2013 Atg19 interaction in context of the Atg16 E102A mutation. This mutation is based on a previous finding by Juris et al., 2015, EMBOJ (PMID: 25691244) reporting that Atg21 recruits Atg16 to the PAS during the Cvt pathway and that the E102A mutation in Atg16 impairs the Atg16 \u2013 Atg21 interaction. We reasoned that this interaction may indirectly stabilize the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 \u2013 Atg19 complex. Indeed, we found an even further decrease of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 \u2013 Atg19 interaction in context of the Atg16 E102A mutation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."
