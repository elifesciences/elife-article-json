The hippocampus, however, has been treated as a unitary structure in anxiety and fear research despite mounting evidence that different hippocampal subregions have specialized roles in other cognitive domains. Using novel cell-type- and region-specific conditional knockouts of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor \u03b12 subunit, we demonstrate that inhibition of the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus or CA3 via \u03b12-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (\u03b12GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) is required to suppress anxiety, while the inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is required to suppress fear responses. We further show that the diazepam-modulation of hippocampal theta activity shows certain parallels with our behavioral findings, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed behavioral effects. Thus, our findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the regulation of anxiety versus fear by hippocampal microcircuitry."

The hippocampus, however, has been treated as a unitary structure in anxiety and fear research despite mounting evidence that different hippocampal subregions have specialized roles in other cognitive domains. Using novel cell-type- and region-specific conditional knockouts of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor \u03b12 subunit, we demonstrate that inhibition of the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus or CA3 via \u03b12-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (\u03b12GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) is required to suppress anxiety, while the inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is required to suppress fear responses. We further show that the diazepam-modulation of hippocampal theta activity shows certain parallels with our behavioral findings, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed behavioral effects. Thus, our findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the regulation of anxiety versus fear by hippocampal microcircuitry."

Evidence suggests that slightly different areas of the brain control fear and anxiety, but much remains unknown about the specific brain regions that help to regulate these two emotional states."

The mice completed tests that stimulated anxiety or fear, some while under the influence of the anxiety and fear-reducing drug diazepam. Notably, diazepam failed to reduce fear in animals that lacked the inhibitory receptor protein in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, suggesting that this subregion participates in the fear response. However, mice that lacked the receptor in the dentate gyrus or CA3 responded normally to the drug (they showed reduced fear when given diazepam)."

Reducing the expression of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs later than approximately 2\u20133 weeks postnatally typically causes no baseline anxiety phenotype (<a href=\"#bib7\">Earnheart et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2012</a>), in line with the concept of a developmental origin of anxiety (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gross et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gross and Hen, 2004</a>). The cre driver lines used in the current study express cre recombinase later in development, and our conditional knockout mice display no spontaneous anxiety or fear phenotype. To assess which part of intrahippocampal circuitry is essential for modulation of anxiety and fear, we thus used a mixed genetic-pharmacological approach: We systemically administered a nonselective positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, known to induce anxiolysis and fear reduction, in cell type- and region-specific \u03b12 knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate a double-dissociation within the HPC with regards to fear and anxiety, where inhibition of CA3 and DG is required for anxiolysis, while the inhibition of CA1 is required for the reduction of fear."

The expression of other GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits in the regions of interest was largely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s3\"> <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).</a>"

In EPM, enhancing GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated responses with diazepam increased open arm activity in \u03b12F/F and \u03b12CA1KO, but not in \u03b12CA3KO or \u03b12DGKO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, Sect. 1). While the diazepam effects were clear in \u03b12F/F and \u03b12CA1KO mice, the lack of these effects especially in \u03b12CA3KO mice was partially due to an increase in percent open arm time in the vehicle condition, as well as a decrease in the same measure in the diazepam condition. To clarify these findings, we repeated this test with mice this time bred on a 129X1/SvJ background under slightly different testing conditions (see Methods; the conditional knockouts bred on the 129X1/SvJ background show similar distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b12 subunits as the C57BL/6J; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Differences between vehicle-treated groups were smaller in this strain, and yet the pattern of diazepam effects were identical to those reported with the C57BL/6J strain, with significant anxiolytic-like effects in \u03b12F/F and \u03b12CA1KO, but not in \u03b12CA3KO or \u03b12DGKO mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, Sect. 1\u2019)."

While it complicates the interpretation of the data, this effect of diazepam in C57BL/6J mice was documented previously (<a href=\"#bib40\">Smith et al., 2011</a>). It should be noted that the startle magnitudes in \u201ctone+startle\u201d condition in diazepam-treated groups was not bound by a ceiling effect, as magnitudes up to 10a.u.\u2019s were observed; thus, the reduction in% FPS in diazepam-treated \u03b12F/F, \u03b12CA3KO and \u03b12DGKO mice is not simply a result of the increased startle in the \u201cstartle stimulus only\u201d condition.

Thus, we chose the VCT, which does not rely on long-term memory (although effects of within-session working memory cannot be eliminated), as our second test of fear. In VCT, water-deprived animals are allowed to drink from a spout which delivers electric shocks to the tongue, creating a conflict between the desire to drink and the desire to avoid a painful stimulus. A reduction in fear of the shock is reflected in increased drinking in the presence of shock. When drinking was unpunished, we found no difference between genotypes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, Sect. 2). In contrast, on test day (punished drinking; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, Sect. 2) elevation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity by diazepam significantly increased punished drinking in \u03b12F/F, \u03b12CA3KO and \u03b12DGKO mice. Similar to FPS, the fear-reducing effect of diazepam was abolished in \u03b12CA1KO mice. We also tested the possible effects of diazepam on unpunished drinking and found no nonspecific effects on water consumption (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Our findings suggest that the double dissociation observed between FPS/VCT and EPM/LDB is likely due to a divergence in the HPC circuitry mediating fear versus anxiety rather than being a consequence of the involvement of memory processes."

                                "text": "Previous studies linked theta range oscillations in the HPC to behavioral manifestations of anxiety. For instance, theta activity is enhanced in the ventral HPC (vHPC) with anxiety (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adhikari et al., 2010</a>) and pharmacological manipulations that reduce anxiety also reduce the frequency of HPC theta elicited by brain stem stimulation (<a href=\"#bib31\">McNaughton et al., 1986</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">McNaughton and Coop, 1991</a> , <a href=\"#bib9\">Engin et al., 2009</a> , <a href=\"#bib50\">Yeung et al., 2012</a> see also <a href=\"#bib47\">Wells et al., 2013</a>). GABAergic anxiolytic drugs additionally reduce the slope of the function that relates brain stem stimulation current to theta frequency (<a href=\"#bib30\">McNaughton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Engin et al., 2008</a>). As our tests of anxiety indicated that increasing GABA<sub>A</sub>R function can reduce anxiety in control and \u03b12CA1KO, but not in \u03b12CA3KO and \u03b12DGKO mice, we next tested whether the effect of these manipulations on HPC theta range activity is consistent with the observed behavioral effects. Whereas our genetic manipulations span the whole HPC, previous studies implicated specifically the vHPC in anxiety-related behaviors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bannerman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bannerman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</a>). Thus, we recorded separately from the dorsal (dHPC) and vHPC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), hypothesizing that the recordings from vHPC might be more closely linked to anxiety."

Strikingly, as increased GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity was achieved through a systemic pharmacological manipulation, our findings suggest that even if GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity is simultaneously increased in all other parts of the circuitry underlying anxiety and/or fear responses, such as the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis or the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tovote et al., 2015</a>) (and in the hippocampus via other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes), it is not sufficient to suppress anxiety and/or fear responses unless the corresponding HPC subregions are simultaneously inhibited via \u03b12GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors."

In \u03b12CA1KO mice, there are no significant changes in the expression of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b12 subunit protein in the cortex or the amygdala, although there is an apparent change in expression in especially the medial regions of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in some sections (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). While this raises the possibility that the effects (or the lack thereof) observed in \u03b12CA1KO mice may be partially due to changes in \u03b12 protein expression in the BLA, our findings from ongoing studies indicate that knocking down \u03b12GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the BLA leads to a completely different pattern of results than that observed in \u03b12CA1KO mice, making this possibility highly unlikely. Our findings also cannot be explained by confounding factors such as gross HPC dysfunction or nonspecific behavioral changes in the gene-targeted mice, as all genotypes showed normal baseline HPC function and response to diazepam, as measured by ex vivo electrophysiology (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and HPC-dependent behavioral tasks (trace and context fear conditioning, Morris water maze; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1)."

All classes of clinically effective anxiolytic compounds reduce the frequency of evoked HPC theta activity, with no known false positives or false negatives, making this a strong physiological marker of anxiolytic action (<a href=\"#bib30\">McNaughton et al., 2007</a>). While most systemic pharmacological manipulations that reduce anxiety also reduce fear, previous studies did not investigate whether the effects of anxiolytic and fear-reducing manipulations on theta range activity may be distinct in this specific model. There is some evidence, however, suggesting that theta range activity recorded from dHPC may be more relevant for fear, while vHPC theta may be more relevant for anxiety. For instance, theta range activity recorded from dHPC in CA1 and the amygdala is synchronized during expression of conditioned fear responses, but not during anxiety-related responses (<a href=\"#bib36\">Seidenbecher et al., 2003</a>). Conversely, in recordings from vHPC, increases in theta power and synchrony with mPFC in the theta band were observed during the exploration of anxiogenic arenas, while this was not the case for recordings from the dHPC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adhikari et al., 2010</a>). In a similar vein, we report that diazepam effects on vHPC theta were reduced in \u03b12CA3KO and \u03b12DGKO mice, while effects on dHPC theta were reduced in \u03b12CA1KO mice, in parallel with the effects observed in behavioral tests of anxiety and fear, respectively. While our knockouts mostly span the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, these findings also point to the possibility that CA1 in the dHPC may be important for fear, while CA3 and DG in the vHPC may be important for anxiety, integrating our findings with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bannerman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</a>)."

However, despite concentrated efforts in the last 15 years to understand the roles of different HPC subregions in cognitive processes (e.g., (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakazawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tsien et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kesner, 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kesner, 2013b</a>), and a shift in the focus of anxiety and fear research towards within-structure microcircuits and specific neuronal populations (e.g., <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Botta et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">Tye et al., 2011</a>), a systematic analysis of the regulation of fear and anxiety by HPC microcircuitry had so far not been conducted. Our experiments extend previous research, which to a large extent treated the HPC as a unitary structure except anatomical distinctions along its septo-temporal axis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</a>), and ignored the possible specialization within the microcircuitry of the HPC. Furthermore, the distinction between anxiety and fear, and whether they are processes mediated by distinct neurocircuitry, has been a controversial question (<a href=\"#bib34\">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</a>). Here we show that anxiety and fear, distinguished via experimental conditions that cause each state (we operationally define \u201ctests of fear\u201d as those involving a distinct harmful stimulus; e.g., an electric shock), are mediated by distinct subregions within the HPC, lending further credence to the distinction between the two states and the overlapping but distinct neurobiological underpinnings of fear and anxiety. In conclusion, in addition to demonstrating a surprisingly essential role of the hippocampus in the pharmacological modulation of anxiety and fear, our study indicates distinct molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of two distinct negative valence systems (i.e., anxiety and fear), and provides defined cellular entry points into neuronal circuitry underlying complex behavioral states."

Geometric shapes affixed to the walls served as extra-maze cues. Mice were given 4 trials per day, released from a different quadrant each trial, with the platform location constant. A trial ended either 10\u2009s after the mouse reached the platform, or 60\u2009s after the start of the trial, with the experimenter guiding the mouse to the platform. On probe trials, the platform was removed and the mice were left in the pool for 120\u00a0s, and average distance to the platform during this time was measured using the tracking feature of EthoVision XT (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). Probe trials were followed by 4 training trials. Following the probe test on Day 12, the platform was moved from the original location to the nearest quadrant (i.e., Reversal) and mice were given the training session with this new platform location from this point on. The mice were placed in a cage with shredded paper towels under a heat lamp until they were dry before being returned to their home cage at the end of testing."

Local field potentials were recorded using two concentric stainless steel bipolar electrodes (NE-100X, Rhodes Medical Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA) lowered into the dorsal (\u22121.94\u2009mm AP, 1.5\u2009mm LM, and -1.4\u2009mm DV) and ventral (\u22123.16\u2009mm AP, 3.0\u2009mm LM, and -4.2\u00a0mm DV) portions of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib33\">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</a>). Anterior-posterior and medial-lateral coordinates were measured from bregma, while depth was calculated relative to brain surface. Additionally, a bipolar concentric stimulating electrode (NE-100X, Rhodes Medical Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA) was lowered into the nucleus pontis oralis (nPO; -4.0\u2009mm AP, 1.2\u2009mm ML, and -3.3\u2009mm DV). Local field potentials were amplified using an A-M System (Carlsborg, WA) with filters set between 1 and 500\u2009Hz. The signals were digitized at a rate of 1 kHz, and stored for subsequent analysis using Spike2 software package, version 7 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Electrical stimulation of the nPO consisted of a train of 0.3 ms square pulses delivered over 6\u2009s at a rate of 250\u2009Hz, and was provided by an Isoflex stimulus-isolator (A.M.P.I. Instruments, Jerusalem, Israel). The 6-s stimulation periods were repeated with an interval of 100\u2009s; stimulating current began at 0.02 mA, and increased in 0.02 mA increments with successive stimulations, until a maximum of 0.10 mA was reached. In this way, a stimulus\u2013response was obtained over a total period of 10\u2009min. This pattern of stimulation was repeated without interruption for the duration of each experiment, and the first two stimulation trains were averaged to give baseline values. Fast Fourier transform analysis was performed on the last 5\u2009s of the EEG during each 6-s stimulation period. The first second during stimulation was not included to avoid stimulus artifact (<a href=\"#bib35\">Scott et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Siok et al., 2009</a>). During the analysis, least squares linear regression lines were fitted to the baseline stimulation amplitude \u2013 theta frequency data of each mouse separately for ventral and dorsal hippocampal recordings. Animals where increasing stimulation failed to cause a linear frequency response (R<sup>2</sup> values &lt; 0.50) were excluded from further analysis (For ventral hippocampus: 2 \u03b12F/F, 1 \u03b12CA3KO, 2 \u03b12DGKO mice; for dorsal hippocampus: 3 \u03b12F/F, 1 \u03b12CA1KO, 1 \u03b12CA3O, 2 \u03b12DGKO mice). As noted above, a mix of male and female mice were used in the analyses (Specifically, 2 female \u03b12F/F and 2 female \u03b12CA1KO mice were used in addition to males due to difficulties in breeding the required number of male mice). While behaviorally there are substantial differences between male and female mice, the hippocampal theta recordings from the female mice did not show any differences from the male and none of the mice that were excluded from the analyses due to not meeting the above-noted criteria were females."

Peak theta frequency was measured for each animal by determining where the peak power occurred in the 4\u20138\u2009Hz frequency band of the power spectrum at a frequency resolution of approximately 0.24\u2009Hz. Stimulating current inducing theta oscillation between 6\u20137\u2009Hz frequencies was selected for power analysis.

The EPM test in the Smith et al. (<a href=\"#bib39\">Smith et al., 2012</a>) study uses the same background and test parameters as the EPM test on C57Bl/6J mice in the current study. Thus, the mean and standard deviation values in the control group of the Smith et al. (<a href=\"#bib39\">Smith et al., 2012</a>) study were used in a power analysis to calculate sample sizes for all tests of anxiety used in the current study (Mean 1: 0.40, Mean 2: 0.80, Standard deviation values between 0.14\u20130.18, alpha: 0.05, intended power: 0.80, which yielded target sample sizes of 8\u201313). Similarly, the FPS test values for control mice in the same study were used to calculate sample sizes for all tests of fear in the current study (Mean 1: 0.45, Mean 2: 0.80, Standard deviation values between 0.24\u20130.31, alpha: 0.05, intended power: 0.80, which yielded target sample sizes of 7\u201313). A sample size per group of 4\u20138 mice was chosen as the group size for in vivo electrophysiology experiments based on earlier studies measuring hippocampal theta oscillations in mice using similar parameters, in which these sample sizes yielded a statistical power of 0.80 or above (<a href=\"#bib35\">Scott et al., 2012</a>). Following the exclusion of mice based on criteria explained above (see Materials and methods \u2013 In vivo electrophysiology), eventual sample sizes of 3\u20135 mice were used in statistical analyses."

There is also reason to believe that \u03b12 expression levels may be different between the two strains e.g., SD Schlussman et al., 2013 Brain Res 1523: 49-58 shows that a different 129 strain, 129P3/J, has higher \u03b12 mRNA expression compared to C57BL/6J) Other studies (MK Mulligan et al., 2012 PLoS ONE 7: e34586; R.W. Overall et al., 2009 Front Neurosci 3: 55) indicated that the C57BL/6J mice had the lowest level of \u03b12 mRNA expression in the hippocampus out of 99 studied inbred strains. As repeating all experiments in the 129X1/SvJ strain is not practically possible, we have now included immunostaining for \u03b12 subunit with the conditional knockouts on the 129X1/SvJ background to at least demonstrate the pattern of knockouts in these mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Please note that as the immunohistochemical procedures were not carried out in parallel, it is not possible to make direct comparisons of staining intensity between the sections shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and those in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Thus, any apparent differences between C57 and 129 sections in terms of overall staining intensity in these figures are arbitrary. However, all sections shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> were processed in parallel and can be directly compared to each other. As seen, the pattern of knockdowns is highly similar to those observed in C57BL/6J animals. This is now also noted in the text (Results; Behavioral Tests of Anxiety). The only test that was carried out in the 129X1/SvJ strain was the LDB, while EPM was conducted in both strains in separate experiments, with comparable results."

It should be noted that the quantification of neither the immunohistochemistry nor the RT-PCR data indicates a significant reduction in the amygdala, making it unlikely that the effects observed in \u03b12CA1KO mice are due to expression changes in the amygdala. Furthermore, in an ongoing study, we are investigating the effects of a basolateral amygdala selective knockdown of \u03b12GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in anxiety and fear-related behaviors. The pattern of effects observed when \u03b12GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression is significantly reduced in the BLA is very distinct from those observed in \u03b12CA1KO mice (e.g., lack of a diazepam effect in EPM; baseline% FPS significantly reduced to almost zero). As these studies are ongoing, we are unfortunately unable to report the results here, but we have mentioned that these studies reveal a distinct pattern of effects in our Discussion per the suggestion of the editors."
