Here, we provide evidence that ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly to maintain actomyosin contractility and cell proliferation and that their loss leads to cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. This phenotype arises from down-regulation of the essential cell-cycle proteins CyclinA, CKS1 and CDK1. Accordingly, while the loss of either <i>Rock1</i> or <i>Rock2</i> had no negative impact on tumorigenesis in mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, loss of both blocked tumor formation, as no tumors arise in which both <i>Rock1</i> and <i>Rock2</i> have been genetically deleted. Our results reveal an indispensable role for ROCK, yet redundant role for isoforms 1 and 2, in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, possibly through the maintenance of cellular contractility."

Here, we provide evidence that ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly to maintain actomyosin contractility and cell proliferation and that their loss leads to cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. This phenotype arises from down-regulation of the essential cell-cycle proteins CyclinA, CKS1 and CDK1. Accordingly, while the loss of either <i>Rock1</i> or <i>Rock2</i> had no negative impact on tumorigenesis in mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, loss of both blocked tumor formation, as no tumors arise in which both <i>Rock1</i> and <i>Rock2</i> have been genetically deleted. Our results reveal an indispensable role for ROCK, yet redundant role for isoforms 1 and 2, in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, possibly through the maintenance of cellular contractility."

                        "text": "The Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein serine/threonine kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 are downstream effectors of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases. They are activated by interaction with Rho GTPases and act through a number of pathways to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and thus cell migration, cell-cell adhesion and cancer cell invasion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Itoh et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Olson and Sahai, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Thumkeo et al., 2013</a>). Substrates for ROCKs include the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1) and the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC), which regulate actomyosin contractile forces (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kawano et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kureishi et al., 1997</a>). Actomyosin contractility is generated when myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) is phosphorylated, allowing myosin II interaction with actin filaments to generate mechanical force (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aksoy et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kureishi et al., 1997</a>). ROCKs may either directly phosphorylate MLC (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amano et al., 1996</a>) or indirectly regulate MLC phosphorylation by phosphorylating the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1) and inactivating it (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kimura et al., 1996</a>). Myosin phosphatase inactivation results from phosphorylation of two inhibitory sites, Thr696 and Thr850, on MYPT1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feng et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kawano et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Muranyi et al., 2005</a>). Furthermore, ROCKs phosphorylate and activate LIM kinases 1 and 2 (LIMK1, 2), which inhibit the actin-depolymerizing protein Cofilin (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yang et al., 1998</a>). ROCK1 and 2 exhibit 65% overall identity and 87% within the kinase domain, and some studies suggest differential roles for the isoforms. Using RNA interference, ROCK1 was reported to be important for stress fiber formation in fibroblasts, whereas ROCK2 controls cortical contractility and phagocytosis (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yoneda et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">2007</a>). Distinct roles for ROCK1 and 2 have also been described in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lock and Hotchin, 2009</a>) and cell detachment (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shi et al., 2013</a>)."

Ninety\u00a0percent of <i>Rock2</i> null mice die in utero due to defects in the placental labyrinth layer. This indicates that ROCK1 cannot compensate for a loss of ROCK2. However, the few <i>Rock2</i> null mice, that are born, display defects similar to those described in <i>Rock1</i> null mice (<a href=\"#bib61\">Thumkeo et al., 2003</a>). This indicates some level of functional redundancy (<a href=\"#bib62\">Thumkeo et al., 2005</a>). In addition to their role in cell migration, ROCKs have been reported to modulate apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coleman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sebbagh et al., 2005</a>) and cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Croft and Olson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Samuel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). The precise role of ROCKs in cell proliferation is not clear: some reports suggest ROCK function is required for G1/S progression (<a href=\"#bib10\">Croft and Olson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), but others suggest ROCK is only required for anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sahai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Vigil et al., 2012</a>). One in vivo\u00a0study reported that over-activation of ROCK, by expressing the kinase domain of ROCK2 in mouse skin, led to hyperproliferation and epidermal thickening (<a href=\"#bib50\">Samuel et al., 2011</a>). In order to investigate the roles of ROCK1 and 2 in tumorigenesis, we have generated conditional <i>Rock1</i> and <i>2</i> knockout mice and studied these in vivo, using genetically engineered mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and <i>Braf<sup>V600</sup></i><sup>E</sup> mutant models of melanoma, as well as in vitro, using cells isolated from these mice."

Because <i>Rock</i> null mice die early due to developmental defects, we generated <i>Rock1</i> and <i>2</i> conditional alleles (<i>Rock1</i><sup>f</sup> and <i>Rock2</i><sup>f</sup>) by inserting LoxP sites flanking exon 6 in the <i>Rock1</i> locus and exons 5 and 6 in the <i>Rock2</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These exons are located within the kinase domain and their deletion results, through frameshifts, in the absence of ROCK proteins.

Depletion of ROCK1 and ROCK2 (<i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i>) resulted in a strong impairment of cell proliferation in vitro, which was not observed in cells lacking either ROCK1 (<i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i>) or ROCK2 (<i>Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), demonstrating that ROCK function is required for cell proliferation and that ROCK1 and ROCK2 act redundantly.

Cells treated for 48\u2009hr with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sasaki et al., 2002</a>) had reduced proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Similar results were observed with other ROCK inhibitors, such as GSK269962A, AT13148, GSK429286A and chroman1 (data not shown). However, the much-used ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Narumiya et al., 2000</a>) had a much weaker effect on cell proliferation than H1152 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This is consistent with previous studies, where we have shown that Y-27632 is a less effective ROCK inhibitor than H1152 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sadok et al., 2015</a>). To determine whether defects in proliferation were due to ROCK-mediated effects on actomyosin contractility, cells were treated with blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II ATPase, for 48\u2009hr. Treated cells displayed a similar proliferation defect to that observed in <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), arguing that the requirement for ROCK in cell proliferation is mediated through its role in maintaining actomyosin contractility."

The\u00a0cells were then treated with Ad-Cre or control virus and, 5 days later, injected subcutaneously and tumor growth monitored. No differences in tumor growth were observed when transformed MEFs, derived from <i>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup></i>or <i>Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></i> cells, infected with Ad-Cre were compared to control virus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>).

One of the most prominent responses to activated ROCK is the generation of actin stress fibers, which regulate cell shape (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amano et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ridley, 1999</a>). A previous report using RNA interference suggested that ROCK1, rather than ROCK2, is important for stress fiber formation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yoneda et al., 2005</a>). After thorough analysis of ROCK depletion upon infection with Ad-Cre or Ad-GFP, a slight decrease in protein levels was observed after three days\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). After four days a further reduction was seen and after five days both ROCK1 and 2 were depleted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>). Three days after infection with Ad-Cre, <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i> cells lacked stress fibers and displayed a \u2018tail retraction\u2019 phenotype, a well-known characteristic of ROCK inhibition (<a href=\"#bib57\">Somlyo et al., 2000</a>). Cells had long processes and defects in detaching their tails, in contrast to their controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>,<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). A similar phenotype was observed in cells treated with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 or the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin but not in cells lacking either ROCK1 (<i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i>) or ROCK2 (<i>Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). After five days, cells that lack both ROCK1 and ROCK2 had few apparent central stress fibers, unlike control cells, and surprisingly adopted a flat morphology (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>,<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). This phenotype seemed to appear gradually after prolonged loss of ROCK which was seen three days after adenovirus infection. Interestingly, when random motility was analyzed between Days 3 and 4 after adenovirus infection, using ImageJ to track cells, migration speed and directionality were significantly increased in cells lacking ROCK1 and 2 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Fewer double knockout than wild-type MEFs were in G1 or S phase, and a higher percentage of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The increased percentage may be due to the fact that binucleate cells in G1 will have the same DNA content as cells in G2/M. To investigate a potential cell cycle block, we treated <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup> </i>cells and their controls with nocodazole, commonly used to arrest cells with a G2/M phase DNA content (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blajeski et al., 2002</a>). In controls, nocodazole led to an increased proportion of cells with G2/M DNA content as expected (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup> </i>cells, however, distribution of cells in the three cell cycle phases is very similar between control treated and nocodazole treated cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). These data suggest that ROCK depletion causes a cell cycle block prior to G2/M. As there is an overall decrease in S phase cells, the block is likely to be in the G1 phase of the cell cycle."

                                "text": "We have shown that ROCK depletion or inhibition induces cellular senescence; therefore, we next investigated whether they affected key cell cycle proteins involved in senescence. Two major pathways are activated by senescence signals. Activation of the transcription factor Trp53 induces expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 1997</a>). The other pathway is induction of the CDKI p16, which prevents CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins, thereby blocking E2F-dependent transcription (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brenner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nevins, 2001</a>). To determine whether blockade of Rb or Trp53 function would overcome senescence resulting from abrogation of ROCK function, we stably infected <i>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></i>MEFs with simian virus 40 large T-antigen (SV40 Large T), which is known to inactivate the tumor suppressors Trp53 and Rb (<a href=\"#bib12\">DeCaprio et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kierstead and Tevethia, 1993</a>). The\u00a0cells were then infected with Ad-Cre, to generate <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup> </i>cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Inactivation of Trp53 and Rb did not prevent the senescence phenotype caused by loss of ROCK, and cells displayed a similar growth defect to the one observed in <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup> </i>MEFs without SV40 Large T (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To further confirm that the senescent phenotype did not involve activation of Trp53, MEFs were isolated <i>from Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup>;Trp53<sup>f/f</sup> </i>mice and ROCK and Trp53 depleted in vitro\u00a0by Ad-Cre infection<i>. Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Trp53<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i> MEFs were found to undergo senescence, and were defective in their proliferation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Western blot analysis confirmed depletion of both ROCKs and Trp53 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We then treated <i>Trp53</i> wild type and null cells with the ROCK inhibitors H1152 and GSK269962A and found an increase in senescence compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Therefore, the classical senescence pathways did not seem to be affected in <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup> </i>cells or cells treated for prolonged periods with H1152. To identify protein changes associated with senescence, we used immunoblotting and quantitative mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ong et al., 2002</a>). The protein levels of some cell cycle regulators appeared to change upon treatment with Cre recombinase alone, so for proteomics analysis we focused on long-term H1152 treatment. Annotation enrichment analysis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>) of the proteome-wide changes after long-term ROCK inhibition revealed many cell cycle-related protein categories that were significantly modulated in ROCK-inhibited cells (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), consistent with a prominent cell-cycle phenotype. However, when we analyzed proteins that are known to control G1 cell-cycle arrest and senescence, we did not detect significant changes in the levels of these proteins. These included known regulators, such as p16, p19, p27, p21, CyclinD1, CyclinE, or phosphorylation of Rb (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). However, CDK1, CyclinA and CKS1 protein levels were significantly reduced upon loss of and long-term inhibition of ROCK1 and 2 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). Long-term treatment of cells with blebbistatin (blebbistatin +/-), but not the inactive enantiomer (blebbistatin +), also decreased the levels of CDK1, CyclinA and CKS1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), suggesting that it is loss of contractility downstream of ROCK loss that results in down-regulation of these proteins. However, it cannot be ruled out that both ROCK inhibition/depletion as well as myosin II inhibition independently lead to a similar phenotype."

Mice were treated with adenovirus expressing Cre (Ad-Cre) and sacrificed 24 weeks after treatment. Histological analysis revealed that the total tumor area was increased in <i>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This was seen for all tumor grades (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) that have been classified as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib16\">DuPage et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jackson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">2001</a>). This result suggests that ROCK1 may have a tumor suppressor function in this specific mouse model, of which the mechanism requires further investigation and will be the subject of another manuscript. However, no difference was seen comparing tumor area of <i>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></i> or <i>Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></i> with wild type mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Western blot analysis of cell lines generated from <i>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup>;Kras<sup>G12D</sup>; Trp53<sup>R270H</sup></i>-driven tumors showed that they always retained ROCK1 or ROCK2 protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and contained un-recombined <i>floxed</i> alleles of <i>Rock1</i> and <i>2.</i> To investigate the consequences of complete loss of ROCK function, we infected these \u2018retainer\u2019 cell lines isolated from lung tumors arising in <i>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice, which retained ROCK1 protein (<i>Rock1<sup>f/f</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i>), with Ad-Cre-GFP to excise the retained <i>Rock1</i> locus. The same procedure was applied to cells isolated from tumors arising in <i>Rock1<sup>f/wt</sup>;Rock2<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice (<i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/wt</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup>).

This further highlights the fact that one wild-type allele of <i>Rock</i> is sufficient to allow cell proliferation. Importantly, we find that just one allele of either <i>Rock</i> is sufficient to rescue the proliferation defect which was also observed using MEFs (data not shown) and this <i>Rock1<sup>\u2206/wt</sup>;Rock2<sup>\u2206/\u2206</sup></i> cell line (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Several reports using siRNA to knockdown ROCK1 or 2 have been published suggesting that ROCK1 and 2 proteins are not redundant. These include different effects on actomyosin contractility, stress fibers and focal adhesions in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yoneda et al., 2005</a>), opposing effects on cell proliferation and changes in cell migration in glioblastoma cell lines (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mertsch and Thanos, 2014</a>). Using ROCK1 and 2 single knockout MEFs, differences in stress fiber formation and\u00a0Cofilin phosphorylation have been described (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shi et al., 2013</a>). In a further study, knockdown of either ROCK1 or ROCK2 alone was sufficient to reduce anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC cell lines - also suggesting their functions are not redundant (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vigil et al., 2012</a>). All of these studies, however, describe very different effects of ROCK1 or ROCK2, and at least partially contradict each other. The use of siRNA knockdown, ROCK inhibitors or germ-line knockout MEF lines has several limitations, such as off-target effects, differences in growth properties or cell morphology. To establish an isogenic system and to circumvent the severity of the embryonic phenotypes in germ-line knockouts of <i>Rock1</i> and <i>2</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shimizu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Thumkeo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Thumkeo et al., 2005</a>), we generated conditional targeted alleles of <i>Rock1</i> and <i>Rock2</i>, allowing us to analyze of the role of ROCK1 and ROCK2, and permitting the generation of cells that lack both ROCK1 and 2. Our data with genetic deletion in an isogenic fashion show that either ROCK1 or ROCK2 is sufficient to regulate MLC and MYPT phosphorylation and thus actomyosin contractility. Known targets such as the phosphorylation of cofilin are not affected in single or double knockout cells. However, using quantitative mass spectrometry treatment of cells with the ROCK inhibitor H1152, we show that Cofilin phosphorylation is affected after short-term ROCK inhibition but recovers upon long-term treatment. This indicates that other kinases are able to take over and phosphorylate Cofilin. MLC phosphorylation, however, is not recovered indicating that ROCK is the major kinase regulating MLC phosphorylation."

Previous work with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 has led to contradictory results on the requirement for ROCK in cell proliferation. We believe that this may reflect the relatively low potency of Y-27632 as a ROCK inhibitor, since we found that treatment with several other ROCK inhibitors (H1152, GSK269962A, AT13148, GSK429286A and chroman1), which have been shown to be more potent than Y-27632 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sadok et al., 2015</a>), could mimic the effects of genetic deletion of <i>Rock1</i> and <i>Rock2</i>."

This cellular senescence does not appear to involve changes in levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p16, p21, p27, but the down-regulation of cell-cycle proteins CDK1, Cyclin A and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CKS1. CKS1 is known to regulate levels of CDK1 and Cyclin A (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martinsson-Ahlzen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Westbrook et al., 2007</a>), and can function in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tang and Reed, 1993</a>).

Recent studies have identified a role for ROCK inhibition in combinatorial treatments in BRAF-mutant melanoma (<a href=\"#bib56\">Smit et al., 2014</a>), as well as in Kras-driven lung cancers (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kumar et al., 2012</a>). Our data thus provide a molecular basis, and highlight the need, for exploiting the use of effective ROCK inhibitors as anti-cancer agents either alone or in combination. However, incomplete or specific inhibition of only one isoform of ROCK alone may not be an effective treatment, and may even lead to adverse results as our results also highlight isoform specific tumor suppressive functions for ROCK1 in lung and ROCK2 in melanoma models."

Cells were then lysed by 2%\u00a0SDS, Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and protein concentrations were measured and balanced by BCA assay. The reciprocal labels of drug and vehicle treated lysates were then mixed 1:1, resulting in two reciprocally\u00a0labelled SILAC replicates (Heavy drug + light vehicle and vice versa). The mixed lysates were then reduced by addition of 100\u00a0mM DTT and boiling for 5\u2009min, followed by trypsin digestion using a Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) protocol (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wisniewski et al., 2009</a>). For phospho-peptide analysis, the digests were subjected to phospho-peptide enrichment on TiO2 tips (GL sciences). For total proteome analysis, the digests were initially fractionated by isoelectric focusing, using an OFF-gel fractionator (Agilent, pH 3\u201310). The fractions were then cleaned up using C18 ziptip columns (Millipore). All samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Thermo Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer (ICR proteomics core facility). The raw data wereas then searched and quantified using Maxquant (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>). All subsequent statistical analysis was performed using Perseus software from the Maxquant package. Briefly, the ratios were converted to Log-2 scale, and reverse and contaminants were filtered out. Proteins only identified in one replicate were also filtered out. The \u2018Significant-B\u2019 outlier test was used to determine the significantly regulated peptides or proteins, using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR rate of 5%. A hit was considered significant if it was found to be significantly changing in opposite directions in both reciprocal SILAC replicates. 2-Dimensional Annotation enrichment analysis was also performed in Perseus, using Broad Institute\u2019s Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) annotations, using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR rate of 2%.

SRM was performed, as described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib69\">Worboys et al., 2014</a>), for the measurement of endogenous and synthetic peptides. To select optimal proteotypic peptides to monitor by SRM, all possible proteotypic peptides of ROCK1 and 2 were empirically measured within cell lines that were <i>wt, Rock1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Rock2<sup>-/-</sup></i>, permitting a confirmation of peptide specificity. For each SRM analysis bands from an SDS-PAGE gel were excised between 150\u2013250\u2009kDa (Precision Plus Protein Prestained Standard, Bio-Rad), and proteins trypsin-digested in-gel. NIDNFLSR, LLLQNELK and ESDIEQLR were chosen for ROCK1 and VYYDISSAK, QLDEANALLR and ENLLLSDSPPCR for ROCK2. For quantitation, the two most intense transitions from each peptide were summed for each isotopic variant. A cycle time of 1.8\u2009s was used, and transitions monitored in an unscheduled manner giving a dwell time of 37.5 ms. Standard curves were generated within sample matrices, and plotted as a function of their SILAC ratios. Subsequent regression lines were used per peptide to calculate absolute concentrations. In tumor samples, 5 fmol of each peptide was spiked into each sample. Three technical replicates were performed and averaged per peptide and each average peptide measurement was averaged per protein. Thus, for each protein a total of 9 measurements are made. The targeted proteomics dataset has been deposited to the PeptideAtlas SRM Experiment Library (PASSEL) with the identifier PASS00721."

A requirement of Rock for tumor formation was established using mouse models of lung cancer (Ras-driven) and melanoma (B-Raf-driven)."
