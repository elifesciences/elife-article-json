SRP scans the nascent chains of translating ribosomes, preferentially engaging those with hydrophobic targeting signals, and delivers these ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the membrane. Here, we present structures of native mammalian SRP-ribosome complexes in the scanning and engaged states. These structures reveal the near-identical SRP architecture of these two states, show many of the SRP-ribosome interactions at atomic resolution, and suggest how the polypeptide-binding M domain selectively engages hydrophobic signals. The scanning M domain, pre-positioned at the ribosomal exit tunnel, is auto-inhibited by a C-terminal amphipathic helix occluding its hydrophobic binding groove. Upon engagement, the hydrophobic targeting signal displaces this amphipathic helix, which then acts as a protective lid over the signal. Biochemical experiments suggest how scanning and engagement are coordinated with translation elongation to minimize exposure of hydrophobic signals during membrane targeting."

SRP scans the nascent chains of translating ribosomes, preferentially engaging those with hydrophobic targeting signals, and delivers these ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the membrane. Here, we present structures of native mammalian SRP-ribosome complexes in the scanning and engaged states. These structures reveal the near-identical SRP architecture of these two states, show many of the SRP-ribosome interactions at atomic resolution, and suggest how the polypeptide-binding M domain selectively engages hydrophobic signals. The scanning M domain, pre-positioned at the ribosomal exit tunnel, is auto-inhibited by a C-terminal amphipathic helix occluding its hydrophobic binding groove. Upon engagement, the hydrophobic targeting signal displaces this amphipathic helix, which then acts as a protective lid over the signal. Biochemical experiments suggest how scanning and engagement are coordinated with translation elongation to minimize exposure of hydrophobic signals during membrane targeting."

Although all proteins are assembled inside cells, some of them must be delivered to the outside or inserted into cell membranes. It is important to understand how this selective delivery system works because secreted proteins (i.e., those delivered outside) and membrane-embedded proteins are essential for cells to communicate with their surroundings. Proteins destined for secretion or membrane insertion contain characteristic stretches of amino acids that act as a targeting signal for delivery to the membrane. These targeting signals are recognized by the \u2018signal recognition particle\u2019 (or SRP for short), a large complex found in all living organisms. The SRP has the task of finding ribosomes that are assembling proteins with a targeting signal, and then taking them to the membrane. The protein being assembled can then either cross the membrane for secretion by the cell, or get embedded within the membrane."

Voorhees and Hegde investigated this question by analyzing SRPs bound to ribosomes that were at different stages of building a membrane protein. The experiment was devised so that SRP would be in two different states: in the first state, the SRP was scanning for its targeting signal and, in the second, it was engaged with the targeting signal. Voorhees and Hegde took many thousands of pictures of these samples using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, and reconstructed the three-dimensional structures of both states. This revealed fine details of how SRP positions itself immediately next to the part of the ribosome where newly formed protein chains emerge. From here, the SRP scans the protein until the targeting signal emerges and then it engages with the protein."

The new structures show how SRP cradles the targeting signal inside a binding groove and covers it with a protective lid to minimize its risk of aggregation. The next challenges are to figure out how SRP chooses which ribosomes to scan, and how it releases the targeting signal when it has delivered it to the membrane."

The majority of these proteins are recognized co-translationally at the ribosome by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and targeted via the SRP receptor to the Sec61 translocon for insertion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Halic and Beckmann, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shan and Walter, 2005</a>). SRP has several critical functions in coordinating this targeting reaction. First, SRP must selectively recognize its cargo via a hydrophobic targeting signal. Second, it must shield this hydrophobic domain to preclude inappropriate interactions. Third, cargo-loaded SRP must interact with its receptor and release the cargo to the translocon. All of these events must occur before substantial synthesis beyond the targeting signal precludes successful engagement of the translocon (<a href=\"#bib66\">Siegel and Walter, 1988</a>)."

The elongated assembly is operationally divided into an S domain and an Alu domain (<a href=\"#bib65\">Siegel and Walter, 1986</a>). The S domain is involved in recognizing the targeting signal and interacting with the SRP receptor. Its functionally essential SRP54 subunit contains three modules: an N domain that interacts with the ribosome near its exit tunnel (<a href=\"#bib21\">Halic et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schaffitzel et al., 2006</a>), an M domain responsible for signal recognition (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zopf et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Halic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Janda et al., 2010</a>), and a G domain that (together with the N domain) coordinates receptor targeting (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miller et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Egea et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Focia et al., 2004</a>). The Alu domain interacts near the GTPase center at the interface between the two ribosomal subunits (<a href=\"#bib21\">Halic et al., 2004</a>). This interaction is thought to compete with translation factors to slow nascent polypeptide elongation and provide additional time for successful targeting. Many prokaryotes lack an Alu domain and instead contain a simplified SRP composed solely of an SRP54 homolog and a short \u223c110 nucleotide RNA."

First, the interactions between SRP and the ribosome are understood only in general terms, with regions of close proximity deduced from moderate resolution cryo-EM structures (<a href=\"#bib21\">Halic et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schaffitzel et al., 2006</a>). The specific residues and chemical details of the binding surfaces are not known. Furthermore, the eukaryotic SRP-ribosome interaction has only been visualized for mammalian SRP bound to the plant ribosome (<a href=\"#bib21\">Halic et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2006</a>). Although functional for translocation, this heterologous complex strongly arrests translation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Walter and Blobel, 1981</a>). By contrast, endogenous SRP in a homologous mammalian system has a remarkably subtle effect on translation elongation (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wolin and Walter, 1989</a>). Hence, the nature of the Alu domain-ribosome interaction and its relationship to translation factor binding in a native homologous system is unknown."

While this has convincingly established the binding site, the configuration of the pre-engaged state of the M domain and how it transitions to the engaged state are less clear. An exposed hydrophobic groove, as seen in isolated M domain crystal structures (e.g., <a href=\"#bib30\">Keenan et al., 1998</a>), would seem energetically unfavorable in an aqueous environment and may exhibit promiscuous interactions. Indeed, other factors that bind hydrophobic clients contain hydrophobic grooves that are occluded in the unengaged state (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pellecchia et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mateja et al., 2009</a>). Thus, it is not known how SRP's substrate binding groove is kept shielded until it encounters its hydrophobic clients specifically at the ribosomal exit tunnel."

The simplest and earliest idea was that SRP has high affinity and selectivity for a ribosome exposing a hydrophobic signal (<a href=\"#bib72\">Walter et al., 1981</a>). However, such a model would not easily explain why far more abundant hydrophobic binding proteins do not outcompete SRP, why SRP cannot bind those same sequences post-translationally, and how SRP can rapidly find these transient and rare species to prevent aggregation. Thus, it was suggested that SRP may repeatedly scan all translating ribosomes until the appropriate cargo is encountered (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ogg and Walter, 1995</a>)."

The extent to which these prokaryotic studies apply to eukaryotic SRP is unclear and has been minimally studied. Not only is its ribosome interaction more complex, but the Alu domain merits consideration of how SRP recruitment is integrated into the translation cycle. Furthermore, <i>Escherichia coli</i> SRP seems to scan any translating ribosome (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>), while eukaryotic SRP may display a further preference for ribosomes containing a hydrophobic signal inside the exit tunnel (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flanagan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berndt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mariappan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>).

The cryo-EM reconstruction of this native complex provided the first structure of SRP bound to the ribosome in a \u2018scanning\u2019 mode. A parallel structure of SRP bound after the TMD has emerged from the ribosome revealed the conformational changes that accompany TMD engagement by SRP. The structures show how the hydrophobic cavity of the SRP M domain is occluded by an amphipathic C-terminal \u2018placeholder\u2019 helix until its displacement by a <i>bona fide</i> TMD. Competition assays between SRP and a translational GTPase provide insight into how scanning and engagement are integrated during polypeptide elongation to maximize targeting efficiency while limiting TMD exposure to the cytosol. These findings have functional implications for the mechanism of membrane protein recognition and targeting."

Density for the mRNA codon in the P site is also present, but is poorly defined, likely reflecting increased flexibility due to truncation of the mRNA. Additional density representing the E-site tRNA is also observed, though its anticodon is disordered suggesting it is not in a single orientation. We do not observe any conformational changes in the ribosome exit tunnel in the scanning structure relative to either the engaged structure or earlier mammalian ribosome structures (<a href=\"#bib70\">Voorhees et al., 2014</a>). Thus, SRP recruitment by a TMD inside the exit tunnel cannot be explained purely based on structural changes observed at this resolution, a point we address further in the \u2018Discussion\u2019."

As expected, the Alu domain is localized to the GTPase center between the 40S and 60S subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and is connected by a flexible RNA linker to the S domain positioned at the exit tunnel (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). At low-resolution, the observed density accounts for the majority of the SRP molecule, including most of the RNA, the Alu domain proteins (SRP9 and SRP14), and most of the S domain proteins (SRP54, SRP19, and RNA binding regions of SRP68). However, only the Alu domain and SRP54 were sufficiently well ordered to allow direct modelling into the density maps, and thus form the focus of our interpretations in the sections below. The others areas, whose functional relevance remain poorly understood, were rigid-body fit with minor adjustments from available crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grotwinkel et al., 2014</a>), and were not interpreted further here."

In particular, the Alu domain, whose binding has been implicated in slowing translational elongation after SRP engages with a signal sequence (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wolin and Walter, 1989</a>), is positioned in the GTPase center. Similarly, the entire S domain is grossly indistinguishable, indicating that the TMD-interacting M domain of SRP54 is positioned at the exit tunnel even prior to engagement. This suggests that in mammals, SRP has a single stable binding site on the ribosome, and carries out its biological functions during both scanning and engagement from this position."

SRP is anchored on the ribosome primarily by its SRP54 subunit near the exit tunnel (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and the Alu domain at the ribosomal GTPase center. Two loops in the SRP54 N-domain previously implicated in ribosome binding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Halic et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schaffitzel et al., 2006</a>) can now be sufficiently resolved for unambiguous placement of many protein side chains and analysis of the stabilizing chemical interactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). For example, Thr21 and Asp19 of SRP54 are within hydrogen bonding distance of Lys46 in uL29 and the phosphate oxygen of A80 in 5.8S rRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Similarly, the backbone of residue 67 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the carbonyl oxygen of residue 116 of uL23 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These specific contacts, along with other electrostatic interactions involving the conserved basic residues in this region, provide the primary stabilization of SRP54 and serve to orient its signal-binding M domain at the ribosomal exit tunnel."

Several arguments suggest that these represent the C-terminus of SRP54. First, the C-terminal \u223c70 residues, truncated from all earlier SRP54 crystal structures, are the only unaccounted amino acids in this region. The only other nearby polypeptide would be the hydrophilic nascent chain, which is unlikely to be helical or rigid. Second, this 70 residue stretch of mammalian SRP54 contains two conserved predicted helices of appropriate length (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure. 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Third, these helices are amphipathic, making them ideal for surrounding the hydrophobic TMD (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We therefore posit that these two additional helices, provisionally termed \u03b1C1 and \u03b1C2 of SRP54, serve as an intramolecular \u2018lid\u2019 that surrounds the hydrophobic substrate to shield it from aqueous solvent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Although we cannot unambiguously assign these helical regions to a particular sequence, we have provisionally named them based on the relationship between their apparent length in the structure and predicted size."

This suggests that in the absence of a TMD substrate, \u03b1C2 shifts to occupy the hydrophobic groove. This helix may be somewhat dynamic since a small amount of density is still observed in the alternate position of \u03b1C2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, bottom panel). Although this is our favored hypothesis, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the density in the hydrophobic groove represents the nascent chain. However, this seems unlikely because a hydrophilic sequence would be disfavored in the hydrophobic groove, this region of polypeptide is unlikely to be helical, earlier crosslinking data suggest SRP does not interact with hydrophilic segments of nascent chain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berndt et al., 2009</a>), and disappearance of the \u03b1C2 density would remain unexplained. Thus, we propose that the amphipathic \u03b1C2 normally resides in the hydrophobic groove, but is displaced by TMD engagement to its \u2018lid\u2019 position between the M domain and exit tunnel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Yet, 35 cycles of translational elongation separate our two structures, and SRP does not arrest translation even after successful engagement (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wolin and Walter, 1989</a>). To investigate this apparent incompatibility, we sought to examine the relationship between translational GTPase binding and the SRP-ribosome interaction in the scanning vs engaged modes. Such an experiment is complicated because neither dominant negative eEF1 nor eEF2 would bind our staged SRP-RNC complexes: eEF1 ternary complex binding requires an appropriate codon in the ribosomal A site, while eEF2, when in its GTP-bound state, preferentially acts on pre-translocation RNCs in the hybrid state. Furthermore, adding mutant versions of these factors to our reactions would inhibit translation. To bypass these technical obstacles, we utilized the GTPase Hbs1 as a surrogate for eEF1 and eEF2. The G-domain of all three factors share a high degree of sequence and structural homology, and the binding of Hbs1 to the ribosomal GTPase center is well characterized (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shoemaker et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Becker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pisareva et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, a GTPase deficient dominant negative mutant (Hbs1-DN) added to our translation reactions will stably bind to the translation factor binding site (<a href=\"#bib4\">Becker et al., 2011</a>) only when ribosomes reach the end of the truncated message (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shao and Hegde, 2014</a>), allowing us to query the consequence of GTPase center occupancy for the SRP-RNC interaction without inhibiting translation."

Hbs1-DN binding, observed in both cases, reduced SRP recovery by up to \u223c70% with the scanning RNCs, but had no effect on engaged SRP-RNC complexes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Because a substantial excess of Hbs1-DN relative to ribosomes was used, its failure to displace engaged SRP suggested the existence of a ternary complex between the ribosome, Hbs1-DN, and SRP. The relatively modest displacement of scanning SRP further hinted that this too may permit ternary complex formation."

The use of a truncated mRNA for sample preparation precludes eEF1 binding, but eEF2-ribosome-SRP complexes were feasible. Such a population was not identified in our scanning dataset, likely due to the lower stability of this ternary complex when SRP is bound in its scanning mode (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). By contrast, the engaged dataset contained a small subset of particles in which density was observed for both eEF2 and the S domain of SRP bound in its canonical location at the exit tunnel (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). At a lower threshold, density for the flexible RNA linker and the Alu domain could also be observed, with the Alu domain at the so-called right foot of the 40S subunit (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The relatively poor density for this half of SRP suggests it is probably dynamic when the Alu domain cannot bind its canonical site at the GTPase center. Whether the weakly observed alternate Alu domain position on the 40S represents a physiologically relevant binding site remains to be determined. Nevertheless, this structure supports our conclusion that the Alu domain can be displaced from the GTPase center by translation factors without dissociating SRP from the ribosome."

These observations suggest that SRP is recruited in a TMD- and nascent chain-dependent manner to actively translating ribosomes despite never exposing the TMD outside the exit tunnel. Thus, SRP might be able to continuously scan translating ribosomes as a TMD elongates through the exit tunnel, thereby permitting engagement with essentially no opportunity for TMD exposure to the cytosol."

Thus, Alu domain recruitment could potentially occur immediately after dissociation of eEF1 or eEF2, from the ribosome. The S domain could presumably bind transiently anytime, and may increase local SRP concentration to facilitate the Alu domain interaction. The proportion of each \u223c200 ms translation cycle during which RNCs are compatible for Alu domain binding remains to be determined.

Whether SRP completely dissociates from the ribosome would depend on the off-rate of the S domain relative to the next Alu domain binding opportunity within the translation cycle. Estimates from the <i>E. coli</i> system suggest that the S domain dissociation would be far slower than an elongation cycle, and thus the Alu domain could re-bind and detach repeatedly while SRP nevertheless maintains ribosome association during ongoing translation. This would explain how we are able to isolate scanning mode SRP-RNC complexes from an active translation reaction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) and recover at least some GTPase-SRP-RNC ternary complex in the scanning state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

Although the precise path of the nascent chain is not known, the limited space in this region means it necessarily passes the M domain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, left panel). We envisage a dynamic \u03b1C2 helix that transiently exposes the hydrophobic groove to provide opportunities for nascent chain sampling. If a segment of the nascent polypeptide is sufficiently hydrophobic to replace the \u03b1C2 helix, it would successfully engage SRP54 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, right panel). In this model, the biophysical properties of \u03b1C2 effectively set the hydrophobicity threshold for client engagement. After nascent chain binding to the M domain, \u03b1C2 would occupy a position on the opposite side of the hydrophobic groove, oriented with its hydrophobic face toward the substrate, forming part of a protective lid. The conformation of this engaged state may be flexible to accommodate different substrates, as suggested by other variant configurations (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By contrast, TMDs responsible for targeting are markedly more hydrophobic and between 17 to 24 residues long. They are effectively insoluble in aqueous solvent and too long to be completely shielded by the M domain, making their efficient and early targeting more important.

Such early delivery may be particularly important for proteins whose downstream domains may interfere with correct translocation such as downstream TMDs of multispanning membrane proteins or rapidly folding domains (<a href=\"#bib10\">Conti et al., 2014</a>). Our findings suggest that early SRP recruitment is another mechanism for lengthening the targeting window, and may operate in conjunction with translational slowing (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wolin and Walter, 1989</a>) and strategic positioning of slowly decoded rare codons (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pechmann et al., 2014</a>)."

One possibility involves conformational changes on the ribosome surface triggered by TMD interactions with the proteins or RNA lining the tunnel.

Instead, we currently favor a kinetic model in which a hydrophobic sequence in the tunnel biases ribosomes into a conformation favorable for Alu domain binding. If the presence of a hydrophobic sequence in the ribosomal tunnel would preferentially extend those stages of the translation cycle compatible with SRP binding, this could provide a mechanism for tunnel-initiated SRP recruitment."

Cycloheximide, an elongation inhibitor that causes ribosomes to pause in a presumably unratcheted state, can rescue translocation defects caused by limiting SRP availability. By contrast, another elongation inhibitor anisomycin, which pauses ribosomes at the ratcheted state, does not rescue under similar conditions. This implies that situations preferentially favoring the cycloheximide state may permit SRP recruitment. Thus, it is plausible that a TMD inside the tunnel, or elongation of hydrophobic amino acids, would subtly influence the translation cycle to favor this state. Indeed, sequences inside the ribosomal tunnel are known to influence the translation cycle (<a href=\"#bib57\">Seidelt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhushan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wilson and Beckmann, 2011</a>), while the biophysical characteristic of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site influences the time spent in different ribosome states (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lareau et al., 2014</a>).

Such analyses can provide a global view of not only SRP substrates in vivo, but also the precise timing of its recruitment for different types of cargos. We anticipate that, based on our analyses in the mammalian system, early recruitment should be seen for proteins with the most hydrophobic targeting sequences. Such proteins are also the most aggregation-prone when targeting fails, perhaps providing a strong selection pressure for evolution of an early targeting mechanism."

The Flag tag was used on the nascent chain in all experiments except those that included Hbs1-DN, which instead used HA-tagged nascent chains. For biochemical analysis, the affinity resin was either added directly to undiluted translation reactions, or after dilution in buffer 1. The ratio of affinity resin to translation reaction was typically 1:50. Binding was performed in batch at 4\u00b0C for \u223c1\u20132 hr with gentle mixing, transferred to a micro-spin column, washed with \u223c25 vol (relative to resin) of buffer 1, and eluted for 30 min at 22\u00b0C in the same buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml of the appropriate peptide. Samples for structural analysis were washed as above in buffer 1 containing an additional 200 mM or 400 mM KAc for the scanning and engaged complexes, respectively. Samples were eluted in buffer 1 supplemented with 3 mM GDPCP, concentrated by centrifugation (50,000 rpm for 75 min in a TLA55 rotor), and resuspended in a volume of buffer 1 to achieve \u223c125 nM ribosomes in the presence of 100 \u03bcM GDPCP."

An additional focussed classification using a mask around the P-Site tRNA identified a final 27,415 particles that are unratcheted, bound to SRP, and contain improved density for the nascent chain. The somewhat weaker density observed for the nascent chain in the scanning complex (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) might be due to either increased flexibility of the nascent chain when it is not anchored at the N-terminus by an interaction with SRP, or decreased occupancy resulting from hydrolysis during sample freezing that was not resolved by computational sorting. Similarly, in the engaged sample, 58% of ribosomes (189,099 particles) were unratcheted and contained tRNA, while 28% of these particles (52,061) were bound by SRP. In order to isolate the population of ribosomes bound to both SRP and eEF2 in the engaged sample, a mask for SRP was used to further sub-classify the population of ribosomes bound to eEF2 (20%: 64,416) resulting in a final population of 8418 particles."

These RNCs were purified via the nascent chain's 3xFLAG N-terminus. The authors found that SRP co-purified with both these complexes, but was absent (or depleted) from RNCs containing three arginine point mutations in the TMD, thus demonstrating SRP's specificity for RNCs containing the hydrophobic TMD."

SRP's lower local resolution limited interpretation of its RNC-bound conformation to just its Alu domain and SRP54 protein. Overall, the two structures are very comparable, with the main difference being the electron density of the SRP M-domain's peptide binding groove. The authors fit the electron density with the available crystal structures of SRP54 and assign the extra density to two alpha helices (\u03b1C1 and \u03b1C2) absent in the crystal structures of truncated SRP54. The density of these helices differs between the engaged and scanning states, and the authors interpret these changes in density to movement of the helices to either occupy the peptide-binding groove in the absence of a nascent chain's TMD, or act as a lid for the groove in the presence of a TMD."

They chose to test this hypothesis using the GTPase Hbs1. By taking an immunoprecipitation approach, the authors enriched for Hbs1-bound RNCs and found that a subset of these was co-occupied by SRP, indicating that these three molecules can exist as a ternary complex (RNC-SRP-Hbs1). Since SRP was found stably bound (over the time course of their experiments) to RNCs in both its scanning and engaged state, the authors speculate that unlike the smaller, prokaryotic SRP, mammalian SRP may remain bound to RNCs by its S domain throughout RNC translation, while its Alu domain may repeatedly bind and dissociate from the ribosome's GTPase binding site by virtue of the flexible linker connecting the S and Alu domains. By remaining stably bound to the RNC by its S domain, SRP could continuously survey nascent polypeptide chains for its hydrophobic substrates, and prevent their exposure to the (aqueous) environment."

The high resolution structure of the complex suggest a new model where the two C-terminal alpha helices in SRP's M domain act as a lid for the peptide-binding groove in the engaged state, whereas they occupy the groove in the absence of a peptide during scanning. Additionally, based on biochemical data and the structures, the authors propose a model for SRP engagement in eukaryotes. They propose that SRP remains stably bound to RNC by its S domain, while its Alu domain may dissociate and re-bind during nascent chain scanning, where the mechanism differs distinctly from the well-studied prokaryotic system.

They use a combination of cryo-EM reconstructions and biochemistry to identify the features of a \u201cscanning\u201d SRP complex with the ribosome, in which the TMD is still in the exit tunnel, and the \u201cengaged\u201d SRP complex, in which the TMD is fully exposed from the ribosome. From these experiments, the authors propose a compelling biophysical model for how SRP is autoinhibited by a C-terminal amphipathic helix that allows dynamic sampling of emerging nascent chains. If a sufficiently hydrophobic stretch emerges from the ribosome, it could compete for binding to the hydrophobic cleft in the SRP M-domain to form the \u201cengaged\u201d complex. In this state the TMD is then protected by the amphipathic helix from exposure to the cytosol until the RNC is properly targeted to the ER."

Association of eEF1 requires specific recognition of the A-site codon, while dominant negative eEF2 would presumably bind most stably to a ratcheted ribosome. Furthermore, addition of dominant negative versions of either eEF1 or eEF2 would interfere with translation elongation. These technical obstacles necessitated the use of Hbs1.This logic is briefly described when we first introduce the use of Hbs1 (subsection \u201cAnalysis of SRP-ribosome interactions during translation elongation\u201d)."
