While we could replicate these results, we detected very little fusion with the more rigorous assay of lumenal compartment mixing. Exploring the discrepancies between lipid-dequenching and content-mixing assays, we surprisingly found that the disposition of the fluorescent lipids with respect to SNAREs had a striking effect. Without other proteins, the association of SNAREs in <i>trans</i> causes lipid dequenching that cannot be ascribed to fusion or hemifusion. Tethering of the SNARE-bearing proteoliposomes was required for efficient lumenal compartment mixing. While the physiological HOPS tethering complex caused a few-fold increase of <i>trans</i>-SNARE association, the rate of content mixing increased more than 100-fold. Thus tethering has a role in promoting membrane fusion that extends beyond simply increasing the amount of total <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex."
