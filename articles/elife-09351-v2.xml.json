However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems, particularly in cell shape control, remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that introduction of the MyTH4-FERM tandem into KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein) during evolution conferred novel functions. The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain in the N-terminal tail of KCBP physically bind to MTs and F-actin, respectively. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP distributes in a specific cortical gradient and concentrates at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches, which lack MTs but have cortical F-actin. Further, live-cell imaging and genetic analyses revealed that KCBP acts as a hub integrating MTs and actin filaments to assemble the required cytoskeletal configuration for the unique, polarized diffuse growth pattern during trichome cell morphogenesis. Our findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms underlying cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination."

However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems, particularly in cell shape control, remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that introduction of the MyTH4-FERM tandem into KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein) during evolution conferred novel functions. The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain in the N-terminal tail of KCBP physically bind to MTs and F-actin, respectively. During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP distributes in a specific cortical gradient and concentrates at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches, which lack MTs but have cortical F-actin. Further, live-cell imaging and genetic analyses revealed that KCBP acts as a hub integrating MTs and actin filaments to assemble the required cytoskeletal configuration for the unique, polarized diffuse growth pattern during trichome cell morphogenesis. Our findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms underlying cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination."

The plant cytoskeletal system, composed of microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (F-actin), plays a central role in cell morphogenesis in both tip-growing and diffuse-growing cell types. In particular, the cortical MTs play pivotal roles in plant cell growth and directionality, mainly by orienting the deposition of nascent cellulose microfibrils during biosynthesis of the cell wall (<a href=\"#bib39\">Paradez et al., 2006</a>). F-actin plays central roles in polarized cell elongation, mainly by regulating intracellular transport (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hussey et al., 2006</a>). However, despite emerging evidence that cortical MTs and F-actin coordinately regulate plant cell morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Petrasek and Schwarzerova, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sampathkumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sambade et al., 2014</a>), the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems remain largely unknown."

The trichome phenotype indicates the cytoskeletal homeostasis inside the plant cell. For example, cortical MTs mainly affect initiation of trichome branches, and disruption of genes encoding MT-associated proteins usually produces trichomes with abnormal numbers of branches (<a href=\"#bib38\">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krishnakumar and Oppenheimer, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burk et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buschmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nakamura and Hashimoto, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kong et al., 2010</a>). By contrast, actin filaments mainly affect elongation of trichomes, and disruption of genes encoding actin-related proteins, such as components of the ARP2/3 actin nucleation complex and the upstream WAVE/SCAR regulatory complex (W/SRC), usually results in impaired trichome elongation but with normal branch number (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mathur et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Basu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Deeks et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">El-Assal Sel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">El-Din El-Assal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Szymanski, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Djakovic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Le et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, theoretically, mutation in a gene that participates in both processes would lead to trichome defects in both branching and elongation and would assist in the elucidation of the crosstalk between the MTs and the F-actin. However, such a central player, which directly links and integrates MTs and F-actin and further establishes the required cytoskeletal systems for trichome cell shaping, remains to be identified."

                        "text": "KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein) occurs solely within the plant kingdom, and uniquely in the kinesin superfamily. KCBP has a C-terminal motor head, beyond which locates a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD) at the extreme end of the C-terminus; besides KCBP, the CBD is only found in the sea urchin kinesin KinC. KCBP also contains a MyTH4-FERM tandem, which only occurs in several myosin families outside the plant kingdom, in its tail region at the N-terminus (NT); thus, KCBP has long been regarded as a chimera of kinesin with a myosin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdel-Ghany et al., 2005</a>). Using biotinylated calmodulin as a probe, KCBP was firstly isolated as a novel calmodulin-binding protein with a kinesin motor domain (<a href=\"#bib65\">Reddy et al., 1996</a>). In vitro biochemical assays showed that the CBD of KCBP binds calcium/calmodulin, which negatively regulates KCBP motor activity, and that the N-terminal tail, including the MyTH4-FERM domain, could co-sediment with MTs (<a href=\"#bib37\">Narasimhulu and Reddy, 1998</a>). Interestingly, genetic analysis of the <i>zwichel</i> (<i>zwi</i>) mutants, which have a shortened stalk and only two branches, revealed that the <i>ZWICHEL</i> (<i>ZWI</i>) gene encodes the KCBP protein (<a href=\"#bib18\">H\u00fclskamp et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</a>). KCBP was detected in mitotic MT arrays such as the preprophase band, the spindle, and the phragmoplast in various plants, indicating that it may play a role in cell division (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bowser and Reddy, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Smirnova et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Preuss et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buschmann et al., 2015</a>). Nevertheless, loss of function in <i>KCBP</i> only produces a noticeable phenotype in trichomes, which are less-branched and contain shortened stalks and swollen, stunted branches (<a href=\"#bib38\">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</a>), providing a hint of clue that KCBP possibly plays the role involving in both cortical MTs and F-actin. However, whether KCBP localizes to cortical MTs in trichome cells is still an open question, cellular basis of defects in <i>kcbp</i> trichomes needs to be examined, direct evidence linking KCBP and F-actin is currently missing, and the role of the mysterious MyTH4-FERM domain remains to be unraveled."

During trichome morphogenesis, KCBP localizes to cortical MTs, distributes in a specific gradient, and is concentrated at the branching sites and the apexes of elongating branches. KCBP orchestrates the MT-actin interplay and is required to assemble the specific cytoskeletal configuration for trichome branching, elongation, and tip sharpening. Our findings build the direct link between the MT-based KCBP motor and the actin cytoskeleton, unravel the cellular basis controlling trichome cell shaping, and provide significant insights into the mechanisms of cytoskeletal regulation of cell shape determination."

Notably, we found that GFP-KCBP localizes to puncta along cortical MTs in both pavement cells and hypocotyl cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Most GFP-KCBP proteins dwell on or move along cortical MTs as discrete particles for a short time (15.9 s, n = 647); only a small portion of GFP-KCBP particles remain immobilized on MTs for longer times (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Kymograph analysis further confirmed the short-lived and poorly processive nature of KCBP movement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), which is the characteristic of non-processive motors of the kinesin-14 subfamily (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fink et al., 2009</a>). We then quantified the distributions of the velocity and the run-length observed for GFP-KCBP. The distributions indicated that, upon fitting to an exponential line, the motor moved at an average velocity of 0.68 \u03bcm/min (n = 647) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), and at an average run length of 0.18 \u03bcm (n = 647) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

                                "text": "To gain further insights into the role of KCBP in regulating trichome morphogenesis, we examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of GFP-KCBP during trichome morphogenesis. Indeed, we observed that KCBP largely colocalizes with cortical MTs in developing trichomes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Intriguingly, KCBP forms a gradient in the elongating trichome branch, with the highest density at the extreme apex, which is devoid of MTs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because the signal of mCherry-labeled MTs is much weaker than that of GFP and undergoes rapid photobleaching, it is extremely hard to detect in trichomes due to their three-dimension geometry; therefore, to ensure an accurate comparison, we further observed KCBP and MTs using the GFP-KCBP-expressing line and the GFP-TUB6-expressing line, respectively. We observed punctuate KCBP localization in the cortical gradient in developing trichomes, with the highest density at the extreme apex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D,G</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In GFP-TUB6-expressing trichomes at identical developmental stages, we observed transversely aligned MT arrays (transverse MT rings) in a similar gradient with higher MT density towards the branch tip, but forming a MT-depleted zone at the extreme apex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E,H</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). In consistent with the result from the double-labeling imaging (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), KCBP largely colocalizes with cortical MTs along the trichome branch, but shows highest levels in the MT-depleted zone at the branch apex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,G,H</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). We also found a similar distribution at the branching site where KCBP accumulates, but which has a relatively sparse MT network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,D,E</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). To further validate the presence of the MT-depleted zone, we used GCP2 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2014</a>), a component of the MT nucleation complex, as a control. Interestingly, we observed that, similar to MTs, GCP2 shows a tip-directed gradient, but with a GCP2-depleted zone at the extreme apexes of elongating branches (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>)."

The wild-type <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf trichome initiates from a bulging protodermal cell and then grows out into a cylindrical cell, which exhibits random organization of the MT array (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The random MT network shifts into a transverse MT array (rings) encircling the elongating cylindrical cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Slightly later, an area near the tip bulges out and gradually forms the primary branch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). Most trichomes undergo two consecutive branching events to form the typical three-branch pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). During trichome branch elongation, cortical MTs also shift to transverse rings with the typical tip-directed MT density gradient (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>). Intriguingly, a MT-depleted zone occurs at the extreme apex of the elongating branch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). At the maturation stage, fully elongated trichome branches form a fine and pointed tip, and cortical MTs reorient to an oblique or longitudinal configuration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Strikingly, the rigor-KCBP exerted specific dominant-negative effects that resulted in more-severe trichome phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,G\u2013N</a>), resembling a class of trichome mutants with defects in the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib2\">Basu et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2005a</a>). Most trichomes in plants expressing rigor-KCBP contained two branches but had an extremely twisted and swollen branch (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013I</a>), and some of them had extremely elongated branches, more than two times as long as the wild-type control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M,N</a>). Interestingly, a small fraction of trichomes formed three branches but still contained one or two swollen and twisted branches (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J\u2013L</a>). Moreover, we observed more-severe abnormalities in the organization of both cortical MTs and F-actin in rigor-KCBP trichomes when compared to the wild-type control (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, the typical, two-branched trichomes in <i>zwichel</i> mutants are aligned in a nearly parallel pattern on leaves, with the elongated and pointed branch toward the proximal part and another shortened and blunt-ended branch toward the distal part (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">H\u00fclskamp et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</a>). Notably, in rigor-KCBP trichomes, the elongated and pointed branch toward the proximal part keeps unchanged, and the extremely swollen and twisting specifically takes place in another branch, which derives from the shortened and blunt-ended branch of the <i>kcbp-1</i> background (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

The MyTH4 domain and the FERM domain are usually found in a tandem in myosins of the Myosin VII, X, and XV families, which differ substantially from the Myosin VIII and XI families found in the plant lineage. Myo VII contains a pair of MyTH4-FERM tandem domains, the second FERM domain of the <i>Drosophila</i> Myo VIIa binds to actin at high density (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2009</a>). Unlike Myo VII, the MyTH-FERM tandem of Myo X, but not either of the isolated domains, was shown to bind to MTs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Weber et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</a>) and also binds its cargo proteins, including \u03b2-integrins and the axonal guidance receptor DCC (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wei et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, in <i>Drosophila</i> myosin XV Sisyphus, the MyTH4 domain binds to MTs, whereas the FERM domain binds to various cargos including the MT-severing protein, Katanin p60 subunit (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2008</a>). In the present study, by single-molecule imaging, we dissected the functional domain of the N-terminal tail and demonstrated that the NT plus the MyTH4 domain functions as a second MT-binding region besides the motor domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), and the FERM domain physically binds to F-actin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Thus, this work provides the first direct evidence linking the MT-based KCBP motor with the actin cytoskeleton, and further indicates that KCBP functions as a hub protein to mediate the interplay between MTs and actin filaments. Most importantly, our work solves the long-standing mystery of the function of the unique MyTH4-FERM domain in KCBP. We propose that the introduction of the MyTH4-FERM domain into the N-terminal tail region of a Kinesin-14 motor during evolution conferred the novel functions of KCBP: the NT and the MyTH4 domain act synergistically to bind strongly to MTs, but still maintain the MT-binding activity of the individual domains, and the FERM domain carries out the novel actin-binding activity, thus, orchestrating the interaction between MTs and the actin cytoskeleton."

                                "text": "Our speculation is supported by the genetic evidence that the KCBP containing the NT-MyTH4 truncation could not rescue the <i>kcbp-1</i> phenotype, but either the NT-truncated version of KCBP or the MyTH4-truncated version could fully complement the <i>kcbp-1</i> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These findings indicate that the second MT-binding domain (NT+MyTH4) is essential for trichome morphogenesis, yet either the NT or the MyTH4 domain is fully functional, and compensate each other to bind to MTs. Surprisingly, either the FERM-truncated KCBP or the MyTH4-FERM-truncated KCBP could rescue the <i>kcbp-1</i> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This unexpected finding indicates that the FERM domain is dispensable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), despite its actin-binding activity. However, our spatio-temporal observation revealed that loss-of-function mutation of <i>KCBP</i> results in defects in both MTs and F-actin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>). Moreover, the interaction between KCBP and the actin cytoskeleton was genetically highlighted by the phenotype of plants expressing the dominant-negative rigor-KCBP construct, which show twisting, swollen trichome phenotype, similar to aberrant trichome morphology in a class of mutants of actin-related genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, we proposed that KCBP indeed regulates actin dynamics, yet its actin-related function is redundant with other proteins in a same pathway. One explanation is that KCBP may function redundantly with KCH kinesins in the same kinesin-14 subfamily, which is extremely expanded in plants. KCH kinesins not only are minus-end-directed kinesins as with KCBP but bind to both MTs and F-actin, acting as dynamic linkers between MTs and actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib42\">Preuss et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Petrasek and Schwarzerova, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schneider and Persson, 2015</a>). So, further live-cell imaging and genetic analyses are required to investigate the potential functional redundancy between KCHs and KCBP. Another possibility is that KCBP may be partially redundant with the actin nucleator ARP2/3 complex as well as the W/SRC complex. The second scenario is supported by previous findings that KCBP acts in the same genetic pathway with DIS1/ARP3, a member of the ARP2/3 complex, and IBT1/SCAR2, a subunit of the W/SRC complex (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schwab et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2005a</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2005b</a>), and that ARP2/3 partially colocalizes with MTs in pavement cells and the W/SRC subunit ABIL3 binds to cortical MTs when overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jorgens et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, ARP2/3 and BRK1, a subunit of the W/SRC complex, were shown to specifically accumulate at the branch apex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dyachok et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</a>). Thus, most likely, KCBP functions redundantly with ARP2/3 and W/SRC complexes to organize the cortical F-actin at the branch apex."

However, the exact nature of the cytoskeletal organization that enables the unique growth mode has not yet been elucidated. Here, we provided live-cell images in high quality, showing the spatio-temporal dynamics and 3-D reconstruction of cytoskeletal organization during trichome morphogenesis. Our observations clearly showed that the transverse MT rings encircling elongating branches and the MT-depleted zone at the extreme apexes are required for trichome elongation and tip sharpening, consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beilstein and Szymanski, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, our observations also revealed that parallel actin cables along the growth axis and the cortical F-actin cap are required for trichome elongation and tip sharpening. Several previous reports also documented the cortical F-actin cap near the branch tips of elongating trichomes, but its configuration remains a matter of debate because of the technical challenges of live-cell imaging of trichome tips. By immunostaining, despite the very dim signal, the cortical F-actin cap was detected as roughly showing a transverse pattern (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2005a</a>), but phalloidin staining showed a clear F-actin cap mainly in a longitudinal pattern (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</a>). Here, we acquired high-quality images in live trichomes using ABD2-GFP labeling, and these clearly showed the F-actin cap mainly in a transverse pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 4</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We consider that live-cell imaging with ABD2-GFP gives a weaker signal, but should reflect the natural scenario. We also note that the fine F-actin cap at trichome branch tips is distinct from the actin fringe that is seen in a longitudinal pattern at the subapical domain of pollen tubes, which undergo tip growth (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lovy-Wheeler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Su et al., 2012</a>). Instead, the specific cytoskeletal configuration, especially for the MT-depleted zone and the cortical F-actin cap near the trichome branch tip, may be associated with the unique, polarized diffuse growth of trichome branch elongation accompanied by tip sharpening during trichome cell shaping."

This notion is further supported by our important discovery that KCBP exhibits a cortical gradient along elongating branches and concentrates at the extreme apexes, where are colonized by the MT-depleted zone and the cortical F-actin cap (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our findings indicated that KCBP is required for establishing the transverse MT rings to promote branch elongation, and that, through the FERM domain, KCBP may dominantly bind to cortical F-actin. This binding occurs at higher density at the extreme apex, as suggested by previous findings (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2009</a>), and plays a critical role in the assembly of the F-actin cap, which then facilitates the maintenance of the MT-depleted zone to promote rapid elongation of trichome branches and tip sharpening (see model in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Recent work showed that ARP2/3 and BRK1, a subunit of the W/SRC complex, specifically accumulate at the branch apex, and plasma-membrane associated ARP2/3 and W/SRC complexes likely nucleate cortical F-actin at the branch apex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dyachok et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, most likely, KCBP functions in concert with the ARP2/3 complex as well as the W/SRC complex to assemble the specific cytoskeletal configuration near the branch tip region during trichome cell shaping. It would also be interesting to examine whether a local MT disassembly machinery occurs at the extreme branch apex to generate the MT-depleted zone, but an intriguing hypothesis is that KCBP might recruit the Katanin p60 subunit via its FERM domain, as suggested by the previous finding from the MyTH4-FERM-containing Sisyphus myosin motor (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2008</a>), to locally disassemble MTs."

                                "text": "During trichome branching, we propose that once the branching program initiates, by a yet-unknown mechanism, the branching site becomes an isotropic zone with randomized sparse MT network; then, KCBP is required to rapidly colonize that area and organize the new transverse MT rings and the cortical F-actin cap to prime the initiation and subsequent elongation of the incipient branch. Previous studies showed that treatment with the MT stabilizing drug taxol can produce second branches in <i>kcbp</i> trichomes, albeit at the relatively low frequency of 5.5%, indicating that transient stabilization of MTs could compensate for the loss of KCBP activity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mathur and Chua, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buschmann et al., 2009</a>). Importantly, we revealed that KCBP exhibits non-processive movement by the live-cell, single-molecule (particle) motility assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), and that the second MT-binding domain is essential, based on the genetic complementation tests (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>); our data further support the bundling or crosslinking role of KCBP in the formation of the MT rings at the branching site. KCBP may further function in concert with AN1, a CtBP/BARS protein implicated in Golgi membrane trafficking and interacts with KCBP both physically and genetically (<a href=\"#bib16\">Folkers et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Minamisawa et al., 2011</a>), to integrate cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking to promote trichome branch initiation."

Our findings reveal the in vivo function of the plant unique kinesin KCBP and further provide significant insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms that will close the knowledge gap between the cytoskeletal regulation and cell shape control, especially for the shaping of leaf trichome cells, which represents a unique growth mode comprising trichome branching, polarized branch elongation, and tip sharpening."

Among the <i>zwichel</i> (<i>zwi</i>) alleles, the <i>zwi-3</i> allele and <i>zwi-w2</i> allele were frequently used in previous studies. The <i>zwi-3</i> allele in Columbia ecotype background, which is expected to produce a truncated ZWI protein (KCBP) at 522 amino acids position lacking the coiled-coil and motor domains, shows the typical, strong <i>zwi</i>chel trichome phenotype (<a href=\"#bib38\">Oppenheimer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krishnakumar and Oppenheimer, 1999</a>). And the <i>zwi-w2</i> allele in RLD ecotype background shows weaker <i>zwichel</i> trichome phenotype, containing a small portion (about 15.9%) of three-branched trichomes, because sequencing analysis revealed that although a C to T transition results in a stop codon at amino acid position 72, re-initiation of translation likely occurs using the in-frame AUG \u223c20 bp downstream from that mutation site as the start codon (<a href=\"#bib16\">Folkers et al., 2002</a>). To find a strong or null <i>KCBP/ZWICHEL</i> allele in Columbia ecotype background, we searched the Salk collection in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> Biological Resource Center, and finally selected the accession of Salk_031704, which contains a T-DNA insertion in the third exon (22 exons in the <i>KCBP/ZWICHEL</i> gene in total) and shows typical, strong <i>zwi</i> trichome phenotype. Coincidently, the Salk_031704 strong allele was used in recent studies and was designated either as <i>kcbp-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Humphrey et al., 2015</a>) or as <i>zwiA</i> (accession is N531704), which was ordered from the Nottingham <i>Arabidopsis</i> Stock Centre (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buschmann et al., 2015</a>).

Previous analyses of trichome phenotypes caused by mutations in either microtubules or actin gave contrasting phenotypes, i.e. those lacking microtubules gave fewer branches and those lacking actin gave stubby branches. A publication in 1997 indicated that plants that lacked expression of KCBP (for Kinesin-like Calmodulin-Binding Protein, i.e. mutants of <i>Zwichel</i>) had a trichome phenotype that was suggestive of both a microtubule (MT) and actin problem, but no particular follow up with respect to the possible bridging role between MTs and actin was ever published. Here the authors study KCBP, which contains numerous domains. They show that two of the novel domains near the N-terminus bind microtubules (the MyTH4 domain) or actin (the FERM domain), and because of this they suggest that KCBP might provide the link (hub protein) needed to coordinate microtubules and actin during trichome development. They use fluorescent-tag imaging to show where this protein is localized in trichomes, i.e. in a gradient and concentrated at branching sites and tips of elongating branches, where there are not MTs but where there is cortical F-actin. They then use a series of deletion constructs to determine the roles of the different domains of the constructs, by introducing them into the kcbp mutant background - from these studies they eliminate a role for the calmodulin-binding domain, but surprisingly, also eliminate a role for the FERM domain. That is, it is mostly the N-terminus and the MyTH4 domain that are needed to complement the mutant phenotype."

By tracking the beads that had been placed on the surface of elongating trichome branches, the extension of trichome branches had been established to occur along the whole cell surface, clearly indicating that trichome branches grow in the mode of diffuse growth. Interestingly, the experiments meanwhile showed that diffuse-growing trichome branches elongate in a polarized manner, the distal regions of the branch grows at significantly faster rates than the branch base (please see Figure 4 in <a href=\"#bib46\">Schwab et al., 2003</a>; please also see Figures 1c and 1d in <a href=\"#bib58\">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</a>).

The wall thickness measurements by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that there is a tip-to-base wall thickness gradient in elongating trichomes and the tip region is the thinnest part; another signal intensity analysis using propidium iodide further confirmed the wall thickness gradient (please see Figures 2g, 2h and 2i in <a href=\"#bib58\">Yanagisawa et al., 2015</a>). Thus, in elongating trichomes, the cell wall autofluorescence at the tip should be weaker than that at the base, and should not affect the observation of KCBP localization pattern.

Although both <i>zwi-3</i> and <i>zwi-w2</i> are loss of function alleles, we had the same concern as you proposed, i.e., the remaining truncated version of KCBP may interact with other partners and interfere with the complementation effects.

The <i>kcbp-</i><i>1</i> (Salk_031704) mutant allele, which shows the same trichome phenotype as with the loss-of-function alleles of <i>zwi-3</i> and the <i>zwi-w2</i>, is the best candidate because it contains a T-DNA insertion in the third exon, and was confirmed to be a null allele (please see Figure 3 in <a href=\"#bib19\">Humphrey et al., 2015</a>). The homozygous <i>kcbp-1</i> lines, which were identified by detecting the T-DNA insertion (please see the <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a>), were used to be the null KCBP background in our complementation tests, and the primers were already listed in the primer list in the previous version.

And the <i>zwi-w2</i> allele in RLD ecotype background shows weaker <i>zwichel</i> trichome phenotype, containing a small portion (about 15.9 %) of three-branched trichomes, because sequence analysis revealed that although a C to T transition results in a stop codon at amino acid position 72, re-initiation of translation likely occurs using the in-frame AUG \u223c20 bp downstream from that mutation site as the start codon (<a href=\"#bib16\">Folkers et al., 2002</a>).

The <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a> has been included as the new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. Furthermore, we performed detailed genetic identification of the <i>kcbp-1/zwiA</i> allele according to your suggestion. Sequencing analysis revealed that the T-DNA insertion is in the third exon and located at the position of 957 bp downstream the ATP start codon of the <i>KCBP</i> gene (please see the new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, and its legend), and introduces a premature stop codon 61 bp downstream the insertion site by frame shift. As expected, we couldn\u2019t detect the transcripts of the <i>KCBP</i> after the T-DNA insertion, but we indeed detected weaker transcription of partial <i>KCBP</i> in front of the insertion site (please see the new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). So, the <i>kcbp-1/zwiA</i> mutant is expected to produce a short peptide of 284 amino acids containing the first 263 amino acids of KCBP at a lower level. Nevertheless, the <i>kcbp-1/zwiA</i> allele is still the best choice for us because it shows strong, typical <i>zwichel</i> trichome phenotype, and is in Columbia ecotype background and publicly available, thus it is frequently used in recent studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buschmann et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Humphrey et al., 2015</a>). In addition, we don\u2019t think that the N-terminal 263 amino acids residual in the <i>kcbp-1/zwiA</i> mutant would affect the complementation tests because most of the constructs (6/9) could rescue the typical <i>zwichel</i> trichome defects (please see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Actually, the <i>zwiA</i> had also been successfully used for the genetic complementation in the most recent study (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buschmann et al., 2015</a>)."
