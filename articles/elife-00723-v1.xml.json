Previous ultrastructural studies of vesicle recycling were conducted in dissected preparations using an intense stimulation to maximize the probability of release. Here, a single light stimulus was applied to motor neurons in intact <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes expressing channelrhodopsin, and the animals rapidly frozen. We found that docked vesicles fuse along a broad active zone in response to a single stimulus, and are replenished with a time constant of about 2 s. Endocytosis occurs within 50 ms adjacent to the dense projection and after 1 s adjacent to adherens junctions. These studies suggest that synaptic vesicle endocytosis may occur on a millisecond time scale following a single physiological stimulus in the intact nervous system and is unlikely to conform to current models of endocytosis."

Previous ultrastructural studies of vesicle recycling were conducted in dissected preparations using an intense stimulation to maximize the probability of release. Here, a single light stimulus was applied to motor neurons in intact <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nematodes expressing channelrhodopsin, and the animals rapidly frozen. We found that docked vesicles fuse along a broad active zone in response to a single stimulus, and are replenished with a time constant of about 2 s. Endocytosis occurs within 50 ms adjacent to the dense projection and after 1 s adjacent to adherens junctions. These studies suggest that synaptic vesicle endocytosis may occur on a millisecond time scale following a single physiological stimulus in the intact nervous system and is unlikely to conform to current models of endocytosis."

It takes roughly 15\u201320 s for vesicles to be recycled in this way. By contrast, synapses with very high firing rates are thought to recycle vesicles through a faster process known as \u2018kiss and run\u2019, in which vesicles are not fully integrated into the membrane, but instead fuse transiently with it to form a reversible pore within about a second."

To test the \u2018vesicle hypothesis\u2019, two groups of scientists stimulated frog motor neurons and examined the ultrastructure by electron microscopy. After prolonged stimulation, it was noted that synaptic vesicles were depleted from the terminals, suggesting that vesicles were being consumed during synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ceccarelli et al., 1972</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Heuser and Reese, 1973</a>).

Purification of vesicles from brain demonstrated that synaptic vesicle proteins (and not just membrane) are found in clathrin-coated vesicles (<a href=\"#bib50\">Maycox et al., 1992</a>). Furthermore, clathrin-coated pits accumulate at terminals in which vesicle scission is blocked by interfering with dynamin (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koenig and Ikeda, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Shupliakov et al., 1997</a>).

The prodigious rate of exocytosis at some synapses may exceed the speed of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For example, during locomotion, lumbar motor neurons in the mouse can fire at \u223c100 Hz (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maeno-Hikichi et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, in some central synapses such as the Calyx of Held, firing rates can reach up to 500 Hz (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lorteije et al., 2009</a>). Calculations suggest that vesicles are reused every 13 s at the Calyx of Held, assuming that all the vesicles in the terminal are mobile (<a href=\"#bib57\">Neher, 2010</a>). This rate of reuse is faster than the 15\u201320 s required to recover vesicles by clathrin-mediated endocytosis at synapses (<a href=\"#bib51\">Miller and Heuser, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cocucci et al., 2012</a>), and would overwhelm the capacity to recycle vesicles. Furthermore, experiments using FM dyes suggest that only 5\u201320% of vesicles in the terminal are cycling during physiological activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harata et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rizzoli and Betz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Denker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Marra et al., 2012</a>).

When frog neuromuscular junctions were stimulated at low frequency, vesicles with fusion pores lacking clathrin coats were observed in the active zone (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ceccarelli et al., 1972</a>). The fusion pores are unstable, lasting about a second (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wu and Wu, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Some experiments using optical tracers including FM dyes, pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins, and quantum dots support a fast pathway (<a href=\"#bib62\">Richards et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aravanis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Harata et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib86\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Park et al., 2012</a>). This has led to a model in which exocytosis and endocytosis are coupled via a transient fusion pore. The key aspects of kiss-and-run endocytosis is that first, the vesicles are recycled at the site of release in the active zone; second, they are recovered quickly (in less than a second), and third, the vesicles remain intact and retain their protein and membrane complement, rather than fully collapsing into the membrane."

Bulk endocytosis has been observed following intense stimulation at frog neuromuscular junctions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Miller and Heuser, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Richards et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gaffield et al., 2011</a>), retinal bipolar cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Holt et al., 2003</a>), and mammalian central synapses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clayton et al., 2010</a>)."

However, in each of these studies, non-physiological or intense sustained stimulation was used in dissected preparations to trigger cycling of synaptic vesicles. For example, for cross sections of the frog neuromuscular junction, Heuser and Reese applied stimulation at 10 Hz for 1 min (1973), and Ceccarelli employed 2 Hz stimulation for 2 hr (1972). For freeze-fracture studies, Heuser and Miller delivered a single stimulus in the presence of 4-aminopyridine and 10 mM calcium; these images provide the best temporal analysis of endocytosis but the nature of the invaginations was not examined in cross sections. Here, we stimulated motor neurons in vivo with a single activation pulse by using the light-sensitive ion channel ChIEF (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lin et al., 2009</a>). Samples were rapidly frozen using a high-pressure freezer, and the ultrastructure was examined using transmission electron microscopy. We found that endocytosis occurs rapidly at two sites, adjacent to the dense projection at the center of the synapse and at adherens junctions flanking the synapse. These two regions represent the edges of the active zone, and endocytosis is complete within 50 ms and 3 s, respectively, after stimulation."

Here, we expressed ChIEF, a variant of channelrhodopsin that is less prone to desensitization (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lin et al., 2009</a>), in acetylcholine motor neuron. We applied a single pulse of blue light to animals while recording currents from the post-synaptic muscle cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

These results suggest that fusing vesicles had collapsed into the membrane by 50 ms but that release sites had not been refilled. We estimated the total number of vesicle fusions and determined the release sites by comparing docked vesicles before and after stimulation. In unstimulated neurons, there were about 11 docked vesicles in the active zone lateral to the dense projection. A single stimulus caused the release of about six to seven vesicles from profiles containing a dense projection, or about one third of the docked vesicles in these sections. These synapse reconstructions are only partial. From full end-to-end reconstructions of synapses, we previously counted a mean of 34 docked vesicles per synapse (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>).

Acetylcholine neuromuscular junctions in <i>C. elegans</i> exhibit rapid depression when stimulated at high frequency (<a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). To determine the refilling rate of the readily releasable pool, we characterized paired-pulse depression at acetylcholine neuromuscular junctions. We applied two 10 ms light pulses to neuromuscular junctions of transgenic animals (<i>acr-16(ok789)</i>; P<i>unc- 17::ChIEF::mCherry</i>) while patch-clamping a body wall muscle. Nicotine-sensitive acetylcholine receptors (encoded by <i>acr-16</i>) desensitize rapidly, and their resensitization would distort the time constant for the recovery of the readily-releasable pool. Therefore, the paired-pulse recordings were performed in animals lacking nicotine-sensitive but retaining the non-desensitizing levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptors. By varying the time of the application of the second pulse, the recovery rate from synaptic depression was measured (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The time constant (\u03c4) for the slow phase of recovery was 2.2 s, and required about 6 s for full recovery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

Acetylcholine motor neurons were depolarized with a single light pulse, allowed to recover for 20 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, 300 ms, 1 s, 3 s, and 10 s, and then frozen (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013H</a>).

Docked vesicles were not depleted in transgenic worms without trans-retinal (the second column in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>), suggesting that the depletion of vesicles depended on the activation of channelrhodopsin. Docked vesicles in active zones recovered with a time constant of 2.4 s (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which corresponds well to the rate of electrophysiological recovery. The total number of vesicles, as well as tethered vesicles, decreased slightly after stimulation but recovered by 300 ms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>) and can be accounted for by the number of vesicles lost through fusion. This fluctuation may indicate that vesicles pass through a tethered intermediate (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zenisek et al., 2000</a>).

In the kiss-and-run model vesicles do not collapse into the membrane, but instead the fusion pore reverses rapidly (within 1 s; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>) to regenerate the vesicle. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is thought to take place lateral to the active zone, by the relatively slow (\u223c20 s; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miller and Heuser, 1984</a>) recruitment of clathrin machinery (<a href=\"#bib64a\">Rizzoli and Jahn, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</a>). Images from three different animals frozen at each time point were scored blind for endocytic structures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In these experiments, serial sections that contained a cross-section of the dense projection were reconstructed, usually 4\u20136 synaptic profiles, and together are defined as a \u2018synapse\u2019 for these experiments. At 20 ms after stimulation, about 50% of the synapses exhibited large invaginations next to the dense projection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D,G and H</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These invaginations were present 30 ms after stimulation but were completely absent by 50 ms. Large vesicles were adjacent to the dense projection in 50% of the synapses at 20 ms, their frequency increases at 30 ms, and peaks at 50 ms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). At least one large vesicle but usually more were found adjacent to each dense projection at 50 ms after stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E and F</a>; more examples in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These large vesicles appeared only after stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting that the formation of large vesicles is triggered by exocytosis. The average diameter of the large invaginations and vesicles near dense projection (42.8 nm) was significantly larger than synaptic vesicles (29.3 nm; p&lt;0.0001) or fusing vesicles (28.4 nm; p&lt;0.0001; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and the diameter was bimodally distributed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Large vesicles at the dense projection declined after 50 ms, and large vesicles peaked in the center of the synaptic varicosity between 100 ms and 300 ms. The large vesicles in the center of the synapse declined to background levels by 3 s suggesting that they are resolved into smaller vesicles, potentially synaptic vesicles."

Large vesicles are defined as clear-core vesicles with a diameter larger than 35 nm. Large vesicles at the dense projection are within a radial distance of 100 nm from the dense projection.

Akaike information criterion for unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal distributions were 352.6, 346.4, and 353.9, respectively, supporting the bimodal distribution.

Large vesicles associated with the adherens junction (within 50 nm) peak at 3 s and decline, suggesting that pits are precursors to large vesicles. After 10 s, the number of large vesicles adjacent to the adherens junction declines to background levels, and vesicles in the center of the terminal peak at this time (dashed line in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), suggesting that the vesicles were transported to the center of the terminal.

To test if dynamin is also required to resolve ultrafast endocytic intermediates at these sites into vesicles, <i>dyn-1(ky51)</i> animals were stimulated with a single light pulse and then frozen 1 s later. <i>dyn-1(ky51)</i> is a temperature-sensitive allele which is not functional at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clark et al., 1997</a>). Following the exposure to non-permissive temperature (30\u00b0C) for 2 min, large vesicles were observed adjacent to the dense projection and adherens junctions in the non-stimulated control (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>; more example micrographs <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These vesicles were often associated with a filament to the dense projection or membrane. Although necks were difficult to discern, prolonged incubation at the restrictive temperature (5 min) revealed the presence of membrane necks attached to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

We calculated the total amount of membrane exocytosed and endocytosed at 300 ms and at 1 s after stimulation in our profiles (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We estimate that a total of 132\u2013154 synaptic vesicles fused to the plasma membrane for all 22 synapses analyzed at the 300 ms time point and a total of 111 synaptic vesicle equivalents were recycled. For the 1 s time point, a total of 138\u2013161 synaptic vesicles were estimated to exocytose, and membrane area equivalent to roughly 144 synaptic vesicles was recovered. These data suggest that most vesicles that fuse during exocytosis are retrieved rapidly after exocytosis; 43% are recovered at dense projections with a time constant of less than 50 ms and 57% are recovered at adherens junctions with a time constant for pit resolution of 1.4 s (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>)."

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis predicts that vesicles collapse into the membrane and are recovered slowly at a specialized site lateral to the active zone. Kiss-and-run predicts that vesicles fuse briefly to the membrane and are recovered at the site of release. A long-standing criticism of these morphological studies has been that they did not employ single physiological stimuli, but rather relied on either high-frequency stimulation or pharmacological methods to increase exocytosis. A brief review is warranted: <a href=\"#bib28\">Heuser and Reese (1973)</a> stimulated neuromuscular junctions at 10 Hz for 1 min and then fixed the sample using ice-cold glutaraldehyde. After this intense stimulation, vesicles were depleted and invaginations with distinct clathrin coats appeared on the plasma membrane. <a href=\"#bib51\">Miller and Heuser (1984)</a> stimulated the nerve with a single stimulus in the presence of the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker 4-aminopyridine and 10 mM calcium and froze the sample rapidly using a freeze-slammer. 20 s after this single stimulus, pits formed at the lateral edges of the active zone. Because these were freeze-fracture studies, the presence of clathrin coats could not be ascertained. However, because clathrin coats had been observed in the 1973 study, they concluded that synaptic vesicle endocytosis is most likely mediated by clathrin (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heuser and Reese, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miller and Heuser, 1984</a>)."

Horseradish peroxidase (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ceccarelli et al., 1972</a>) and dextran (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ceccarelli et al., 1973</a>) were taken up into these invaginations, suggesting that endocytosis takes place at the active zone. Given the presence of invaginations with a narrow neck, they speculated that exocytosis and endocytosis are coupled via the fusion pore. To support these conclusions with high temporal resolution images, they applied a single stimulus in the presence of 4-aminopyridine and 10 mM calcium and preserved structure using a freeze slammer (<a href=\"#bib78\">Torri-Tarelli et al., 1985</a>). They did not observe exocytic figures accumulating between 2.5 ms and 10 ms, nor did they observe clathrin-coated vesicles at later time points as they expected based on the Heuser and Reese experiments, and concluded that vesicle fusion pores were reversing before collapse of the vesicles into the membrane (<a href=\"#bib78\">Torri-Tarelli et al., 1985</a>)."

Here, we developed a method to visualize the ultrastructure of endocytosis after a single stimulus in an intact <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system. Neurotransmission at <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions is likely to be graded rather than driven by an action potential; however, light stimulation via channelrhodopsin has been used to study single evoked responses at these synapses (<a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). The goal was to look in a sample that was stimulated only once rather than after high frequency stimulations to avoid bulk endocytosis, and to look at very rapid time scales that would distinguish clathrin-mediated endocytosis from kiss-and-run endocytosis. We found that synaptic vesicle fusion takes place along the entire face of the synapse from the dense projection to the adherens junction. By contrast, endocytosis takes place at the edges of the active zone, either directly adjacent to the dense projection or laterally at the adherens junction. Endocytosis adjacent to the dense projection is completed 50 ms after a stimulus, and endocytosis at the adherens junction occurs about 1 s after stimulation. Both of these events are rapid, and do not fully support either kiss-and-run or clathrin-mediated mechanisms."

By using TIRF microscopy, the release ready vesicles were shown to be within \u223c10 nm of the surface (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zenisek et al., 2000</a>). Docked vesicles can also be identified in electron micrographs. Careful comparisons of the pools for docked and for releasable vesicles demonstrated that they were of similar size (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</a>), and these were similar in size to the pool of vesicles that could be loaded with dye after stimulation by 40 action potentials (<a href=\"#bib69\">Schikorski and Stevens, 2001</a>). Here, we reinforce the relationship between the readily releasable pool and docked vesicles by examining the ultrastructure after light-activated stimulation at the <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junction.

About 60% of the docked vesicles fuse in response to a stimulus; these remaining docked vesicles may need to undergo a transition from an incompetent to a competent state (<a href=\"#bib58\">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hosoi et al., 2009</a>).

One interpretation is that these structures are exocytic in nature, that is, the large vesicles are the result of fusions between synaptic vesicles, which then fuse to the plasma membrane. This model is described as \u2018compound fusion\u2019(<a href=\"#bib65\">R\u00f6hlich et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez de Toledo and Fernandez, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Matthews and Sterling, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">He et al., 2009</a>). For example, at the synaptic ribbon in retinal bipolar cells large vesicles and invaginations are observed after stimulation and are thought to represent fusion between synaptic vesicles preceding exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Matthews and Sterling, 2008</a>). However, the pits we observe are likely to be endocytic rather than exocytic intermediates for four reasons. First, we observe simple fusions along the membrane that are the size of synaptic vesicles, whereas the pits at the dense projection and adherens junction are larger than synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Second, the fusions of docked synaptic vesicle are coincident with postsynaptic currents, both are no longer present after 30 ms, whereas the invaginations at the dense projection are still present after postsynaptic currents have declined. Third, invaginations at these sites are stabilized in temperature-sensitive dynamin mutants suggesting these are endocytic in nature. Fourth, there is a temporal order to these structures suggesting a precursor-product relationship between them. It is more likely that the presence of invaginations at the plasma membrane, followed by the presence of large vesicles at these sites, and then the translocation of large vesicles into the synaptic terminal represents an influx of membrane rather than an efflux."

The absence of coats on endocytic pits is consistent with the absence of a genetic requirement for clathrin heavy chain at <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sato et al., 2009</a>). However, making strong conclusions about the absence of a protein based on morphology in electron micrographs is highly risky. These results do not exclude the possibility that clathrin is required at synapses. In fact, synaptic vesicles are smaller in the temperature-sensitive allele of clathrin in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sato et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that vesicles may pass through a clathrin-coated intermediate at the neuromuscular junction, perhaps during the resolution of endosomes."

The appearance of endocytic structures within 50 ms after stimulation at the <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junction is consistent with kiss-and-run endocytosis. However, there are two morphological features that suggest kiss-and-run is unlikely to account for endocytosis after stimulation at the <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junction: position and size. Kiss-and-run is predicted to occur at the site of exocytosis: the vesicle forms a fusion pore, which reverses itself to regenerate an empty vesicle. All exocytic intermediates captured at 20 ms after stimulation at the <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junction have wide necks, suggesting that synaptic vesicles are collapsing into the membrane. Moreover, vesicles fuse throughout the active zone, but endocytosis takes place at the edges of the active zone. Although we cannot exclude the reversal of the fusion pore by some vesicles, a large amount of membrane must translocate to endocytic sites at the lateral margins of the synaptic membrane."

Thus, endocytic vesicles should be 30 nm in diameter. In fact, some of the vesicles recovered at dense projections were only slightly larger than a single vesicle. However, some endocytic structures adjacent to the dense projection are greater than twice the size of a synaptic vesicle. Moreover, the arrested endocytic structures in the dynamin mutants became even larger with prolonged synaptic activity.

In brief, an animal was immobilized on a Sylgard-coated glass coverslip by applying a cyanoacrylate adhesive along the dorsal side. A longitudinal incision was made in the dorsolateral region. The cuticle flap was folded back and glued to the coverslip, exposing the ventral nerve cord and two adjacent muscle quadrants. An upright microscope (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) equipped with a 40\u00d7 water immersion lens and 15\u00d7 eyepieces was used for viewing the preparation. Borosilicate glass pipettes with a tip resistance of \u223c 3\u20135 M\u03a9 were used as electrodes for voltage clamping. The classical whole-cell configuration was obtained by rupturing the patch membrane of a gigaohm seal formed between the recording electrode and a right medial body muscle two cells anterior to the vulva. The cell was voltage clamped at \u221260 mV to record mPSCs and ePSCs. Postsynaptic currents were amplified (EPC10; HEKA, Bellmore, NY) and acquired with Patchmaster software (HEKA). Data were sampled at a rate of 10 kHz after filtering at 2 kHz. The recording pipette solution contained the following: 120 mM KCl, 20 mM KOH, 5 mM TES, 0.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 36 mM sucrose, 5 mM EGTA, and 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP; adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH and osmolarity to 310\u2013320 mOsm with sucrose.

Amplitude and frequency of mPSCs were analyzed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). A detection threshold of 10 pA was used in initial automatic analysis, followed by visual inspections to include missed events (\u22655 pA) and to exclude false events resulting from baseline fluctuations. Amplitudes of ePSCs were measured with Patchmaster (HEKA) and analyzed with Fitmaster. The amplitude of the largest peak of ePSCs from each experiment was used for statistical analysis. Data were imported into Origin, version 7.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA), for graphing and statistical analysis. Unpaired <i>t</i>-test was used for statistical comparisons.

A 3-mm blue light-emitting diode (LED) was inserted into the bayonet just behind the specimen pod (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). For initial experiments, a power supply for the LED was constructed using a 9 V battery, a TIP110 transistor and a 200 k\u03a9 current limiting resistor. This was connected to the LED using sub micro twisted servo wire (Radical RC, Dayton, OH, <a href=\"http://www.radicalrc.com\">www.radicalrc.com</a>, W3ST-34JR). The transistor base was connected to an analog output channel of a USB multifunction DAQ device (NI-USB6008, National Instruments, Austin, TX, <a href=\"http://www.ni.com\">www.ni.com</a>). The DAQ device was driven by a custom Labview program (available on request) which could monitor an accelerometer mounted to the bayonet holder and update the LED output level every 7\u20138 ms. In later experiments, we constructed a dedicated device based on an Arduino Uno microcontroller board (<a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/\">www.arduino.cc/</a>) driven by custom firmware. For these experiments, we changed from the 3-mm LED to a 3.2 mm diameter high brightness LED (LZ1-00B200; LED Engin, <a href=\"http://www.ledengin.com/\">www.ledengin.com/</a>), fitted into the bayonet with a custom-machined adapter. The LED is powered using a dedicated constant current LED power module (7023-D-E-1000; Luxdrive, <a href=\"http://www.luxdrive.com/\">www.luxdrive.com/</a>), which is controlled by the microcontroller. The microcontroller triggers the freezing of the sample by communicating with the EMpact-2 via an RS232 serial communication channel.

Based on the accelerometer reading, the pressure increase occurs around 170 ms after sending out the \u2018start\u2019 signal. The 170 ms delay is required for the operating system of the freezer to communicate with the pressure firing switch. Since the freezing initiates 8 ms after the pressure application, 178 ms is required for specimens to freeze after sending out the \u2018start\u2019 signal. Thus, to freeze a sample 1 s after stimulation, one needs to activate the high pressure freezer 822 ms after the light stimulus; to freeze a sample 100 ms after stimulation, one needs to activate the high pressure freezer 78 ms \u2018before\u2019 the light. However, in our experiments, we found that the 170 ms delay is not consistent\u2014it varies by \u00b120 ms. Thus, the actual time between light stimulation and freezing was calculated post hoc from the accelerometer read-out vs when the light was stimulated. Unfortunately, for very short time points, the light was often flashed \u2018after\u2019 the sample was frozen because of fluctuations in the pressure time point."

From each axon profile containing a slice of the dense projection or one section adjacent to the dense projection, the locations of vesicles, plasma membrane, dense projection, and adherens junctions, as well as the diameters of vesicles, were annotated and exported as a text file. Data were analyzed as per \u2018profile\u2019, that is for synaptic vesicle docking or fusions, for which many events can be detected along the membrane. Alternatively, data were analyzed per \u2018synapse\u2019, that is a reconstructed region of a synapse around the dense projection, for which only one or two events occur such invaginations or the presence of large vesicles. Vesicles were categorized into three types depending on their appearance: synaptic vesicles, dense core vesicles, and large vesicles. Synaptic vesicles have a diameter of \u223c30 nm and are most abundant in the terminals. Synaptic vesicles that are in the physical contact with plasma membrane are categorized as docked vesicles. Other vesicles are close to the membrane (&lt;30 nm) but are not in contact with the membrane. Such vesicles with a physical tether are categorized as \u2018tethered\u2019, and such vesicles with no obvious tether are categorized as the \u201830 nm pool\u2019. Note that a combination of both pools was previously defined as the \u2018tethered pool\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Broadie et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Toonen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Siksou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gracheva et al., 2010</a>). Dense core vesicle can be distinguished by the dark appearance of the vesicle core, and their diameter is typically around 40 nm. Large vesicles are clear-core vesicles that are larger than 35 nm in diameter. Then, these text files were imported into the Matlab analysis program. In this program, the distances from each vesicle to the nearest edge of dense projection, to the closest plasma membrane, and to the adherens junctions were calculated. The total number of vesicles in the terminal was normalized based on the average area of the synaptic profile to account for the differences in the size of each terminal. The diameter of synaptic varicosities can vary greatly, although the density of vesicles within the varicosity does not. This variation can lead to irrelevant changes in the number of synaptic vesicles per profile from time point to time point. Thus, each value for the number of synaptic vesicles in a profile (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>) was normalized to the average profile area. Values thus really represent the number of synaptic vesicles in a typical synaptic varicosity with a cross-section of 60,700 nm<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, the numbers of vesicles docked or tethered along the active zone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,J</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>) were normalized by the average length of active zones from the dense projection to the flanking adherens junctions. Values thus really represent the number of synaptic vesicles along a typical active zone membrane of 670 nm."

These profiles are cross sections of a single synapse that include active zone membrane on two sides from the dense projection to the flanking adherens junctions. The dense projection spans approximately four sections (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>) and these sections encompass about one third of the vesicles found at a synapse. Thus, our reconstructions sample a significant fraction of vesicles at each synapse. On the other hand, it is likely that exocytic and endocytic events are occurring at the active zone in adjacent sections, leading to a systematic undercounting of recycling events per synapse. We confirmed the presence of exocytic and endocytic pits in profiles not containing a dense projection by examining adjacent sections. Endocytic pits in these sections were also strictly associated with adherens junctions but were not included in our calculations. Because these endocytic events are likely driven by local exocytosis, it is possible that exclusion of these domains does not bias our calculations."

Shallow pits peak at 300 ms at the adherens junction, and decline with a time constant of 1.4 s. Conversely, large vesicles accumulate between 1 and 3 s. Deep pits are only occasionally observed in the 1 s time point and must resolve into large vesicles rapidly. We assumed that the shallow pits observed at the adherens junctions will be resolved as a large vesicle with a diameter of \u223c43 nm. Thus, pits and large vesicles can be counted as endocytic events at the adherens junction."

The average diameter of 18 of these vesicles (70% of the vesicle at the dense projection) was \u223c37 nm (surface area = 4300 nm<sup>2</sup>), and the remaining eight had an average diameter of 46 nm (surface area = 6600 nm<sup>2</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Thus, the total surface area of membrane recovered at dense projections is 130,200 nm<sup>2</sup>. We also observed 29 shallow pits at adherens junctions. Assuming that each endocytic structure resolves into a large vesicle with a diameter of 43.2 nm (surface area = 6000 nm<sup>2</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), about 174,000 nm<sup>2</sup> of membrane was retrieved at adherens junctions.

Thus, of the 143 synaptic vesicles that fuse, we can account for 112 synaptic vesicle equivalents by the observed endocytic structures at the 300 ms time point. The total amount of membrane exocytosed and endocytosed is roughly equal, suggesting that most of the endocytic structures are likely present by 300 ms after stimulation."

This paper will be of high interest to the field \u2013 it is well written and easy to understand \u2013 one quickly gets the main message that endocytosis is not happening as one would have imagined.

This study is a tour de force that will be referred to by experts in the field for many years to come. The authors develop a modern version of the Heuser slam freeze protocol, utilizing photo-evoked ACh release. Samples are frozen as quickly as 20ms following photostimulation, allowing for a detailed temporal analysis of changes in synapse ultrastructure. A critical aspect of this study is the use of high pressure freezing to preserve membrane ultrastructure, which gives the most accurate description of SV docking. Using this experimental design Watanabe and colleagues analyze where and when SV exocytosis and endocytosis happen with high spatial and temporal resolution. The location of SV fusions is determined by two criteria. First, within 20ms of stimulation, they see shallow invaginations of the active zone plasma membrane, which have an average diameter indistinguishable from SVs. These structures are distributed throughout the length of the active zone (extending roughly 400 nm radially from the dense projection), are gone by 50ms following stimulation (when evoked synaptic charge transfer is completed). The authors conclude that these shallow pits correspond to evoked SV fusions. Second, they compare the spatial pattern of SV docking before and after stimulation. In this manner, they observe a loss of 10-20 docked SVs within 20ms, which recovers in the next several seconds (tau \u223c2 s). The authors also describe endocytic events, which are defined as shallow invaginations with diameters larger than SVs, and the subsequent appearance of larger diameter vesicles. These large diameter pits were observed at 20ms, persist for \u223c1 second after stimulation, and their persistence is exaggerated by mutations inactivating dynamin. Following the appearance of the endocytic structures, larger diameter vesicles are observed, which are interpreted as the scission products of the endocytic pits. By these criteria, endocytic events occur in two zones: adjacent to either the dense projection or the adherens junction (which forms the lateral boundary of the active zone). Both forms of endocytosis occur rapidly, proximal and distal events peaking at 30ms and 300ms respectively. These experiments (and the resulting data) are elegant, and the authors\u2019 interpretations and conclusions are convincing. Thus, I believe that this study will be of great interest to the broad community of synaptic cell biologists. I have a few minor comments, which the authors may wish to consider prior to publication."

They show that docked SVs are preferably consumed during single light stimuli, which release an equivalent of 4\u20136 SVs, i.e., about half of the docked SV pool (in these only partially reconstructed synapses). Loss of docked SVs is followed by the rapid appearance of shallow invaginations and large vesicles within 20-50 ms post-stimulation. Similar structures appear at distant adheres junctions within about 300 ms. The time course of appearance and consumption suggests a precursor-product relationship between invaginations and large vesicles. Further, disappearance of endocytic intermediates correlates with the replenishment of docked SVs and with the refilling of the RRP. Lastly, it is shown that resolution of enlarged invaginations into vesicles requires dynamin activity. Based on these results it is proposed that SV endocytosis in <i>C. elegans</i> involves two ultrafast mechanisms of membrane retrieval that occur at dense projections and at distant adherens junctions."

We counted the number of docked vesicles in UNC-13 mutants in unstimulated samples and 50 ms after stimulation. The number of docked vesicles was slightly reduced in these animals (0.5 \u00b1 0.1 docked vesicle/profile) compared to the non-stimulated control animals (0.78 \u00b1 0.1 docked vesicle/profile), but the change was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Moreover, post-synaptic currents are largely absent in UNC-13(s69) mutants, and thus we expect that there would be almost no exocytic intermediates in UNC-13 mutants. These data are consistent with the almost complete absence of evoked responses in UNC-13 mutants (Richmond, Weimer, and Jorgensen, 2001)."

The pool of tethered vesicles is large enough to refill the docked pool: there are 2.5 docked vesicles at rest per profile and 1.5 vesicles are lost after a stimulation. There are 3 tethered vesicles per active zone so it is possible that the tethered vesicles could refill the docked pool. Moreover, there is a statistically significant increase in the tethered pool while the docked pool is being refilled (1 second after the stimulus), and the tethered pool size is restored to its normal level when refilling of docked vesicles is complete (3 seconds).

We discuss this possibility extensively in the Discussion."

For example, calcium-activated potassium channels may limit calcium influx in subsequent stimuli and these must deactivate for recovery of the N-type channels (Dworetzky et al., 1996; Vergara et al., 1998). Alternatively, it is the calcium channels themselves that are inhibited by calcium influx (reviewed in Findeisen and Minor 2010; Su et al. 2012; Kim and Ryan 2013)."

Alpha acetylcholine-gated ion channels recover from desensitization of 200 ms (Mike et al., 2000), which is in the range for what we see for rapid recovery (\u03c4 = 100 ms). However, our electrophysiological experiments were done in a mutant lacking the alpha7-like ACR-16 receptor. Only the levamisole receptor was present which shows very little desensitization under high frequency stimulation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 2009</a>)."

In our distribution diagrams in the past the adherens junction generated a depressed region for docking \u2013 a region that we previously described as the \u201dvesicle free zone\u201d (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>). The position of the adherens junctions can be variable, one side of the VA or VB acetylcholine neurons that faces a muscle cell is typically longer, and in such a case, the adherens junctions may be located up to \u223c1000 nm from a dense projection. Vesicles that are docked to this face undergo exocytosis, and thus synaptic vesicles docked quite distant from the dense projection can undergo fusion at those sites. In the previous submission, we simply measured the distance from the dense projection to each docked vesicle whether they were in the active zone or beyond the adherens junction in the perisynaptic zone. The variability of the position of the adherens junction caused the \u02bbvesicle free zone\u02bc to be obscured in these figures. In this resubmission we only graphed docked vesicles in the active zone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Nevertheless, because some synapses are smaller than others, the number of docked vesicles declines simply because the declining number of synapses that contributed to this bin."

Thus, the apparent reduction in docked vesicles further than 133-660 nm is caused by the staggered ends of the active zones rather than a reduction in the density of docked vesicles.

We tried to perform this experiment using correlative nanoscopic fluorescence and electron microscopy (nano-fEM), but unfortunately this failed. There are several reasons for the failure. First, membrane contrast is too low in the absence of osmium to reliably spot invaginations. Osmium is normally used to provide contrast to membranes but cannot be used for localizing proteins because it oxidizes either the fluorescent protein in nano-fEM, or the antigen in immuno-EM and destroys the signal. Second, the membranes are blurred because nano-fEM uses a scanning electron micrograph. The resolution in SEM is limited by the diameter of the electron beam used to scan across the specimen. For our Nova Nano SEM the beam width is about 5 nm."

Third, the neck of invaginations will be particularly rare in our images. Our sections are 70-80 nm thick. A scanning electron microscope only visualizes the top surface of the section, approximately 5 nm. Thus, the invaginations must be cut perfectly at the plane of the neck so that the neck is at the surface of the plastic sections. The chance of catching the neck of these structures is just too low. Thus instead of localizing dynamin to the neck of invagination, we stimulated dynamin mutants. As a reminder, endocytic structures are already trapped at the plasma membrane without stimulation in these mutants due to the endogenous activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). Stimulation of these neurons generated even larger vesicles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>), demonstrating that membrane from evoked fusions was trapped in invaginations at the dense projection and adherens junction."
