Notch is further characterized by a two-fold relationship with its Delta-Serrate (DSL) ligands, as ligands from opposing cells (<i>trans</i>-ligands) activate Notch, whereas ligands expressed in the same cell (<i>cis</i>-ligands) inhibit signaling. We show that cells without both cis and trans ligands are able to mediate Notch-dependent developmental events during <i>Drosophila</i> oogenesis, indicating ligand-independent Notch activity occurs when the receptor is free of <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> ligands. Furthermore, <i>cis</i>-ligands can reduce Notch activity in endogenous and genetically-induced situations of elevated <i>trans</i>-ligand-independent Notch signaling. We conclude that cis-expressed ligands exert their repressive effect on Notch signaling in cases of <i>trans</i>-ligand independent activation, and propose a new function of <i>cis</i>-inhibition which buffers cells against accidental Notch activity."
