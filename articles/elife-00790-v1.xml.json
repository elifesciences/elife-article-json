Fungi employ LysM effectors to prevent recognition of cell wall-derived chitin by host immune receptors, although the mechanism to compete for chitin binding remained unclear. Structural analysis of the LysM effector Ecp6 of the fungal tomato pathogen <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i> reveals a novel mechanism for chitin binding, mediated by intrachain LysM dimerization, leading to a chitin-binding groove that is deeply buried in the effector protein. This composite binding site involves two of the three LysMs of Ecp6 and mediates chitin binding with ultra-high (pM) affinity. Intriguingly, the remaining singular LysM domain of Ecp6 binds chitin with low micromolar affinity but can nevertheless still perturb chitin-triggered immunity. Conceivably, the perturbation by this LysM domain is not established through chitin sequestration but possibly through interference with the host immune receptor complex."

Fungi employ LysM effectors to prevent recognition of cell wall-derived chitin by host immune receptors, although the mechanism to compete for chitin binding remained unclear. Structural analysis of the LysM effector Ecp6 of the fungal tomato pathogen <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i> reveals a novel mechanism for chitin binding, mediated by intrachain LysM dimerization, leading to a chitin-binding groove that is deeply buried in the effector protein. This composite binding site involves two of the three LysMs of Ecp6 and mediates chitin binding with ultra-high (pM) affinity. Intriguingly, the remaining singular LysM domain of Ecp6 binds chitin with low micromolar affinity but can nevertheless still perturb chitin-triggered immunity. Conceivably, the perturbation by this LysM domain is not established through chitin sequestration but possibly through interference with the host immune receptor complex."

Although most species are saprophytic, many are causative agents of disease and include plant pathogens that cause considerable yield losses in agricultural crops worldwide (<a href=\"#bib43\">Skamnioti and Gurr, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Oliver, 2012</a>). To sense the presence of potential pathogens, hosts employ cell surface receptors that detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to activate immunity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boller and Felix, 2009</a>). Chitin, an <i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) homopolymer, is the primary structural component of fungal cell walls and is recognized as a PAMP by plant cell surface receptors that contain extracellular lysin motifs (LysMs) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Felix et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shibuya et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shibuya et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kombrink et al., 2011</a>). The first chitin receptor has been cloned from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) as the chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kaku et al., 2006</a>) that forms a receptor complex in a ligand-dependent manner that furthermore includes the chitin elicitor receptor kinase-1 (OsCERK1; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shimizu et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> CERK1 binds chitin and is required for chitin-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Miya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Iizasa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Petutschnig et al., 2010</a>). However, no homologs of rice CEBiP could be implicated in chitin-triggered immunity against fungal infection in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shinya et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). Recently, a crystal structure of the AtCERK1 ectodomain was determined, revealing chitin binding to one of the three AtCERK1 LysMs only (Protein Data Bank code 4EBZ; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). LysM2 of AtCERK1 binds three GlcNAc residues of a longer chitin oligomer in a shallow groove on the surface of the protein, with both ends of the oligomer as well as one half side of each of the three bound GlcNAc residues protruding into the solvent (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Biochemical experiments suggest that sufficiently long chitin oligomers act as bivalent ligands, leading to ligand-induced AtCERK1 dimerization that is required for immune signaling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>)."

The leaf mold fungus <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i> abundantly secretes the LysM-containing effector protein Ecp6 (for extracellular protein 6; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bolton et al., 2008</a>) during colonization of its host tomato. Ecp6 acts as a scavenger of chitin fragments and thus prevents recognition of the fungus by host immune receptors (<a href=\"#bib21\">de Jonge et al., 2010</a>). Intriguingly, Ecp6 homologs occur throughout the fungal kingdom, suggesting a fundamental role of chitin scavenging in fungal pathogenicity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bolton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">de Jonge and Thomma, 2009</a>). Indeed, LysM effectors from the fungal wheat pathogen <i>Mycosphaerella graminicola</i> and the rice pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> suppress chitin-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marshall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mentlak et al., 2012</a>).

To this end, Ecp6 was heterologously produced in the yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i> and purified. Initial Ecp6 vapor-diffusion crystallization screening consistently yielded intertwined plate-like crystals that grew overnight. These crystals were harvested, smashed in stabilizing mother liquid and used for micro-seeding (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bergfors, 2003</a>). In this manner, large Ecp6 protein crystals that belonged to space group <i>P</i>3<sub>2</sub>21 were obtained. The structure was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) and refined to a resolution of 1.6 \u00c5 with an <i>R</i><sub>work</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>free</sub> of 20.3% and 22.5%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

The chitin oligomer was likely co-purified with Ecp6 and derived from the cell wall of the <i>P. pastoris</i> expression system. The observation that the chitin oligomer remained adhered to Ecp6 during the protein purification procedure suggests that it is bound to the groove with high affinity. Thus, our finding illustrates the remarkable potential of Ecp6 to instantly and strongly bind chitin after secretion by fungal cells, a scavenging activity that is expected to similarly occur after secretion by <i>C. fulvum</i> to prevent chitin oligosaccharides from activating host immune receptors (<a href=\"#bib21\">de Jonge et al., 2010</a>). The loop between the first \u03b2-sheet and the first \u03b1-helix and the loop between the second \u03b1-helix and the second \u03b2-sheet in both LysM1 and LysM3 interact with chitin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), similar to the previously reported chitin binding by single LysM domains including LysM2 of AtCERK1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohnuma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Koharudin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>)."

Specifically, the groove is shaped by the amino acids <sup>20</sup>GDTLT<sup>24</sup> and <sup>46</sup>PNLIEL<sup>51</sup> of LysM1 and <sup>150</sup>GDLFV<sup>154</sup> and <sup>176</sup>PSKL<sup>179</sup> of LysM3. The chitin binding is further strengthened by noncovalent interactions among proximate residues on the complementary surfaces of LysM1 (N<sup>45</sup> and <sup>47</sup>NLIE<sup>50</sup>) and LysM3 (<sup>150</sup>GDLFVD<sup>155</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The concerted action of two LysM domains that compose a single binding groove and the many noncovalent bonds that are involved in the interaction with chitin may collectively provide a mechanistic explanation for high affinity substrate binding, resulting in sequestration by Ecp6 of cell wall chitin from the heterologous host <i>P. pastoris</i>. Furthermore, the solute-exposed ends of the chitin tetramer in the structure suggest that longer oligomers can also be bound to the groove, in which case four GlcNAc units of a chitin oligomer make direct contact with the protein while the remaining parts of the molecule protrude into the solvent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

It was previously reported that Ecp6 protein, carrying three LysM domains, binds chitin with 3:1 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib21\">de Jonge et al. 2010</a>) by building on the general observation that LysM domains bind their substrate with 1:1 stoichiometry. However, the crystal structure revealed that only LysM2 is available for chitin binding when Ecp6 is produced in <i>P. pastoris</i>, as the LysM1\u2013LysM3 groove is occupied by chitin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Therefore, we integrated the heat measurements using a single binding site model, confirming that <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6 binds chitin with 1:1 stoichiometry and a dissociation constant (k<sub>d</sub>) of 4.5 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The T22R mutant in LysM1 binds chitin with similar thermodynamic values as Ecp6 produced in <i>P. pastoris</i> (k<sub>d</sub> = 4.69 \u00b5M; n = 0.75; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)<i>.</i> However, chitin binding by the mutants N47K, L152R and S177K did not follow a sigmoidal curve, suggesting that more than one binding event occurs in these mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

                                "text": "Next, we assessed the ability of the various mutants to suppress chitin-triggered immunity in tomato cells. Unfortunately, the two mutants that were generated in LysM1 (T22R and N47K) resulted in an autoactive protein that triggered a response of the tomato cells, leading to medium alkalinization already in the absence of chitin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Most probably the induction of medium pH shift by the mutants in LysM1 was due to improper protein folding, as is suggested by CD spectra when compared with wild-type Ecp6 protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Possibly, these mutant proteins carry <i>P. pastoris</i> chitin with low affinity that is released in the cell suspension, thus activating a pH shift in the absence of exogenously added chitin. Consequently, these mutants could not be assessed for their ability to suppress chitin-triggered immunity. In contrast, the CD spectra of the two mutants in LysM3 (L152R and S177K) were very similar to that of wild-type Ecp6 protein, indicating that they adopt the same secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). As these mutants (L152R and S177K) did not trigger a response of the tomato cells in the absence of chitin oligosaccharides, they could be tested for their scavenging ability. Interestingly, both mutants still prevented chitohexaose [(GlcNAc)<sub>6</sub>]-induced medium alkalinization. These results suggest that also LysM2 contributes to the suppression of chitin-triggered immunity by <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6 in the cell suspension assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Indeed, the high sequence and tertiary structure conservation of the three LysM domains of Ecp6 suggests that LysM2 contains a functional chitin-binding site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To investigate this, conserved residues in the putative chitin-binding site of LysM2 were selected for mutagenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D and 2A</a>). Based on the structural alignment, T<sup>95</sup> and D<sup>121</sup> were mutagenized because of their localization in the two loops that may be involved in chitin binding by LysM2. <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced mutant proteins (that contain chitin in the LysM1\u2013LysM3 groove) were tested for their capacity to suppress chitin-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#bib21\">de Jonge et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, mutants T95R and D121K no longer suppressed the chitin oligosaccharide-induced pH shift, revealing that LysM2 contains a functional chitin-binding site that contributes to the suppression of chitin-triggered immunity in the cell suspension assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Indeed, ITC experiments confirmed that the <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced mutants T95R and D121K were impaired in the binding of exogenously added chitohexaose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and 5D</a>). Correct folding of the LysM2 mutants was confirmed by CD spectra that were similar to that of wild-type Ecp6 protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Collectively, these data confirm that suppression of chitin-triggered immunity in the tomato cell suspension by <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6 is established through the \u00b5M chitin-binding activity of LysM2 and explains why chitin scavenging by LysM3 mutants was not impaired. However, calculation of the equilibrium between Ecp6 protein and chitin oligosaccharide levels at the concentrations that were used, and that were well below the measured dissociation constant of LysM2, reveals that only a small amount of the available chitin oligosaccharide is bound by this LysM. Consequently, the suppression of chitin-triggered immunity by LysM2 is unlikely to work via chitin oligosaccharide sequestration."

                                "text": "Based on the assumption that we have not assessed the full chitin-binding capacity of the Ecp6 effector protein thus far, but only assessed the \u00b5M affinity of the solitary LysM2, we attempted to obtain chitin-free Ecp6 protein. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in recovering functional chitin-free Ecp6 after denaturing with 8 M urea. As an alternative strategy, the production of Ecp6 in mammalian (HEK293) cells was pursued. A relatively small amount (4 mg) of chitin-free Ecp6 was obtained from these cells. We confirmed that the Ecp6 protein produced in mammalian cells was able to suppress chitin-triggered immunity in the tomato cell suspension assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and subsequently performed substrate affinity measurements (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Interestingly, ITC revealed biphasic binding of the chitin hexamer (GlcNAc)<sub>6</sub> to chitin-free Ecp6. A first binding phase in which one chitin molecule was bound with ultra-high affinity (k<sub>d</sub> = 280 pM; n = 0.99) occurred, followed by binding of an additional molecule with lower affinity (k<sub>d</sub> = 1.70 \u00b5M; n = 1.03) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Both binding events displayed 1:1 stoichiometry, demonstrating that the three LysM domains of a single Ecp6 monomer are collectively involved in two binding events (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). As <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6, in which the LysM1\u2013LysM3 groove is blocked by a <i>P. pastoris</i> chitin fragment, displayed similar characteristics as the second binding event of mammalian cell-produced Ecp6 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), we conclude that the \u00b5M affinity should be attributed to LysM2. To confirm this hypothesis, we also produced the LysM2 mutant T95R, which only has the LysM1\u2013LysM3 site available for chitin binding, in mammalian cells. As this mutant binds a single chitin molecule with high affinity (k<sub>d</sub> = 4.95 nM) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), we concluded that the ultra-high chitin-binding affinity displayed by wild-type Ecp6 corresponds to the LysM1\u2013LysM3 binding groove. The slightly lower dissociation constant that is measured for the LysM1\u2013LysM3 groove in the HEK293-produced LysM2 mutant when compared with the HEK293-produced wild-type Ecp6 may be attributed to disabled cooperativity that may occur between both binding sites in the wild-type protein. We subsequently analyzed the role of the LysM1\u2013LysM3 groove in suppression of chitin-triggered immunity in the tomato cell suspension assay with the HEK293-produced LysM2 mutant T95R. As expected, this mutant protein was able to prevent chitin-triggered medium alkalinization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Consequently, the composite LysM1\u2013LysM3 binding site provides a single binding event with ultra-high (pM) affinity for chitin binding, the highest chitin-binding affinity described in nature, which is extremely competent to sequester chitin oligosaccharides. Through this effector activity, <i>C. fulvum</i> prevents chitin oligosaccharides from activating host immune receptors during infection of tomato."

                        "text": "Various fungal pathogens secrete LysM effectors to scavenge chitin fragments and thus avoid recognition by host immune receptors that activate immune responses (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bolton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">de Jonge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Marshall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mentlak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kombrink et al., 2011</a>). However, the mechanism used by these LysM effectors to efficiently compete for chitin binding with immune receptors remained unclear. Our structural and biochemical analysis of the LysM effector Ecp6 has unveiled a novel mechanism for chitin binding that evolved in fungi, in which the concerted action of two LysM domains results in sequestration of a chitin oligomer with ultra-high affinity. The flexible loop between LysM1 and the rigid LysM2\u2013LysM3 body enables the sandwiching of four GlcNAc units of a chitin oligomer in the interface of the LysM1\u2013LysM3 dimer by 12 hydrogen bonds and many other noncovalent interactions, resulting in ultra-high (pM) affinity. Based on the structure of the binding groove, it is anticipated that the intrachain LysM dimerization is substrate induced rather than pre-formed, as the chitin oligomer is completely buried in between the two LysM domains that are in very close proximity to make contact with the chitin oligomer. A pre-formed binding site would require a chitin oligomer to slide along the two LysM domain binding sites, which is practically impossible. At minimum, the binding groove has to breathe to let the oligomer enter before the chitin oligomer is bound. Furthermore, the noncovalent interactions among proximate residues on the complementary surfaces of LysM1 and LysM3 are likely not sufficient to keep a pre-formed binding groove in a closed conformation. More realistically, and considering the long and flexible linker that separates LysM1 from the LysM2\u2013LysM3 body, the binding groove significantly opens in absence of the ligand and closes upon ligand binding, leading to substrate-induced intrachain LysM domain dimerization. Longer chitin oligomers may protrude from the Ecp6 protein into the solvent on both ends, which is particularly relevant since these are considered to be the most biologically active in eliciting chitin-triggered immune responses (<a href=\"#bib16\">Felix et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, previously determined affinity constants were similar for chitin tetra-, penta-, hexa- and octamers (<a href=\"#bib21\">de Jonge et al., 2010</a>). Likely, as soon as Ecp6 is secreted from the plasma membrane of <i>C. fulvum</i>, it will sequester a chitin oligosaccharide that remains firmly attached to the protein. The global arrangement of the three LysMs of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> AtCERK1 chitin receptor, all three facing in outward direction on the surface of the protein, clearly prevents the establishment of intrachain LysM dimerization in a similar fashion as observed in Ecp6 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Moreover, only a single of the three AtCERK1 LysM domains is apparently involved in substrate binding, and only a single chitin oligomer is bound by a receptor molecule (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Consequently, AtCERK1 binds (GlcNAc)<sub>6</sub> with a considerably lower affinity (k<sub>d</sub> = 44.8 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) than the LysM1\u2013LysM3 binding groove of Ecp6 (k<sub>d</sub> = 280 pM; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A tomato receptor for chitin has not been identified until now. However, it has been described based on radiolabeling assays that tomato cells and microsomal membranes can bind chitin oligomers with binding constants of 1.4 nM and 23 nM, respectively (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baureithel et al., 1994</a>). Also, these affinities are lower than that of the LysM1\u2013LysM3 binding groove of Ecp6. Considering also the high amount of Ecp6 effector protein that is secreted, especially during the initial stages of the infection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bolton et al., 2008</a>), these data collectively explain how <i>C. fulvum</i>, and possibly also other fungal pathogens (<a href=\"#bib22\">de Jonge and Thomma, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Marshall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mentlak et al., 2012</a>), manage to suppress chitin-triggered immunity during infection of their hosts."

Thus, considering LysM dimerization as a mechanism for substrate binding, also interchain LysM dimerization may be exploited by nature. In this study as well as in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib21\">de Jonge et al., 2010</a>), it was found that <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6 is able to suppress chitin-triggered immunity of tomato cells although only LysM2 is available for chitin binding. Moreover, <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced LysM2 mutants in Ecp6 were impaired in prevention of chitin-triggered alkalinization of tomato cell suspensions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In this respect it is surprising that the affinity that was determined for chitin binding by LysM2 is lower than previously determined affinities for chitin binding by tomato cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baureithel et al., 1994</a>). However, it needs to be noted that different methods have been used to determine these affinities, and that the binding assays were performed under different conditions that furthermore differ from those in planta during the interaction with the pathogen. Because the concentrations of <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6 (100 nM) and chitin (10 nM) that were used in the alkalinization experiment are much lower than the LysM2 dissociation constant (4.5 \u00b5M), <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6 will only sequester a small portion of the available chitin oligosaccharides, and the amount of remaining, unbound, chitin oligosaccharides should be sufficient to activate chitin-triggered immunity. Thus, the observation that LysM2 is able to suppress chitin-triggered immunity strongly suggests that this LysM suppresses chitin-triggered immunity through another mechanism than through chitin oligosaccharide sequestration. Potentially, LysM2 may be involved in perturbation of the activation of chitin-triggered immunity by preventing the immune receptor dimerization that is required for the activation of immune signaling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Ecp6 may bind to chitin oligomers that have been bound by host immune receptor monomers, thus physically blocking host immune receptor dimerization. These mechanisms may explain how LysM2 of Ecp6 may perturb chitin-triggered immune signaling. In conclusion, it appears that the <i>C. fulvum</i> LysM effector Ecp6 is able to suppress chitin-triggered immunity through two mechanisms; efficient chitin oligosaccharide sequestration through a ligand-induced composite LysM1\u2013LysM3 binding groove, and secondly a mechanism exerted by LysM2 that does not involve chitin oligosaccharide sequestration but may involve perturbation of host immune receptor complexes. Future studies should reveal whether, and how, perturbation of chitin-triggered immunity by LysM2 occurs in the interaction of <i>C. fulvum</i> with tomato."

Chitin is a highly potent elicitor; some biological effects can be measured with nmol or even pmol amounts of chitin. Judging from the amount of chitin used by the authors and the amount of ECP6, it appears that a lot of unbound chitin would still be available to elicit alkalinization. In the absence of Pichia-produced Ecp6, 10 nM of chitin (NAG6) elicits the alkalization response. With Pichia-produced Ecp6, the concentration of free chitin should still be 9.8 nM. It seems most unlikely that tomato cells are only sensitive to 10 nM chitin, but not to 9.8 nM. A dose response experiment with chitin should be done to establish the sensitivity of the assay, preferably also with Ecp6 produced by yeast and by mammalian cells. If you are near the threshold of responsiveness for this assay, it might explain how a slight reduction in the total chitin could result in reduced alkalinization. Otherwise, assuming the ITC binding data are correct, the LysM2 domain does not directly out-compete for chitin-induced responses in the assay, and something else must be going on. The authors need to discuss this point and consider that their model for how ECP6 affects defense activation by chitin via the LysM2 domain may not be correct."

The authors should re-consider this argument in light of the wealth of data in the field showing that chitin oligomers induce a variety of plant innate immunity responses at low nM and even pM levels. Additionally, they are using the tomato bioassay. In the classic experiments, chitin binds to tomato cells with very high affinity. Hence, as mentioned above, the uM levels of chitin binding by Ecp6 LysM2 do not seem to be sufficient to explain suppression of alkalinization."

In fact, virtually none of it will be sequestered. Therefore, prior to adding the pre-incubation mix to the tomato cells, 0.22 nM complex is formed leaving 99.8 nM free protein and 9.8 nM free ligand. If the authors can provide an alternative mathematical explanation for how the protein can sequester the ligand under the conditions used, they should show this explicitly."

It seems most unlikely that tomato cells are only sensitive to 10 nM chitin, but not to 9.8 nM. A dose response experiment with chitin should be done to establish the sensitivity of the assay, preferably also with Ecp6 produced by yeast and by mammalian cells. If you are near the threshold of responsiveness for this assay, it might explain how a slight reduction in the total chitin could result in reduced alkalinization. Otherwise, assuming the ITC binding data are correct, the LysM2 domain does not directly out-compete for chitin-induced responses in the assay, and something else must be going on. The authors need to discuss this point and consider that their model for how ECP6 affects defense activation by chitin via the LysM2 domain may not be correct</i>."

The authors should re-consider this argument in light of the wealth of data in the field showing that chitin oligomers induce a variety of plant innate immunity responses at low nM and even pM levels. Additionally, they are using the tomato bioassay. In the classic experiments, chitin binds to tomato cells with very high affinity.

In these assays, we use 10 nM of chitin and 100 nM (a 10-fold excess) of Ecp6 protein. As chitin binds to LysM2 (the only site available in <i>Pichia pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6) with 1:1 stoichiometry, all the chitin that is added to the tomato cell suspension will be bound by LysM2, and no chitin will be released to the medium. In addition, it has previously been described that Ecp6 produced in <i>P. pastoris</i> is able to prevent chitin-triggered immunity even when administered in equimolar concentrations with Ecp6 (de Jonge et al., Science 2010), which is again in agreement with the 1:1 stoichiometry. Furthermore, in the same manuscript (de Jonge et al., Science 2010) we have shown that 10 times less chitin (1 nM) is still able to induce a pH shift which is similar to that triggered by 10 nM of chitin. In conclusion, in our assays we intentionally use a ten-fold excess of Ecp6 protein in order to avoid being near the threshold of responsiveness."

However, it needs to be noted that different affinities have been reported based on completely different types of binding assays, and it cannot be excluded that these assays contribute to the observed differences in affinities. Affinities of tomato cells for chitin binding have been determined with radiolabeling (Baureithel et al., JBC 1994), whereas we have used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Moreover, these different affinity measurement technologies require that binding assays are performed under specific conditions that differ from the conditions that are used for the competition assays, and also from conditions during a true plant\u2013pathogen interaction. This may obscure the precise determination of relative affinities under the relevant conditions (i.e., during competition in planta). Thus, very precise comparisons of such affinities should be taken with care. For this reason, we have compared the affinity constants of AtCERK1 (Liu et al., Science 2012) and Ecp6 as these were both determined by the same technology, ITC, and under very similar conditions. Finally, previously performed competition assays involving <i>P. pastoris</i>-produced Ecp6 and rice microsomal membranes showed that Ecp6 can compete for chitin binding with plant receptors (de Jonge et al., Science 2010). Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that Ecp6 may still affect defense activation by chitin via the LysM2 domain in other ways than through sequestration. Therefore, at the end of the Discussion it is stated: \u201cAlternatively, LysM2 may be involved in perturbation of the activation of chitin-triggered immunity by preventing the immune receptor dimerization that is required for the activation of immune signaling activation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Ecp6 may bind to chitin oligomers that have been bound by host immune receptor monomers, thus physically blocking host immune receptor dimerization. These mechanisms may explain how LysM2 of Ecp6 may perturb chitin-triggered immune signaling.\u201d"

This binding groove cannot be preformed because a chitin oligomer GlcNAc cannot enter a preformed binding groove and \u201cslide along\u201d the two LysM domain binding sites. At a minimum, the binding groove has to \u201cbreathe\u201d to let the oligomer enter before the chitin oligomer is bound.
