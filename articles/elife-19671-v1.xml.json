Current strategies to circumvent resistance target the same or parallel pathways. We report here that targeting a completely different process, autophagy, can overcome multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms in brain tumors. <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i>mutations occur in many pediatric brain tumors. We previously reported that these tumors are autophagy-dependent and a patient was successfully treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine after failure of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor vemurafenib, suggesting autophagy inhibition overcame the kinase inhibitor resistance. We tested this hypothesis in vemurafenib-resistant brain tumors. Genetic and pharmacological autophagy inhibition overcame molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms, inhibited tumor cell growth, and increased cell death. Patients with resistance had favorable clinical responses when chloroquine was added to vemurafenib. This provides a fundamentally different strategy to circumvent multiple mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance that could be rapidly tested in clinical trials in patients with <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> brain tumors."

Current strategies to circumvent resistance target the same or parallel pathways. We report here that targeting a completely different process, autophagy, can overcome multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms in brain tumors. <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i>mutations occur in many pediatric brain tumors. We previously reported that these tumors are autophagy-dependent and a patient was successfully treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine after failure of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor vemurafenib, suggesting autophagy inhibition overcame the kinase inhibitor resistance. We tested this hypothesis in vemurafenib-resistant brain tumors. Genetic and pharmacological autophagy inhibition overcame molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms, inhibited tumor cell growth, and increased cell death. Patients with resistance had favorable clinical responses when chloroquine was added to vemurafenib. This provides a fundamentally different strategy to circumvent multiple mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance that could be rapidly tested in clinical trials in patients with <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> brain tumors."

In 2014, researchers reported that brain tumors carrying a mutation called <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> rely on autophagy to survive treatment with medications that target this mutation. These findings suggested that blocking autophagy might make the medications more effective against <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i>mutant tumors and overcome the resistance."

Together these findings suggest that blocking autophagy in patients might be a safe and effective strategy to improve their response to existing therapies that target the <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutation. Future clinical trials are now needed to test more patients and verify if this treatment plan can be broadly effective in patients with these types of brain cancers."

The RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is important in central nervous system tumors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gierke et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mistry et al., 2015</a>), and with <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> mutations in more than 50% of select tumors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Penman et al., 2015</a>) there is great potential for the use of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors. Indeed, the first pediatric patient successfully treated with vemurafenib (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rush et al., 2013</a>) was followed by similar case reports in brain tumor patients of all ages (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bautista et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Skrypek et al., 2014</a>), and clinical trials in children and adolescents are ongoing using both vemurafenib (NCT01748149) and dabrafenib (NCT01677741). The\u00a0initial excitement for BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) in other tumors was tempered because the majority of patients who initially respond to RAF inhibition quickly develop resistance to therapy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hartsough et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sun et al., 2014</a>). This is a significant issue in brain tumors as well (<a href=\"#bib20\">Levy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Yao et al., 2015</a>)."

A recent study of BRAFi resistance in colorectal cancer highlighted difficulties with this approach with a single tumor often harboring more than one mechanism of resistance. More importantly, when tumors became resistant to one combination of drugs, such as BRAF/MEK inhibition, there was cross-resistance to others such as BRAF/EGFR inhibition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahronian et al., 2015</a>). This concept is playing out in clinical trials as well. BRAF and MEK inhibition in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanoma patients found a small increase in median progression free survival but failed after a short time. Further evidence found that patients who were treated with MEKi after they had developed BRAFi resistance had no objective clinical responses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). EGFR is another potential secondary target in melanoma, brain, and colorectal cancer. Although encouraging preclinical results have been obtained in these tumors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Corcoran et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Girotti et al., 2013</a>), combined BRAF/EGFR inhibition similarly leads to incomplete and short-term responses in people (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahronian et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pietrantonio et al., 2016</a>)."

                        "text": "Autophagy inhibition is a potential method to reverse BRAFi resistance. Previous studies of kinase inhibitor resistance in adult BRAF<sup>WT</sup> gliomas with PTEN mutations resistant to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to AKT to mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathway inhibitors found that autophagy inhibition improved response to dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fan et al., 2010</a>). Up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced autophagy after treatment with BRAFi has been shown in melanoma tumor biopsies and associated with the\u00a0development of resistance to vemurafenib. Autophagy inhibition overcame the resistance through this mechanism in melanoma cell lines (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). Previously, we reversed clinical and radiographic disease progression with the addition of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) in a patient with a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> brainstem ganglioglioma who progressed while on vemurafenib (<a href=\"#bib20\">Levy et al., 2014</a>). This patient continued to experience disease regression on the combination of CQ plus vemurafenib for more than two and a half years, contrasting dramatically with her original response to vemurafenib that failed at 11 months (<a href=\"#bib20\">Levy et al., 2014</a>). These findings led us to hypothesize that autophagy inhibition provides a different way to circumvent BRAF inhibitor resistance in CNS tumors that avoids targeting the same or similar kinase pathways and might apply to multiple different mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance."

Parental cells (794 and AM38) demonstrated a stable reduction the in ratio of pERK to ERK when treated with vemurafenib. In contrast, resistant cells recovered pERK:ERK ratios to almost baseline levels by 24 hr of drug exposure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and quantification of pERK:ERK ratios <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Unlike reports in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ma et al., 2014</a>), neither basal nor drug-induced autophagy was increased in resistant cells (794R, AM38R, B76) compared to parental/sensitive\u00a0cells (794, AM38, BT40) as determined by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>) or by Western blot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Quantification of autophagic flux measured by Western blot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) demonstrated that 794 and 794R cells have a similar flux at all timepoints, while AM38R had a smaller accumulation of LC3II over six hours compared to AM38 parental cells. This may be in part to the AM38 parental cells that demonstrated a lower level of LC3II at baseline compared to AM38R cells. As flux is measured by comparison of all time-points to the time 0 baseline, the higher level of LC3II in AM38R cells at time 0 would reduce the final flux measurement at six hours. Taken together, these data demonstrated that development of resistance to BRAFi did not increase levels of autophagy in these cells. Additionally, autophagic flux was successfully blocked in both parental and resistant cells using 5 \u03bcM CQ (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), a dose that can be achieved clinically (<a href=\"#bib2\">Augustijns et al., 1992</a>)."

To test this in our resistant cells, we evaluated MEK inhibition with trametinib, which inhibits MEK1 and MEK2. 794R cells demonstrated no cross-resistance shown by a significant decrease in cell growth similar to parental 794 cells treated with trametinib. Conversely, while AM38 parental cells treated with trametinib demonstrated a significant reduction in growth, AM38R cells had a minimal decrease in growth rates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) indicating that for AM38 cells, but not 794 cells, the acquisition of resistance to vemurafenib was associated with cross-resistance to MEK inhibition. However, as with the BRAFi, when autophagy inhibition with CQ was combined with trametinib in AM38R cells, a further decrease in cell growth was demonstrated in both short and long-term assays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). These findings suggest that although the two cell lines had become resistant through different mechanisms, autophagy inhibition works similarly to reverse kinase inhibitor resistance in both cases."

Therefore, genetic inhibition of autophagy was also performed to test if the responses seen were related to inhibition of the autophagic pathway or were due to another effect of CQ. Knockdowns of either ATG5 or ATG7 (two essential regulators of canonical autophagy) had a profound effect on the growth of both parental and resistant cell lines with a dramatic decrease in growth velocity. However, under conditions where there was measureable growth in the presence of RNAi, the addition of vemurafenib to resistant cells along with ATG5 or ATG7 knockdown resulted in a further decrease in growth rate, under conditions where there was measurable growth in the presence of RNAi. (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). Confirmation that ATG5 and ATG7 knockdown inhibited autophagy was shown by a decrease in the autophagy marker LC3II (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>). Combination therapy with RNAi and vemurafenib also resulted in a decreased number of viable cells compared to pharmacologic BRAF inhibition or genetic autophagy inhibition alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). These data suggest that re-sensitization to the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor was due to autophagy inhibition and not another effect of CQ. More importantly, both\u00a0the trametinib sensitive 794R and trametinib resistant AM38R cells responded equally well to genetic interference with autophagy."

This strategy allows monitoring of treatment effects in tumor cells with a supporting microenvironment ex vivo. Patient #1 was diagnosed with epithelioid glioblastoma and had rapid recurrence following standard therapy including temazolamide and radiation. At relapse, a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation was identified, and there was a successful tumor control on vemurafenib for approximately 2 years. While on vemurafenib, a rapidly growing metastatic second recurrence developed. Following confirmation that the recurrent disease continued to harbor BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, the largest lesions were treated with focal radiation while the metastatic disease required a chemotherapeutic approach. Tissue slices were collected at a\u00a0biopsy of recurrence and evaluated for protein level changes, LDH release, and EdU incorporation following BRAFi with vemurafenib and autophagy inhibition with CQ. Western blotting demonstrated up-regulation of the pERK pathway following treatment with vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), consistent with known resistance mechanisms that cause paradoxical activation of the pathway through other RAF isoforms or amplification of COT (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Johannessen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Luke and Hodi, 2012</a>), but notably, also mechanistically different than when either of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> cell lines acquired resistance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). CQ treatment caused accumulation of LC3II within the tumor slices compared to DMSO controls, indicating successful autophagy inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Combination treatment with autophagy and BRAF inhibition resulted in significantly greater cytotoxicity than vemurafenib or CQ treatment alone as measured by LDH release (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

Moreover, combination therapy demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) that was associated with an increase in caspase 3/7 activity in the combination treated cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In a long-term growth assay, combination therapy also resulted in a reduction of cell growth compared to single drug treatments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Further pathway analysis of Patient #1 treated slice cultures was performed to evaluate the association between autophagy inhibition and the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Treatment with vemurafenib resulted in small decrease in pAKT and pS6 with an associated small increase in LC3II (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and G</a>) but no significant increase of autophagic flux in cells treated with vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). This is consistent with our previously published data showing vemurafenib did not have a significant effect on the\u00a0autophagic flux in parental BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> cell lines\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Levy et al., 2014</a>). As has also been previously reported (<a href=\"#bib37\">Spears et al., 2016</a>), treatment with CQ resulted in increase phosphorylation of AKT. Combination therapy resulted in pAKT levels similar to DMSO control. Phospho MEK expression was also increased in all samples treated with vemurafenib, although the pMEK:MEK ratio was lower in samples treated in combination with CQ, primarily due to an increase in total MEK in these samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G and I</a>). Importantly, in all treatments with vemurafenib, regardless of the presence of CQ, pERK was upregulated compared to DMSO control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,G and I</a>). Together, these data suggest that patient #1\u2019s tumor acquired resistance to vemurafenib through a mechanism leading to \u2018paradoxical\u2019 RAF pathway activation by the drug, but that subsequent combination treatment with autophagy inhibition and vemurafenib could overcome this resistance."

Combination treatment of ex vivo tumor from Patient #2 with a <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> positive pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma resulted in significantly greater LDH release than vemurafenib treatment alone (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In contrast, two patients (Patients #3 and #4) with WT BRAF exhibited no increase in LDH release in any of the treatment conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) showing that as with our previous studies in cell lines, primary tumor samples with WT BRAF display no significant sensitivity to autophagy inhibition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Levy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Levy and Thorburn, 2012</a>). In Patient #2, treatment with vemurafenib resulted in an increase in Edu incorporation while a reduction of Edu incorporation was seen in combination treated cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). An additional primary culture from Patient #5, an adult with a <i>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></i> positive glioblastoma who had not received vemurafenib therapy, demonstrated inherent BRAFi resistance. However, as with Patients #1 and #2, sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy was seen (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Moreover, combination therapy with both vermurafenib and CQ again demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity compared to single drug treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), and was associated with an increase in caspase 3/7 activation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Both short and long term growth assays demonstrated decreased cell growth when autophagy was inhibited with or without vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F and G</a>). Increased tumor growth was not seen in Patient #5 vemurafenib treated cells. The increase in Edu incorporation seen in Patient #2 was not related to paradoxical RAF pathway activation, as was seen in Patient #1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), although there was also not a substantial reduction in pERK overall. In contrast, Patient #5\u2019 tumor cells did demonstrate a reduction in pERK signaling with exposure to vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H\u2013I</a>). Of note across all these patients, pERK status did not correlate with resistance to vemurafenib. Rather, inhibition of autophagy resulted in re-sensitization in all three primary patient samples. Patient #5\u2019s tumor contained additional mutations in PTEN as well as a TP53 mutation (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Mutations in PTEN are known to confer BRAFi resistance (<a href=\"#bib26\">Paraiso et al., 2011</a>), which could explain the inherent resistance found in this tumor. An evaluation of PTEN downstream effectors in Patient #5 cells found no significant effect of autophagy inhibition on pAKT, p21 or pS6 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>)."

This includes mutations in PTEN as shown above, as well as RAS mutations and activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (<a href=\"#bib22\">Luke and Hodi, 2012</a>). Feedback activation of EGFR has specifically been suggested as an escape pathway in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CNS tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yao et al., 2015</a>). The above data suggest that autophagy inhibition is able to overcome BRAFi resistance in different tumor types, and that distinct mechanisms of resistance can be similarly targeted by this approach. To test this isogenic BRAF mutant cells carrying specific mutations known to confer vemurafenib resistance through distinct mechanisms were created."

Using constitutively active mutants KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup>, we evaluated induction of resistance and the ability to reverse this resistance by pharmacologic autophagy inhibition with CQ. 794 and AM38 cell lines expressing either KRAS<sup>WT</sup> or a non-target (NT) construct retained sensitivity to both increasing doses of vemurafenib and combination therapy with CQ (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>), similar to that in parental cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, both KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> cells displayed the expected resistance to increasing doses of vemurafenib alone (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>). Combination vemurafenib and CQ therapy in the RAS resistant lines resulted in a significantly increased response compared to either drug alone (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>).

Analysis of the percent of viable cells also demonstrated a significant decrease in combination therapy compared to pharmacologic BRAF or autophagy inhibition alone (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>).

Vemurafenib was continued and the CQ dose was increased to 500 mg daily following completion of radiation to treat leptomenengeal metastatic disease sites. The dosing schedule was modeled after previously published reports using CQ for autophagy inhibition in brain tumor patients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brice\u00f1o et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rojas-Puentes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sotelo et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with the ex vivo and in vitro tumor modeling, addition of CQ to the continued vemurafenib treatment resulted in clinical improvement and decreased growth of metastatic tumor sites as shown by MRI (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013B</a>). Robust LC3II accumulation in peripheral white blood cells following CQ therapy (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>) suggests effective autophagy inhibition at the doses of CQ used for this patient. In addition to these easily seen larger lesions, leptomeningeal enhancement throughout the subarachnoid CSF spaces improved with combination therapy as well. In stark contrast with the rapidly growing recurrent metastases, where significant growth was seen after just two weeks at the time of initial relapse, a continued favorable response to the combination therapy was maintained for 7 months. At this time, patient #1 had to stop therapy for unrelated medical issues."

But with this potential comes difficulties in identifying which patients to treat and how to predict and counteract the\u00a0development of resistance. A recent study by Ahronian et al. evaluated resistance in colorectal cancer and highlighted many of the difficulties in combatting resistance to BRAFi (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahronian et al., 2015</a>). They found multiple resistance mechanisms across tumors and often more than one resistance mechanism in a particular patient. More importantly, they found that when cells became resistant to one combination of drugs, there was often cross-resistance to other potential combination therapies. This emphasizes the difficulty of targeting individual resistance mechanisms e.g. by adding an inhibitor of a downstream kinase such as MEK to circumvent resistance to BRAF inhibition. Tumor heterogeneity is also a significant concern with studies showing branched evolution in mutations and resistance mechanisms that can contribute to acquired resistance. Such heterogeneity can occur both temporally as well as geographically within the same patient (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shi et al., 2014</a>)."

Here we present evidence from cell lines with both experimentally acquired and different molecularly defined resistance mechanisms and from tumor samples from patients with clinically acquired and intrinsic BRAFi resistance, that pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with CQ can achieve this goal. In the cell lines where it was experimentally feasible, we could also demonstrate a similar effect with genetic inhibition of autophagy. Broad applicability is suggested because the various resistance mechanisms that could be overcome included examples that did and did not involve cross-resistance to MEK inhibition, mutational activation of both KRAS and NRAS, EGFR overexpression, paradoxical activation of the ERK pathway by vemurafenib, and a PTEN mutation. Taken together, our data suggest that regardless of the resistance mechanism to the BRAF inhibitor, autophagy inhibition was able to improve the response to BRAFi."

These first clinical responses have also been sustained. Patient #1 demonstrated control and reduction of her metastatic tumors for greater than seven months, whereas she had previously shown MRI-measurable tumor growth in as little as two weeks. Moreover, patient #1 has experienced clinical benefit when the autophagy inhibitor was added to vemurafenib despite having demonstrated subsequent acquisition of clinical resistance to MEK inhibition after the acquisition of BRAF resistance. Also, the first patient we reported (<a href=\"#bib20\">Levy et al., 2014</a>) maintained sustained tumor regression on the combination of vemurafenib and CQ for more than 2 \u00bd years without significant clinical complications. Although these early clinical results are encouraging, our findings are in a limited number of patients and further clinical investigation is required to verify if this strategy of combining autophagy inhibition with BRAF inhibition provides a durable and widely applicable response in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> tumors."

However, based on our results, we hypothesize that by targeting an entirely different cellular process, i.e. autophagy, upon which these same tumor cells rely, it may be feasible to overcome such resistance and thus re-establish effective tumor control. Importantly, our data suggest that this strategy can work even when different resistance mechanisms apply. This can be done using CQ, which is an approved, safe, and inexpensive drug and, perhaps, other more potent autophagy inhibitors that are under development (<a href=\"#bib7\">Egan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goodall et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ronan et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, in the context of BRAF mutant pediatric brain cancers where BRAF inhibition is already being tested, it should be feasible to quickly test this hypothesis in clinical trials."

The effect of autophagy inhibition to overcome resistance was initially evaluated in vitro in cell lines and then extended to include ex vivo studies of primary tumor samples. To ensure a complete evaluation of the effects on cell growth and death, both long and short-term growth assays were utilized as well as evaluation of LDH release and EdU incorporation as appropriate. Specificity to the autophagy pathway was evaluated with genetic inhibition studies. Final endpoints were defined prior to the start of each experiment. All in vitro experiments were completed with a minimum of three biologic replicates and where possible with triplicate technical replicates.

A custom-built bioinformatics pipeline utilizing GSNAP for sequence alignment and FreeBayes for variant calling was employed for data analysis. All genomic regions were verified to be covered by at least 500 sequencing reads and identified variants were manually inspected using Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute)."

New data incorporates additional hairpins against ATG5 and ATG7. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> (previously <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) now includes IncuCyte growth monitoring experiments in 794R and AM38R cells with two hairpins each for ATG5 and ATG7 and is discussed in the subsection \u201cGenetic inhibition of autophagy overcomes BRAFi resistance in vitro\u201d. Importantly, similar results were obtained with the additional hairpins including a significant decrease in growth in 794R and AM38R cells and, in conditions where there was still some measurable growth in the presence of RNAi, the addition of vemurafenib further decreased cell growth. An evaluation of viable cells at the end of these growth experiments was also determined for each hairpin and is included in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and also discussed in the aforementioned subsection. Western blotting demonstrates the effectiveness of these hairpins and is included in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>. These data are consistent with our previous study in parental 794 and AM38 cells that also demonstrated the effectiveness of genetic inhibition of autophagy in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> brain tumor cells.<sup>1</sup>"

All BRAF mutant cell lines investigated to date have had a consistent response to CQ (pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy) with all showing a significant improvement in response to BRAFi when treated with combination therapy. We have also demonstrated in both parental<sup>1</sup> and polyclonal resistant cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) that genetic autophagy inhibition is effective in reducing tumor cell growth alone and when combined with BRAFi. To test the effects of genetic inhibition of autophagy in a molecularly defined mechanism of resistance, we evaluated NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> resistant cells as these cells demonstrated significant resistance to single agent vemurafenib therapy (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013D</a>). In the revised manuscript, we expanded the analysis to include two hairpins each for ATG and ATG7 in AM38 parental, AM38R polyclonal, and AM38 NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> cells. Results were consistent across the three cell lines as well as across all of the hairpins. An additional <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> has also been included to better evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of vemurafenib to the genetically inhibited cells. This was important as often the RNAi resulted in no growth of the cells and the combination effect upon addition of vemurafenib was therefore difficult to detect. An endpoint evaluation highlights the differences between the treatment groups that are difficult to see on the growth curves. This was particularly notable in cells with shATG7 #2, which had a very efficient knockdown and loss of protein. Western blotting analysis has been added to <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> to show efficiency of RNAi knockdown."
