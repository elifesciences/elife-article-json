The ants in a colony develop into distinct types known as castes to perform these roles. In colonies of leaf cutter ants, for example, small \u201cworker\u201d ants usually care for the larvae and the fungus the colony feeds on, while larger worker ants leave the nest to forage for new leaves to grow the fungus on. Other species, such as the silver ant, possess a soldier caste that has huge mouthparts dedicated to fighting. Finally, most colonies have one or several \u201cqueen\u201d ants that focus on reproduction. It is important that the colony has the right numbers of each caste: if too many ants develop into soldiers, for example, the colony will starve, while a colony with too many foragers cannot take care of its larvae."

Now, in eLife, Laurent Keller and Richard Benton of the University of Lausanne and colleagues \u2013 including Adria LeBoeuf as first author \u2013 report on a new way in which adult ants can alter how larvae develop (<a href=\"#bib2\">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</a>)."

They found that, in addition to nutrients, ant saliva also contains juvenile hormone and other molecules including proteins, microRNAs and cuticular hydrocarbons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

Previous studies have shown that genetic factors and environmental cues can influence this outcome\u00a0(green\u00a0box). LeBoeuf et al. show that when adult ants feed larvae mouth-to-mouth (blue box), a variety of signal molecules are transferred alongside the nutrients in the saliva of the adult. These molecules include juvenile hormone, which is known to alter caste fate, and numerous proteins that control how social insects grow and develop. Molecules known as cuticular hydrocarbons (which allow ants to distinguish between nestmates and non-nestmates) are also transferred.

It also suggests that the ants exchange other hormones that we did not previously know were involved in communication between individuals: these hormones include hexamerin, which is known to be involved in caste fate in social insects (<a href=\"#bib9\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>). The next challenge will be to find out whether trophallaxis really plays an active role in regulating caste fate. One way to test this idea would be to remove all the soldiers from the colony and observe whether this changes the amount of different hormones present in ant saliva as the colony attempts to replace the soldiers. Adult ants are best placed to know the needs of the colony, so it makes sense that they use several strategies to guarantee that the colony produces the right mix of castes."
