The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (<i>DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C</i>, <i>CAMKV</i>) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions."

The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (<i>DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C</i>, <i>CAMKV</i>) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions."

A typical cause is the inhibition of the inward rectifying potassium channel (hERG or <i>human ether-a-go-go</i> related gene encoded by <i>KCNH2</i>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kannankeril et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Roden, 2008a</a>), which results in the prolongation of the repolarization time and induces an increase of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. The early prediction of drug-induced long QT (diLQT) is a major requirement to avoid exposing patients to cardiac arrhythmias and ultimately sudden cardiac death (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sarganas et al., 2014</a>). Eventually, diLQT is a major cause of drug withdrawal or of premature termination during development (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fermini and Fossa, 2003</a>). Regulatory agencies require that new drug candidates be systematically screened for hERG inhibition in animal models or in heterologous over-expression cellular systems (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sager et al., 2014</a>). Because of species-dependent differences of cardiac electrophysiology and the failure of heterologous systems to express all cardiac proteins, hERG screening however remains suboptimal and has a poor positive predictive value for subsequent proarrhythmia risk (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gintant, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Giorgi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sager et al., 2014</a>)."

Previous studies in the general population have shown that a small proportion (i.e., less than 10%) of patients exposed to QT-prolonging drugs actually develop diLQT (<a href=\"#bib1\">Behr and Roden, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kannankeril et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Soyka et al., 1990</a>). Different observations support the existence of a genetic determinism to diLQT including the higher propensity to develop drug-induced repolarization abnormalities in first-degree relatives of patients with diLQT (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kannankeril et al., 2005</a>) and the similarity to the congenital form of the long QT syndrome (LQTS), a rare inherited cardiac disorder (<a href=\"#bib33\">Moss and Robinson, 1992</a>). Multiple rare mutations with marked effects in genes encoding ion channels have been reported to underlie LQTS (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cerrone and Priori, 2011</a>). However, candidate gene screening studies in large cohorts of patients with diLQT have reported a small prevalence (from 10 to 15%) of these mutations in the known LQTS genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Paulussen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2002</a>). QT prolongation can be induced by mutations in many genes that occupy a substantial region of the human interactome and contain many drug targets (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 2010</a>). The factors leading to diLQT in some individual subjects remain largely unclear but are probably driven by the additive effect of common genetic variants that reduce the cardiac repolarization reserve (<a href=\"#bib1\">Behr and Roden, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kannankeril et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Roden, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2008b</a>). As a consequence, diLQT is difficult to predict as it usually develops in individuals with a predisposing genetic makeup which favors exaggerated response to a pharmacological challenge with QT-prolonging drugs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kannankeril et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Roden, 2008b</a>) but does not affect cardiac repolarization features at baseline (<a href=\"#bib1\">Behr and Roden, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kannankeril et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sarganas et al., 2014</a>)."

Our findings offer novel insights on the use of a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells to model complex pharmacogenetic traits."

Sotalol is a non-selective competitive \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker with additional Class III antiarrhythmic properties by its inhibition of potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zanetti, 1993</a>). Sotalol is widely recognized as a classical QT-prolonging drug (<a href=\"#bib51\">Soyka et al., 1990</a>). A total of ninety-two subjects were enrolled in the study (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). All subjects gave their written informed consent to participate the study. Included subjects were aged from 18 to 40 years (30.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2 years), had a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 29 kg/m\u00b2 (23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 kg/m\u00b2), were from Caucasian origin and had no known significant disease or long-term treatment. Forty-four percent (n\u00a0=\u00a040) were male. Cardiac repolarization parameters were analyzed through standardized measurements of digital high-resolution ECG (sampling rate 1000 Hz). All subjects had a normal sinus rhythm and no significant conduction or repolarization abnormalities. Basal QT interval ranged from 340 to 458 ms (393.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.3 ms), with a corresponding heart rate ranging from 47 to 88 bpm (63.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7 bpm). QT interval was corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcf=QT/[RR]<sup>1/3</sup>) providing corrected QTcf in the physiological range from 350 to 447 ms (399.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.6 ms). Three hours after sotalol intake, QTcf had increased by 23.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 ms. A large inter-individual variability was however noticed with a change in QTcf ranging from \u22129 ms to\u00a0+81 ms and a resulting post-sotalol QTcf ranging from 351 to 489 ms (412.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a043.0 ms) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

The objective was to identify healthy subjects with extreme responses to Sotalol 80 mg. Skin punch biopsies were performed in a\u00a0total of twenty subjects, 10 with low-sensitivity and 10 with high-sensitivity to Sotalol. The fresh skin biopsies were then transferred at the Ectycell company (Romainville, France) in close vicinity of the clinical investigation center. The objective was to culture and bank human dermal fibroblasts and to derive and characterize hiPSC. iPSC clones were then anonymized before any further cardiac experiments were performed. This procedure was agreed by all partners to avoid potential biases in interpreting the recording at the cellular level. iPSCs clones were successfully generated for 17 subjects using retroviral infection and were investigated in this study. For the remaining three subjects (Patients 4, 14 and 20), iPSCs clones were secondarily generated using episomal plasmids and were thus not investigated. The 17 iPSCs clones were then transferred to the Cardiovascular Research Center at Icahn School of Medicine, New York, USA. The objective was to differentiate iPSCs into cardiac myocytes and to perform MEA recordings and drug testing. All required authorizations were obtained."

As early as seven days following initiation of cardiac differentiation, spontaneously beating embryoid bodies (EBs) appeared. To test for iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes quality and purity we first performed immunocytostaining studies showing positive staining for the sarcomeric proteins troponin T (cTnT), and alpha-actinin and for the gap-junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Cardiac troponin T staining of iPSC-CMs showed a typical striated pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, upper panels). We also determined the cardiomyocytes differentiation efficiency by flow cytometry and found an average of 47.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.9% cTNT positive cells. Importantly, after unblinding the study, we did not observe any differences between iPSC lines from the high-S vs. low-S groups (49.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.4% vs. 46.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.3% respectively, p=0.42).

Few days after seeding iPSC-CMs regain spontaneous beating activity thus allowing recordings of field potential duration (FPD) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). FPD is analogous to the QT interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and was previously shown to correlate with action potential duration (APD) and can be used to test drug effects on repolarization (<a href=\"#bib35\">Navarrete et al., 2013</a>). IPSC-CMs were first tested for their responses to E4031, a specific and potent experimental hERG blocker. E4031 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in FPD with typical flattening of the waveform in all but two cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">3</a>). There was moderate inter-line variability, except for line P11019 which demonstrated higher sensitivity to E-4031 and was found to belong to the high-S group after unblinding. There was however no significant differences in sensitivity to E4031 between groups as assessed by computations of half maximal effective concentration EC50 (2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22128</sup> vs 6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22128</sup> M in high-S and low-S groups respectively, p=0.59) or of maximal effect Emax (49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020% vs 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% in high-S and low-S groups respectively, p=0.76). Two lines displayed no responses to E4031 and were found as having the lowest expression of hERG (P11021 and P11023, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Because of the lack of response to a pure hERG blocker and of appropriate recordings to detect effects of QT prolonging drugs with the MEA system, sotalol response was not further tested on these two lines."

Increasing sotalol concentrations was associated with a significant prolongation in FPDs in all iPSC-CMs, an effect that was however significantly enhanced in lines from the high-S group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). There was a dose-dependent sotalol-induced FPD prolongation that typically appears for sotalol concentrations above 30 \u03bcmol/L (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), as seen in other reports (<a href=\"#bib35\">Navarrete et al., 2013</a>). Of note, the application of low sotalol concentration (10 \u03bcmol/L), a concentration this is closer to typical sotalol plasma levels, was already associated with a significant increase in FPD in lines from the high-S group as compared to low-S (p=0.03). The maximal FPD prolongation observed in response to sotalol was also significantly higher in the high-S as compared to low-S iPSC-CMs (52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% vs. 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%, p=0.02, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Sotalol is known to induce arrhythmic events including ectopic beats and short-long-short rhythm. We found that 5 of the seven lines derived from the high-S group displayed arrhythmias in response to sotalol stimulation as they showed development of irregular spontaneous beating rate. On the other hand, arrhythmias only occurred in one of the eight lines from the low-S group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We plotted the relative change in FPD in response to sotalol 30 \u03bcM against the observed change in QTcf in donors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). With the exception of one cell line in each group, the remaining six low-S and six high-S cell lines were correctly discriminated according to the clinical phenotype. These data indicate that the contrasted responses to sotalol in iPSC-derived CMs are strongly related to the inter-individual differences in response to sotalol as recorded during clinical investigations."

We looked for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups (all cell lines included) and used a prior knowledge based approach to identify potential risk markers that could be mechanistically connected to QT prolongation development. By analyzing the LQTS neighborhood in the human interactome we recently demonstrated that graph theoretical models allow the prediction of new gene variants and drug targets that are involved in disease pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 2010</a>). Here, we used a similar approach and searched for differentially expressed direct neighbors of the known congenital LQTS genes in the human interactome (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Of note, expression of these LQTS genes was similar between high-S and low-S groups. We identified four up-regulated (<i>DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF,</i> and <i>HTR2C</i>) and one down-regulated direct neighbors (<i>CAMKV</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>).

Down-regulated counts were subtracted from up-regulated counts and resulting netto counts were normalized to the number of total comparisons (i.e. divided by 96). Using this approach, a gene that is up-regulated in the high-S group because of gender specific expression, should be identified as significantly up-regulated in most of the female versus male groups sets of DEGs.

Extreme phenotype selection is a well-defined methodology that helps enrich the frequency of alleles that contribute to a trait and this methodology has been successfully applied in genetic studies aimed at identifying variants associated with complex traits (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cirulli and Goldstein, 2010</a>). The use of this methodology is particularly suitable when investigating variability in drug responses by segregating individuals with opposite predisposing genetic makeup, a characteristic that can be transmitted to iPSCs as shown by our data. Importantly, in order to avoid experimental biases, in vitro assessment of iPSC-CMs sensitivity to sotalol was performed blinded to the clinical phenotype. In addition, as we aimed at reproducing a more complex phenotype, we designed our study with a larger sample size than typical studies using iPSCs for disease modeling of monogenic disorders. As a consequence, we were only able to explore one iPSC clone per patient and we did not evaluate potential inter-line variability. The likelihood that inter-line variability would have systematically biased our results to reproduce the anticipated effect as seen in vivo and thus explain our results is however unlikely on a panel of 17 different cell lines as appreciated by low p-values for comparison between groups (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Under our hypothesis, it is likely that the discrepant results obtained in two cell lines reflect that potential false results associated with inter-line variability from a same patient. However, external replication would further strengthen the potential of subject-specific iPSCs to model complex phenotypes as shown in our seminal study."

Of note, while none of these genes have been previously associated with the occurrence of diLQT, <i>CAMKV</i> is coding for a kinase-like protein that, in the presence of calcium, interacts with calmodulin (<i>CALM1</i>), a critical regulator of ion channels involved in congenital long QT syndrome 14 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Crotti et al., 2013</a>) and in loperamide-induced long QT (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berger et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, mutations in <i>PTRF</i> (Polymerase I and transcript release factor, or cavin-1) cause a particular form of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (type 4, CGL4) that is associated with features of long QT syndrome and high rate of sudden cardiac death (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rajab et al., 2010</a>). <i>PTRF</i> is involved in the formation of caveolae (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nabi, 2009</a>), that are critical in cardiac ion channels trafficking to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maguy et al., 2006</a>). In addition to the involvement of <i>DLG2</i> and <i>KCNE4</i> genes in the direct regulation of scaffolding, trafficking and gating kinetics of some cardiac potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leonoudakis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Levy et al., 2010</a>), our study suggest for the first time that diLQT might be related to changes in downstream regulation of the cardiac repolarization machinery. Further experiments will be required to understand the exact contribution of each of these candidates and whether they might act in combination to confer susceptibility to develop diLQT. Similarly, future studies using single-cell RNA sequencing on cardiomyocytes derived from our library of subject-specific iPSCs would be needed to better identify and characterize differentially expressed genes and pathways. Lastly, we identified an up-regulation in <i>HTR2C</i> (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C), a G-protein coupled receptor for serotonin that is expressed in the heart. Upon activation HTR2C activates down-stream signaling cascades to promote the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Interestingly, serotonin receptor agonists have been associated with higher risk for diLQT (<a href=\"#bib21\">Keller and Di Girolamo, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sarganas et al., 2014</a>). Intriguingly, we found non-significant trends for differences between groups in response to E-4031, a selective hERG channel blocker. Sotalol primarily prolongs cardiac repolarization through hERG inhibition but also have a non-selective competitive \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker activity and can thus affect other cardiac repolarization components that are associated with higher susceptibility to develop diLQT. Whether sotalol has a direct or indirect effect on the candidates identified in this study would deserve further investigations."

It has been suggested that sex hormones can influence cardiac repolarization by modulating expression and function of cardiac ion channels but their effect is complex to appreciate as levels fluctuate with time and age and the different sex hormones can have counterbalancing effects (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hulot et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Odening and Koren, 2014</a>). Here, we were able to reproduce susceptibility to develop diLQT in vitro in a hormone-free environment. We performed specific analyses that did not support an important role of gender to explain our results, including the lack of a gender-specific gene expression signature and the lack of significant sex hormone-related transcription factors. Importantly, our data suggest that the identified genes should work as predisposing genes in both genders thus arguing for the existence of an intrinsic predisposing background that is carried by iPS cells but do not depend on gender. Of note, it has recently been shown that women have in mean a greater intrinsic sensitivity to sotalol as compared to men, an effect that however remains widely variable at the individual level (<a href=\"#bib10\">Darpo et al., 2014</a>)."

Interestingly, we were able to detect significant differences in response to the lowest sotalol concentrations (i.e., 10 \u00b5M) in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from subjects clinically presenting with high sensitivity to sotalol. This suggests that the iPSC-derived platform could efficiently detect individual differences in the range of concentrations that is near the typical sotalol plasma levels. Finally, further developments in differentiation protocols (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burridge et al., 2014</a>), in functional maturation of iPSC-derived cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lundy et al., 2013</a>) or in iPSC-based bioengineering (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schaaf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Turnbull et al., 2014</a>) might also improve the overall predictability of the method."

In consequence, it could happen that fewer genes are detected in a sample with a lower read count than in a sample with a higher read count. Such an experimental artifact might distort normalization including total reads as well as upper quartile normalization, the two normalization options that are offered by cufflinks. Both normalization approaches only change the number of reads that are associated with a gene, but not the number of identified genes. Consequently, the same number of normalized reads might be distributed over a different number of genes in two different samples, causing the detection of an equally expressed gene in both samples as differentially expressed. To prevent such an experimental artifact we randomly removed reads from the sequenced samples until every sample had the same number of read counts. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 with Tophat using the ensemble GTF file as a gene annotation reference and the option 'no-novel-juncs'. Output BAM files were directly subjected to Cufflinks to identify differentially expressed genes, using the options 'multi-read-correct', 'upper-quartile-norm' and 'frag-bias-correct' against the hg19 genome. Differentially expressed genes were identified based on a FDR of 5% and a minimum fold change (log<sub>2</sub>((FPKM<sub>condition1</sub>+1)/(FPKM<sub>condition2</sub>\u00a0+\u00a01)) &gt;= \u00b1\u00a0log<sub>2</sub>(1.3))."

                                "text": "For MEA recordings, we used 6well-MEA arrays, which contain six independent culture chambers, separated by a macrolon ring (60\u20136 well MEA 200/30 iR-Ti-rcr, Multichannel Systems, Germany). Inside each well, there is a field of nine electrodes with an internal reference electrode (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The 6well-MEA arrays were prepared by pipetting 5 \u03bcl fibronectin solution (100 \u03bcg/mL, BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for at least 1 hr. iPSC-CMs were dissociated using 0.025% trypsin for 5 min at 37\u00b0C and seeded onto prepared MEA plates using 5 \u03bcl of cell suspension in StemPro34 medium and then incubated at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2. The day after the cells were covered with 200 \u00b5L of StemPro34 media. MEA recordings were performed once the cells started to beat again (5\u20137 days). Field potentials of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes were recorded using a high-resolution Micro Electrode Array (MEA) recording system (MEA60 system, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany, <a href=\"http://www.multichannelsystems.com\">http://www.multichannelsystems.com</a>) at 37\u00b0C. The baseline steady state was achieved following an equilibration period of about 15 min in vehicle medium (StemPro34 media). The tested drugs (E4031 and Sotalol, Sigma) were then added directly to each well. Dose-response experiments were performed with the following sequence: drugs were diluted in 200 \u03bcL of StemPro34 media; increasing concentrations of drug were added to a well of the MEA array in a cumulative manner; the FPD recordings were started 3 min after application of a given concentration of a drug, a timing that was found optimal to achieve steady-state changes; FPD recordings were then performed for two additional minutes. Each drug was tested in at least three different wells. Raw MEA data were acquired using QT-Screen Lite and MC-Rack softwares (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). The data were then exported on QT-Analyzer Software to analyze the field potential duration and the inter-beat interval (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). Parameters were averaged on the 2 min recordings. Inter-beat interval (in ms) was used to calculate the instantaneous beat rate. To account for the dependency between repolarization rate and the beating rate, FPD was firstly adjusted using the popular Bazett\u2019s formula (adjustedFPD = rawFPD / RR1/2). We however found that, as expected, this formula was associated with an important over-correction thus supporting the need for an alternative adjustment formula according to Funck-Brentano et al. (<a href=\"#bib12\">Funck-Brentano and Jaillon, 1993</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, panel A). We thus plotted the FPD / inter-beat-interval pairs recorded at various beating rates under baseline conditions. The following equation with the same dimension as a\u00a0Bazett\u2019s formula: adjustedFPD = rawFPD / RR\u03b1, where alpha is a regression parameter, was applied to raw data in order to have a\u00a0new estimate of the correction factor and results in appropriate corrections of FPD (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, panel B)."

The authors have performed a clinical study in which they exposed volunteers to sotalol and measured changes in the electrocardiographic QT interval. They found that the patients exhibit a wide range of QTc responses. They then studied the extremes \u2013 high sensitivity and low sensitivity to sotalol. They generated patient specific iPS cell lines from the low and high sensitivity patients and differentiated them to cardiomyocytes, whose electrical properties were studied using a microelectrode array system. The authors found evidence that the adjusted field potential duration (aFDP), an in vitro surrogate for the QTc interval in the ECG segregated with the low and high sensitivity samples as assessed clinically. These findings support the hypothesis that iPSC-CMs can be used to report patient-specific responses to QT prolonging drugs. In addition, the authors did genomic analysis comparing high and low sensitivity samples finding some variability in SNPs. In addition, transcriptome analysis identified changes in expression levels of genes associated with cardiac repolarization comparing high and low sensitivity samples which is intriguing. The manuscript has several strengths. This is the first attempt to do such a prospective clinical trial rigorously testing iPSC-CM technology, and it addresses problem that is highly relevant for drug development, unanticipated drug-induced QT prolongation. The number of lines tested and characterized is substantial given the extent of analysis involved."

We apologize for this inattention. The revised <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> now shows typical ECG recordings in a high-sensitive and a low-sensitive subject. As detailed in the Methods section, we were indeed extremely careful in using highly accurate and standardized measurements of QT interval. A specific operating procedure was developed for ECG recordings, collections, transfer and analyses. The three consecutive complexes used for the measurements of the intervals were selected in periods with stable heart rate, stable baseline, absence of artifacts and U waves either absent or well differentiated from T-waves. Measurements were then performed using the tangent method by an investigator blindly of drug administration. Importantly, all ECG and measurements were reviewed by another cardiologist (still blinded of drug administration). As an extended example, we here provide the complete ECG recording and caliper positions (raw data, low resolution) for the high-s subject (baseline evaluation). All other ECG were recorded and measured in the same conditions (available on request)."

A representative image is reported in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. The MEA recordings were performed on a layer of iPSC-CMs that had spontaneous beating activity and had measurable field potential duration (FPD) as they developed contact with the electrodes. It seems unlikely that contaminating cell types would have influenced these results. In addition, patch clamp experiments were performed at the cell level on two different couples of iPSC-CM lines from each group (low-S and high-S) and confirmed the MEA results (see previous and new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Finally, our gene expression studies were indeed performed on whole preparations because of challenges in enriching preparations in derived cardiomyocytes. For our transcriptomic study, we thus decided to use a prior knowledge based approach (on cardiac repolarization / LQTS neighborhood; based on a previously published methodology) to identify signals that are specifically coming from cardiomyocytes in these preparations. Indeed, a direct neighbor of a LQTS gene is anticipated to be cardiomyocyte specific. The expression of cardiac ion channel genes indeed appears variable (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) but was similar between both groups (Low-S and high-S), as also further confirmed in our transcriptomic analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and Results section, subsection \u201cDysregulation of downstream regulators of cardiac ion channels\u201d). For all of these reasons, we think we have limited the influence of variability in cardiac differentiation efficiency among iPS lines on our results.

As pointed out, E-4031 is an experimental drug that is a selective hERG channel blocker whereas sotalol is a clinically used drug that is a non-selective competitive \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker with additional Class III antiarrhythmic properties by its inhibition of potassium channels. We found that trends in response to E-4031 (both for EC50 and maximal effect) were in the same direction than with sotalol but these trends did not reach statistical significance. The two compounds differ in their pharmacological characteristics in terms of inhibition potency and target selectivity. First, as compared to sotalol, E-4031 is a more potent hERG blocker with an IC<sub>50</sub> value reported to be in the range of 10-100nM (vs. 10-50 \u00b5M for sotalol) and presents a very steep concentration-response effect (as observed in our lines, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C). It is thus possible that subtle differences in the susceptibility to develop prolonged cardiac repolarization in response to a given drug cannot be fully revealed when using a very potent inhibitor such as E-4031. Second, sotalol is thought to primarily prolong cardiac repolarization through hERG inhibition but sotalol can also affect other cardiac repolarization components. Our own transcriptomic results indicate that higher susceptibility to diLQT was associated with significant changes in expression of genes related to the regulation of ion channels homeostasis while the expression of cardiac ion channels (including hERG) was similar between both groups. A direct or indirect effect of sotalol on these components (in addition to its hERG effect) could explain the apparently discrepant results obtained with E-4031. This hypothesis would however deserve further investigations. The discussion has been corrected accordingly."
