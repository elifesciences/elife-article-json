Foot and mouth disease is most common in developing areas of the world, such as parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and an outbreak of the disease in animals raised as food resources in such areas can have a devastating effect on economic growth. Now, in eLife, researchers at Shihezi University, Jilin University and the Xinjiang Academy of Animal Science, all in China, report the results of experiments on genetically engineered pigs that could have broad implications for the control of the disease (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hu et al., 2015</a>)."

The Chinese team focused on a protein called VP1 that is variable across all different FMD viruses. VP1 is part of the viral capsid, a three-dimensional array of proteins that is involved in receptor binding and entry into host cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Mason et al., 2003</a>). Hu et al. designed small RNA molecules that silenced the gene for VP1 via a process called RNA interference (<a href=\"#bib1\">Fire et al., 1998</a>). Having less VP1 might decrease the number of viral particles that are produced and make FMD virus less able to spread between animals."

They then integrated the gene coding for this small RNA into the genome of single pig cells; transgenic embryos were then generated from these cells by the same technique that produced Dolly the sheep. The embryos were subsequently implanted into donor sows that gave birth to transgenic piglets."

Whereas control groups displayed the classical clinical signs of FMD\u00a0-\u00a0high fever, mouth blisters, foot sores and lameness\u00a0-\u00a0all transgenic pigs were protected from disease for up to seven days after infection, and only later developed milder clinical signs associated with FMD.

If mutations appear in the region of the genome targeted by the small RNAs, variants that are resistant to treatment can emerge: such \u2018escape mutants\u2019 have been observed for other viruses that are similar to the FMD virus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Gitlin et al., 2005</a>). Hu et al. did not examine the viruses recovered from the transgenic pigs, so they did not identify escape mutants. However, if escape mutants do turn out to be a problem, one solution would be to use several small RNAs to target multiple regions of the virus genome at the same time. Since the target region is different among the different types, multiple small RNAs could also be combined to target different types of FMD virus. This would decrease the chances of the viruses gathering exactly the right mutations to evade RNA interference and could extend protection to other types of FMD virus."

The ability of the virus to rapidly replicate helps it to spread and evade the immune response of its host. Importantly, Hu et al. reported that the amount of virus found in the blood or blisters of infected transgenic pigs was much lower than in the control group, suggesting that the transgenic pigs are less contagious and would be less likely to spread the disease. In the case of an outbreak, genetically engineered pigs would be less susceptible to the infection, would shed fewer virus particles and would slow down the spread of the infection. This would give animal health authorities the necessary time to implement control programs such as vaccination. The downside of this approach is that clinical signs of infection would be masked or undetected: this means that the introduction of transgenic pigs would have to be accompanied by the introduction of robust disease surveillance systems."

Although this technology could potentially increase food security, it also faces major challenges since, to date, neither the Food and Drug Administration in the United States nor the European Food Safety Authority have approved genetically engineered animals for human consumption. The processes used by these regulators to ensure the safety of genetically modified animals as food resources are strenuous and expensive, and have prevented other transgenic animals, such as salmon, from entering the market in the US (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ledford, 2013</a>). A global consensus on the regulation of genetically engineered organisms has not been reached and each country adopts policy at a national level. However, the governments in a number of countries\u00a0-\u00a0including Argentina, Brazil and China\u00a0-\u00a0view transgenic products as a way to resolve food security issues. Such countries have simpler protocols for the approval of transgenic products, which might allow transgenic animals to be approved for human consumption (<a href=\"#bib7\">Maksimenko et al., 2013</a>)."
