The high conservation of minor introns, typically one amidst many major introns in several hundred genes, despite their poor splicing, has been a long-standing enigma. Here, we discovered that the low abundance minor spliceosome\u2019s catalytic snRNP, U6atac, is strikingly unstable (t\u00bd&lt;2 hr). We show that U6atac level depends on both RNA polymerases II and III and can be rapidly increased by cell stress-activated kinase p38MAPK, which stabilizes it, enhancing mRNA expression of hundreds of minor intron-containing genes that are otherwise suppressed by limiting U6atac. Furthermore, p38MAPK-dependent U6atac modulation can control minor intron-containing tumor suppressor PTEN expression and cytokine production. We propose that minor introns are embedded molecular switches regulated by U6atac abundance, providing a novel post-transcriptional gene expression mechanism and a rationale for the minor spliceosome\u2019s evolutionary conservation."

The high conservation of minor introns, typically one amidst many major introns in several hundred genes, despite their poor splicing, has been a long-standing enigma. Here, we discovered that the low abundance minor spliceosome\u2019s catalytic snRNP, U6atac, is strikingly unstable (t\u00bd&lt;2 hr). We show that U6atac level depends on both RNA polymerases II and III and can be rapidly increased by cell stress-activated kinase p38MAPK, which stabilizes it, enhancing mRNA expression of hundreds of minor intron-containing genes that are otherwise suppressed by limiting U6atac. Furthermore, p38MAPK-dependent U6atac modulation can control minor intron-containing tumor suppressor PTEN expression and cytokine production. We propose that minor introns are embedded molecular switches regulated by U6atac abundance, providing a novel post-transcriptional gene expression mechanism and a rationale for the minor spliceosome\u2019s evolutionary conservation."

This means that U6atac is a limiting factor for the splicing of minor introns\u2014a process that is already limited by the very low abundance of the minor spliceosome under normal conditions. However, Younis et al. found that this bottleneck could be relieved by halting the degradation of U6atac. Experiments showed that U6atac can be stabilized by a key signaling molecule, a protein kinase (called p38MAPK), which is activated in response to stress. The resulting higher levels of U6atac promoted splicing of the introns in its target mRNA transcripts, and also modulated various signaling pathways in the cells."

The vast majority of introns (&gt;200,000) in complex eukaryotes are spliced by the major spliceosome (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>), consisting of U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs. However, \u223c700 minor introns, also known as U12 introns, are spliced by the much less abundant (&lt;1%) minor spliceosome, consisting of U11, U12, U4atac, U5 and U6atac snRNPs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hall and Padgett, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tarn and Steitz, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Patel and Steitz, 2003</a>). Despite their low occurrence, minor introns, typically one amidst many major introns, are found in genes essential for diverse cellular processes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burge et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sheth et al., 2006</a>). Their splice site sequences, position and the genes in which they reside are all highly conserved (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Turunen et al., 2012</a>). However, previous data suggested that minor introns are generally poorly spliced, and therefore the purpose of the minor splicing pathway has been a long-standing mystery, as it has been difficult to rationalize their remarkable conservation and function in splicing alone. The importance of the minor spliceosome has been recently underscored by reports that mutations in U4atac cause microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type I (MOPD I) or Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdel-Salam et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Edery et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2011</a>).

We found a wide variation of minor intron dependence on U6atac level and that mRNA production from \u223c200 minor intron-containing genes are strongly suppressed in HeLa cells under normal growth conditions. Importantly, we show that U6atac level can be rapidly up-regulated by activated p38MAPK, which results in enhanced splicing of minor introns and increased expression of these mRNAs. Among these is the tumor suppressor, PTEN, which we show buffers cell response to stress by modulating TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 cytokine production. We propose that minor introns are control switches that are regulated by U6atac abundance, providing a novel gene expression regulation mechanism and explaining the retention of the minor splicing pathway during evolution."

Interestingly, Pol II transcription inhibition by Actinomycin D (ActD), as well as by the structurally and chemically unrelated Pol II inhibitor 5,6-Dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), led to a rapid and strong decrease in the levels of three ncRNAs transcribed by Pol III: U6atac and U6 snRNAs, and vault RNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Previous studies have shown co-dependence of Pol III transcription on Pol II, which binds upstream of Pol III at the promoter of these ncRNAs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Listerman et al., 2007</a>). The decrease in vault RNAs after ActD treatment has been previously observed in mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kickhoefer et al., 2001</a>), and U6 was noted to have a shorter half-life compared to other major snRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fury and Zieve, 1996</a>). However, this is the first report of U6atac\u2019s fast turnover. We have not found significant sequence similarity among these ncRNAs to explain their fast turnover. Real-time qPCR validated the short half-life of U6 and U6atac, but not U5, for which the microarray did not predict a change (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In comparison, HeLa cells arrested in mitosis using nocodazole, which causes transcription by all three types of polymerases to cease, showed a moderate U6atac decrease, whereas translation inhibition with cycloheximide (CHX) caused no significant changes in the levels of the ncRNAs tested (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In cells, U6atac mostly exists as part of U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP or U4atac/U6atac/U5 tri-snRNP complexes. To test whether U6atac instability is rate limiting for U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP formation, we immunoprecipitated the di-snRNP specific protein p110/SART3 and measured the associated U4atac/U6atac by real-time PCR in control or ActD-treated cells. This showed that ActD decreased U4atac level by \u223c20% in total RNA, whereas the U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP formation was reduced by &gt;80% (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results demonstrate the fast turnover and vulnerability of U6atac to transcriptional inhibition, which makes it rate limiting for di-snRNP formation."

Interestingly, 206 (48%) of these were expressed at low levels in control and severely down-regulated (FPKM &lt; 1) in U6atac AMO, suggesting that limiting amount of U6atac suppresses splicing and expression of these genes even under normal growth conditions, and that their unspliced pre-mRNAs are very unstable. On the other hand, unspliced, yet stable pre-mRNAs for the remaining 223 introns were detected. To rank these minor introns according to their relative dependence on U6atac level, we calculated the splicing index for each intron as the ratio of Y/X whereas: X = the reads count in a given intron normalized to the reads count in the surrounding exons in control AMO. Y = the reads count for the same intron normalized to the reads in the surrounding exons in U6atac AMO. This showed that 44 (20%) out of these 223 have little to no intronic reads in control but significant intron accumulation in U6atac AMO (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; CHD4, ARPC5). For these minor introns, the level of U6atac snRNP is sufficient for splicing catalysis under normal growth conditions (control AMO), but they are extremely sensitive to U6atac decrease. In contrast, 81 (36%) minor introns were poorly spliced, with their unspliced pre-mRNAs clearly detectable in control and showing minimal additional response to U6atac inactivation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; MTBP). For these introns, U6atac snRNP is limiting under normal growth conditions and they are predicted to splice more efficiently when U6atac level increases. Taken together, these data show a strict dependence on U6atac abundance for minor intron splicing, which actually varied over a wide range (&gt;20-fold; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) and thus challenges the accepted view that minor introns typically splice poorly. This wide range could not be explained by analysis of the splice sites (AT-AC vs GT-AG) or their surrounding sequences (data not shown). A list of minor introns with highest and lowest U6atac-dependent splicing indices is shown in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>."

Only three genes were up-regulated. Splicing analysis revealed 657 alternative splicing changes resulting from U6atac inactivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), including all 223 minor introns that showed various levels of splicing inhibition. Importantly, the major introns in these same transcripts were spliced normally. In a small number of minor intron-containing genes (&lt;20) U6atac inactivation elicited alternative major intron splicing from cryptic 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites around the minor introns (e.g., C11ORF10 and ZNF207; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This resulted in mRNA isoform switching without overall transcript level down-regulation. Interestingly, while these effects are likely due to misplicing as a result of U6atac inhibition, they nevertheless resemble the previously described twintrons that utilize either the minor or major spliceosome by switching between adjacent U11-U12 or U1-U2 splice sites, and play an important role in <i>Drosophila</i> development (<a href=\"#bib32\">Scamborova et al., 2004</a>), but has not been previously identified in human cells. U12 AMO, tested on select minor introns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), had the same effects as U6atac AMO, confirming that the U6atac AMO effects we observed result from the minor spliceosome inhibition. Although the effect of U6atac inactivation on expression level and alternative splicing in \u223c2000 genes that have no minor introns could be secondary, it nevertheless reflects a significant and immediate biological phenomenon. We conclude that U6atac decrease down-regulates or causes splicing change in all minor intron genes and that minor spliceosome inhibition reverberates widely throughout the transcriptome."

For this we tested the effect of anisomycin, a potent activator of stress-induced protein kinase, p38MAPK (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bunyard et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yong et al., 2010</a>), and observed a \u223ctwofold increase in U6atac level within 4 hours (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Because anisomycin activates both p38MAPK and JNK, we pre-treated cells with either SB203580, an inhibitor of p38MAPK activation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davies et al., 2000</a>), or SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heo et al., 2004</a>). While SB203580 blocked the anisomycin-mediated U6atac increase, SP600125 had only a small effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), indicating that U6atac increase is predominantly due to p38MAPK activation. To assess whether this increase is transcriptional or post-transcriptional, cells were co-treated with ActD and anisomycin. In contrast to the drastic U6atac decrease after transcription inhibition with ActD (82%), co-treatment with anisomycin resulted in only about half that amount of U6atac decrease (\u223c40%) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that cell stress-induced U6atac increase is due, at least in part, to U6atac stabilization. Interestingly, the U6atac increase correlated with enhanced minor intron splicing and gene expression of a splicing reporter (LucI-minor) whose expression is strictly dependent on splicing of a minor intron, showing a twofold increase of its expression after anisomycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, intronless and major intron-containing reporters (<a href=\"#bib45\">Younis et al., 2010</a>) were not affected, indicating that the increased expression is due to enhanced minor intron splicing and not an effect on transcription or translation. A similar U6atac increase was observed in Jurkat T-cells and THP-1 monocytes following anisomycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), indicating that U6atac increase by activated p38MAPK is a general phenomenon and not limited to HeLa cells."

Whereas p38MAPK activation increases transcription of several key cell physiology modulators, including up-regulation of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>), which do not contain minor introns (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 2006</a>), production of these cytokines has been shown to be suppressed by PTEN, a minor intron-containing gene (<a href=\"#bib14\">Furumoto et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Furgeson et al., 2010</a>). We therefore determined if U6atac inactivation affects p38MAPK-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, U6atac inactivation increased the levels of p38MAPK-mediated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 production to a much higher level, &gt;twofold compared to control AMO, suggesting that a minor intron-containing gene(s) suppresses production of these cytokines. To test if this is due to loss of PTEN suppression, PTEN was knocked down by siRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This resulted in the same effect on p38MAPK-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 production as U6atac AMO (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, compare panels 6E and 6F to 6B and 6C), indicating that PTEN expression, which is regulated by U6atac level, plays a role in p38MAPK-induced cytokine production. We note, however, that while PTEN mRNA level was increased by 2\u20135 fold we have only been able to detect a small (\u223c20%) increase of PTEN protein level by western blot. Nevertheless, previous reports have shown that even very small changes in PTEN level are sufficient to have a strong phenotype (<a href=\"#bib47\">Alimonti et al., 2010</a>).

Previous studies using a small number of model minor introns have led to the perception that minor introns generally splice at a slower rate than major introns and could therefore be rate limiting for the production of mRNAs that contain them (<a href=\"#bib27\">Patel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Singh and Padgett, 2009</a>). However, there has been no evidence that minor introns could be regulated. Here we discovered that U6atac is highly unstable relative to other snRNAs and its level can be rapidly up- or down-regulated. Furthermore, modulation of U6atac amount produces a corresponding change in the amount of mRNA from many minor intron-containing genes, thus providing a novel post-transcriptional mechanism for regulating minor intron splicing and the expression of the genes that contain them, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Interestingly, in growing HeLa cells \u223c50% of minor intron-containing genes are suppressed by the limiting U6atac level and produce very low amounts of mRNA. Many others are strongly down-regulated with U6atac decrease because a retained minor intron causes the pre-mRNA to degrade or switch alternative splicing to make a different isoform. However, their splicing and expression can be strongly and rapidly enhanced by an increase in U6atac level, at least in part due to its stabilization by p38MAPK (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Thus, the apparent sluggishness observed for some minor introns can be explained by the rarity of U6atac, rather than an intrinsic inefficiency of minor introns. Furthermore, the rapid turnover of U6atac after attenuation of either RNA polymerases II or III makes the minor spliceosome a real time sensor of transcriptional activity in cells."

While transcription attenuation rapidly lowers U6atac level and limits minor intron-containing gene\u2019s expression, activated p38MAPK rapidly stabilizes U6atac, increasing its level and enhancing minor splicing and production of full-length mRNAs."

These genes, including PTEN, E2F2, E2F6 and MTBP, play important roles in cell stress physiology such as regulating cytokine production. PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog, is a tumor suppressor that plays key roles in cell growth and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tamguney and Stokoe, 2007</a>). We show that U6atac and the minor splicing pathway, through regulation of PTEN expression, play an antagonistic role that buffers p38MAPK-induced production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8, two major inflammatory response mediators. TNF-\u03b1 also functions in a wide range of processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism and coagulation. IL-8 is a chemo-attractant and a potent angiogenic factor. While activated p38MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate the transcription factor ATF2, which in turn activates PTEN transcription (<a href=\"#bib33\">Shen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Qian et al., 2012</a>), our data show that PTEN expression can also be regulated post-transcriptionally by the efficiency of splicing of its minor intron.

Minor intron-containing genes that typically contain a single minor intron amidst many major ones function in diverse cellular processes that are critical for cell growth and organism development (<a href=\"#bib26\">Otake et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alioto, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdel-Salam et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Edery et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2011</a>). Fine-tuning the level of the catalytic snRNP, U6atac, allows for a circuit design based on the capacity to completely shut off or rapidly up-regulate the production of the full-length mRNAs from a pool of pre-mRNAs in which all the other major introns have been spliced, without having to affect their transcription (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Indeed, as our RNA-seq show, a single minor intron is sufficient to regulate the expression of an entire pre-mRNA. The conservation of this design principle over &gt;500 million years (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burge et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shukla and Padgett, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Russell et al., 2006</a>) demonstrates the effectiveness of this gene regulation mechanism. Thus, minor introns function as control switches that are embedded in hundreds of genes and regulated by U6atac abundance, providing a rationale for evolutionary conservation of the minor spliceosome."

Indeed, we found U4atac to be even less abundant than U6atac (\u223c20-fold). Interestingly U4atac levels measured from total RNA decreased by \u223c20% after 4 hours of Actinomycin D treatment and did not change after 4 hours of anisomycin treatment. On the other hand, the level of U4atac/U6atac that is associated with the di-snRNP specific protein p110/SART3 was significantly decreased after Actinomycin D treatment, which mirrors the decrease of U6atac in total RNA. Importantly, anisomycin treatment caused the p110/SART3-associated U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP to increase. These findings indicate that U6atac is the rate-limiting factor for U4atac/U6atac di-snRNP formation and minor intron splicing. We have added these data as <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2013figure Supplement 3</a> and describe them in the text."

Regarding the lack of an effect of PTEN knockdown on cytokine expression in the absence of anisomycin: without a cytokine inducer (e.g., the p38MAPK activator anisomycin), the baseline expression level of these cytokines in HeLa cells is too low to determine if PTEN knockdown has an effect on them."

Cytokine proteins\u2019 increase reflected those of their mRNAs (&gt;10 fold) in both cell lines, and was increased further by U6atac AMO. On the other hand, the amount of PTEN protein increase was \u223c20%, which we are not confident is sufficient to explain this protein\u2019s role in the observed cytokines\u2019 response. We note, however, that similarly small changes in PTEN protein levels have been shown to have significant biological effects, including on cancer development in mice (Alimonti et al, Nature Genetics, 2010). Thus, while U6atac level can modulate PTEN mRNA and similarly the cytokines\u2019 mRNAs and proteins over a several fold range, the direct U6atac-dependent regulatory factor(s) remains to be determined. However, given PTEN\u2019s key role in human pathologies, the potential of U6atac modulation to regulate PTEN should be considered. We have added these points to the text."
