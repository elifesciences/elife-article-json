The molecular basis for their anti-inflammatory effects is incompletely understood, but has been proposed to involve the indirect tethering of LXRs to inflammatory gene promoters. Here we demonstrate that the ability of LXRs to repress inflammatory gene expression in cells and mice derives primarily from their ability to regulate lipid metabolism through transcriptional activation and can occur in the absence of SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify the putative lipid transporter Abca1 as a critical mediator of LXR's anti-inflammatory effects. Activation of LXR inhibits signaling from TLRs 2, 4 and 9 to their downstream NF-\u03baB and MAPK effectors through Abca1-dependent changes in membrane lipid organization that disrupt the recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6. These data suggest that a common mechanism-direct transcriptional activation-underlies the dual biological functions of LXRs in metabolism and inflammation."

The molecular basis for their anti-inflammatory effects is incompletely understood, but has been proposed to involve the indirect tethering of LXRs to inflammatory gene promoters. Here we demonstrate that the ability of LXRs to repress inflammatory gene expression in cells and mice derives primarily from their ability to regulate lipid metabolism through transcriptional activation and can occur in the absence of SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify the putative lipid transporter Abca1 as a critical mediator of LXR's anti-inflammatory effects. Activation of LXR inhibits signaling from TLRs 2, 4 and 9 to their downstream NF-\u03baB and MAPK effectors through Abca1-dependent changes in membrane lipid organization that disrupt the recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6. These data suggest that a common mechanism-direct transcriptional activation-underlies the dual biological functions of LXRs in metabolism and inflammation."

LXRs control the expression of a battery of genes involved in cholesterol, fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism through direct binding to LXR response elements (LXREs) in their target promoters (<a href=\"#bib3\">Calkin and Tontonoz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hong and Tontonoz, 2014</a>). In addition to their ability to activate the expression of genes linked to lipid metabolism, LXRs also have the ability to antagonize inflammatory gene expression triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Joseph et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Castrillo et al., 2003a</a>). LXRs are not known to act as direct ligand-dependent repressors, that is, there is no well-documented example of LXR/RXR heterodimers binding to an LXRE in a gene promoter and repressing transcription in response to ligand. Rather, they have been proposed to act on inflammatory promoters through mechanisms that do not involve DNA-binding domain recognition of LXREs."

Key features of this model include the requirement for receptor SUMOylation, the involvement of an LXR monomer, and the mechanistic separation of the transcriptional activation and repression functions of LXRs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ghisletti et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Venteclef et al., 2010</a>). Although several lines of evidence have supported the transrepression model, the requirement for receptor SUMOylation in the repressive actions of LXRs on inflammatory genes in cells and animals remains to be tested. The potential involvement of additional or alternative mechanisms has also not been excluded."

We show that the ability of LXRs to activate transcription of the Abca1 sterol transporter, and thereby alter membrane cholesterol homeostasis, has a secondary effect on inflammatory signaling through inhibition of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways downstream of TLRs. These data present a unified view of LXR-dependent gene regulation in which direct transcriptional activation underlies the dual biological functions of LXRs in metabolism and inflammation. They further emphasize the importance of local membrane composition in the activation of TLR signaling pathways."

Previous studies have proposed that LXRs \u2018transrepress\u2019 inflammatory gene expression by acting as a monomer (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ghisletti et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Venteclef et al., 2010</a>). Unexpectedly, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of RXR\u03b1 and RXR\u03b2 in primary mouse macrophages blunted the ability of LXR agonist to repress the LPS-induced expression of the endogenous inflammatory genes <i>Nos2, Il1\u03b2, Ccl2, Cxcl1, Tnf\u03b1, Cox2</i> and <i>Il6</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This observation suggested that LXR was acting to repress inflammation as a heterodimer with RXR in our system. We therefore explored alternative mechanisms for the repressive effects of LXR on inflammatory gene expression."

The synthetic LXR agonist GW3965 did not induce the canonical LXR target gene <i>Abca1</i>, nor did it repress LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression, in LXR-deficient MEFs or macrophages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B,C, 2A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Castrillo et al., 2003a</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Joseph et al., 2004</a>). However, when LXR-deficient cells were reconstituted with wild-type LXR\u03b1, GW3965 treatment simultaneously induced <i>Abca1</i> expression and repressed LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression (<i>Ccl2</i> and <i>Cxcl1</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). These results establish that both the activating and repressive effects of GW3965 under our experimental conditions are entirely mediated by LXRs. This is important to emphasize because many synthetic LXR agonists, including GW3965 and T0901317, can exhibit LXR-independent effects on gene expression, especially when used at concentrations higher than employed here. It is also important to note that this approach does not involve supraphysiologic overexpression of LXRs, as the level of reconstituted protein expression in these cells was within the physiologic range and restored target gene expression to physiologic levels (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>)."

However, both the activation and repression activities of LXR were completely abolished in DNA binding domain- (DBD), ligand binding domain- (LBD) or AF2-deletion mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Thus, MyD88 emerged as potential common component of inflammatory signaling pathways targeted by LXR and Abca1. Flow cytometry revealed that TLR4 expression in plasma membrane was not affected by LXR activation (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). We therefore tested whether the recruitment of key adaptor molecules to lipid rafts was altered by LXR activation. We performed cell fractionation studies to assess the ability of MyD88 and TRAF6 to associate with lipid rafts in response to TLR4 activation by LPS. We confirmed the ability of our antibodies to detect MyD88 and TRAF6 using MyD88-deficient and siRNA to TRAF6 (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). LPS-dependent recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6 in Flotillin-1-enriched detergent-resistant membrane microdomains was markedly reduced by treatment of iBMDM with GW3965 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). Furthermore, the ability of LXR agonist to inhibit recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6 was lost in Abca1-deficient macrophages. These observations suggest that a reduction in raft cholesterol content in response to LXR activation and Abca1 expression leads to alterations in membrane dynamics and/or raft structure and to the disruption of functional TLR4 complexes. Therefore, downstream MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling and inflammatory gene expression are repressed."

Analysis of gene expression in spleen and lung 2 hr after LPS treatment revealed that an array of inflammatory genes was induced by LPS as expected (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). This induction was substantially attenuated by LXR agonist treatment in wild-type mice, whereas little if any inflammatory repression was observed in mice lacking expression of Abca1 in macrophages (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the ability of LXRs to repress inflammation in macrophages derives primarily from their ability to regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism through Abca1.

Both of these processes are central to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Castrillo et al., 2003a</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Joseph et al., 2004</a>). LXRs have been proposed to repress inflammatory gene expression <i>in trans</i> by tethering to NF-\u03baB transcriptional complexes in a SUMOylation-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ghisletti et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Venteclef et al., 2010</a>). This has heretofore been believed to be the sole mechanism underlying LXR's anti-inflammatory effects. The present study suggests that LXR-mediated transcriptional repression of endogenous inflammatory genes is principally dependent on LXR's capacity for transactivation. Our studies also identify the sterol transporter Abca1 as an important mediator of LXR's anti-inflammatory effects, both in vitro and in vivo. We find that Abca1 induction represses TLR-induced NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathway activation by reducing the cholesterol content of detergent-resistant membrane domains. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for LXR-mediated inflammatory repression in which inflammatory repression is secondary to activation-dependent changes in cellular lipid metabolism."

This led us to explore additional mechanisms for LXR inflammatory crosstalk. We found that an LXR L439A/E441A mutant that lacks co-activator recruitment capacity was unable to repress inflammation. These studies suggested that repression was mechanistically linked with transcriptional activation, and that repression might be a secondary phenomenon."

Interestingly, the nuclear receptor SF-1 can be modified by SUMO in its hinge region and this modification has been shown to be functionally important for gene repression in vivo (<a href=\"#bib4\">Campbell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2011</a>). In contrast to the LXR transrepression model, however, the repressive effects of SUMOylated SF-1 are mediated by direct binding of SF-1 to response elements in its target promoters. Nevertheless, we considered the possibility that alternative SUMOylation sites in the hinge region of LXR (LXR\u03b1 K177/K178/K180) might be used for transrepression. However, mutation of the three hinge lysines to arginine did not alter LXR-dependent repression of endogenous inflammatory genes."

These conclusions were drawn based on the analysis of electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In retrospect, these studies likely had technical limitations that prevented us from appreciating the effects of LXR on NF-\u03baB signaling. Our prior studies did not define which NF-\u03baB isoforms were bound to our DNA probe, and according to a recent comprehensive analysis of DNA binding by NF-\u03baB proteins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Siggers et al., 2012</a>), the sequence we used is not predicted to have high affinity for the LPS-induced p65-p50 heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hoffmann and Baltimore, 2006</a>).

Our membrane dynamics and biochemical studies indicate that LXR-dependent Abca1 induction reduces raft cholesterol content and alters membrane fluidity, suggesting a biophysical basis for the ability of LXR to inhibit TLR signaling. Previous studies have reported that <i>Abca1</i>-deficient macrophages contain more cholesterol and TLR4 protein in plasma membrane lipid rafts and that this results in enhanced inflammatory signaling upon LPS treatment (<a href=\"#bib19\">Koseki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2010</a>). Our data are consistent with these results and provide an additional mechanism whereby changes in Abca1 expression can affect TLR signaling. We found that Abca1 expression is important for the ability of LXR to inhibit signaling from TLRs 2, 4 and 9\u2013all of which use MyD88 as a key adaptor. We showed that LXR activation inhibits recruitment of the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRAF6 to rafts and thereby blocks TLR-induced activation of MAP kinases and NF-\u03baB."

Although Abca1 is clearly a major contributor, our data do not exclude the involvement of other factors. In our view, it is likely that additional LXR target genes involved in lipid handling may also contribute to effects on inflammation. One attractive additional player is the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3, which we have recently shown affects inflammatory signaling in hepatocytes in the setting of obesity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Rong et al., 2013</a>)."

The present work suggests that SUMOylation is not required and that instead the mechanism involves the upregulation of ABCA1 expression. The authors show that ABCA1 is required for LXR-dependent anti-inflammatory activity through its ability to alter membrane lipid composition and in turn signaling through TLR4. While the data demonstrating that ABCA1 is required for the anti-inflammatory action of LXR agonists is quite good, the experiments were less robust in ruling out a role for SUMOylation or co-repression. Since a major conclusion of this work is based on co-repression not being involved, this is something that would need to be fleshed out in more detail. In addition, the proposed mechanism of ABCA1 effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) needs further experimental clarification."

This previous paper used cells transfected with various siRNAs and/or LXR mutants to support their conclusions. The present manuscript has a similar set of experiments using retroviral expression in LXR KO and ABCA1 KO cells to show that LXR mutants lacking the SUMO sites still repress some genes. However, these experiments cannot be directly compared to Ghisletti et al., since the present work never even investigates the requirement of Ubc9 or N-CoR. In addition, perhaps the discrepancy may be due to the promoters studied in each paper. Ghisletti mainly studied the iNos promoter, while this paper focused mostly on other targets (e.g., IL-1b). At this point I do not believe one can entirely rule out the co-repression as part of the mechanism. The involvement of Ubc9 and N-CoR should be investigated. It would be important to include iNOS genes in the analyses here, as the effects may well be gene dependent and so direct comparison impossible and the issue will remain unresolved unless the same genes are analyzed."

I feel this is not the best assay to address the mechanism. One likely scenario is that ABCA1 mediated cholesterol efflux affects recruitment of TIRAP. TIRAP is a sorting adaptor responsible for recruitment of MyD88 to TLR4 at the plasma membrane. TIRAP interacts with PIP2, which is enriched at lipid rafts. So a plausible scenario is that cholesterol 'depletion' from PM may affect TIRAP mediated MyD88 recruitment. A direct way to test this is by looking at TIRAP recruitment to PM in response to LPS (Kagan, Cell. 2006 Jun 2;125(5):943-55.). This is a fairly simple experiment that can be done quickly and all the reagents are available from the authors of the above study."

We have remade the image and hope that this will correct the PDF conversion error (Revised <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A, B</a>). Note, although the magnitude of change in the cholesterol levels in the raft fraction is not large in absolute terms, it is nonetheless biologically significant. Cholesterol levels in membranes never change dramatically in any physiological context. E.g., a change in ER cholesterol content between 3 and 5% has been reported by Brown and Goldstein to control SREBP cleavage."

I feel this is not the best assay to address the mechanism. One likely scenario is that ABCA1 mediated cholesterol efflux affects recruitment of TIRAP. TIRAP is a sorting adaptor responsible for recruitment of MyD88 to TLR4 at the plasma membrane. TIRAP interacts with PIP2, which is enriched at lipid rafts. So a plausible scenario is that cholesterol 'depletion' from PM may affect TIRAP mediated MyD88 recruitment. A direct way to test this is by looking at TIRAP recruitment to PM in response to LPS (Kagan, Cell. 2006 Jun 2;125(5):943-55.). This is a fairly simple experiment that can be done quickly and all the reagents are available from the authors of the above study</i>."

We also appreciate the insightful suggestion regarding TIRAP, but based on our finding that TLR9 is also inhibited by LXR, TIRAP seems to be excluded as the mediator of the LXR effect."
