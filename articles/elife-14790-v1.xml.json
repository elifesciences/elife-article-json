A simple form of self-knowledge is recognizing that a previous choice was incorrect without receiving any feedback on that decision (<a href=\"#bib8\">Rabbitt, 1966</a>). Every decision we make, from detecting a faint sound to choosing a new job, comes with a degree of confidence that we have made the right call. If this confidence level is sufficiently low we might change our minds and reverse our choice.\u00a0Theoretical models and experimental work both suggest that decision making operates by accumulating evidence for or against a particular option (<a href=\"#bib3\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>). But whether similar evidence accumulation mechanisms also underpin changes of mind has remained unclear."

One suggestion is that changes of mind happen because we continue to weigh evidence after a choice has been made (<a href=\"#bib9\">Resulaj et al., 2009</a>); this process is called post-decision evidence accumulation. An alternative idea is that the brain uses additional mechanisms to detect and correct previous errors. Support for this theory comes from findings that show that error-related signals are produced in the medial frontal cortex of the human brain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Gehring et al., 1993</a>). People who have damage to the frontal regions of the brain are also unable to \u201cself-monitor\u201d and identify errors they have made without external feedback (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ham et al., 2013</a>). Now a pair of studies in eLife provides the most detailed account yet of the mechanisms underpinning changes of mind \u2013 and together, they indicate that both ideas could be right."

The volunteers indicated their choice by moving a handle in the corresponding direction and simultaneously indicated their confidence in their decision by moving the handle to an upper or lower target. This allowed the researchers \u2013 who are based at the University of Cambridge, Columbia University and New York University \u2013 to track how each decision evolved over time and to observe occasional swerves from one target to the other that they labelled as changes of mind or changes of confidence."

A previous paper found that the strength of the accumulated evidence, together with the elapsed time, could predict how confident the volunteers felt when they made their decision (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>). By extending this model to allow evidence to continue to accumulate after the decision had been made, van den Berg et al. could also explain changes of mind and changes of confidence through a common mechanism. Both the extended model and the volunteers were\u00a0more\u00a0likely to switch from low to high confidence at the last second, particularly when the motion was strong."

This question was tackled by Peter Murphy of Trinity College Dublin and Leiden University and colleagues in the other paper (<a href=\"#bib6\">Murphy et al., 2015</a>). While wearing electroencephalography (EEG) caps, human volunteers were asked to press a button each time a colour word such as \u201cred\u201d appeared on a computer screen. However, they were instructed to not press the button if either the same word was repeated twice or if the meaning of the word and the font colour matched (for example, \u201cred\u201d written in red text). This is a difficult task to perform quickly, and mistakes were made on 43% of the trials on average. To assess self-monitoring, the volunteers pressed a separate button if they noticed making an error."

Murphy et al. found that this signal ramped up to a threshold level during both pre- and post-decision evidence accumulation, and predicted the probability and timing of error detection. This finding indicates that the same evidence accumulation system is engaged both\u00a0when making a decision about external events and when deciding whether one\u2019s own previous decision is wrong."

This finding suggests \u2013 in line with early work on error monitoring \u2013 that a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d error signal in the frontal cortex may subsequently trigger post-decision evidence accumulation to work out whether a change of mind is warranted."

In contrast, Murphy et al. suggest that top-down signals \u2013 information that feeds back to influence earlier stages of processing \u2013 provide an additional input to the post-decision evidence accumulation process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

The contribution of the theta signal from the frontal cortex may be more important in the former case (when an overt error has already been committed) than the latter. Future research could combine the approaches taken in these two papers. For instance, it would be of interest to monitor EEG during experiments like those performed by Wolpert et al. to establish the relative contributions of bottom-up and top-down influences on changes of mind."
