We previously showed that GABAergic short-term plasticity is impaired in <i>App</i> knock-out (<i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i>) animals, but the precise mechanism by which APP regulates GABAergic synaptic transmission has remained elusive. Using electrophysiological, biochemical, moleculobiological, and pharmacological analysis, here we show that APP can physically interact with KCC2, a neuron-specific K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter that is essential for Cl<sup>-</sup> homeostasis and fast GABAergic inhibition. APP deficiency results in significant reductions in both total and membrane KCC2 levels, leading to a depolarizing shift in the GABA reversal potential (E<sub>GABA</sub>). Simultaneous measurement of presynaptic action potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in hippocampal neurons reveals impaired unitary IPSC amplitudes attributable to a reduction in \u03b11 subunit levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R. Importantly, restoration of normal KCC2 expression and function in <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice rescues E<sub>GABA</sub>, GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b11 levels and GABA<sub>A</sub>R mediated phasic inhibition. We show that APP functions to limit tyrosine-phosphorylation and ubiquitination and thus subsequent degradation of KCC2, providing a mechanism by which APP influences KCC2 abundance. Together, these experiments elucidate a novel molecular pathway in which APP regulates, via protein-protein interaction with KCC2, GABA<sub>A</sub>R mediated inhibition in the hippocampus."

We previously showed that GABAergic short-term plasticity is impaired in <i>App</i> knock-out (<i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i>) animals, but the precise mechanism by which APP regulates GABAergic synaptic transmission has remained elusive. Using electrophysiological, biochemical, moleculobiological, and pharmacological analysis, here we show that APP can physically interact with KCC2, a neuron-specific K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter that is essential for Cl<sup>-</sup> homeostasis and fast GABAergic inhibition. APP deficiency results in significant reductions in both total and membrane KCC2 levels, leading to a depolarizing shift in the GABA reversal potential (E<sub>GABA</sub>). Simultaneous measurement of presynaptic action potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in hippocampal neurons reveals impaired unitary IPSC amplitudes attributable to a reduction in \u03b11 subunit levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R. Importantly, restoration of normal KCC2 expression and function in <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice rescues E<sub>GABA</sub>, GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b11 levels and GABA<sub>A</sub>R mediated phasic inhibition. We show that APP functions to limit tyrosine-phosphorylation and ubiquitination and thus subsequent degradation of KCC2, providing a mechanism by which APP influences KCC2 abundance. Together, these experiments elucidate a novel molecular pathway in which APP regulates, via protein-protein interaction with KCC2, GABA<sub>A</sub>R mediated inhibition in the hippocampus."

The deleterious impact of A\u03b2 has been studied extensively, with the recent discovery of the potent toxicity of A\u03b2 oligomers on neuronal and synaptic activities (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsieh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wei et al., 2010</a>).

In contrast, the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of uIPSCs in response to two consecutive action potentials in GABAergic neurons, at an inter-spike interval of 100 ms and 150 ms to assess synaptic release probability (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</a>), was similar between WT and <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>) (100 ms; WT, 0.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04; <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i>, 0.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; p=0.2; 150 ms; WT, 0.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06; <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i>, 0.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05; p=0.75). Consistent with impaired post-synaptic function accounting for these changes in APP mutants, we did not see a decrease in miniature IPSC (mIPSC) frequency, a measure of presynaptic efficacy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fiszman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goswami et al., 2012</a>), when we compared <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> and WT hippocampal slices (Frequency; WT, 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 Hz; <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 Hz; p=0.8) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). Meanwhile mIPSC amplitude remained unchanged as well (Amplitude; WT, 14.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 pA; <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i>, 13.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 pA; p=0.7) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). In line with similar frequencies of mIPSCs in WT and <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> hippocampus, we observed identical numbers of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus of <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> and WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Finally, we looked at the abundance of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the hippocampus of APP mutant and WT animals. <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> hippocampal lysates display reduced immunoreactivity of the \u03b11 subunit, mediating fast inhibition, of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R but not the other GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits, (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Together, these data suggest that loss of APP may cause postsynaptic deficits in GABA<sub>A</sub>R mediated GABAergic inhibition."

The best characterized effectors of the Cl<sup>-</sup> distribution in the CNS are KCC2 and the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ben-Ari, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kaila et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rivera et al., 1999</a>). Since neuronal [Cl<sup>-</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is mainly determined by the opposing activities of the Cl<sup>-</sup> extruding transporter, KCC2, and the Cl<sup>-</sup> importing NKCC1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blaesse et al., 2009</a>), we compared hippocampal KCC2 and NKCC1 levels in WT and <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. We found that KCC2, but not NKCC1, protein levels were significantly reduced in <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> hippocampus compared to WT littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). KCC2 is mainly localized to the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gauvain et al., 2011</a>). To determine whether plasma membrane localization of KCC2 is decreased in APP mutants, we used surface biotinylation in hippocampal tissue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) or HEK293 cells transfected with KCC2 alone or KCC2 and hAPP695 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We observed significantly reduced plasma membrane KCC2 levels in both <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> hippocampus and HEK293 cells without co-transfection of hAPP695 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and D</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). To examine KCC2 levels in intact tissue, we performed immunohistochemical staining in slice with anti-KCC2 antibody. We observed a selective loss of KCC2 immunoreactivity in <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). To determine if this is due to altered transcription of KCC2 in APP mutants, we compared hippocampal KCC2 mRNA levels in <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> and WT controls. KCC2 mRNA abundance was similar in <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> and WT hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Together, these results indicate that APP is required to maintain normal KCC2 protein levels in the hippocampus via a post-transcriptional mechanism."

Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of KCC2 enhances lysozomal degradation and thus decreases KCC2 levels (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2010</a>). We hypothesized that APP may normally interact with KCC2 to prevent tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylated KCC2 levels increased in the absence of APP. Hippocampal tissue from <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> and WT mice was lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-KCC2 antibody (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). Precipitates were blotted for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins using the anti-P-Tyr antibody, 4G10. We observed a robust increase in tyrosine phosphorylated KCC2 levels in APP mutants compared to littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Moreover, total KCC2 protein levels remained decreased in <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) (Relative IOD: WT, 544.86; <i>App<sup>-/-</sup></i>, 412.56. hippocampal lysates of three mice per genotype) indicating an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of KCC2 accompanies the reduction in total KCC2 levels. To further demonstrate that KCC2 instability is due, at least in part, to phosphorylation by a tyrosine kinase in the absence of APP, we tested whether blockade of tyrosine kinases by PP2, a potent inhibitor of Src-family tyrosine kinases (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2007</a>), enhances KCC2 protein levels. Treatment of HEK293 cells transfected with KCC2 with PP2 at a concentration of 20 \u00b5M for 30 min significantly increased KCC2 levels compared to vehicle controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Together, these results suggest that APP-KCC2 interaction functions, at least in part, to limit tyrosine phosphorylation of KCC2, loss of APP leads to excessive tyrosine phosphorylation and premature degradation of KCC2, resulting in reduced KCC2 protein levels in APP mutants."

Changes in KCC2 function may account for many GABAergic signaling deficits, as it has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism and aging brain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ben-Ari et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ferando et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tao et al., 2012</a>). Though the GABAergic system appears to be resistant to A\u03b2 toxicity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Selkoe, 2002</a>), recent research has demonstrated dysfunctional GABAergic inhibition in AD (<a href=\"#bib46\">Verret et al., 2012</a>). In the present study, we have described a cellular mechanism by which loss of APP function downregulates KCC2 to impair GABAergic signaling. Given the results presented here in APP mutant hippocampal neurons, if APP function is compromised in the context of progressing AD, this may lead to the gradual loss of GABAergic signaling capacity in the hippocampus and associated changes in memory function. Together with a most recent study revealing a critical role of KCC2 in information storage in aging brain (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferando et al., 2016</a>), the present study suggests that KCC2 might serve as a therapeutic target to improve GABAergic inhibition to potentially restore hippocampal function and improve memory in AD."

Briefly, HEK293 cells transfected with KCC2 constructs or cultured neurons were washed two times with PBS containing 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (PBS-CM) and then incubated with 2 ml of PBS-CM containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. After labeling, the biotin reaction was quenched by washing three times with ice-cold PBS-CM containing 50 mM glycine and 0.1% BSA. Cells were then lyzed with 1 ml lysis buffer and the lysate was collected. Protein concentration was determined using Micro BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). After correction for protein concentration, 40 \u03bcl of 1:1 slurry of UltraLink NeutrAvidin (Pierce) was added to the lysates to pull down the biotin-labeled surface proteins for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. The NeutrAvidin beads were washed and bound materials were analyzed by SDS-PAGE."

The authors first showed the GABA reversal potential shifts toward depolarization, the decreased unitary IPSC amplitude, and the reduced GABAA receptor protein level in the hippocampus of APP-/- mice. Then, the authors found that APP directly binds to KCC2 and prevents KCC2 from its degradation. Furthermore, the authors showed that restoration of KCC2 function in APP-/- mice by CLP290 rescues GABAA receptor levels and function. Because patho-physiological functions of APP have attracted considerable attention, this work addresses a generally important topic. Addressing the following points would strengthen this paper."

This type of discrepancy is also shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, in which the amplitude of mIPSC for WT and APP-/- did not show the expected difference. These discrepancies might be due to the fact that authors apparently do not fully address the field of GABA inhibition. GABA has not only phasic mode but also tonic mode of action. In recent studies, tonic GABA release from reactive astrocytes and its inhibitory action has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Jo, et al., 2012; Wang, et al., 2012; also, see Yarishkin et al., 2015). KCC2 could not only affect synaptic GABAA receptors but also extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. In addition, isoguvacine which is used for monitoring functional surface GABAA activates not only synaptic GABAA but also extrasynaptic GABAA, complicating authors' interpretations. Therefore, authors need to introduce the current state of phasic and tonic GABA appropriately and discuss their results accordingly."

In our original submission, we showed that, in HEK293 cells, mKCC2 (a mutant form of KCC2 in which tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited) underwent ubiquitination and sequential degradation in the absence of APP co-transfection based on experiment showing that mKCC2 levels could be rescued by co-transfection with CYLD (a deubiquitinating enzyme) construct (previously <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, now <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), implicating ubiquitination as a mechanism potentially leading to KCC2 degradation. In our new experiments, we have confirmed, by treating transfected HEK293 cells (mKCC2 alone, mKCC2+APP; KCC2 alone, KCC2+APP) with the ubiquitination inhibitor MG132 (or vehicle), that blockade of ubiquitination by MG132 significantly increased both KCC2 and mKCC2 levels in the absence of APP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A-D</a> in the revised manuscript)."

To determine whether KCC2 ubiquitination occurs in brain lysates as well, we immunoprecipitated KCC2 from APP<sup>-/-</sup> and WT mouse hippocampal lysates and immunoblotted for ubiquitin/ubiquitinated protein to evaluate differences in KCC2 ubiquitination in APP<sup>-/-</sup> and WT. In APP<sup>-/-</sup> extracts, we observed significantly increased levels of ubiquitinated KCC2, indicating increased KCC2 ubiquitination in APP<sup>-/-</sup> hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E-F</a>). Furthermore, KCC2 levels were significantly increased in MG132-treated APP<sup>-/-</sup> hippocampus compared to DMSO controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G-H</a>). Moreover, MG132 treatment increased KCC2 surface levels in both HEK293 cells and APP<sup>-/-</sup> hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I-J</a>), implicating that KCC2 endocytosis might be functionally coupled to ubiquitination. Together, these results support the hypothesis that APP deficiency does indeed cause KCC2 ubiquitination. Please see subsection \u201cAPP also functions to suppress ubiquitination and thus degradation of KCC2\u201d and the Discussion, second paragraph."

We have previously shown that APP deficiency results in an impairment in tonic GABA current in dentate gyrus (Wang et al., 2014), and we have now added a figure showing significantly reduced tonic GABA current, which was evaluated by application of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist bicuculline, in CA1 of APP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Interestingly, restoring KCC2 activity with CLP257 did not rescue the impaired tonic GABA current in APP<sup>-/-</sup> hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A-B</a>). In addition, using western blotting, we have now shown that there are no significant differences between WT and APP<sup>-/-</sup> mice in levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b15 and \u03b4 subunits, which mediate tonic GABA current (Brickley &amp; Mody 2012; Caraiscos et al., 2004; Curia et al., 2009) (data added to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H-I</a> in the revised manuscript). These results suggest that altered tonic GABA current in APP-deficient CA1 may involve presynaptic mechanisms, e.g., abnormal astrocytic GABA activities, that require further investigation in the future.
