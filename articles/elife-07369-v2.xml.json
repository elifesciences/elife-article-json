To date, mechanical stimuli are the only means to activate Piezo ion channels and whether other modes of activation exist is not known. In this study, we screened \u223c3.25 million compounds using a cell-based fluorescence assay and identified a synthetic small molecule we termed Yoda1 that acts as an agonist for both human and mouse Piezo1. Functional studies in cells revealed that Yoda1 affects the sensitivity and the inactivation kinetics of mechanically induced responses. Characterization of Yoda1 in artificial droplet lipid bilayers showed that Yoda1 activates purified Piezo1 channels in the absence of other cellular components. Our studies demonstrate that Piezo1 is amenable to chemical activation and raise the possibility that endogenous Piezo1 agonists might exist. Yoda1 will serve as a key tool compound to study Piezo1 regulation and function."

To date, mechanical stimuli are the only means to activate Piezo ion channels and whether other modes of activation exist is not known. In this study, we screened \u223c3.25 million compounds using a cell-based fluorescence assay and identified a synthetic small molecule we termed Yoda1 that acts as an agonist for both human and mouse Piezo1. Functional studies in cells revealed that Yoda1 affects the sensitivity and the inactivation kinetics of mechanically induced responses. Characterization of Yoda1 in artificial droplet lipid bilayers showed that Yoda1 activates purified Piezo1 channels in the absence of other cellular components. Our studies demonstrate that Piezo1 is amenable to chemical activation and raise the possibility that endogenous Piezo1 agonists might exist. Yoda1 will serve as a key tool compound to study Piezo1 regulation and function."

                        "text": "Mechanotransduction describes processes by which mechanical forces are converted into biological responses. Mechanotransduction is essential for physiological functions including the sense of touch, hearing, and blood pressure regulation. The molecular mechanisms involved in mechanotransduction have been largely unknown, but mechanically activated cation channels are postulated to play important roles (<a href=\"#bib11\">Delmas et al., 2011</a>). Piezo1 and Piezo2 are necessary and sufficient for mechanically activated cation channel activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coste et al., 2010</a>). These proteins are expressed in various mechanically sensitive cell types, and Piezo1 and Piezo2 have recently been shown to be required for vascular development and touch sensing, respectively (<a href=\"#bib17\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Maksimovic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ranade et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ranade et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Woo et al., 2014</a>). In humans, Piezo1 gain-of-function mutations are associated with a hereditary red blood cell condition termed dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, while Piezo2 gain-of-function mutations are associated with three phenotypically overlapping conditions termed distal arthrogryposis type 5, Gordon Syndrome, and Marden\u2013Walker Syndrome (Piezo2) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albuisson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andolfo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coste et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">McMillin et al., 2014</a>). Piezo proteins form a distinct class of proteins with no apparent sequence similarity to other proteins and channels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coste et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bae et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Nilius and Honore, 2012</a>). They typically consist of &gt;2000 amino acids with \u223c30\u201340 putative transmembrane segments, and Piezo1 has been shown to assemble as a homotetramer of \u223c1.2 million daltons. Purified Piezo1 can be reconstituted in lipid bilayers resulting in spontaneous cation currents. This indicates that Piezos constitute channel-forming proteins, as opposed to accessory subunits (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coste et al., 2012</a>). Both vertebrate and invertebrate Piezo channels can be activated by mechanical stimuli suggesting an evolutionarily conserved gating mechanism geared to transduce mechanical force (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, to date, mechanical stimuli are the only means to activate Piezo ion channels. In comparison, temperature-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are polymodal and are the sensors of various chemicals that cause a burning sensation such as capsaicin and mustard oil, as well as endogenous compounds that cause inflammation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Julius, 2013</a>). Studies on the chemical activation of TRP channels have been crucial to understand the physiological role of these channels and have contributed to mechanistic appreciation of how these ion channels are gated (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jordt and Julius, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bandell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Macpherson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Julius, 2013</a>). The discovery of a chemical agonist of Piezo channels could thus benefit the study of mechanotransduction."

                        "text": "We set out to probe Piezos for chemical-mediated activation. As Piezos are calcium-permeable channels, we hypothesized that Piezo activity could be monitored using calcium-sensitive fluorophores. We tested this by overexpressing Piezo1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and monitoring intracellular calcium in response to pressure exerted on the cell via a blunt glass probe. In Piezo1 expressing cells, a sequence of mechanical stimulations using a piezo-electric driven probe caused reversible calcium responses that increased with increasing probe displacement until ultimately an irreversible Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal ensued as a consequence of membrane rupture. In contrast, control cells showed no reversible responses and only irreversible calcium flux upon cell perforation was observed. (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This suggested that Piezo1-mediated calcium flux could be measured via calcium fluorophores. With the objective to identify either a Piezo1 or Piezo2 agonist, we co-transfected HEK cells with mPiezo1 and mPiezo2 cDNAs and screened a collection of \u223c3.25 million low molecular weight (LMW) compounds for their ability to induce calcium influx in these cells. This led us to identify a synthetic compound that elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in Piezo1- but not vector-transfected cells; we named this compound Yoda1 (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> for screen and Yoda1 details). Yoda1-induced calcium responses depended largely on calcium influx as the chelation of extracellular calcium dramatically reduced the responses, while the depletion of intracellular calcium stores using thapsigargin did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Still, calcium-chelating conditions did not completely abolish the responses, raising the possibility of some functional Piezo1 in intracellular membranes upon overexpression. Concentration-response experiments showed that Yoda1 at micromolar concentrations induced robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in cells transfected with either human or mouse Piezo1, but not Piezo2-transfected cells, indicating its selectivity for Piezo1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). At higher Yoda1 concentrations (&gt;\u223c20 \u03bcM), the solutions became increasingly opaque. Therefore, the apparent EC<sub>50</sub> is likely affected by compound insolubility and may not allow meaningful interpretation. We further tested six distinct hPiezo1 mutants that we previously identified in xerocytosis patients and which exhibited increased mechanically induced currents (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albuisson et al., 2013</a>). Invariably, the Yoda1-induced calcium responses were bigger in cells transfected with these mutant channels than cells transfected with wild-type Piezo1, consistent with their gain-of-function phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The effect of Yoda1 appears to critically depend on the dichloro substitution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), as similar compounds present in the collection lacking the chlorines were not identified in the screen (data not shown). Furthermore, the oxidation state of the thioether group appears critical as no activity could be observed with the sulfone analog (tested at \u226430 \u03bcM, data not shown)."

In HEK cells transiently transfected with mPiezo1, using a cell-attached patch configuration, currents were measured before and during a series of increasing negative pressures applied via the recording pipette. The presence of Yoda1 caused multiple distinct effects. Firstly, Yoda1 caused a dramatic change in the kinetics of the mechanical responses, as it notably slowed the inactivation phase of the transient currents (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Secondly, Yoda1 sensitized mPiezo1 to activation by pressure as indicated by a leftward shift in the current\u2013pressure relationship, reducing the half maximal activation pressure (P50) by about 15 mm Hg (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Lastly, in the absence of negative pressure, we observed small currents in Yoda1-exposed patches. The Yoda1-dependent currents were a fraction of those attained by stretch: 9.0 \u00b1 2.2% of the maximal attainable current compared to 1.5 \u00b1 0.4% in control patches without Yoda1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D,E</a>). These results suggest that Yoda1 both modifies Piezo1 mechanotransduction currents and partially activates Piezo1 in the absence of externally applied pressure (note, however, that some membrane tension exists in cell-attached patches even prior to the application of negative pressure) The partial activation of Piezo1 by Yoda1 might be due to a variety of reasons, including (1) an indirect mechanism of action (but see below), (2) an inefficacious gating mechanism (i.e., acting as a gating modifier instead of a full agonist), or (3) a very high actual EC<sub>50</sub> (see comment on insolubility above). We also tested the effect of Yoda1 (10 \u03bcM) in whole-cell configuration, where mechanical pressure can be applied using a piezoelectric-driven glass probe. This concentration did not lead to measurable mPiezo1 currents in the absence of pressure but did cause a clear slowing of the inactivation phase of the mechanically activated currents, similar to the cell-attached patch experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). No such change in kinetics could be observed for Piezo2 consistent with Yoda1 having a Piezo1 selective effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

For instance, our lipid bilayer experiments suggest that Yoda1 does not require other proteins or specific lipid domains to exert an effect on Piezo1. This suggests its effect is either directly on the channel or via long-range membrane-delimited effects, for instance through a change in membrane tension or curvature of the membrane. Indeed, compounds that modify membrane curvature are known to affect mechanically sensitive ion channels (<a href=\"#bib22\">Patel et al., 1998</a>). However, such compounds are typically amphipaths which Yoda1 is not (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sheetz and Singer, 1974</a>). More importantly, the effect of Yoda1 appears governed by stringent structural requirements both on the side of the chemical and on the side of the channel (as no effect on Piezo2 was observed), fitting a model in which Yoda1 directly interacts with Piezo1."

In the bilayer system, we observed that Yoda1 stabilizes the open channel, potentially explaining the slowing of mPiezo1 inactivation kinetics observed in cells. However, we also observe prominent Yoda1-dependent calcium responses in cell culture and currents in artificial bilayers in the absence of externally applied forces. Therefore, the discrepancy in various levels of channel activity observed with different assays used here remains unexplained, and future in-depth understanding of mechanism of Yoda1 action on Piezo1 might shed light on these apparently disparate observations. Regardless, we show in an accompanying paper that Yoda1 causes Piezo1-dependent red blood cell dehydration, arguing for sufficient activation of the ion channel in the absence of external forces to cause a robust physiological impact."

This finding is important from two perspectives. Firstly, our studies provide the first evidence of non-mechanical activation of a Piezo channel, suggesting that Piezo1 gating does not exclusively depend on changes in mechanical force. This is important, since it raises the possibility that endogenous agonists of Piezo1 exist which may play an important role in modulating mechanotransduction. Secondly, Yoda1 will provide a valuable tool to facilitate studies aimed at elucidating Piezo1 gating mechanism and exploring its functional significance in various biological processes (see for instance accompanying paper)."

For Yoda1 containing liposomes, Yoda1 stock of 10 mM was made in DMSO and further diluted to give 1\u201330 \u03bcM final concentration in DPhPC liposomes. The liposomes were extruded through 0.1-mm filter (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). The protein was added in the Yoda1-containing liposomes prior to the single-channel recordings. All the experiments were performed in 100% DPhPC symmetric bilayers (with and without Yoda1), in 0.5 M KCl to potentiate signal-to-noise ratio. Electrode carrying the proteoliposome droplet was connected to the working end of the amplifier head stage (Molecular Devices Axopatch 200B). The second electrode, in a droplet containing the DPhPC liposomes, was connected to the grounded end of the head stage. In the indicated experiments, RR was injected to a final concentration of 30 \u03bcM using a Nano injector (VWR instrument, Sugar Land, TX)."

Segments of continuous recordings in the range of 50 s \u2264 t \u2264 500 s were used for analysis. The currents were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Additional offline filtering of 1 kHz was applied to the recordings for display. Conductance was determined by fitting a Gaussian curve to the single channel all point current amplitude histograms. Event detection was performed by time-course fitting with the segmental K means (SKM) implemented in QuB software. To avoid the detection of erroneous events, the receiver dead time (<i>t</i><sub><i>d</i></sub>) was set at 300 \u03bcs for all records. Therefore, transitions shorter than <i>t</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> were ignored; transitions longer than <i>t</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> were accepted as events. Open dwell-time distributions are fitted with a single-component probability density function, whereas closed dwell-time distributions are fitted with a two-component probability density function implemented in QuB. The calculated values are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, n denote number of experiments."

The molecule was identified by an unbiased screen of an impressive \u223c3 million compound library. The authors use a combination of calcium-imaging, detailed single channel and whole-cell and artificial bilayer electrophysiology to convincingly show that Obi1 is in fact an agonist acting specifically on Piezo1, but not Piezo2."

Having this molecule is significant to study Piezo-related mechanisms and the authors demonstrate this nicely in the accompanying manuscript."

The Obi1 compound shifts the pressure-effect curve leftward and removes inactivation. Remarkably, this opener works after reconstitution of Piezo1 into an artificial bilayer. Those findings are conceptually important as it demonstrates that this mammalian stretch-activated ion channel can also be opened by an agonist in the absence of mechanical stress. This study also suggests that a natural opener of Piezo1 may possibly exist. I believe that this report is important for a better understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and will certainly be a highly cited paper."
