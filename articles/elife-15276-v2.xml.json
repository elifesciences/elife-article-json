RcsF exists in complexes with \u03b2-barrel proteins (OMPs) allowing it to adopt a transmembrane orientation with a lipidated N-terminal domain on the cell surface and a periplasmic C-terminal domain. Here we report that mutations that remove BamE or alter a residue in the RcsF trans-lumen domain specifically prevent assembly of the interlocked complexes without inactivating either RcsF or the OMP. Using these mutations we demonstrate that these RcsF/OMP complexes are required for sensing OM outer leaflet stress. Using mutations that alter the positively charged surface-exposed domain, we show that RcsF monitors lateral interactions between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules. When these interactions are disrupted by cationic antimicrobial peptides, or by the loss of negatively charged phosphate groups on the LPS molecule, this information is transduced to the RcsF C-terminal signaling domain located in the periplasm to activate the stress response."

LPS is a glycolipid that consists of three domains: lipid A, the core and the O-antigen (<a href=\"#bib47\">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</a>). Several sugars in lipid A and the core are phosphorylated conferring negative charge to the LPS molecule. In the OM, these negatively charged groups are bridged by divalent cations, which help to establish strong lateral interactions between LPS molecules. In addition to stabilizing the OM, these lateral interactions contribute to the unique barrier properties of the OM making it impermeable to hydrophobic compounds, detergents and dyes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nikaido, 2003</a>). The OM also protects Gram-negatives from the host innate immunity factors and antibiotics limiting their effectiveness. In order to disrupt the OM, many organisms produce cationic antibacterial peptides (CAMPs) that bind LPS (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hancock and Diamond, 2000</a>). As a result of this binding, the OM is permeabilized and this not only facilitates further uptake of the CAMPs but also sensitizes Gram-negatives to antibiotics and host-factors, including lysozyme. For this reason, several CAMPs are \u201clast hope\u201d antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li et al., 2006</a>)."

Rcs controls the expression of capsule exopolysaccharides that are exported to the cell surface and help to stabilize the OM (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gottesman et al., 1985</a>). In addition, Rcs downregulates flagella expression (<a href=\"#bib18\">Francez-Charlot et al., 2003</a>), shifting bacteria from planktonic to a biofilm growth mode (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ferri\u00e8res and Clarke, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Latasa et al., 2012</a>), which is often associated with further increased resistance.

RcsF is an OM lipoprotein that acts as a sensory component (<a href=\"#bib34\">Majdalani and Gottesman, 2005</a>). Unlike most lipoproteins in <i>E. coli</i>, RcsF is anchored to the outer leaflet of the OM by its lipid moiety and contains an N-terminal domain that is surface exposed (<a href=\"#bib28\">Konovalova et al., 2014</a>). The short, hydrophilic transmembrane domain of RcsF is threaded through the lumen of \u03b2-barrel proteins (OMPs) exposing the C-terminal signaling domain in the periplasm (<a href=\"#bib28\">Konovalova et al., 2014</a>). The inner membrane (IM) protein RcsC is a hybrid histidine kinase, which autophosphorylates and passes the phosphate through the IM phosphotransferase protein RcsD to a cytoplasmic DNA-binding response regulator RcsB (<a href=\"#bib59\">Stout and Gottesman, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Takeda et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Majdalani and Gottesman, 2007</a>).

Based on genetic analysis as well as some interaction studies it has been proposed that RcsF can interact directly with the periplasmic domain of IgaA to alleviate inhibition of RcsC (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dom\u00ednguez-Bernal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2014</a>)."

The fact that LPS is found exclusively in the outer leaflet of the OM and that RcsF is required to sense LPS structural defects prompted us to search for a surface-exposed domain. Our discovery that RcsF exists in a transmembrane complex with OMPs suggested that this interlocked structure is required for sensing the LPS defects (<a href=\"#bib28\">Konovalova et al., 2014</a>). However, another study, which focused primarily on Rcs activated by PG stress caused by A22 or mecillinam treatment, proposed a model in which the RcsF/OMP complex has no function in RcsF sensing and signaling and only serves an inhibitory role during steady state growth. This model was based on the observation that Rcs induction by A22 depends on newly synthesized RcsF (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). Here, we show that the RcsF/OMP complex is functional and that LPS defects are sensed directly by the surface-exposed domain of RcsF."

The NPN (1-N-phenylnaphthylamine) uptake assay is used to quantitatively monitor OM permeability caused by CAMPs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Loh et al., 1984</a>).

Due to its hydrophobic nature, it cannot penetrate Gram-negative OM due to the presence of LPS. However, when CAMPs compromise the OM, NPN enters the cell and integrates into membranes resulting in an increase in fluorescence. When mid-log cells were incubated with 0.5 \u00b5g /ml PMB we observed only a small increase in fluorescence, about 1.5 fold, compared to a 6-fold increase when cell were treated with 8 \u00b5g /ml PMB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

DiSC3(5) accumulates in the IM in a proton motive force (PMF)-dependent manner, where it self-quenches the fluorescence. However, when PMF is compromised, diSC3(5) is released from the IM resulting in increased fluorescence. We treated diSC3(5) -labeled cells with 0.5 \u00b5g /ml PMB or an MIC (12.5 \u00b5g /ml) of Gramicidin, a CAMP known to be PMF uncoupler. Gramicidin A but not PMB caused an increased fluorescence due to diSC3(5) release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Taken together, these assays demonstrate that at low concentrations PMB does not cause IM depolarization and generates only a small increase in OM permeability, consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib8\">Daugelavicius et al., 2000</a>)"

Glb prevents maturation of lipoproteins resulting in the accumulation of OM lipoproteins in the outer leaflet of the IM. It is well established that, when RcsF accumulates in the outer leaflet of the IM, due to Lol-avoidance mutations that alter the signal sequence or defects in lipoprotein maturation and/or export, it strongly induces the Rcs response (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shiba et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tao et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, we observed strong Rcs induction in response to 5 \u00b5M Glb (0.5 MIC). This induction required at least 15 min on the RNA level and 20 min on the protein level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Clearly, the kinetics of Rcs induction are much slower with Glb than with PMB. Glb will prevent assembly of essential lipoproteins involved in both LPS and OMP assembly; however, depletion of these proteins to levels low enough to interfere with these assembly processes requires generations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Malinverni et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, Glb does not induce the Sigma E response even after 60 min exposure (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, we conclude that Glb is a chemical inducer of Rcs that is independent of OM damage."

Therefore, the kinetics of the Glb-induced Rcs response can also serve as a temporal marker for induction due to mislocalization of newly synthesized RcsF. The observation that Glb induced Rcs with slower kinetics than with PMB suggested that induction with PMB does not require newly synthesized RcsF. To test this directly, we used the antibiotic Kasugamycin (Ksg), which is an inhibitor of translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Okuyama et al., 1971</a>). After 15 min pre-treatment with Ksg we added PMB or Glb and followed the expression of P<i>rprA-lacZ</i> by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). As expected Ksg completely abolished Rcs induction in response to Glb (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, lower panel), however Ksg did not block the Rcs response to PMB, demonstrating that Rcs induction is independent of <i>de novo</i> protein synthesis and does not require newly synthesized RcsF (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, upper panel). Since RcsF is transported to the OM immediately after it is translocated from the cytoplasm, this result suggests that RcsF molecules already located in the OM are required to respond to PMB treatment."

Here we report that a mutation <i>rcsF_A55Y</i> results in a significant reduction in the assembly of RcsF/OmpA complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, upper panel). Photo-crosslinking also shows that RcsF interacts with BamA and it is thought that this reflects a role for BamA in the assembly of the RcsF/OMP complexes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Konovalova et al., 2014</a>). The <i>rcsF_A55Y</i> mutation also results in a significant reduction in the levels of RcsF/BamA complex."

Deletion of <i>ompA</i> in <i>waaP</i> background resulted in a strong synthetic interaction and this strain had a growth defect in liquid culture (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For this reason, we did not perform experiments with this strain. When the <i>rcsF_A55Y</i> or <i>bamE</i> mutation was introduced in the <i>waaP</i> strain, no growth defect was observed demonstrating that the loss of OmpA not the RcsF/OmpA complex causes this synthetic interaction (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Strikingly, both assembly mutations significantly reduced the expression of the P<i>rprA-lacZ</i> reporter in the <i>waaP</i> strain and resulted in loss of the mucoid phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) indicating that Rcs was not induced. P<i>rprA-lacZ</i> expression in the <i>rcsF_A55Y</i> strain was still somewhat stimulated by the <i>waaP</i> mutation, likely because the assembly of RcsF/OMP complexes was not completely abolished. Taken together, we conclude that RcsF/OMP complexes are required for sensing LPS defects."

We therefore tested whether charge-neutralization of LPS by PMB is sufficient to induce Rcs. For this, we analyzed the ability of a lipid-truncated PMB derivative, PMB nonapetide (PMBN) to induce Rcs. PMBN also neutralizes LPS but does not disturb the bilayer and is non-toxic.

We show here that this interlocked, heterodimeric structure functions directly to sense known Rcs inducing signals that cause perturbations in the outer leaflet of the OM caused either by treatment with CAMPs or by mutations that cause LPS structural defects. We show that altered OM permeability or asymmetry are not physiological inducers of RcsF. Instead, RcsF senses the state of LPS lateral interactions and it is activated when these interactions are perturbed either by: i) neutralization of LPS negative charge by CAMPs (such as PMB) as a result of direct binding; ii) decreased LPS phosphorylation as a result of mutations in LPS biosynthesis pathway; iii) by lack of cations to stabilize LPS cross-bridges. Moreover, we show that the positive charge of surface-exposed domain of RcsF is necessary for sensing these LPS defects."

Signals that induce Rcs do so by inhibiting the function of the Bam complex. This prevents RcsF/OMP assembly and allows newly synthesized RcsF to remain free in the periplasm where it can engage the IM components of the signal transduction system. According to this model, activation of Rcs signaling depends on <i>de novo</i> protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2014</a>)."

However, it is unclear how PG defects induce Rcs. RcsF does not interact with PG, and therefore, activation might not be direct. For example, \u03b2-lactams (including mecillinam), A22 and mutations in <i>pbp</i> genes induce not only Rcs but also the Cpx response (<a href=\"#bib31\">Laubacher and Ades, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Delhaye et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Evans et al., 2013</a>) and, at least in the case of the <i>pbp4, 5, 7, and ampH</i> mutations, Rcs induction relies fully on Cpx (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evans et al., 2013</a>). Because A22 and mecillinam treatment decrease RcsF/BamA crosslinking, it was proposed that RcsF monitors the activity of the Bam complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). However, there is no evidence that any of the treatments that affect PG affect the function of the Bam complex. We propose an alternative explanation in which newly synthesized RcsF is engaged in signaling prior its interactions with BamA. Reduction of RcsF/OMP complexes may facilitate this type of signaling by increasing proportion of periplasmic RcsF."

Recent studies have uncovered a role for BamE in modulating BamA activity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rigel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2013</a>).

Here, we show that BamE plays an essential role in assembly of RcsF/OMP complexes. In a strain lacking BamE, RcsF/OmpA complexes are almost undetectable. Nonetheless, RcsF is still recognized by BamA. In fact, increased RcsF /BamA crosslinking is observed in a <i>bamE</i> strain. This finding further supports the model that RcsF/BamA crosslinking represents an intermediate in RcsF/OMP assembly pathway and suggests that RcsF binds BamA before it binds the OMP."

                                "text": "For a time course experiments, overnight cultures of corresponding strains were diluted 1:100 in LB (supplemented with kanamycin 25 \u00b5g/ml when needed) and grown to an OD600 of 0.5 in a shaking water bath at 37\u00b0C. Cultures were then treated with 0.5 \u00b5g/ml PMB or 5 \u00b5M Glb for a course of 60 min. Samples were taken every 10 min for a \u03b2-galactosidase assay and for OD600 measurement. For a \u03b2-galactosidase assay, 100 \u00b5l samples were taken and added directly to 900 \u00b5l of Z buffer (60\u2009mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 40\u2009mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 50\u2009mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% SDS). 50 \u00b5l of chloroform was added to stop growth and mix vigorously by pipetting. After collecting all samples, 100 \u00b5l of cell each lysate was mixed with 100 \u00b5l of 4 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) solution in Z buffer. \u03b2-galactosidase activity was analyzed by a kinetic measurement of OD420 in a BioTek Synergy 1 plate reader and Vmax was determined using Gen5 software. Vmax was normalized by OD600. Experiments were performed in three biological replicates and mean values +/- SEM were plotted. Graphs were built by GraphPad Prism 6 software. For a single point measurement, corresponding strains were grown to an OD600 of 0.5\u20130.7 and samples for a \u03b2-galactosidase assay were taken and analyzed as described above."

In this paper you report that the RcsF/OMP complexes can induce Rcs system through OM stress response by showing that pre-synthesized RcsF is sufficient to induce Rcs in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, as shown using chemical inhibitors. This challenges the model of Choi et al. for RcsF induction, which evokes a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. Clearly, the model is evolving and your manuscript is an important step towards this. Overall, the conclusions are well supported and provide new insight into complex signaling events. The main concern is whether it has been proven that changes in LPS structure are directly detected by RcsF, or if the sequence of events is LPS mutation leading to \"altered OM\", which in turn activates RcsF signaling. A few suggested control experiments should help to strengthen your conclusions that it is indeed the former scenario, as you have proposed."
