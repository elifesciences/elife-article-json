Although A\u03b2 exerts neuropathogenic activity through tau, the mechanistic link between A\u03b2 and tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we showed that the Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP2 axis is critical in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau pathology. <i>Fcgr2b</i> knockout or antagonistic Fc\u03b3RIIb antibody inhibited A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and rescued memory impairments in AD mouse models. Fc\u03b3RIIb phosphorylation at Tyr273 was found in AD brains, in neuronal cells exposed to A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>, and recruited SHIP2 to form a protein complex. Consequently, treatment with A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> increased PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> levels from PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to mediate tau hyperphosphorylation. Further, we found that targeting SHIP2 expression by lentiviral siRNA in 3xTg-AD mice or pharmacological inhibition of SHIP2 potently rescued tau hyperphosphorylation and memory impairments. Thus, we concluded that the Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP2 axis links A\u03b2 neurotoxicity to tau pathology by dysregulating PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism, providing insight into therapeutic potential against AD."

Although A\u03b2 exerts neuropathogenic activity through tau, the mechanistic link between A\u03b2 and tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we showed that the Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP2 axis is critical in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau pathology. <i>Fcgr2b</i> knockout or antagonistic Fc\u03b3RIIb antibody inhibited A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and rescued memory impairments in AD mouse models. Fc\u03b3RIIb phosphorylation at Tyr273 was found in AD brains, in neuronal cells exposed to A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>, and recruited SHIP2 to form a protein complex. Consequently, treatment with A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> increased PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> levels from PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to mediate tau hyperphosphorylation. Further, we found that targeting SHIP2 expression by lentiviral siRNA in 3xTg-AD mice or pharmacological inhibition of SHIP2 potently rescued tau hyperphosphorylation and memory impairments. Thus, we concluded that the Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP2 axis links A\u03b2 neurotoxicity to tau pathology by dysregulating PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism, providing insight into therapeutic potential against AD."

The pathological hallmarks of AD are the presence of senile plaques consisting of A\u03b2 peptide and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (<a href=\"#bib79\">Walsh and Selkoe, 2004</a>). A\u03b2 species are generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, and accumulate extracellularly (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haass and Selkoe, 2007</a>). In general, A\u03b2 contributes to AD pathology by exhibiting toxicity in susceptible neurons, facilitating tau hyperphosphorylation, disrupting proteasome activity, and triggering synaptic dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib37\">LaFerla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kam et al., 2014</a>). Tau is a microtubule-binding protein but dissociates from the microtubules and accumulates in neurons as it becomes highly phosphorylated at multiple sites, resulting in the impairment of microtubule assembly and function (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballatore et al., 2007</a>)."

In the amyloid cascade hypothesis, tau is believed to be one of the major downstream targets of A\u03b2 to produce neurotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</a>). A\u03b2 accelerates neurodegeneration in neuronal cells but not in tau-deficient neurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rapoport et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, tau depletion in mutant <i>APP</i> transgenic mice prevented A\u03b2 pathologies, including learning and memory impairment (<a href=\"#bib63\">Roberson et al., 2007</a>). The role of A\u03b2 in tau pathology was also shown in 3xTg-AD mice expressing APP, presenilin, and tau transgenes in which A\u03b2 immunization reduced not only A\u03b2 accumulation but also tau pathology (<a href=\"#bib50\">Oddo et al., 2004</a>). In addition, higher levels of NFT have been observed in APPswe/P301L transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lewis et al., 2001</a>) and in 3xTg-AD mice (<a href=\"#bib51\">Oddo et al., 2003</a>). More importantly, tau hyperphosphorylation is frequently found in AD brains (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1989</a>). Apparently, tau kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), are activated by A\u03b2 for tau phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hoshi et al.,\u00a02003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Terwel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Park et al., 2012</a>).

Unlike PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> are formed when cells respond to signals (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zhang and Majerus, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lemmon, 2008</a>).

Of particular note, while \u03b17 nAChR was reported to mediate A\u03b2-induced tau phosphorylation, the finding was based on in vitro and ex vivo system (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, evidence showing a correlation of the proposed molecular mechanism with pathologic evidence was not much provided. In particular, the CAMKK2-AMPK at down-stream of NMDA receptor was recently proposed to mediate the synaptotoxic effects of A\u03b2 oligomers through tau phosphorylation and this event is very likely caused by NMDA receptor-induced increase of intracellular calcium, not by direct interaction of NMDA receptor with A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mairet-Coello et al., 2013</a>).

On the other hand, injection with normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) did not exhibit such inhibitory effects on memory impairment. There was no difference in total movements between these groups of mice, as reflected by total arm entry in the Y-maze test (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

We generated several Fc\u03b3RIIb mutants lacking the ITIM (\u0394ITIM) or cytoplasmic region (\u0394cyto), or substituting the tyrosine residue with phenylalanine (Y273F), and examined their effects on A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxicity and tau phosphorylation. Unlike Fc\u03b3RIIb, ectopic expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb mutants did not induce neuronal death in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Moreover, overexpression of Fc\u03b3RIIb Y273F mutant, which was not phosphorylated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), blocked A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxicity to the control level in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas Fc\u03b3RIIb WT potentiated it (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), indicating that Fc\u03b3RIIb-Tyr273 phosphorylation is required for A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> neurotoxicity. Next, we examined the role of Fc\u03b3RIIb phosphorylation in tau phosphorylation using a reconstitution analysis in <i>Fcgr2b</i> KO neurons. Unlike that in <i>Fcgr2b</i>-deficient neurons, reconstitution of the <i>Fcgr2b</i> KO primary cortical neurons with Fc\u03b3RIIb WT recovered A\u03b2-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau, detected by PHF1, CP13, AT180, and 12E8 antibodies, as seen in WT neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). On the other hand, reconstitution with Fc\u03b3RIIb-\u0394Cyto or Fc\u03b3RIIb-Y273F failed to show tau phosphorylation at those epitopes in response to A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

Compared to untreated control cells, treatment with PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> increased tau phosphorylation (AT180, CP13, PHF1) in primary cortical neurons in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Interestingly, the increase in tau hyperphosphorylation was specific to PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>; other phosphoinositides, such as PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, failed to do so. Consistent with the activation of GSK3\u03b2 by A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>, PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> treatment also reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9 in neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Moreover, PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> induced the expression of GRP78, a typical marker of unfolded protein response (UPR), as well (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We further found that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>-induced GSK3\u03b2 activation and tau phosphorylation were attenuated by the treatment with ER stress inhibitors, such as 4-PBA and Salubrinal, a chemical chaperone and an eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation inhibitor, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We confirmed that ER stress response and GSK3\u03b2 activation triggered by A\u03b2 were all declined by a SHIP2 inhibitor AS1949490 or lentiviral expression of <i>Inppl1</i> siRNA (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Combined with the previous study showing that ER stress stimulates GSK3\u03b2 activity (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ren et al., 2015</a>), these results suggest that an increase in the PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> level by A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> activates GSK3\u03b2 through ER stress for tau hyperphosphorylation in neuronal cells."

Conversely, overexpression of SHIP2 alone was sufficient to increase tau hyperphosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). On the other hand, these effects were not observed using an activity-dead SHIP2 mutant with Asp608 replaced by Ala (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nakatsu et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

When we examined the effect of AS1949490 on the memory impairment triggered by i.c.v.-injected A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> in mice, we directly delivered AS1949490 into mouse brains because of its poor bioavailability (<a href=\"#bib72\">Suwa et al., 2010</a>).

To our knowledge, this is the first study showing crucial mediator, the Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP2 axis, which is responsible for A\u03b2-induced tau phosphorylation, memory impairment, and neuronal loss in AD models. Because the interaction of A\u03b2 species, especially oligomeric A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>, with Fc\u03b3RIIb accounts for such neuropathogenic defects of AD as an initiation step, the selective interaction of oligomeric A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> with Fc\u03b3RIIb may hint at why A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>, but not A\u03b2<sub>1-40</sub>, is important in tau pathology (<a href=\"#bib52\">Oddo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kam et al., 2013</a>). Consequently, inhibition of the interaction between Fc\u03b3RIIb and A\u03b2 using anti-Fc\u03b3RIIb antibody prevents A\u03b2-induced tau phosphorylation and memory deficits."

We have here used 3 different sources of A\u03b2 oligomers; synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers, naturally secreted A\u03b2 oligomers (7PA2 cells), and A\u03b2 of 3xTg-AD model mice. Although synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers are well-characterized and have been used widely for neurotoxicity, the acting concentration of synthetic A\u03b2 (\u03bcM range) is relatively higher than that in AD brains. Compared to synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers, conditioned medium from 7PA2 cells mainly contains not only A\u03b2 dimers and trimers but also the different pools of A\u03b2 oligomers, including zeta peptide, and show more potent neurotoxic properties (nM range) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Qi-Takahara, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Haass and Selkoe, 2007</a>). Moreover, the oligomers generated in 3xTg-AD mouse brain may be more complicated and needs to be identified. Nonetheless, we propose here that Fc\u03b3RIIb plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in response to these species of A\u03b2, probably a certain common species among the different sources of A\u03b2 oligomers."

As expected, we observed that microglia was activated in 3xTg-AD mice and this activation was also reduced significantly in the cortex and marginally in the hippocampus by Fc\u03b3RIIb deficiency (data not shown). Recently, however, we and other colleagues identified that both Fc\u03b3RIIb mRNA and protein are also expressed in neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cahoy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Suemitsu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kam et al., 2013</a>), though Fc\u03b3RIIb expression in neurons is low compared to astrocytes and immune tissues. Notably, its expression is increased at least several folds in primary neurons after exposure to A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> and in AD brain (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kam et al., 2013</a>). In addition, transgenic expression of the Fc\u03b3RIIb mutant lacking its cytoplasmic domain in the neurons blocked memory impairment in 3xTg AD mice (data not shown). Moreover, the results showing that A\u03b2-induced tau phosphorylation was prevented by Fc\u03b3RIIb deficiency, antagonistic Fc\u03b3RIIb antibody, or SHIP2 inhibitor in primary cultured neurons assure neuronal function of the Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP2 axis. Together, we believe that the inflammation mediated by Fc\u03b3RIIb in 3xTg-AD mice is not likely a major cause of the memory impairment but contributes to the aggravation of memory impairment in the mice."

Excitingly, the binding of extracellular A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> to Fc\u03b3RIIb induces phosphorylation in the ITIM of Fc\u03b3RIIb in neuronal cells. We observed that Lyn kinase is expressed in neurons and that knockdown of <i>LYN</i> expression blocks A\u03b2-induced Fc\u03b3RIIb phosphorylation and neurotoxicity (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that Lyn phosphorylates the ITIM of Fc\u03b3RIIb in neuronal cells in response to A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>. Moreover, we also observed this phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIb in AD brains (stage V and VI) in which tau was highly phosphorylated. Then, how is Fc\u03b3RIIb different from other A\u03b2 receptors? It is reasonable to propose that different mechanisms or even the same mechanism exerts multiple effects at different stages of disease progression (<a href=\"#bib13\">De\u00a0Strooper and Karran, 2016</a>). For instance, RAGE is now believed to mainly function to transport A\u03b2 in the blood brain barrier (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deane et al., 2003</a>) and ABAD acts for mitochondrial toxicity as an intracellular binding partner of A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lustbader, 2004</a>). In case of PrPc, it's debatable whether it is involved in A\u03b2-induced memory impairments and thus needs to be further characterized (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balducci et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gimbel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ciss\u00e9 et al., 2011b</a>). Further, compared to those receptors, our observations that the phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIb at tyrosine 273 is found in the brain of AD patients and is required for both oligomeric A\u03b2 neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation can make it distinct from other A\u03b2-binding receptors. In the case of PirB that shares structural similarity with Fc\u03b3RIIb and also acts as an A\u03b2 receptor for synaptic plasticity, the phosphorylation of PirB is not associated with A\u03b2 signaling (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we believe that Fc\u03b3RIIb facilitates tau phosphorylation and neuronal loss in AD brains, consistent with the proposed role of tau in AD pathogenesis, such as severe memory impairment and neuronal loss (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballatore et al., 2007</a>)."

Many studies on SHIP2 have focused on its inhibitory effect on insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ishihara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wada et al., 2001</a>). <i>Inppl1</i> transgenic mice show impaired insulin signaling and glucose intolerance, while <i>Inppl1</i> KO mice are highly resistant to weight gain on a high-fat diet (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sleeman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kagawa et al., 2008</a>). Thus, targeting SHIP2 is thought to be a promising approach for the treatment of other diseases, including type 2 diabetes (<a href=\"#bib76\">Vanhanen et al., 2006</a>). Given that metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, is highly associated with AD (<a href=\"#bib76\">Vanhanen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Razay et al., 2007</a>), we speculate that SHIP2 may play a dual role in AD and diabetes. In support of this, a SHIP2 inhibitor exhibited an ameliorating effect on the impaired memory function of diabetic mice (<a href=\"#bib68\">Soeda et al., 2010</a>). Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SHIP2 are involved in metabolic syndrome (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kaisaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kagawa et al., 2005</a>); thus, it will be very interesting to evaluate the effect of these SHIP2 SNPs on AD pathogenesis in our Fc\u03b3RIIb-SHIP2 axis."

The phosphoinositide pool is also altered in AD (<a href=\"#bib70\">Stokes and Hawthorne, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jope et al., 1994</a>). In particular, this work shows that a change in the PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> level is implicated in AD pathogenesis through tau hyperphosphorylation. PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> is scarce under normal conditions and increases through signaling (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lemmon, 2008</a>). While PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> are known to overlap to some degree in their functions, they apparently have distinct roles in neurodegeneration. Recently, it was shown that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, but not PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, potentiates glutamate-induced cell death in neurons (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sasaki et al., 2010</a>). In addition, PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase INPP4A deficiency shows increased level of PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and leads to neurodegeneration in brains (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sasaki et al., 2010</a>). We also observed that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> selectively induces tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. In addition, tensin homolog deletion on chromosome 10 (PTEN) also dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> at position 3 and generates PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997</a>). The reduced level of PTEN in AD brains correlates with an increase in tau phosphorylation and, thus, dysregulation of PTEN also contributes to tau pathology (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kerr et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). More recently, genetic reduction of synaptojanin 1 (Synj1), the major PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase in the brain, ameliorates behavioral and synaptic deficits and accelerates A\u03b2 clearance through rescuing PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> deficiency (<a href=\"#bib46\">McIntire et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhu et al., 2015</a>). Because oligomeric A\u03b2 decreases PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in AD (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berman et al., 2008</a>), as we also observed, there is a possibility that SHIP2 activation together with either Synj1 upregulation or PTEN downregulation induces the imbalance in the phosphoinositide pool between PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and leads to AD pathogenesis."

The lentivirus (1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109<sup>9</sup> TU/ml, TU; transduction unit) was stereotaxically injected bilaterally into the dentate gyrus (2 \u03bcl per hemisphere at 0.4 \u03bcl/min) with the following coordinates: anteroposterior\u00a0=\u00a02.1 mm from bregma, mediolateral =\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 mm, dorsoventral\u00a0=\u00a02.0 mm. After the injection, the cannula was maintained for an additional 5 min for a complete absorption of the virus. Behavior tests were performed 20 and 30 days after the injection.

In Y-maze test, the mice were placed in the end of one arm (32.5 cm length \u00d7 15 cm height) of apparatus and allowed to move freely for 7 min. When the all four paws were into the arm, the entry was counted. The percentage of spontaneous alternations was calculated as the ratio of the number of successful alternations to the number of total alternations. In novel object recognition test, the mice were habituated in a chamber (22 cm wide \u00d7 27 cm long \u00d7 30 cm high) for 7 min with 24 hr intervals. In training trial #1 (2 days after habituation), the mice were exposed to two objects and allowed to explore freely for 7 min. In the testing trial #2 (a day after training), one of the familiar objects was replaced to a novel object and recognition was counted for 7 min. The same test was repeated after 24 hr, but with another novel object (trial #3). The object recognition was defined as spending time with orienting toward the object in a distance of 1 cm or less, sniffing the object or touching with the nose. The passive avoidance test was done in an apparatus consist of a light and dark compartment (20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020 \u00d7 20 cm each) separated by a guillotine door. The mice were allowed to explore the box for 5 min with the door open for habituation, and then returned to home cage. After 24 hr, the mice were placed into the light compartment for conditioning. The door was closed after entering into the dark room and then an electric foot shock (0.25 mA, 2 s) was delivered by the floor grids.

After incubation for 18 hr at 16\u00b0C, cells were harvested and lyzed by sonication. His-fused TAPP1-PH and GRP1-PH were purified from cell lysates using Ni-NTA chelating agarose CL-6B (Peptron,\u00a0Korea). PLO assays were performed as described previously with minor modification (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dowler et al., 2002</a>). Lyophilized PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> diC16 (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT) were reconstituted in a 1:2:0.8 solution of chloroform, methanol and water, and used as positive controls. The lipid extracts from the cells were serially diluted and spotted on PVDF membranes which were pre-wetted in methanol, washed in TBS-T buffer and then air-dried. The membranes were dried completely and blocked with 3% BSA in TBS-T buffer for 1 hr. The blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle rocking in the fresh blocking buffer containing purified 10 \u03bcM His-TAPP1-PH or His-GRP1-PH. The membranes were washed 5 times over 50 min in TBS-T buffer and incubated with anti-His antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. The membranes were further incubated for 1 hr with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and bound proteins were visualized using ECL detection system. PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>, PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels were quantified by ELISA kit (Echelon) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions."

GSK-3-\u03b2 kinase that catalyzes tau hyperphosphorylation, uses ATP as a donor of phosphate groups, so phosphoinositides are not a substrate.

Although these receptors were shown to be responsible for A\u03b2 neurotoxicity, especially memory impairment in AD mice, their role as neuronal receptors in A\u03b2-induced tau pathologies was limitedly shown in \u03b17 nAChR and NMDA receptor (reviewed in Stancu et al., 2014). Of particular note, while \u03b17 nAChR was reported to mediate A\u03b2-induced tau phosphorylation, the finding was based on in vitroand ex vivosystem (Wang et al., 2003). It thus remains to be confirmed in detail using animal models of AD. Furthermore, evidence showing a correlation of the proposed molecular mechanism with pathologic evidence was not much provided. In particular, the CAMKK2-AMPK at down-stream of NMDA receptor was recently proposed to mediate the synaptotoxic effects of A\u03b2 oligomers through tau phosphorylation and this event is very likely caused by NMDA receptor-induced increase of intracellular calcium, not by direct interaction of NMDA receptor with A\u03b2 (Mairet-Coello et al., 2013). Therefore, a neuronal receptor that is important in A\u03b2- induced tau pathology has not been identified and needs to be elucidated for controlling overall AD pathology. We added this information in \u2018Introduction\u2019 (fourth paragraph)."

                    "text": "Then, how is Fc\u03b3RIIb different from other A\u03b2 receptors? It is reasonable to propose that different mechanisms or even the same mechanism exerts multiple effects at different stages of disease progression (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). For instance, RAGE is now believed to mainly function to transport A\u03b2 in the blood brain barrier (Deane et al., 2003) and ABAD acts for mitochondrial toxicity as an intracellular binding partner of A\u03b2 (Lustbader et al., 2004). In case of PrPc, it's debatable whether it is involved in A\u03b2-induced memory impairments and thus needs to be further characterized (Balducci et al., 2010; Gimbel et al., 2010; Cisse et al., 2011b). Further, compared to those receptors, our observations that the phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIb at tyrosine 273 is found in the brain of AD patients and is required for both oligomeric A\u03b2 neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation can make it distinct from other A\u03b2- binding receptors. In the case of PirB that shares structural similarity with Fc\u03b3RIIb and also acts as an A\u03b2 receptor for synaptic plasticity, the phosphorylation of PirB is not associated with A\u03b2 signaling (Kim et al., 2013). Thus, we believe that Fc\u03b3RIIb facilitates tau phosphorylation and neuronal loss in AD brains, consistent with the proposed role of tau in AD pathogenesis, such as severe memory impairment and neuronal loss (Ballatore et al., 2007). Following the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we added the specificity of Fc\u03b3RIIb in \u2018Discussion\u2019 (fourth paragraph)."

We have here used 3 different sources of A\u03b2 oligomers; synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers, naturally secreted A\u03b2 oligomers (7PA2 cells), and A\u03b2 of 3xTg-AD model mice. Although synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers are well-characterized and have been used widely for neurotoxicity, the acting concentration of synthetic A\u03b2 (\u03bcM range) is relatively higher than that in AD brains. Compared to synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers, conditioned medium from 7PA2 cells mainly contains not only A\u03b2 dimers and trimers but also the different pools of A\u03b2 oligomers, including zeta peptide, and show more potent neurotoxic properties (nM range) (Qi-Takahara et al., 2005; Haass and Selkoe, 2007). Moreover, the oligomers generated in 3xTg-AD mouse brain may be more complicated and needs to be identified. Nonetheless, we propose here that Fc\u03b3RIIb plays a crucial role in tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity in vitroand in vivoin response to these species of A\u03b2, probably a certain common species among the different sources of A\u03b2 oligomers.

Thus, we initially hypothesized that and tested whether Fc\u03b3RIIb was phosphorylated by Lyn after treatment with A\u03b2. We found that Lyn was activated (phosphorylation at Tyr 397) by A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> treatment in primary cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1A</a>). In addition, we observed that knockdown of Lyn expression by shRNA suppressed A\u03b2- induced Lyn activation and Fc\u03b3RIIb phosphorylation (tyrosine 273) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1B</a>). To further address the role of Lyn in AD, we also isolated a novel inhibitor of Lyn from virtual library. When we examined the activity of this Lyn inhibitor in vitroand in vivo, we consistently found that the Lyn inhibitor effectively prevented Fc\u03b3RIIb-induced cell death (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1C</a>) and A\u03b2-induced Lyn activation and Fc\u03b3RIIb phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1D</a>). Moreover, Lyn inhibitor reduced the A\u03b2-induced cell death in primary cortical neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1E</a>). Taken together, Lyn is required for Fc\u03b3RIIb phosphorylation at Tyr273 for A\u03b2 neurotoxicity. We have actually prepared these results together with other data of in vivotests using AD models as a separate issue, and are thus sorry to say that we would like to show these results only to reviewers.

We previously demonstrated that ER stress is elicited by the interaction between A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> and Fc\u03b3RIIb, and is responsible for A\u03b2 neurotoxicity (Kam et al., 2013). Thus, we decided to examine the gap among SHIP2, ER stress, and GSK3\u03b2. To determine the relationship between PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (a SHIP2 product) and ER stress, we first analyzed the alteration of GRP78, a typical marker of unfolded protein response (UPR), following the delivery of various phosphoinositides into primary cortical neurons. Among the phosphoinositides, we found that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> only increased the level of GRP78. We also found that PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> abolished the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at Ser9 (GSK3\u03b2 activation) and increased tau hyperphosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In addition, we found that treatment with ER stress inhibitors, such as 4-PBA and Salubrinal, a chemical chaperone and an eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation inhibitor, respectively, apparently attenuated PtdIns(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>-induced GSK3\u03b2 activation and tau phosphorylation with some different efficacy (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The different efficacy of these two inhibitors on GSK3\u03b2 and tau phosphorylation might reflect a way of their inhibition of ER stress and tau phosphorylation by kinases. These results suggest that GSK3\u03b2 is activated by SHIP2 product through ER stress to phosphorylate tau. Further, treatment with AS1949490, a SHIP2 inhibitor, or infection with lentivirus carrying <i>Ship2</i> shRNA blocked A\u03b2-induced GSK3\u03b2 activation and tau hyperphosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C, D</a>), again confirming our proposal that activation of SHIP2 elicits ER stress to activate GSK3\u03b2 and subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation.

Therefore, the impact of Fc\u03b3RIIb KO on tau pathology in 3X TG mice can be also mediated by reduced microglial activation (cell autonomous effects vs non-autonomous effects). Did the authors check microglial activation and cytokine levels in these mice (WT 3XTG vs. KO 3Xtg)? Moreover, have the authors looked at whether Fc\u03b3RIIb plays a role in sensing A\u03b2 in microglial cells?</i> "

However, as you known well, generation of neuron-specific knockout (nsKO) mice of Fc\u03b3RIIb and of Fc\u03b3RIIb nsKO/3x AD double transgenic mice will take too long time (3 more years). Thus, as an alternative approach, we generated a dominant negative mutant of Fc\u03b3RIIb (Fc\u03b3RIIb DN; Fc\u03b3RIIb-\u0394Cyto) lacking its cytoplasmic region (a.a. 232-300) and thus unable to transmit the signal into cells, and confirmed its protective activity in A\u03b2-induced neuronal cell death after its transient expression in neuronal cells (data not shown). We then generated a transgenic mouse expressing Fc\u03b3RIIb- \u0394Cyto-HA under <i>CamKII\u03b1</i> promoter, which drives neuron-specific expression of the transgene (Mayford et al., 1996) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 4A</a>). We confirmed apparent but low expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb-\u0394Cyto-HA in the hippocampus and cortex of the transgenic mice (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 4B</a>). To address neuropathic effect Fc\u03b3RIIb in AD model mice, we next crossed the mice with 3xTg-AD model mice to generate 3xTg- AD/Fc\u03b3RIIb-\u0394Cyto-HA double transgenic mice (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 4C</a>). The behavior tests of the mice showed that neuronal expression of Fc\u03b3RIIb-\u0394Cyto-HA inhibited memory impairments of 3xTg-AD model mice in Y-maze, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 4D</a>). These results are essentially similar with the results observed in 3xTg-AD/Fc\u03b3RIIb KO double transgenic mice, and suggest that neuronal function of Fc\u03b3RIIb is critical for the memory impairments in the AD model mice. As we mentioned above, these results together with those of neuron-enriched Fc\u03b3RIIb2 isoform are included in other manuscript and are thus presented only here to provide more convincing evidence to reviewer."

To confirm this result of cell viability, we additionally determined their neurotoxicity using other cell viability assay in HT22 cells. We observed similar results as those mentioned above (<a href=\"#fig13\">Author response image 7</a>)."
