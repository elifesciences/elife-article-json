We have employed cysteine labelling and linkage analysis to the full length of Bak in mitochondria. This comprehensive survey showed that in each Bak dimer the N-termini are fully solvent-exposed and mobile, the core is highly structured, and the C-termini are flexible but restrained by their contact with the membrane. Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement. Together, our data show that Bak dimers form disordered clusters to generate lipidic pores. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the observed structural heterogeneity of the apoptotic pore."

We have employed cysteine labelling and linkage analysis to the full length of Bak in mitochondria. This comprehensive survey showed that in each Bak dimer the N-termini are fully solvent-exposed and mobile, the core is highly structured, and the C-termini are flexible but restrained by their contact with the membrane. Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement. Together, our data show that Bak dimers form disordered clusters to generate lipidic pores. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the observed structural heterogeneity of the apoptotic pore."

The results show that during apoptosis, Bak dimers contact each other at several different places (rather than at one or two places) to assemble into disorderly, ever-changing clusters. Based on these observations, Uren et al. suggest that the enlarging clusters stress the membrane and cause pores to form."

Both proteins comprise nine \u03b1-helices that adopt a globular fold in the non-activated state (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Moldoveanu et al., 2006</a>). Non-activated Bak is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane via the \u03b19-helix forming a transmembrane domain (<a href=\"#bib26\">Iyer et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, non-activated Bax is largely cytosolic due to binding of \u03b19 to its own hydrophobic groove (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wolter et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gahl et al., 2014</a>). Following binding of BH3-only proteins, both Bak and Bax undergo similar conformation changes including \u03b11 dissociation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Weber et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alsop et al., 2015</a>) and separation of the \u2018latch\u2019 domain (\u03b16-\u03b18) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Czabotar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brouwer et al., 2014</a>) from the \u2018core\u2019 domain (\u03b12-\u03b15).

Although there is structural information for Bak and Bax homodimers, no structures of higher order oligomers of Bak or Bax have been resolved. Upon an apoptotic stimulus, Bak and Bax have been shown to coalesce into clusters at the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nechushtan et al., 2001</a>) and small clusters of Bax have been implicated in the rapid release of cytochrome <i>c</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhou and Chang, 2008</a>). The availability of full-length recombinant Bax makes biochemical assays more amenable for Bax than for Bak. Thus, recent studies using artificial membranes and recombinant Bax have detected Bax complexes of various shapes and sizes with fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Subburaj et al., 2015</a>) and cryo-electron microscopy has revealed Bax protein exclusively associated with pore edges (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kuwana et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy has shown Bax can be found in ring-like structures, arcs and clusters at the mitochondrial outer membrane of apoptotic cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gro\u00dfe et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Salvador-Gallego et al., 2016</a>), although the orientation of Bax dimers in these structures could not be visualised. Higher order oligomers of both Bak and Bax vary in size when assessed by gel filtration, blue native PAGE or linkage (<a href=\"#bib20\">George et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dewson et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, linkage studies have identified several points at which dimers might associate, including interactions at \u03b1-helices 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dewson et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aluvila et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bleicken et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gahl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iyer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mandal et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>). Critically, it is not clear whether any of these interaction sites are required for dimer-dimer association and assembly of the apoptotic pore. Here, we compare linkages through the full length of Bak in cells and show that dimers associate in a disordered and lipid-mediated fashion."

This work complemented our previous cysteine-accessibility analyses of Bak \u03b15, \u03b16 and \u03b19 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Westphal et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iyer et al., 2015</a>), by analyzing the Bak N-terminus and additional residues in the \u03b12-\u03b15 core and C-terminus. The two native cysteine residues of human Bak (C14 and C166) were first substituted with serine to generate Bak Cys null (Bak\u0394Cys, i.e. C14S/C166S), and then a single cysteine residue substituted at several positions throughout the molecule. Each Bak variant was stably expressed in <i>Bak<sup>-/-</sup>Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and tested for function (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).\u00a0To convert Bak to the activated oligomeric form, membrane fractions enriched for mitochondria were incubated with tBid, as previously (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dewson et al., 2008</a>). To label solvent-exposed cysteine residues, membrane fractions were treated with the thiol-specific labelling reagent IASD (4-acetamido-4'-((iodoacetyl) amino)stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid). Two negative sulfonate charges prevent IASD from accessing cysteine in hydrophobic environments (such as the mitochondrial outer membrane or the hydrophobic protein core), and also allow isoelectric focusing (IEF) to resolve IASD-labelled and IASD-unlabelled Bak (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tran et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Westphal et al., 2014</a>). We assessed each cysteine-substituted Bak variant for labelling before, during or after incubation with recombinant tBid or tBid<sup>Bax</sup>, a tBid variant containing the Bax BH3 domain (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hockings et al., 2015</a>), that activates Bak analogous to tBid, as well as a control not exposed to IASD and another fully exposed to labelling by denaturation and membrane solubilisation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The approach thus monitors solvent-exposure of the residue as non-activated Bak converts to oligomeric Bak, and may detect transient exposure during these conformational changes."

Those residues remained exposed following incubation with tBid. Four residues in \u03b11 (R36C, Y41C, Q44C and Q47C) that were not fully accessible before tBid treatment became exposed following incubation with tBid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). An additional \u03b11 residue, V39C, also showed a tendency for increased labelling. These changes suggest that the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop separates from \u03b11, consistent with increased labelling of A54C in the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop that opposes \u03b11.

A summary of current and previous cysteine labelling data for the full length of the Bak protein\u00a0is\u00a0shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and\u00a0supports the following picture of Bak dimer topology\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Certain cysteine residues placed in \u03b12 became transiently exposed, consistent with exposure of the BH3 domain followed\u00a0by its burial in the hydrophobic groove in the \u03b12-\u03b15 core dimer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), as predicted by the published structure of the Bak BH3:groove homodimer (4U2V) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brouwer et al., 2014</a>). Cysteine substitutions on the exposed surface of \u03b13 were successfully labelled with IASD before, during and after tBid treatment. In contrast, two buried residues in \u03b14 were refractory to IASD labelling throughout. In the \u03b14-\u03b15 linker region, although I123C became more exposed following activation, it was still incompletely labelled. This pattern of I123C labelling may reflect initial loss of contact between I123C and two hydrophobic residues in the \u2018latch\u2019 (I167 and W170), followed by shallow membrane insertion of I123C, as it resides on the hydrophobic face of the Bak dimer core. Partial labelling of this residue is consistent with shallow membrane insertion as IASD can label cysteine moieties up to 7.5 \u00c5 into the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gr\u00fcndling et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Westphal et al., 2014</a>). Within the C-termini, the profile of IASD-labelling was consistent with the amphipathic \u03b16 helix lying in-plane on the membrane surface (<a href=\"#bib61\">Westphal et al., 2014</a>) and the hydrophobic \u03b19 forming the sole transmembrane domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

In the course of these structural rearrangements, some regions of Bak display changes in solvent exposure (such as \u03b11 which becomes more exposed, or \u03b12 which is transiently exposed) whilst others remain buried throughout (such as the \u03b19 transmembrane anchor)."

To directly compare reported linkages, and to analyse the full length of Bak, we used our expanded library of single-cysteine Bak variants. Each substituted cysteine was tested for the ability to disulphide bond to the same residue in a neighbouring Bak molecule (or to a cysteine in a nearby protein) upon addition of the oxidant copper phenanthroline (CuPhe). Linkage between Bak molecules was indicated by the presence of 2x complexes corresponding to twice the molecular weight of the Bak monomer on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. It is important to note that these 2x complexes are the product of CuPhe-mediated linkage between Bak molecules and do not necessarily represent the native Bak BH3:groove dimer that will form even in the absence of linkage, as shown below on BNP. This system of single cysteine substitutions offers an elegant screening approach for assessing the proximity of single cysteine residues in neighbouring molecules in a point-to-point manner, but does not identify interaction surfaces where a single cysteine substitution may not contact its counterpart (See Discussion)."

Furthermore, disulphide linkage to proteins other than Bak resulted in Bak complexes larger than the 2x species and was observed for cysteine substitutions in the \u03b12-\u03b13 helices (D84C, R87C), \u03b14-\u03b15 loop (S121C, N124C), \u03b18-\u03b19 linker (G186C, I188C) and C-terminal end of \u03b19 (V205C).

The Bak BH3:groove interaction <i>within</i> dimers is an extensive protein-protein interface and is stable in 1% digitonin on BNP while the interaction between dimers is not (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). Thus oligomerised Bak migrates only as BH3:groove dimers on BNP. Addition of CuPhe to mitochondrial extracts prior to BNP can stabilise high order complexes on BNP and does so by cysteine-mediated linkage <i>between</i> dimers (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). Thus, if the\u00a0addition of CuPhe at the end of the mitochondrial incubation generated 4x and greater complexes on BNP, we conclude that the linkage was <i>between</i> dimers. If larger complexes were absent and dimers predominated on BNP, any linkage was <i>within</i> the dimer. Thus, parallel examination of CuPhe linked Bak species on BNP and non-reducing SDS PAGE permits differentiation of three conditions: the\u00a0linkage <i>within</i> the dimer, linkage <i>between</i> dimers, or no cysteine linkage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

We simulated the membrane as a flat surface (i.e. a 2D plane). Each subunit representing a Bak dimer, was evenly distributed on a geometric grid imposed on this surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and to avoid edge effects the grid was wrapped onto a torus. A hexagonal grid, rather than square or triangular, was selected to best represent the close packing of objects on a plane with the greatest degrees of freedom. The linkage potential of each subunit in the grid was based on the known linkage constraints of the V61C residue; i.e. linkage occurred exclusively and efficiently between dimers and each dimer could make at most two cysteine linkages, but possibly only 1 or 0 linkages if no other free cysteines were available. Furthermore, the simulation allowed linkages only between immediately adjacent dimers, based on the short 4 \u00c5 limit of the CuPhe-mediated disulphide linkage and the known dimensions of the Bak dimer. Thus, each hexagonal subunit had the freedom to link with at most two neighbouring hexagons, in any direction, and this random linkage between neighbouring dimers would result in a mixture of linkage states including double, single or no linkages. With this hexagonal grid, four types of double linkage were possible; opposite, obtuse, acute or reciprocal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). An equal probability for each of the double linkages (opposite, obtuse, acute or reciprocal) was imposed, to reflect close but random packing of dimers at the membrane. Furthermore, the simulation was allowed to proceed to complete linkage of available cysteine residues to reflect the near-complete linkage of V61C:V61C\u2019.

In the first test, we performed mitochondrial experiments in which\u00a0~50% of the Bak molecules lacked cysteine residues. In those experiments, Bak V61C was co-expressed with Bak Cys-null that was FLAG-tagged (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, upper panel). As expected, only half of the Bak molecules could link to 2x species after activation by tBid and induction of linkage (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, middle panel, lane 4). In addition, all molecules formed BH3:groove dimers after incubation with tBid, as shown by BNP, but the capture of higher order oligomers mediated by cysteine-linkage was greatly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, lower panel, lane 4; quantified in <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In simulations of this system, we assumed an\u00a0equal expression of V61C and the Cys null variants, as indicated by western blot analysis. We also assumed that this population of monomers forms dimers in Mendelian proportions: 25% of dimers are V61C doublets and can link twice, 50% are V61C:Cys null and can link once, and the remaining 25% are Cys null doublets and cannot link (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). The simulation output (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>) reflected that of the BNP densitometry (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) in terms of more dimers and fewer\u00a0&gt;10x complexes, indicating the simulation was generalisable to a different distribution of linkage-competent Bak molecules."

As noted above, because T62C, Q66C, S68C, and S69C substitutions were closer than V61C to the constrained \u03b12-\u03b15 core, they did not link efficiently (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> lower, quantified in <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). To simulate this steric hindrance caused by a shorter distance from the constrained core, an <i>edge blocking</i> effect was introduced to the model; every edge of every hexagon was prohibited from having a link form across it with this probability for the duration of each simulation. As the edge blocking probability increased from 0 to 0.75, linkage between dimers decreased to generate patterns comparable to BNP analysis of these core-proximal residues (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Thus, modification of a single parameter could describe linkage of residues closer than V61C to the Bak dimer core. The adaptability of this simple simulation further illustrated the strength and feasibility of our model of random Bak dimer aggregation at the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis."

The N-extremity (~70 residues N-terminal to \u03b12) becomes fully solvent-exposed as shown by IASD labelling, and fully mobile as indicated by linkage, consistent with exposure of N-terminal cleavage sites and antibody epitopes in \u03b11 and the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop (<a href=\"#bib22\">Griffiths et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Weber et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alsop et al., 2015</a>). As discussed previously (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alsop et al., 2015</a>), several parts of the \u03b11 region are able to unfold, as they bind antibodies that recognise linear epitopes. Failure of the N-extremity to re-engage in protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions argues that it does not contribute to the assembly of dimers.

Notably, however, a dominant protein-protein interface between dimers was not evident. Rather, linkage between the membrane-associated regions could be detected at many positions, arguing for a disordered arrangement. As our single-cysteine scanning approach can only examine the homotypic pairing of cysteine residues, it remains possible that heterotypic pairing of cysteine substitutions may detect a more complex protein interface between dimers, as seen for linkage at the Bak BH3:groove interface (M71C:K113C, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dewson et al., 2008</a>). However, in support of the notion that there is no dominant protein interface between dimers, the interaction between Bak dimers is lost when digitonin is added, in contrast to the BH3:groove interface which persists in the presence of digitonin. Moreover, the\u00a0lability of dimer-dimer association was highlighted by the capacity of Bax to intermingle with pre-formed Bak dimers. Each of Bcl<sub>xL</sub>, Mcl-1 and Bax localised to mitochondria with similar efficiency, however a critical feature of Bax is that, like Bak, following activation by tBid it collapses onto the membrane surface to form homodimers (<a href=\"#bib61\">Westphal et al., 2014</a>). The large membrane surface occupied by Bax dimers, together with disturbance of the outer leaflet, may explain why Bax, but not the prosurvival proteins, could disrupt Bak dimer-dimer association in this assay."

                        "text": "A variety of biophysical and imaging techniques have been deployed to better understand how Bak (or Bax) dimers associate, yet it remains unclear. Well-characterised pore-forming proteins typically reveal an extensive interface between subunits that facilitates pore formation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Song et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mueller et al., 2009</a>). Versions of this regular architecture have recently been considered for Bak and Bax as a closed circuit of dimers lining a circular pore (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aluvila et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bleicken et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brouwer et al., 2014</a>). In contrast to these hypothetical linear dimer arrangements, our biochemical data revealed that there is no single dominant interface between the \u03b12-\u03b15 core dimers and support the random collision of Bak dimers in two dimensions at the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis. Here a novel approach of mathematical modelling was used to simulate linkage between Bak dimers and showed the feasibility of random dimer association. For example, as the V61C residue linked only between Bak dimers, and did so very efficiently, this provided a powerful tool for testing different arrangements of Bak dimers on the membrane. A minimalist set of assumptions were adopted for stochastic simulations of V61C:V61C\u2019 linkage between Bak dimers: linkage is complete and irreversible but occurs only between dimers; only two linkages are possible per dimer; and neighbouring dimers can only link if both have a free cysteine available for disulphide bonding. Indeed, the simulation showed good concordance with different sets of linkage data obtained from fully oligomerised Bak in mitochondria. From this, we conclude that Bak dimers are closely packed and aggregate with a random orientation."

However, in our model system, preventing\u00a0~50% Bak from locating to mitochondria prevented pore formation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ferrer et al., 2012</a>) argues that, of the whole population of Bak surveyed in our linkage studies, at least 50% is required for a pore to form somewhere in the mitochondrion. Thus, the patterns observed in our linkage assays are at least 50% representative of Bak engaged in driving pore formation."

                        "text": "A disordered cluster of dimers is reminiscent of the \u2018carpet\u2019 model of pore formation by peptides (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib21\">Gilbert [2016]</a>). In this model, amphipathic antimicrobial peptides such as melittin lie parallel to the membrane plane, with accumulation causing strain in the outer layer of the membrane until at higher concentrations the lamellar structure of the membrane is destabilised and non-lamellar lipidic pores form (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2013</a>). Like an amphipathic peptide, the Bak and Bax \u03b12-\u03b15 core dimers and \u03b16-helices penetrate the outer leaflet of the bilayer (<a href=\"#bib9\">Czabotar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aluvila et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brouwer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Westphal et al., 2014</a>). While very high concentrations of antimicrobial peptides can disintegrate membranes in a detergent-like manner (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2008</a>), this does not appear to occur with near-physiological levels of Bak and Bax. Antimicrobial peptides also have membrane thinning attributes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2003</a>), as reported for Bax (<a href=\"#bib49\">Satsoura et al., 2012</a>). Satsoura and colleagues discuss how membrane deformation by Bax may promote oligomerisation mediated not by protein:protein interactions but by long-range changes in membrane tension (<a href=\"#bib49\">Satsoura et al., 2012</a>). For example, the\u00a0attractive forces between membrane wrapped particles can arise purely as a result of membrane forces (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reynwar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">van der Wel et al., 2016</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib27\">Katira et al., 2016</a>). Thus, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, we hypothesise that Bak dimers penetrate the outer leaflet to attract further dimers and in doing so increase the membrane disturbance. Enlarging clusters then destabilise the membrane sufficiently to form lipidic pores that release apoptogenic factors. The pores may then be stabilised by parts of the Bak and Bax dimers rearranging to line the pore (<a href=\"#bib56\">Terrones et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Garc\u00eda-S\u00e1ez, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Westphal et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kuwana et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mandal et al., 2016</a>), consistent with the lipidic pore model first proposed for Bax (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basa\u00f1ez et al., 1999</a>). Hence, our model for the disordered clustering of Bak dimers provides a holistic molecular explanation for the detection of Bak and Bax in a variety of formations including complete rings, arcs, lines and clusters (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gro\u00dfe et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nasu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Salvador-Gallego et al., 2016</a>)."

We have described molecular tools that can precisely monitor the aggregation of Bak dimers in cells, and could also be used to examine how the pro-survival proteins inhibit Bak oligomerisation, which may impact on the development of cancer therapies that target these proteins. Critically, the combination of linkage data and mathematical simulations described here has offered, for the first time, insight into the\u00a0assembly of the apoptotic pore with single molecule resolution."

Horseradish peroxidase conjugated IgG secondary antibodies were used; anti-rabbit (4010\u201305, AdB Serotec, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_609701\">AB_609701</a>), anti-rat (3010\u201305, AdB Serotec, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_619911\">AB_619911</a>) and anti-mouse (1010\u201305, AdB Serotec, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_609673\">AB_609673</a>). Immobilised horseradish peroxidase was detected with Luminata Forte western HRP substrate (WBLUF0500, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), images captured with the ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA) and signal intensity measured with Image Lab 4.1 software (Bio-RAD)."

The lookup table (LUT) was inverted and images rotated 90 degrees. Using the rectangular selection tool, a box was drawn around the lane of interest to encompass the full range of Bak signal (with fixed dimensions of 370 \u00d7 50 pixels). This box was then measured with the Dynamic ROI profiler plugin. Plot values were exported for analysis in Prism (ver 6.0f, Graphpad Software Co., La Jolla, CA, USA), and normalised to a fraction of the total intensity for each lane of interest. A clearer representation of multiple replicate plots of lane intensity was achieved by a linear rescaling of each replicate's horizontal axis so that the maximum corresponding to Bak 4x species, and the characteristic minimum (which is a highly reproducible artefact of our Bak BNP western blots) at\u00a0~720 kDa, coincided across replicates."

We continue until no neighbouring dimers have cysteines available for linkage, to reflect complete linkage of V61C:V61C\u2019. We consider a collection of Bak dimers on a two-dimensional surface (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Dimers are arranged on a hexagonal (or square) grid, and linkage is permitted in all directions. Each dimer has two cysteines available for disulphide linkage to a neighbouring dimer. We simulate such that linkage is allowed in all directions with equal probability. Reduced linkage efficiency was modelled by introducing an edge blocking effect. Every edge between neighbouring hexagonal cells was flagged as eligible for a disulphide bond, independently at random with probability <i>p</i> constant across all edges in a given simulation, for p=0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. We modelled the experimental scenario where Bak dimers were formed from a mixture of equal amounts of V61C and cys-null monomers by assigning each dimer either zero, one or two available cysteines with probability 0.25, 0.5 and 0.25 respectively (see <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>)."

Following previous work, the authors used an expanded set of monocysteine BAK mutants in IASD labeling and cysteine crosslinking experiments to extract new information about the topology and multimerization surfaces of cBID-activated BAK. In addition, the authors used a novel approach of mathematical modeling to simulate linkage between BAK dimers and showed feasibility of random dimer association into high-order oligomers. Based on these collective approaches, Uren et al. elaborate a model where BAK dimers aggregate into disordered clusters lacking a dominant protein-protein interface to elicit MOMP."

First of all, following previous work by this and other groups it should be straightforward to discriminate between membrane-inserted and protein buried residues, at least for a few key residues (see below). Second, the author\u00b4s conclusion that the entire BAK helix 1 becomes solvent-exposed upon BAK activation primarily relies on the finding that several hydrophilic sites within BAK helix 1 (R36, Y41, Q44 and Q47) show increased IASD labelling after cBID treatment. To firmly establish this point, the IASD labelling test should be extended to additional hydrophobic sites in the BAK helix 1 (such as V27, F35, V39, and F40), because these hydrophobic sites display the highest potential for becoming buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane or a proteinaceous structure. Similarly, additional hydrophobic sites in BAK helix 2 (I81, I85) and BAK helix 4 (F111, T112) should also be tested for IASD labelling to unambiguously establish that cBID-activated BAK adopts a BH3-into-groove dimeric structure at the MOM, as the authors claim. This is also critical, because Zhang et al. recently reported that active BAX adopt an helix 2-helix 3-helix 4 dimeric structure rather than a BH3-into-groove structure at the MOM by analysing analogous sites in BAX helix 2 (I66, L70) and BAX helix 4 (F92, F93). In addition to BAK helix 1, extending the IASD-labelling studies to more hydrophobic sites in the BAK helix 7-8 region also appears highly desirable."

However, the most important aspect of Bax, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1 behavior is that a significant portion was able to associate with the membrane fraction, and thus test whether Bak clusters are dynamic. Of these, only Bax was able to intermingle with pre-formed Bak dimers. We did not intend to explore the nuanced interactions between pro-survival proteins and Bak dimers in this work, rather we added Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1 as a contrast to recombinant Bax. We were confident that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, Mcl-1 and Bax would all localise to the mitochondrial outer membrane, but appreciated that they might have different properties once at the membrane, and this is evident in this assay."

Second, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> has the transmembrane domain which may insert without any interaction with other Bcl-2 family members. Third, Mcl-1 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> may bind to activated Bak which is inserted in the membrane, although this population is likely to be minimal as Bak is fully dimerised prior to the addition of Mcl-1 or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (as seen on BNP, e.g. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, lane 2)."
