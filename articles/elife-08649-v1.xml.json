Here, we identify <i>C. elegans</i> NOCA-1 as a protein with homology to vertebrate ninein. NOCA-1 contributes to the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in multiple tissues. In the larval epidermis, NOCA-1 functions redundantly with the minus end protection factor Patronin/PTRN-1 to assemble a circumferential microtubule array essential for worm growth and morphogenesis. Controlled degradation of a \u03b3-tubulin complex subunit in this tissue revealed that \u03b3-tubulin acts with NOCA-1 in parallel to Patronin/PTRN-1. In the germline, NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin co-localize at the cell surface, and inhibiting either leads to a microtubule assembly defect. \u03b3-tubulin targets independently of NOCA-1, but NOCA-1 targeting requires \u03b3-tubulin when a non-essential putatively palmitoylated cysteine is mutated. These results show that NOCA-1 acts with \u03b3-tubulin to assemble non-centrosomal arrays in multiple tissues and highlight functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin protein families."
