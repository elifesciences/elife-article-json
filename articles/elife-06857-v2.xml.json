To understand how MITF regulates transcription, we used tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to define a comprehensive MITF interactome identifying novel cofactors involved in transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromatin organisation. We show that MITF interacts with a PBAF chromatin remodelling complex comprising BRG1 and CHD7. BRG1 is essential for melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and for normal melanocyte development in vivo. MITF and SOX10 actively recruit BRG1 to a set of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) at active enhancers. Combinations of MITF, SOX10, TFAP2A, and YY1 bind between two BRG1-occupied nucleosomes thus defining both a signature of transcription factors essential for the melanocyte lineage and a specific chromatin organisation of the regulatory elements they occupy. BRG1 also regulates the dynamics of MITF genomic occupancy. MITF-BRG1 interplay thus plays an essential role in transcription regulation in melanoma."

To understand how MITF regulates transcription, we used tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to define a comprehensive MITF interactome identifying novel cofactors involved in transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromatin organisation. We show that MITF interacts with a PBAF chromatin remodelling complex comprising BRG1 and CHD7. BRG1 is essential for melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and for normal melanocyte development in vivo. MITF and SOX10 actively recruit BRG1 to a set of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) at active enhancers. Combinations of MITF, SOX10, TFAP2A, and YY1 bind between two BRG1-occupied nucleosomes thus defining both a signature of transcription factors essential for the melanocyte lineage and a specific chromatin organisation of the regulatory elements they occupy. BRG1 also regulates the dynamics of MITF genomic occupancy. MITF-BRG1 interplay thus plays an essential role in transcription regulation in melanoma."

This investigation found many new protein partners for MITF, including proteins involved in DNA damage, repair, and replication. MITF also associates with two proteins\u2014one of which is called BRG1\u2014that are involved in modifying how tightly DNA is packaged inside cells. DNA wrapped around proteins is known as chromatin, and if chromatin is tightly packed, the genes in that stretch of DNA cannot be easily accessed or activated."

Furthermore, Laurette, Strub et al. report that BRG1 binds to many such elements in a characteristic manner, in which two BRG1 proteins flank the stretch of DNA bound by MITF and several other key DNA-binding proteins that together regulate many aspects of melanocyte and melanoma cell physiology."

The BPTF, SMARCA1 (SNF2L), SMARCA5 (SNF2H), and RBBP4 components of the NURF chromatin-remodelling complex associated with MITF specifically in the chromatin fraction. Components of the DNA damage response machinery including XRCC5 and XRCC6 (Ku80 and Ku70), DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC), BRCA2 as well as MSH2 and MSH6 were identified along with the HECT domain-containing E3-ligase HERC2, previously implicated in DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2010</a>), and UBR5 a second HECT domain-containing E3-ligase with functions in both DNA repair and transcription (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cojocaru et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gudjonsson et al., 2012</a>). NEURL4, a known HERC2-interacting protein (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Hakim et al., 2012</a>), was also found along with the de-ubiquitinase enzymes USP7 and USP11 that were preferentially represented in the SNE. In contrast, USP13 shown to regulate MITF stability (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>) was not detected in our experiments. Several interactions were verified by immunoblot as HERC2, BRG1, USP7, USP11, XRCC5, and XRCC6 were detected in the F-H-MITF immunoprecipitations from the soluble nuclear fraction, but not in the untagged controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), with enrichment of USP7 and USP11 in the SNE compared to the CAE and the selective presence of HERC2 in the SNE."

We identified BRG1 (SMARCA4) as well as the PBRM1 (BAF180), SMARCC2 (BAF170), SMARCD2 (BAF60B), and ACTL6A (BAF53A) subunits along with CHD7 reported to associate with BRG1 in human neural crest cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bajpai et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

To investigate BRG1 complex composition in 501Mel cells, extracts were precipitated with an anti-BRG1 antibody showing co-precipitation of BRG1 with BAF200, BAF155, BAF53A, BAF180, and BAF170, whereas BAF60B and BAF250B were not co-precipitated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Peptides for BAF60B were detected in the MITF interactome, but this subunit did not associate with BRG1 in 501Mel cells, while BAF60A co-precipitated with BRG1, suggesting that MITF interacts with BAF60B independently from the BRG1 complex. The MITF-interacting complex also comprises CHD7 as seen by the reciprocal co-precipitation of BRG1 and CHD7 and their co-precipitation with MITF (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>).

These observations are also consistent with previous reports showing that SOX10 promotes melanoma cell proliferation and that its loss leads to senescence (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cronin et al., 2013</a>)."

BRG1 knockdown in these cells repressed endogenous MITF expression, but not ectopic 3HA-MITF (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Nevertheless, BRG1 silencing elicited a phenotype similar to 501Mel cells characterised by arrested proliferation, and morphological changes. Many MITF target genes were similarly repressed by BRG1 silencing in both 501Mel and Cl8 cells, while SASP components were induced (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Together, these data show that BRG1 is essential for MITF expression and that it acts as a cofactor for MITF since ectopic MITF in the Cl8 cells does not activate target genes expression in its absence."

Almost 6000 SOX10-occupied sites were detected, but unlike MITF they were mainly located at distal regulatory elements with only around 80 sites at the proximal promoter.

Recognition motifs for TCF/LEF, MITF, and TFAP2A were also enriched at these sites. Genes associated with these sites were enriched in several ontology terms associated with cell motion/adhesion, cell morphogenesis and organisation (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). We integrated the SOX10 data with that of MITF, BRG1, and H3K27ac.

The above data define a specific organisation of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) where MITF alone or with SOX10 bind between two BRG1-bound nucleosomes. This analysis also defined 1929 MAREs at active melanocyte/melanoma enhancer elements associated with 1511 genes involved in pigmentation, cell motility and adhesion, actin cytoskeleton organisation, and signalling (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>)."

At the <i>TYR</i> locus, siMITF silencing led to the specific loss of BRG1 at a promoter proximal site (* in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), whereas at the upstream site where MITF co-localized with SOX10 little change was observed (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). In contrast, siSOX10 and consequent loss of both SOX10 and MITF (see above), diminished BRG1 at all sites. Interestingly, BRG1 occupancy was observed throughout the region between these sites. siSOX10 silencing led to BRG1 loss across the entire region suggesting that it is recruited to the SOX10/MITF sites and then may spread across the locus. A similar situation was observed at the <i>CIT</i> locus encoding a MITF-regulated gene essential for cell cycle progression, with two downstream regulatory elements comprising MITF and SOX10 sites (* and arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). At both sites, BRG1 was strongly reduced upon siMITF or siSOX10 silencing. A global analysis identified sites showing a strong and preferential loss of BRG1 following, siSOX10 (clusters B and G\u2013H, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), siMITF (clusters E and F) or both, (cluster D), defining sites where MITF and SOX10 independently or cooperatively recruit BRG1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>).

BRG1 knockout in developing mouse melanocytes in vivo leads to complete loss of pigmentation and immunostaining failed to reveal the presence of Sox10 or Dct expressing cells in the hair follicle of the mutant animals.

The first is a subset of TSS, where BRG1 occupies the nucleosomes flanking the NDR with the Pol II pause site located immediately 5\u2032 of the +1 nucleosome. This specific positioning of BRG1 at the TSS was not noted in several previous ChIP-seq studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">De et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Euskirchen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ho et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Morris et al., 2014</a>), however, <a href=\"#bib49\">Tolstorukov et al.

At many of these sites the BRG1-bound nucleosomes are also marked by H3K27ac, thus defining MAREs active in regulating melanocyte lineage gene expression. As SOX10, YY1, TFAP2A, and ETS1 all have important roles in melanocytes and/or melanoma, the MAREs identified here define a combinatorial signature of TFs critical for gene regulation in this lineage (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This is further underlined by the recent finding that a combination of MITF, SOX10, and PAX3 can reprogram fibroblasts into functional melanocytes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Ondrusova et al. reported an MITF-independent pro-survival role for BRG1 in melanoma cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ondru\u0161ov\u00e1 et al., 2013</a>). This observation is in agreement with our findings that BRG1 silencing affects expression of many more genes than MITF and that the binding motifs for a variety of factors other than MITF are enriched at BRG1-occupied sites. BRG1 is likely therefore to act as a cofactor for many other TFs accounting for its MITF-independent functions."

Such an organisation has been previously proposed based on extensive ChIP-seq profiling by the Encode consortium showing that TF binding sites are often combinatorial and correspond to GC-rich, DNaseI hypersensitive NDRs flanked by two positioned nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Our data support this idea through the identification of combinatorial MAREs and they extend it by showing that the nucleosomes flanking the TF binding sites are often bound by BRG1 and marked with H3K27ac (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These regulatory elements show an analogous organisation to that of the TSS that also comprise a NDR encompassing variable numbers of TF binding sites and the PIC, flanked by BRG1-bound nucleosomes. Although examples of association between BRG1 and TFs have been previously described (<a href=\"#bib50\">Trotter and Archer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Reisman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Euskirchen et al., 2011</a>), this specific configuration of BRG1 binding to nucleosomes flanking the TF binding sites has not been generally recognised. In yeast, it has however been reported that TF binding sites are rather flanked by nucleosomes bound by ISWI and CHD remodellers (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zentner et al., 2013</a>)."

Moreover, we show that MITF associates with PBAF in the soluble nuclear fraction suggesting that they form a complex in the nucleoplasm and are recruited simultaneously to the chromatin to create the NDRs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>)."

In contrast, we observed that MITF occupancy of many co-occupied sites either shows little change or is increased following siBRG1 silencing suggesting that BRG1 regulates the dynamics of MITF binding. TF binding to chromatin is often extremely dynamic with ChIP capturing only a snapshot of their occupancy (<a href=\"#bib54\">Voss and Hager, 2014</a>). The increased MITF occupancy seen in ChIP upon BRG1 silencing suggests an increase in its time of residence at occupied sites."

                                "text": "Several mechanisms may explain the increased MITF binding upon BRG1 loss. The human genome comprises many more consensus E-box elements than are occupied by MITF. The excess of consensus as well as degenerate E-boxes could potentially act as a sink thus limiting the pool of MITF for binding to functional sites. One function of BRG1-driven dynamics may therefore be to limit MITF sequestration at non-functional sites and ensure a pool of MITF for binding to functional sites. Alternatively, BRG1 may be required to establish the NDRs for MITF binding, for example after mitosis, or at specific stages of the cell cycle. As siBRG1 cells are post-mitotic and senescent, the increased MITF occupancy may reflect a new steady state where MITF remains more stably bound to the NDRs established while BRG1 was still present compared to cycling cells where the NDRs are established and erased in a more dynamic manner. Irrespective of the underlying causes, our results indicate that BRG1 regulates dynamic MITF interactions with chromatin."

For antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, within a closed plastic container placed in a boiling waterbath, for 20 min. Sections were permeabilised with 3 \u00d7 5 min 0.1% Triton in PBS, blocked for 1 hr in 5% skim milk in PBS, and incubated overnight in 5% milk with primary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: goat anti-Dct at dilution of 1/1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-10451) and rabbit anti-Sox10, at 1/2000 (Abcam, ab155279). Sections were washed 3 \u00d7 5 min 0.1% Triton in PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa 488 donkey-anti-goat, and Alexa 555 donkey-anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) for 2 hr. Sections were subsequently incubated with 1/2000 Hoechst nuclear stain for 10 min, washed 3 \u00d7 5 min in PBS, dried and mounted with Vectashild."

Thus the difference in the number of affected genes is unlikely to be explained by inefficient BRG1 silencing in Hermes cells. Our results rather suggest that the function of PBAF with BRG1 while critical is less ubiquitous in these cells than in 501Mel. Perhaps other variants of the SWI/SNF complexes with the related BRM subunit also play an important role in gene regulation in these cells. Our RNA-seq data shows that BRM is expressed in Hermes cells and its expression (as well as the genes encoding all other SWI/SNF subunits) is not affected by BRG1 silencing. There is therefore a potential for redundancy in these cells between BRG1 and BRM, although it is important to note that this is not the case in 501Mel cells where BRM is also expressed. Several of the additional comments below are related to this point. In the future it will be important to address this issue, but it is beyond the scope of the present study. We have modified the Discussion to take this issue into account."

However <i>SOX10</i> expression is not affected by BRG1 silencing in Hermes melanocytes in vitro, and is a marker for immature transient amplifying cells, yet there is no Sox10 expression in the mutant hair shafts in vivo.

We showed the BRG1 silencing strongly down-regulates SOX10 expression and that SOX10 is required to activate MITF expression. The second pathway by which BRG1 may act to regulate MITF expression is through MITF auto-regulation. This is suggested by the colocalisation of MITF and BRG1 at H3K27ac marked elements of the MITF locus suggesting that these may be enhancer elements via which MITF may regulate its own expression. Clearly the situation is very different in melanocytes. In melanocytes, SOX10 expression is not reduced by BRG1 silencing and thus may contribute to maintenance of MITF expression. A role for SOX10 in modulating MITF expression in Hermes 3A cells has previously been described by the Ronai lab (Shah et al., 2010). In melanocytes in which BRG1 is silenced, MITF remains expressed, but 30% of the genes regulated by MITF are down-regulated. These data show that part of the MITF-directed gene expression program in melanocytes is co-regulated by BRG1."
