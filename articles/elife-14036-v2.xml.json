                    "text": "In budding yeast, if the spindle becomes mispositioned, cells prevent exit from mitosis by inhibiting the mitotic exit network (MEN). The MEN is a signaling cascade that localizes to spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and activates the phosphatase Cdc14. There are two competing models that explain MEN regulation by spindle position. In the 'zone model', exit from mitosis occurs when a MEN-bearing SPB enters the bud. The 'cMT-bud neck model' posits that cytoplasmic microtubule (cMT)-bud neck interactions prevent MEN activity. Here we find that 1) eliminating cMT\u2013 bud neck interactions does not trigger exit from mitosis and 2) loss of these interactions does not precede Cdc14 activation. Furthermore, using binucleate cells, we show that exit from mitosis occurs when one SPB enters the bud despite the presence of a mispositioned spindle. We conclude that exit from mitosis is triggered by a correctly positioned spindle rather than inhibited by improper spindle position."

                    "text": "In budding yeast, if the spindle becomes mispositioned, cells prevent exit from mitosis by inhibiting the mitotic exit network (MEN). The MEN is a signaling cascade that localizes to spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and activates the phosphatase Cdc14. There are two competing models that explain MEN regulation by spindle position. In the 'zone model', exit from mitosis occurs when a MEN-bearing SPB enters the bud. The 'cMT-bud neck model' posits that cytoplasmic microtubule (cMT)-bud neck interactions prevent MEN activity. Here we find that 1) eliminating cMT\u2013 bud neck interactions does not trigger exit from mitosis and 2) loss of these interactions does not precede Cdc14 activation. Furthermore, using binucleate cells, we show that exit from mitosis occurs when one SPB enters the bud despite the presence of a mispositioned spindle. We conclude that exit from mitosis is triggered by a correctly positioned spindle rather than inhibited by improper spindle position."

This mechanism stops the cell from dividing if the spindle is not positioned correctly. Two models could explain how an incorrectly positioned spindle prevents budding yeast from dividing. The first model proposes that yeast cells do not divide if protein filaments (called microtubules) touch the bud neck. This only occurs if the spindle is not properly threaded into the bud through the small opening of the bud neck. The second model proposes that specific proteins required for cell division (which are found at the ends of the spindle) are inhibited while they are inside the mother cell. This means that the cell cannot divide until one end of its spindle moves out of the mother cell and into the bud."

First, a laser was used to cut the spindle filaments in live yeast cells. This stopped the filaments from touching the neck between the mother cell and the bud, but did not cause the cell to divide. Therefore, these results refute the first model. Next, Falk et al. generated yeast cells that had essentially been tricked into forming two separate spindles before they started to divide. As would be predicted by the second model, these cells could divide as long as an end from at least one of the spindles entered the bud."

Finally, in a related study, Gryaznova, Caydasi et al. identify a protein at the ends of the spindle that acts like a regulatory hub to coordinate cell division with spindle position. Their findings also suggest that the surveillance mechanism is switched off in the bud to allow the cell to divide."

In order to produce viable progeny with distinct cell fates, asymmetrically dividing cells must coordinate nuclear position with the site of cytokinesis. When the spindle is mispositioned with respect to the cleavage plane, cell cycle progression is delayed until the spindle is correctly aligned. In the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, coupling exit from mitosis with spindle position is particularly important because the site of cytokinesis forms independently of mitotic spindle position (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pruyne et al., 2004</a>). Thus budding yeast has evolved mechanisms that align the spindle and that ensure that cytokinesis only occurs after the nucleus has been partitioned between the mother cell and bud, the future daughter cell (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bardin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miller et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yeh et al., 1995</a>)."

The first positioning mechanism relies on the type V myosin motor Myo2. Myo2, together with its adaptor Kar9 and the plus-end microtubule binding protein Bim1, positions the pre-anaphase spindle at the bud neck by pulling cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) along actin cables (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beach et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kopeck\u00e1 and Gabriel, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miller et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Miller and Rose, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Palmer et al., 1992</a>). The second pathway is active during anaphase and requires the minus-end microtubule motor protein dynein, together with its associated coactivating complex dynactin. Dynein, when anchored to the cell cortex by Num1, aligns the spindle by essentially towing it along the cortex of the cell (<a href=\"#bib13\">Farkasovsky and K\u00fcntzel, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Muhua et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yeh et al., 1995</a>). The consequences of eliminating either positioning pathway are minor but cells lacking both pathways are inviable (<a href=\"#bib31\">Miller and Rose, 1998</a>). Cells that fail to segregate the nucleus into the bud will arrest in late anaphase with the spindle mispositioned in the mother cell compartment. If the cell manages to correct this positioning defect and threads the nucleus through the bud neck into the bud, it will then disassemble the anaphase spindle and exit from mitosis (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yeh et al., 1995</a>)."

Cdc14\u2019s essential role in exit from mitosis requires that its activity is tightly regulated. Cdc14 is kept inactive from G1 to metaphase by its inhibitor Cfi1/Net1, which functions by sequestering the phosphatase in the nucleolus. It is only upon anaphase entry that Cdc14 is released from Cfi1/Net1 to spread throughout the cell where it antagonizes mitotic CDK activity and so returns the cell to G1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shou et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Visintin et al., 1999</a>)."

Tem1 regulates a kinase cascade comprised of the PAK-like kinase Cdc15 and the protein kinase Dbf2. Tem1 activates Cdc15 by recruiting it to the spindle pole body (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rock and Amon, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Visintin and Amon, 2001</a>). Cdc15 in turn recruits Dbf2 to spindle poles by creating a phospho-peptide binding domain on the SPB component and MEN scaffold Nud1. In its phosphorylated state, Nud1 docks the Dbf2-activating subunit Mob1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rock et al., 2013</a>). Activated Dbf2-Mob1 together with Cdc5 then promote the sustained release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus through a largely uncharacterized mechanism (<a href=\"#bib30\">Manzoni et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mohl et al., 2009</a>)."

This regulatory mechanism that prevents exit from mitosis in response to spindle misposition is called the spindle position checkpoint (SPoC; [<a href=\"#bib36\">Muhua et al., 1998</a>]). Two models have been proposed to explain how spindle position regulates MEN activity. The 'zone model' proposes that the cell is partitioned into a MEN inhibitory zone in the mother cell compartment and a MEN activating zone in the bud (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan and Amon, 2010</a>). The MEN inhibitor Kin4 localizes to the mother cell, the MEN activator Lte1 to the bud (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bardin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">D'Aquino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</a>). In the event that anaphase spindle elongation occurs only in the mother cell, the spindle poles (where Tem1 resides) cannot escape the negative regulation of Kin4 and the MEN is kept inactive. Inhibition of Tem1 is only relieved once the spindle realigns along the mother-bud axis and one spindle pole exits the Kin4 inhibitory zone. The bud compartment promotes Tem1 activation through redundant mechanisms: 1) the bud is largely devoid of Kin4 and 2) the Kin4 inhibitor Lte1 prevents any small amount of Kin4 present in the bud from localizing to the daughter SPB."

Yeast cells are partitioned into two zones: a MEN inhibitory zone in the mother cell compartment (red) and a MEN activating zone in the bud cell compartment (green). If the spindle becomes misaligned in the inhibitory zone, MEN inhibitors such as Kin4 prevent Tem1 enrichment on SPBs thereby inhibiting exit from mitosis. It is only once one SPB escapes the MEN inhibitory zone and moves into the bud cell compartment that Tem1 can become enriched at the daughter-bound SPB and the cell can exit mitosis. Note that in this model, Tem1 is shown not to localize to SPBs in cells with mispositioned spindles. This is based on the observation that Tem1-13MYC does not localize to SPBs in cells with mispositioned spindles (<a href=\"#bib9\">D\u2019Aquino et al., 2005</a>).

These analyses refute the cMT - budneck model and support the zone model. In the first approach we conducted live cell imaging to investigate the relationship between the presence of cMTs in the neck and exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles. As previously reported, we found that cMT loss from the bud neck does indeed precede exit from mitosis in cells that inappropriately breakdown their spindle in the mother cell compartment. However, our data show that loss of cMTs from the bud neck is not a cause but rather a consequence of exit from mitosis. We find, in cells wh exit from mitosis despite\u00a0harboring a mispositioned spindle, that\u00a0Cdc14 release from the nucleolus precedes rather than follows the disassembly of cytoplasmic microtubules and exit from mitosis. Second, we show that severing cytoplasmic microtubules does not lead to inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles. Finally, we developed a method that allowed us to create cells containing two nuclei. We find that as long as one nucleus enters the bud during anaphase, cells will exit from mitosis, irrespective of whether the other nucleus is correctly or incorrectly positioned. Our data are inconsistent with a model where cMT-bud-neck interactions prevent exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles. Instead, they support the conclusion that spatial regulation of the MEN is controlled through the delivery of a MEN component bearing SPB into the bud."

The relatively low penetrance and transient nature of the spindle positioning defect of <i>kar9\u0394</i> and <i>dyn1\u0394</i> cells has impeded the investigation of the consequences of spindle misposition on cell cycle progression. To overcome this limitation we developed a system to conditionally inactivate both the Kar9 and Dyn1 spindle positioning pathways. We depleted Dyn1 using the Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; auxin) depletion system (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nishimura et al., 2009</a>). IAA is a naturally occurring plant hormone that promotes the degradation of proteins containing an AID degron sequence by targeting them for ubiquitinylation by the SCF-Tir1 ubiquitin ligase (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gray et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Teale et al., 2006</a>).

                                "text": "A previous study reported that eliminating cMT-bud neck interactions by ablating GFP-labeled microtubules causes exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moore et al., 2009</a>). We conducted a similar analysis and found this not to be the case. We used a laser to ablate microtubules in cells either lacking both the <i>KAR9</i> and <i>DYN1</i> spindle positioning pathways or just the <i>DYN1</i> positioning pathway. We ablated the cMT that interacted with the bud neck in 15 <i>DYN1-AID kar9\u0394</i> cells, but exit from mitosis was not observed in the mother cell compartment within the time that we monitored cells post severing (69 min; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We also assessed exit from mitosis following laser ablation in these cells using a marker for cytokinesis. None of the 10 cells with mispositioned spindles in which we ablated the bud-neck interacting cMT exited mitosis as judged by loss of septin Cdc3 from the bud neck (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and C</a>). To ensure that exposure of cells to the laser pulse did not cause cell cycle arrest, we targeted the cytoplasm of cells with correctly positioned spindles with the laser. In the 20 cells treated in this manner, exit from mitosis occurred within 2\u201324 min following application of the laser pulse (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B; C</a>, aligned category). Furthermore, when laser ablated cells with mispositioned spindles managed to realign their spindle, they also exited mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, spindle breakdown in the bud category). Lastly, we ablated cMTs in <i>dyn1\u0394</i> cells. Exit from mitosis did not occur for the duration of the analysis (69\u00a0min)\u00a0in\u00a0cells with mispositioned spindles in which cMTs were ablated. One cell succeeded in positioning its spindle correctly along the mother \u2013 bud axis and promptly exited mitosis thereafter. In 2 cells exit from mitosis followed ablation of cMTs. One cell exited mitosis 8 min post ablation and the other cell exited mitosis 69 min post ablation. The latter instance seems unlikely to be the consequence of loss of cMTs from the budneck because the cell initially lacked cMTs in the budneck for at least 7 min but exited mitosis much later (69 min post-ablation). The one cell that exited mitosis shortly after cMT ablation is well in line with the fraction of wild-type cells that exit from mitosis despite harboring a misaligned spindle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In summary, our results show that ablation of cMTs does not promote exit from mitosis in the vast majority (33/35) of cells analyzed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, mispositioned spindles category). We conclude that although cMT retraction frequently precedes inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with misaligned spindles, it is not the cause of exit from mitosis in these cells."

Cdc14 release from the nucleolus during anaphase activates the phosphatase to trigger exit from mitosis. We used Cdc14 localization as the criterion to determine whether cMT retraction from the bud neck occurred before or after exit from mitosis. To examine Cdc14 localization we used a Cdc14-tdTomato fusion. This allele is slightly hypermorphic (it causes inappropriate exit from mitosis in a small fraction of cells with mispositioned spindles after a substantial anaphase delay, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) but nevertheless accurately reflects the changes in Cdc14 localization during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

In 78.22 \u00b1 3.0% of cells (n \u2265 37 cells per biological replicate. 3 replicates were performed), Cdc14 release occurred approximately 5 min prior to loss of cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions and approximately 5\u201315 min prior to mitotic spindle breakdown (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The decrease in nucleolar Cdc14 signal intensity that occurred shortly prior to spindle breakdown was not caused by changes in nucleolar morphology that take place during anaphase. Signal intensity of Cdc14's nucleolar anchor Cfi1/Net1 did not change during anaphase (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">4</a>). Instead, it appears that Cdc14 was released from the nucleolus. In the majority of cells (73.85 \u00b1 4.4%) Cdc14 release from the nucleolus occurred during anaphase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

As Cdc14 is released from the nucleolus and spreads throughout the nucleus and later the cytoplasm, the standard deviation of pixel intensities will decrease as cells progress through anaphase. We should note that despite intense efforts, we were not able to normalize changes in Cdc14-tdTomato CV to that of a protein that localizes to the nucleolus in a constitutive manner. GFP-tagged nucleolar markers overlapped with the Tubulin-GFP signal, a construct that was necessary to determine when cMTs retract. Tags other than GFP, such as BFP, were too dim to detect by live cell microscopy. Despite this limitation, it was nevertheless clear that the coefficient of variation of Cdc14-td\u00a0Tomato pixel intensity decreased before cMT retraction from the bud neck (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Not all cells showed release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus prior to cMT retraction from the bud neck. In 10.8 \u00b1 4.9% of cells Cdc14 release from the nucleolus occurred concomitantly with cMT retraction. In the remaining cells (11.0 \u00b1 2.2%) that did not release Cdc14 prior to cMT retraction, Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was not detected prior to anaphase spindle breakdown. This is most likely because the fraction of Cdc14 that was released from the nucleolus was too small to detect by imaging. Importantly, we never observed that Cdc14 release occurred after cMT retraction from the bud neck. Consistent with the idea that Cdc14 triggers inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles we find that depletion of Cdc14 suppressed exit from mitosis in the rare wild-type cells that escape the anaphase arrest when their spindles are mispositioned (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We conclude that inappropriate mitotic exit in cells with mispositioned spindles is not due to loss of cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions. Rather, cMT retraction is a consequence of Cdc14 release from the nucleolus in these cells. We further propose that the reason why loss of cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions always precedes mitotic spindle breakdown in cells with mispositioned spindles that exit from mitosis is because disassembly of a single cMT occurs more quickly than disassembly of the mitotic spindle."

The FEAR network promotes the transient release of the phosphatase from the nucleolus during early anaphase. The MEN is needed for the sustained release of the phosphatase during later stages of anaphase (<a href=\"#bib59\">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</a>). Our data showing that Cdc14 is inappropriately released in some cells with mispositioned spindles led us to investigate which pathway regulating Cdc14 was responsible for promoting inappropriate Cdc14 release in these cells. Not surprisingly, inhibition of the MEN, a pathway which is essential for exit from mitosis in all cells, suppressed the inappropriate mitotic exit that is observed in the 11% of cells that exit from mitosis when their spindle is mispositioned (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We were, however, surprised to find that inactivation of the FEAR network, either by deleting <i>SPO12</i> or <i>SLK19</i> also prevented the inappropriate exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib51\">Scarfone et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with the idea that cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions are not regulating mitotic exit, we found that deleting <i>SPO12</i> largely did not affect these interactions (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5E</a>) despite completely suppressing inappropriate mitotic exit in cells with mispositioned spindles. Finally, in cells with mispositioned spindles, we found that the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus was prevented in cells lacking <i>SPO12</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

First, cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions are not responsible for preventing Cdc14 activation and exit from mitosis in response to mispositioned spindles. Instead, activation of Cdc14 causes cMT retraction from the bud neck and exit from mitosis in cells with mispositioned spindles that inappropriately exit from mitosis. Second, Cdc14 activation in the cells that exit from mitosis despite harboring a mispositioned spindle depends on the FEAR network. This observation raises the interesting possibility that it is high FEAR network activity that causes bypass of the anaphase arrest triggered by spindle misposition in some cells."

Division by budding also means that the connection between mother cell and bud is small and the nucleus and other organelles must be squeezed through the bud neck to be accurately partitioned. Therefore division by budding not only requires sophisticated mechanisms to position the nucleus along the mother \u2013 bud axis, it also requires mechanisms to prevent cells from exiting mitosis and undergoing cytokinesis until the nuclei are partitioned between the mother and bud cell compartments. In 1995, Yeh et al. demonstrated the existence of such a mechanism. They showed that cells with mispositioned spindles arrest in late anaphase and fail to exit from mitosis. Subsequently, <a href=\"#bib36\">Muhua et al. (1998)</a> termed this regulatory mechanism the spindle position checkpoint (SPoC). Ensuing studies showed that exit from mitosis is prevented in cells with misaligned spindles through the inhibition of the Mitotic Exit Network, the GTPase signaling cascade that promotes anaphase spindle disassembly, chromosome decondensation and cytokinesis by activating Cdc14 (<a href=\"#bib9\">D'Aquino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</a>)."

In this paper we took advantage of a new inducible system to study mispositioned spindles to distinguish between these two models.

However, once the nucleus traverses the bud neck during anaphase these interactions are lost. In cells that misposition their spindles and undergo anaphase in the mother cell, cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions persist. The proposal that it is these cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions that prevent exit from mitosis in cells with misaligned spindles stems from the analysis of cells that exit mitosis despite harboring a misaligned spindle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adames et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">D'Aquino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</a>). Previous work by Adames and Cooper demonstrated that cMT retraction from the bud neck precedes mitotic spindle breakdown in cells that exit mitosis with a mispositioned spindle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adames et al., 2001</a>). This correlation led them to propose that cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions emit an inhibitory signal that prevents exit from mitosis. This hypothesis was supported by the observations that 1) elimination of cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions by microtubule ablation or 2) loss of cMTs brought about by the cold sensitive \u03b2-tubulin allele (<i>tub2-401</i>) increased the frequency with which cells with mispositioned spindles inappropriately exit from mitosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adames et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Moore et al., 2009</a>)."

First, retraction of cMTs occurs frequently and often for extended periods of time also in cells with-mispositioned spindles that do not inappropriately exit mitosis in the mother cell compartment. Second, in our cMT ablation studies we did not observe exit from mitosis following the loss of cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions. We cannot explain why our ablation results differ from those of <a href=\"#bib34\">Moore et al. (2009)</a> but we note that mitotic exit that followed ablation of cMTs took a long time (approximately 18 min) in this previous study and regrowth of cMTs into the bud neck was also observed during the time it took until cells exited mitosis. Third, not all mutants that lack cytoplasmic microtubules exhibit an increased frequency in inappropriate exit from mitosis when the spindle is mispositioned. Gryaznova et al. (accompanying paper) found that cells lacking <i>SPC72</i> arrest in anaphase when their spindles are mispositioned despite the absence of cMTs."

It clearly showed that cMT retraction from the bud neck did not precede Cdc14 release from the nucleolus but was a consequence thereof. We propose that the reason why cMTs invariably disassemble prior to the mitotic spindle in such cells is that disassembly of a single cMT upon mitotic CDK inactivation takes less time than the disassembly of a mitotic spindle that is composed of many microtubules. An inherently higher instability of cMTs compared to spindle microtubules could of course also explain this difference in disassembly timing. Together, our studies disfavor a mitotic exit inhibitory function of cMT \u2013 bud neck interactions."

The GTPase Tem1 and Polo kinase recruit the MEN kinase Cdc15 to SPBs where it is activated by an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rock and Amon, 2011</a>). Regulators of the GTPase are strategically placed in the cell. Kin4, the GTPase inhibitor localizes to the mother cell, the Kin4 inhibitor and hence MEN activator Lte1 localizes to the bud (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bardin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">D'Aquino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</a>). These localization patterns led us to propose that spindle position controls exit from mitosis through the establishment of a MEN activating compartment in the bud, a MEN inhibitory compartment in the mother cell and a sensor, the MEN component bearing SPB that shuttles between them. When both of the spindle pole bodies are in the MEN inhibitory mother cell compartment, the cell cannot exit from mitosis and arrests in anaphase. It is only once one MEN component-bearing spindle pole body moves into the mitotic exit-activating zone in the bud does the MEN become active and exit from mitosis occurs. It is important to emphasize that the zone model takes into account that not only are there MEN inhibiting factors in the mother cell compartment, but that there are also factors in the bud that promote exit from mitosis. Evidence that cells have both a negative zone in the mother cell compartment and a positive zone in the bud comes from the analysis of cells in which the MEN activating and inhibitory zones were switched. When the Kin4 inhibitor Lte1 is targeted to the mother cell, cells with mispositioned spindles inappropriately exit from mitosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bardin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bertazzi et al., 2011</a>). When Kin4 is targeted to the bud and its inhibitor Lte1 is inactivated, cells with correctly positioned spindles cannot exit from mitosis and arrest in anaphase (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan and Amon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Falk et al., 2011</a>). The analysis of heterokaryons presented here also supports the zone model. Irrespective of whether or not a cell harbors a mispositioned spindle, exit from mitosis occurs once one anaphase spindle enters the bud. Our analysis of heterokaryons in which one of the two spindles gets pulled into the bud in its entirety further shows that it is the presence of a spindle pole in bud and not a correctly positioned spindle that leads to MEN activation. In cells that harbor one nucleus in the bud and one in the mother cell, both spindles are mispositioned, yet exit from mitosis occurs once the spindle in the bud has initiated anaphase. This finding further demonstrates that two signals are necessary for MEN activation in anaphase: (1) a spatial signal \u2013 the movement of a MEN bearing SPB into the bud and (2) a temporal signal that indicates that anaphase chromosome segregation has occurred (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bardin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chan and Amon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Manzoni et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rock and Amon, 2011</a>). Dissecting the molecular details of how these two signals interact to control Tem1 activity will be a critical next step in understanding how the MEN integrates spatial and temporal cues to control exit from mitosis."

We show here that this event is preceded by the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. Our data further indicate that this Cdc14 activation requires FEAR network function because inappropriate mitotic exit in cells with mispositioned spindles is completely prevented when FEAR network component encoding genes are deleted. FEAR network activity is under the control of the regulatory mechanisms governing the metaphase \u2013 anaphase transition (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stegmeier et al., 2002</a>). At this cell cycle transition, a checkpoint known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) inhibits entry into anaphase until all chromosomes have attached correctly to the mitotic spindle (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib37\">Musacchio and Salmon (2007)</a>). Once this has occurred, the SAC inhibition of a protease known as Separase is alleviated and the protease initiates chromosome segregation by cleaving cohesins, the protein complexes that hold sister chromatids together (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nasmyth, 2002</a>). As Separase is also a component of the FEAR network (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stegmeier et al., 2002</a>), SAC activity also governs the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus during early anaphase."

Metaphase duration could be a factor. Difficulties in mitotic spindle formation and correctly attaching chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, may lead to prolonged metaphase delays, during which FEAR network component levels could increase leading to a burst of FEAR network activity once the checkpoint is satisfied and cells enter anaphase. This could also explain why the cell cycle arrest following spindle misposition is especially leaky in the <i>tub2-401</i> mutant, in which the SAC is activated. It is also possible that mitotic CDK activity, which inhibits FEAR network-mediated Cdc14 release from the nucleolus varies between individual cells. Especially high levels of activity could cause a more sustained FEAR-network-dependent release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus causing inappropriate exit from mitosis in some cells with mispositioned spindles."

Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in YEP and then briefly sonicated using a Branson 250 Sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Dansbury CT). These cells were then loaded into a Beckman elutriation rotor JE 5.0 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) which was cooled to 4\u00b0C and equilibrated with YEP at 2400\u2009rpm.

G1 cells were collected at a pump speed of ~23\u00a0mL/min.

The study interrogates two models that have been proposed to account for the mechanism by which the successful orientation of the spindle along the mother daughter axis to support passage of one nucleus into the daughter cell triggers mitotic exit. In the first model, the association of microtubules with the bud neck region restrains mitotic exit arose. In the second, it is the physical presence of an SPB/nucleus in the bud that triggers exit. The first model was suggested following the observation of an apparent correlation between the time at which cytoplasmic microtubules lost their association with the neck region and the dissolution of the spindle (taken as a marker of mitotic exit). These former studies had been based on observations of rare events within a large population of Kar9 and Dyn1 deficient cells. In the current study the authors combine the use of the Kanemaki auxin degron system to greatly enrich for this rare category of cells within the population with more appropriate markers of mitotic exit; Cdc14 exit from the nucleolus and the departure of the septin Cdc3 from the bud neck region. The comprehensive, focused, data set that is presented reveals no correlation between the timing of the loss of microtubule association with the bud neck and mitotic exit. Rather, ingenious heterokaryon and return to cycle from meiosis experiments support the zonal model in which it is the presence of one nucleus in the bud that promotes mitotic exit. The manuscript also addresses the question of the \"leakiness\" of the SPOC arrest. As the abolition of the FEAR network abolishes this leakiness, the authors propose that high levels of FEAR activity enable some cells in the population to escape SPOC arrest to propagate as heterokaryons."

Both claims should be documented by data, which could be provided as a supplemental figure. As a matter of fact, a large fraction of Cdc14-tdTomato seems to remain in the nucleolus throughout the cell cycle, which is not what the lab has shown before. Furthermore, in the Lu and Cross paper where Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was quantitatively measured using the coefficient of variation, fluorescence intensities were normalized over Net1 signal, which is constant in the nucleolus and was not used here as reference."

Why do those cells exit mitosis inappropriately? Are <i>dyn1/kar9</i> mutant cells also defective in SPOC to some extent (for whatever unknown reasons)? I understand that <i>dyn1/kar9</i> that eventually exit mitosis with correct spindle position don't provide insights into the question being asked in this manuscript, but I think a caution is required to use low frequency events (of unknown cause) to build logic, and I'd suggest adding an explanation about this in the manuscript."

The authors state that it is slightly hypermorphic without showing the data. Yet, they claim that it accurately reflects the cell cycle changes in Cdc14 localization. Both claims should be documented by data, which could be provided as a supplemental figure. As a matter of fact, a large fraction of Cdc14-tdTomato seems to remain in the nucleolus throughout the cell cycle, which is not what the lab has shown before. Furthermore, in the Lu and Cross paper where Cdc14 release from the nucleolus was quantitatively measured using the coefficient of variation, fluorescence intensities were normalized over Net1 signal, which is constant in the nucleolus and was not used here as reference.</i>"

We next attempted to perform this normalization using a Cfi1-BFP but this fusion was not detectable in live-cell imaging. Lastly, we tried to quantify the Cfi1-GFP signal in cells were only the (+) ends of microtubules were marked with a Bim1-GFP fusion. However, in this set up we were not able to reliably identify cytoplasmic microtubules because the Bim1-GFP signal was too dim. This prevented us from determining when cMTs retract from the bud neck. Because of these complications we are only able to show a qualitative comparison of the Cdc14-tdTomato and Cfi1-GFP signal. The reasons of why we were not able to perform this normalization are also mentioned in the text."

It is our experience that GFP fusions tend to have a higher affinity to SPBs and so caution is warranted when analyzing these constructs. We further found that a Tem1-eGFP fusion is hypermorphic (Chan and Amon, 2009). Together, these observations lead us to believe that the localization of the Tem1-13MYC fusion likely reflects the true localization of Tem1 in cells with mispositioned spindles, that is off the SPBs.

Why do those cells exit mitosis inappropriately? Are dyn1/kar9 mutant cells also defective in SPOC to some extent (for whatever unknown reasons)? I understand that dyn1/kar9 that eventually exit mitosis with correct spindle position don't provide insights into the question being asked in this manuscript, but I think a caution is required to use low frequency events (of unknown cause) to build logic, and I'd suggest adding an explanation about this in the manuscript.</i>"

However, we should add that if this were the case one would predict that the few cells with mispositioned spindles that exit mitosis inappropriately do so only after a very long arrest. This is however not always true, which would argue against this possibility."
