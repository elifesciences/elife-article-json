The cytokine profile of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells is hard-wired already during thymic development. Yet, the molecular pathways underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Here we show that signaling via the NF\u03baB inducing kinase (NIK) is essential for the formation of a fully functional \u03b3\u03b4 T cell compartment. In the absence of NIK, development of V\u03b35+ dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) was halted in the embryonic thymus, and impaired NIK function caused a selective loss of IL-17 expression by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Using a novel conditional mutant of NIK, we could show in vivo that NIK signaling in thymic epithelial cells is essential for the thymic hardwiring of \u03b3\u03b4 T cell cytokine production."
