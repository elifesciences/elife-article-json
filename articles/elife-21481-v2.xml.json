Here, we demonstrate two distinct correlates of such speed-accuracy adjustments by recording subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity and electroencephalography in 11 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients during a perceptual decision-making task; STN low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity (2\u20138 Hz), coupled to activity at prefrontal electrode Fz, and STN beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) coupled to electrodes C3/C4 close to motor cortex. These two correlates differed not only in their cortical topography and spectral characteristics but also in the relative timing of recruitment and in their precise relationship with decision thresholds. Increases of STN LFO power preceding the response predicted increased thresholds only after accuracy instructions, while cue-induced reductions of STN beta power decreased thresholds irrespective of instructions. These findings indicate that distinct neural mechanisms determine whether a decision will be made in haste or with caution."

Here, we demonstrate two distinct correlates of such speed-accuracy adjustments by recording subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity and electroencephalography in 11 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients during a perceptual decision-making task; STN low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity (2\u20138 Hz), coupled to activity at prefrontal electrode Fz, and STN beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) coupled to electrodes C3/C4 close to motor cortex. These two correlates differed not only in their cortical topography and spectral characteristics but also in the relative timing of recruitment and in their precise relationship with decision thresholds. Increases of STN LFO power preceding the response predicted increased thresholds only after accuracy instructions, while cue-induced reductions of STN beta power decreased thresholds irrespective of instructions. These findings indicate that distinct neural mechanisms determine whether a decision will be made in haste or with caution."

In neurobiological models of decision-making, such modulations of decision thresholds subserving speed-accuracy trade-offs have been assigned to the basal ganglia (BG) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bogacz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Frank, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lo and Wang, 2006</a>), which are connected to a wide range of decision- and movement-related cortical areas in a closed-loop fashion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lambert et al., 2012</a>). Within these loops, the BG exert tonic inhibition over cortical areas, which can be decreased through activation of a facilitatory, direct pathway connecting the striatum with BG output areas or increased by activation of two net inhibitory circuits passing through the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which incorporate the indirect and hyperdirect pathways (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bogacz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>).

An involvement of the STN has been suggested by studies showing that treatment with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN affects patients\u2019 ability to switch between fast and accurate decision-making (<a href=\"#bib23\">Green et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pote et al., 2016</a>).

Task difficulty was manipulated by changing the percentage of dots moving coherently in one direction (8% or 50%). Before the onset of the moving dots, subjects were either instructed to respond as quickly or as accurately as possible (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). While trials with low and high coherence were pseudorandomly interspersed, speed vs. accuracy instructions alternated in blocks of 20 trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) resulting in a 2 (low vs. high coherence) * 2 (speed vs. accuracy instructions) design (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). An overview of the behavioral data is given in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>. Analysis of reaction times (RT) showed that participants were significantly faster during high compared to low coherence trials (974\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0302 ms vs. 1478\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0298 ms, main effect of coherence: F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a083.284, p&lt;0.001) and when they were instructed to emphasize speed over accuracy (1146\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0322 ms vs. 1306 ms\u00a0\u00b1259 ms, main effect of instruction: F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a018.172, p=0.002). In addition, there was a significant interaction of instruction*coherence (F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a09.744, p=0.011), since speed instructions led to a stronger decrease in RT during low coherence compared to high coherence (180\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0137 ms vs. 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0113 ms decrease in RT, t<sub>(10)</sub> = 2.662, p=0.024). This difference was, however, not significant when considering % change in RT rather than the absolute difference (t<sub>(10)</sub> = 1.414, p=0.188). Accuracy rates were significantly lower during low vs. high coherence trials (73.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09% vs. 95.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6%, main effect of coherence: F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0165.107, p&lt;0.001), while there was no significant effect of instruction (83.9%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% during speed vs. 85.7% \u00b1 7% during accuracy instructions, F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.374, p=0.268) nor an interaction of instruction*coherence (F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.152, p=0.308). To assess whether participants\u2019 behavior was, nevertheless, in line with our a-priori hypothesis that subjects would have decreased decision thresholds during speed instructions, we analyzed the RT distribution of error trials in the speed and accuracy conditions. Previous studies have shown that during conditions with high thresholds, errors are primarily observed during slow responses (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</a>; see Materials and methods for more details). In line with this, we found that participants made significantly more errors during slow compared to fast trials after accuracy instructions (16.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.4% decrease in accuracy rates during slow responses, t<sub>(10)</sub> = \u22124.731, P<sub>corrected</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.002), but not during speed instructions (6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.3%, t<sub>(10)</sub> = \u22121.641, P<sub>corrected</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.264). Thus, even though there was no overall effect of speed instructions on accuracy rates, which is compatible with previous studies showing little effects on trials with very high or very low coherence (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanks et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>), our behavioral data were in line with the hypothesis that participants would decrease their decision thresholds during speed emphasis. To directly test this, we then applied the drift diffusion model (DDM), which allows computation of the latent decision-making parameters underlying participants\u2019 behavior."

Second, the decision threshold <i>a</i> determines the amount of sensory evidence that needs to be accumulated before the choice is executed. During speed-accuracy adjustments, when speed is required the decision threshold is thought to be decreased requiring less evidence before responding (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>). Of note, an increased baseline level is mathematically equivalent to decreased decision thresholds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Third, the non-decision time <i>t</i> reflects the portion of RT which is not directly related to the decision process, such as afferent delay, sensory processing and motor execution. In the current study, we assumed that drift rates were related to the coherence of the moving dots (low vs. high coherence) and thresholds were related to differences in task instructions (speed vs. accuracy). Furthermore, the non-decision time was allowed to vary between coherence and instruction conditions. We fitted this simple model to the data using a hierarchical Bayesian estimation of DDM parameters (HDDM) and computed the posterior distribution of model parameters for statistical inference considering posterior probabilities\u00a0\u226595% significant (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wiecki et al., 2013</a>). The model fitted the data well, as indicated by accurate predictions of the observed RT distributions in all four conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As expected, trials with low coherence had significantly lower drift rates than trials with high coherence (100% posterior probability) and decision thresholds after speed instructions were significantly lower than after accuracy instructions (&gt;99% posterior probability, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). As a control analysis, we also assessed whether modulations of drift rates were related to changes in performance during speed vs. accuracy instructions, for\u00a0example, due to increased attention to the stimuli. However, there was no effect of instruction on drift rates (67% posterior probability). Similarly, the non-decision time was neither modulated by instructions nor coherence (both 75% posterior probability). Thus, the HDDM analysis confirmed our a-priori hypotheses that changes in coherence of the moving dots would selectively alter drift rates, while speed vs. accuracy instructions would be related to adaptations of decision thresholds."

First, when comparing speed and accuracy conditions, LFO power was significantly stronger after speed compared to accuracy instructions in the time period preceding the response (p&lt;0.05), while there was no difference between trials with low and high coherence (p&gt;0.05, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>). The pre-response increase in LFO power during speed instructions was also observed when aligning the spectra to the onset of the moving dots cue with a significant cluster starting\u00a0~500 ms after dots onset (p&lt;0.001), see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>. To assess whether the observed changes in LFO power were more strongly related to the onset of the moving dots cue or the response, we directly compared the mean LFO power during the respective time windows (from 750 ms before the response until the response vs. 500 ms until 1250 ms after the cue) after speed and accuracy instructions in a 2*2 ANOVA. Except from the already known main effect of instruction (F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a010.941, p=0.008), this analysis did not show any significant differences between the cue- and response-related changes (effect of alignment: F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00, p=0.993, interaction alignment*instruction: F<sub>(1,10)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.93, p=0.358).

However, there was a very strong RT difference between the low and high coherence conditions (see dotted vertical lines in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, the difference in the beta power might just reflect that responses took place later in low coherence trials. To address this effect of RT differences on STN beta power, we conducted an additional analysis based on (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanks et al., 2014</a>), in which we focused on the early cue-induced reduction in beta power (see Materials and methods for more details). This decrease was evident in all conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and took place well before the second decrease in beta around the time of the response.

This revealed a significant effect of LFO (99% posterior probability) as well as an interaction of LFO*instruction (95% posterior probability), see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>. Post-hoc tests showed that LFO predicted elevated decision thresholds only after accuracy instructions (96% posterior probability), but not after speed instructions (63% posterior probability). Thus, even though LFO was increased after speed instructions, it only predicted modulations of decision thresholds when subjects responded more cautiously after accuracy instructions (right column in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Cue-induced beta power decreases predicted lower decision thresholds (95% posterior probability), but there was no interaction of beta*instruction (59% posterior probability, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, in contrast to LFO power changes, the relationship between beta power decreases and decision thresholds did not depend on speed vs. accuracy instructions. Importantly, the relationship between beta power decreases and thresholds was specific to the early cue-induced decrease in beta, since the averaged pre-response beta power (computed analogously to pre-response LFO power) did not predict threshold adjustments (54% posterior probability), which is in line with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herz et al., 2016</a>). As a further control analysis, we assessed whether STN power changes were specific to modulations of decision thresholds by conducting the same regression analysis using drift rates as dependent variable. This analysis showed that there were no relationships between STN LFO or beta power changes and trial-by-trial fluctuations in drift rates (effect of LFO: 69% posterior probability, LFO*coherence: 73% posterior probability, beta-decrease: 53% posterior probability, beta-decrease*coherence: 53% posterior probability). Finally, the HDDM incorporating STN power changes also improved model performance compared to the HDDM not containing any neural data (difference in deviance information criterion: 485)."

In addition, stronger cue-induced decreases in beta power predicted shorter RT across instructions (slope: \u22120.022, p=0.035). These findings show that similar effects of STN activity can be detected using either DDM or simple behavioral measures. However, applying DDM allowed us to relate STN activity changes to a specific latent decision-making parameter, that\u00a0is, the decision threshold. This is not possible through correlations with behavioral measures alone, since RT is not only influenced by changes in decision thresholds, but also the rate of evidence accumulation and processes not directly related to the decision process (including motor execution delays)."

We found two distinct, statistically-uncorrelated mechanisms comprising modulations of a Fz-STN network in the LFO band and a C3/C4-STN network in the beta band. These two networks differed in their cortical topography, relative timing of recruitment and spectral characteristics as well as in their precise relationship with decision thresholds. The Fz-STN network predicted increased thresholds only after accuracy instructions, while the C3/C4-STN network predicted decreased thresholds irrespective of instructions, but was more strongly modulated during speed emphasis."

More specifically, <a href=\"#bib42\">Past\u00f6tter et al. (2012)</a> demonstrated that changes in cortical LFO power are mainly localized in the medial PFC using EEG in healthy participants performing a speed-accuracy trade-off task. Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib20\">Frank et al. (2015)</a> showed that trial-by-trial variations in Fz LFO measured using EEG correlated with activity of the medial PFC measured using fMRI and that both signals were related to increases in decision thresholds. These findings add to the increasing evidence that the PFC contributes to decision-making and modulations of the speed-accuracy trade-off (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aron et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bogacz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Frank, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Heekeren et al., 2008</a>). Within the PFC, mainly \u2013 albeit not exclusively - dorsomedial PFC seems to play a pivotal role during context-dependent adaptations of decision-making and motor control (<a href=\"#bib18\">Forstmann et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Frank et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Herz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ivanoff et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">van Veen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wenzlaff et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, dorsomedial PFC has anatomical connections to the STN via the indirect and hyperdirect pathway (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aron et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Forstmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lambert et al., 2012</a>). Here, we found that STN LFO power was increased prior to the response after speed compared to accuracy instructions. However, it was only predictive of elevated thresholds after accuracy instructions and, similarly, the extent to which Fz and STN LFO fell into register (as reflected by phase coupling) only correlated with variations in STN LFO power after accuracy instructions. These observations are in line with the idea that PFC increases its influence over STN activity when caution is warranted (<a href=\"#bib21\">Frank, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ridderinkhof et al., 2011</a>) leading to increased decision thresholds in order to delay the response (<a href=\"#bib20\">Frank et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Herz et al., 2016</a>). Further evidence for this hypothesis has been provided by previous studies assessing \u2018conflict\u2019 between competing responses. Using the Flanker task Zavala and colleagues (2013, 2015, 2016) found increased STN LFO power in trials with distracting stimuli compared to trials without such conflict. Similar changes in STN LFO power have been observed during a Stroop task (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brittain et al., 2012</a>). Since response conflict has been shown to increase decision thresholds (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ratcliff and Frank, 2012</a>), these previously reported LFO changes might be related to threshold adjustments. However, LFO activity \u2013 at least when measured over PFC using EEG - cannot be simply mapped to one specific process or mechanism, since it is not only modulated by conflict, but various processes including novelty, punishment, error, memory and learning (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cavanagh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen, 2014b</a>). Thus, the increased STN LFO power after speed instructions observed in the current study could be related to a variety of processes, such as the implementation of a non-default mode of responding (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>) assuming that participants\u2019 natural tendency was to weigh accuracy over speed (<a href=\"#bib19\">Forstmann et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, however, this change in LFO power after speed emphasis was not related to adjustments of decision thresholds nor to PFC-STN phase coupling indicating either that cortical areas other than dorsomedial PFC were increasing their influence over STN or that communication between PFC and BG were mainly relayed through the striatum instead of STN for threshold adjustments during the speed regime (<a href=\"#bib19\">Forstmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ivanoff et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">van Veen et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "We found a separate neural correlate of speed-accuracy adjustments, namely an immediate cue-induced decrease in STN beta power, which was more pronounced during speed emphasis and predicted lower decision thresholds irrespective of the type of instruction. Furthermore, variations in STN beta power after speed instructions were closely related to the extent to which beta phase coupling between C3/C4 and STN decreased after the cue indicating that the stronger STN beta power decrease during speed emphasis was related to modulations of C3/C4-STN connectivity. It should be noted that concomitant changes in power can affect measures of phase coupling, since low power can render phase estimates unreliable underestimating the consistency of phase-alignment between areas. Thus, the decreased phase coupling after speed instructions should be interpreted with caution, even though we found that C3/C4-STN beta phase coupling was already decreased when STN beta power showed no differences between speed and accuracy instructions\u00a0~300 ms after the cue. At the cortical level, beta power modulations during movements (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pape and Siegel, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pfurtscheller, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">2003</a>), decision-making (<a href=\"#bib14\">Donner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wyart et al., 2012</a>) and speed-accuracy trade-offs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Past\u00f6tter et al., 2012</a>) have been localized to motor areas. Furthermore, STN beta oscillations are coherent to motor cortical areas during rest (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hirschmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Litvak et al., 2011</a>). Thus, even though conclusive evidence can only be provided through simultaneous STN and focal cortical recordings, for\u00a0example, using electrocorticography, the observed beta band changes in STN and at C3/C4 in the current study are likely to be related to modulations of a motor cortical-STN network adding to the increasing evidence that \u2018decision-related\u2019 signals can be observed in areas involved in motor preparation and execution (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Donner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Klein-Fl\u00fcgge and Bestmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Past\u00f6tter et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Thura and Cisek, 2016</a>). One role of motor cortical-STN beta modulations during speed-accuracy adjustments might be related to the amount of vigor invested in the response. In the current study, we did not measure movement velocity or force. However, previous studies have provided strong evidence that the BG in general (<a href=\"#bib13\">Desmurget and Turner, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</a>), and variations in STN beta power in particular (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tan et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2016</a>), are related to encoding movement vigor. During speed-accuracy adjustments speed emphasis not only decreases decision times, but also increases movement vigor to indicate the choice (<a href=\"#bib53\">Spieser et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thura et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, the longer is spent on deliberation the less time is spent on performing the motor response (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thura and Cisek, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thura et al., 2014</a>). Such close relationships between \u2018cognitive\u2019 and \u2018motor\u2019 aspects of a decision have led to the hypothesis that a common signal might underlie adjustments in the speed of decision and vigor of movements (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thura and Cisek, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thura et al., 2014</a>). Future studies are needed to test the intriguing possibility that modulations of cortico-STN networks during speed-accuracy adjustments do not only mediate changes in decision time, but also related changes in movement vigor."

                        "text": "How can changes in cortico-STN connectivity lead to adjustments between fast and accurate decisions? Recordings of cortical single-unit activity in non-human primates have shown that when speed is emphasized, neurons integrating sensory evidence exhibit an increase in the baseline and gain of firing rates during deliberation, rather than terminating at lower levels of firing rates before the choice is executed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanks et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heitz and Schall, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Thura and Cisek, 2016</a>). These findings indicate that a shift in baseline, but not a change in the threshold (which is mathematically equivalent, see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), underlies speed-accuracy adjustments at the neural level. Such changes in cortical activity and excitability could be mediated through the BG by modulating tonic feedback inhibition of the cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bogacz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>) putatively in the form of a dynamic \u2018urgency\u2019 signal (<a href=\"#bib9\">Churchland et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Thura and Cisek, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thura et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, changes in cortical firing rates during speed-accuracy adjustments have been observed in multiple areas comprising motor and premotor cortex (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thura and Cisek, 2016</a>), parietal cortex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanks et al., 2014</a>) and frontal eye field (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heitz and Schall, 2012</a>), all of which share connections with the STN (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lambert et al., 2012</a>). Thus, context-dependent changes in STN activity could adjust cortical activity (e.g. baseline firing rates) simultaneously in multiple, spatially remote areas according to current task demands. As mentioned earlier, cortex and basal ganglia are interconnected through circuits, which comprise not only cortico\u2013STN connections, but involve a multitude of subcortical areas (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lambert et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we do not assume that during speed-accuracy trade-offs neural activity changes within the basal ganglia are limited to the STN. Behavioural adjustments might ultimately be implemented by modulations of cortico-basal ganglia network dynamics through multiple pathways. Since spike-based communication can be optimized regarding efficiency and selectivity through synchronized oscillations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fries, 2015</a>), we propose that the changes in oscillatory activity observed in this study reflect modulations of distinct neural communication channels facilitating adjustments between hasty and cautious decision regimes."

The display was viewed from a comfortable distance allowing the subjects to interact with the keyboard. At the beginning of each trial, a text cue indicated whether participants should respond as quickly (\u2018Fast!\u2019) or as accurately as possible (\u2018Accurate!\u2019). The duration of this cue was randomly jittered between 0.75 and 1.25 s with an average duration of 1 s. Then, a cloud of 200 randomly moving white dots was presented on a black background. The diameter of the cloud was 14 cm and dot size was 10 pixels. Each dot moved in a straight line at a rate of 0.14 mm per frame for 20 frames before moving to another part of the cloud where it moved in a new direction chosen pseudorandomly between \u2212180\u00b0 and 180\u00b0. While some of the dots were moving randomly, the remaining dots moved coherently in one direction, which made the cloud of dots appear to move to the left or right. Participants were instructed to press a key with their right index finger (\u2018/\u2019 on the keyboard of the laptop) if they perceived that the cloud was moving to the right and to press a key with their left index finger (\u2018z\u2019) when they perceived a leftwards movement. Between responses both index fingers rested on the respective keys. The percentage of dots moving coherently in one direction was either 50% (high coherence) or 8% (low coherence). These two cues were pseudorandomly presented with equal probability so that participants could not predict whether the next trial would contain dots with high or low coherence. The trial was terminated by a response or after a 3 s deadline in case participants did not respond followed by immediate visual feedback, which was shown for 500 ms. During accuracy instruction \u2018incorrect\u2019 was shown as feedback both for errors of commission and errors of omission, while \u2018correct\u2019 was shown for all correct trials. During speed instructions \u2018in time\u2019 was shown for all responses within the 3 s window, while \u2018too slow\u2019 was shown if patients did not respond within the 3 s deadline.

While trials with different coherence levels were randomly interspersed, accuracy and speed trials alternated in blocks of 20 trials (<a href=\"#bib23\">Green et al., 2013</a>). These blocks were repeated six times each resulting in 240 trials for the whole experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which lasted approximately 10 min. Before commencement of the experimental recordings, patients could practice the task for as long as they wished (usually approximately 40 trials)."

These regions were recorded from Fz as well as C3 (left hemisphere) and C4 (right hemisphere) according to the international 10\u201320 system. We also recorded from midline electrodes Cz, Pz and Oz whenever possible, but due to surgical wounds and dressings we were not able to cover a broader area. Accordingly, although we maintain that Fz, C3 and C4 recorded activity from our regions of interest, we do not assume that they do so exclusively. Electrooculography (EOG) was recorded for eye movement artifact rejection. Data were sampled at 2048 Hz, band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 500 Hz and amplified (TMSi porti, TMS International, Enschede, The Netherlands). Further analyses were conducted offline using custom-written Matlab scripts (R2015a, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622\">SCR_001622</a>). Artifacts related to eye movements were removed by subtracting the filtered and adaptively scaled EOG data (40 Hz low-pass filter). Scaling was performed with an optimization algorithm (Matlab function <i>fminocn</i>, initial value\u00a0=\u00a01) minimizing the sum of squared errors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fischer et al., 2016</a>). Trials with residual artifacts were discarded after visual inspection. After removal of trials based on behavioral data (see above) and artifacts in the electrophysiological data on average 201 trials (83.4%) remained per patient resulting in 2209 trials combined. Data were downsampled to 200 Hz, high-pass filtered at 1 Hz and low-pass filtered at 100 Hz. For quadripolar contacts (five patients, see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">supplementary file 1</a>), LFPs were converted to a bipolar montage between adjacent contacts (three channels per hemisphere) to limit effects of volume conduction (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herz et al., 2016</a>). Similarly, for octopolar non-directional contacts (three patients), bipolar channels were computed between adjacent contacts leading to seven channels per hemisphere. For octopolar directional contacts (three patients), bipolar montages were created between the dorsal omnidirectional contact and its three adjacent directional contacts as well as between the ventral omnidirectional contact and its three adjacent directional contacts resulting in six bipolar channels per hemisphere. Power and phase of LFPs were computed using the continuous wavelet transform with two cycles per frequency for the lowest considered frequency (2 Hz) which linearly increased to five cycles per frequency for the highest considered frequency (30 Hz) in 1 Hz steps. We chose this frequency range, because we <i>a-priori</i> expected low-frequency oscillations (LFO) between 2\u00a0and\u00a08 Hz and beta oscillations between 13\u00a0and\u00a030 Hz to be modulated during the task (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herz et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zavala et al., 2014</a>). Power of each frequency was normalized to the mean signal of that frequency across the whole experiment. Of note, we applied normalization to account for between-subject differences unrelated to the task (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio), however, observed qualitatively highly similar spectra when omitting this step. The resulting time frequency spectra were aligned to the onset of the moving dots and time of the response, respectively. In order to detect the bipolar STN channel, which was most strongly modulated by the task, we employed the following procedure. First, for each patient and hemisphere, response-aligned time-frequency spectra (averaged across all conditions to avoid circularity) were visualized for all channels and the channel with the most pronounced beta modulation (reduction of beta power in the peri-response time window) was noted. For further analyses, we then selected the channel showing the strongest peri-response LFO increase if this channel (i) also showed a strong beta-modulation (&gt;15% change from baseline) and (ii) was not further than two channels remote from the best beta channel to avoid including activity likely recorded outside of the STN (contact length is 1.5 mm with 0.5 mm spacing between contacts for all implanted electrodes). In 53% of hemispheres, the bipolar channel showing the strongest beta modulation was identical to the channel showing the strongest LFO modulation and in 47% the best LFO channel was localized ventrally to the best beta channel. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows an example of STN channel selection for one representative patient. When using the best beta channel instead of the best LFO channel for analyses of task-related modulations of STN activity, we obtained highly similar results regarding modulations in the beta band to the ones presented in the paper (data not shown). After channel selection, normalized spectra of the selected left and right STN were averaged resulting in one STN channel per patient."

Thus, for each trial, we computed the change in beta power over time until the response was executed, that\u00a0is, the time series of each trial was capped at the time of the response. We then averaged these time series across trials from 500 ms before dots onset until the point in time when 50% of trials in the condition with lowest RT (high coherence during speed instructions) contributed to the average. Thereby we ensured the inclusion of at least 50% of trials at all considered time points for all conditions.

DDM has been widely applied over the last decades and has been shown to accurately predict behavior over a range of different tasks (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>). There are three main parameters in DDM. First, the drift rate <i>v</i> reflects the rate of evidence accumulation. If a cue clearly favors one over the other choice the drift rate is high resulting in fast and accurate decisions, while ambiguous cues will lead to low drift rates and thus slow and error-prone choices. In our experiment, we expected the level of dots coherence to modulate the drift rate (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>). Second, the decision threshold <i>a</i> defines how much evidence is accumulated before committing to a choice. Thus, the decision threshold constitutes a decision criterion, which transforms a continuous variable (sensory evidence) into a categorical choice (option A or B). There is ample evidence that speed-accuracy adjustments are mediated through modulations of the decision threshold so that decreased thresholds (or mathematically equivalent an increased baseline, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) during speed emphasis lead to faster responses at the expense of accuracy. This leads to increased fast errors during speed emphasis, that\u00a0is, errors are typically faster than correct trials (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>). Conversely, during conditions with high thresholds errors are typically slower than correct trials (for a more detailed explanation of this finding see [<a href=\"#bib49\">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</a>]). In the current study, we hypothesized that the decision threshold would be modulated by speed vs. accuracy instructions. The third parameter in DDM is the non-decision time <i>t</i>, which is thought to be related to afferent delay, sensory processing and motor execution."

Another advantage of HDDM is that it allows regression analyses between trial-by-trial variations of model parameters and fluctuations of neural activity, such as STN power modulations. In other words, model parameters and neural activity are not analyzed separately and then correlated afterwards (which would result in n\u00a0=\u00a011 observations (patients) in the current study), but the neural variables are directly entered into the model and allowed to modulate the latent decision-making parameters at each trial (resulting in n\u00a0=\u00a02209 observations (trials) in our study). The hierarchical design assumes that parameters from individual participants are not completely independent, but drawn from the group distribution while allowing variations from this distribution given sufficient evidence to overwhelm the group prior. Prior distributions were informed by 23 previous studies (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wiecki et al., 2013</a>). The starting parameter (bias parameter) <i>z</i> was fixed to 0.5, because leftwards and rightwards movements were equally likely. We <i>a-priori</i> assumed that the decision threshold <i>a</i> was modulated by instruction (speed vs. accuracy) and the drift rate <i>v</i> by level of coherence (low vs. high) allowing for overall trial-by-trial variability in drift. In addition, we also assessed whether the non-decision time <i>t</i> was affected by changes in instructions or dots coherence. Since this was not the case (see Results), we used a simple model with drift rates affected by coherence and thresholds altered by instructions for model checks and regression analyses (see below). Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling was used for Bayesian approximation of the posterior distribution of model parameters generating 20,000 samples and discarding 10,000 samples as burn-in (<a href=\"#bib29\">Herz et al., 2016</a>). To ensure model convergence we inspected traces of model parameters, their autocorrelation and computed the R-hat (Gelman-Rubin) statistics (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wiecki et al., 2013</a>). To assess model performance, we computed quantile probability plots (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>), in which predicted and observed RT for the 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 percentile were plotted against their predicted and observed cumulative probability for each condition. Error trials were only plotted for the low coherence condition due to the paucity of errors in the high coherence condition (~5%). Parameters of the model were analyzed by Bayesian hypothesis testing. We considered posterior probabilities\u00a0\u226595% of the respective parameters being different than zero significant (<a href=\"#bib20\">Frank et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Herz et al., 2016</a>). In other words, model parameters were significant if\u00a0\u226595% of samples drawn from the posterior were different from zero (or different from the distribution they were compared to, for\u00a0example, of healthy participants). Even though such <i>posterior probabilities</i> are distinct from classical p\u00a0values (e.g. in a t-test) they can be interpreted in a similar manner (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wiecki et al., 2013</a>). After having conducted the HDDM analysis for patients, we conducted the identical analysis for healthy participants to assess whether task effects on latent decision-making parameters were different between both groups."

To analyze whether task-related changes in LFO and beta were predominantly expressed over Fz or C3/C4, we compared the pre-response increase in LFO and cue-induced decrease in beta (see Statistical analysis of STN LFPs) between these two sites using permutation testing (1000 permutations) by shuffling between electrode labels for each subject."

                                "text": "After having established the spatial selectivity of cortical LFO and beta activity, we then computed the inter-site phase clustering (ISPC) between Fz and STN in the LFO band as well as between C3/C4 and STN in the beta band. ISPC is a phase-based measure of connectivity reflecting to what extent oscillations in two different areas are phase-locked at specific time points (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen, 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Herz et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zavala et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2016</a>). This measure is independent of power changes in that it only considers the phase information of the signal and will be only affected by power in cases where power is very low (because phase estimates deteriorate) or zero (because phase cannot be estimated with zero power) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen, 2014a</a>). Note that we did not compute single trial estimates of connectivity, because connectivity estimates are far more robust when averaging across trials. After extracting the phase from the wavelet transform, the difference between the phase of the STN LFP and respective EEG channel was calculated at each time point of each trial, and averaged across trials. Note that this computation is identical to ITPC described above, except that the phase difference between the STN and EEG signal were used rather than phase angles from STN alone. The resulting values were then integrated over time using a sliding window decreasing linearly from\u00a0\u00b1200 ms (corresponding to\u00a0\u00b11 cycle for 5 Hz, the median frequency of LFO) to\u00a0\u00b1100 ms (roughly corresponding to\u00a0\u00b12 cycles for 22 Hz, the median of beta). For specifically assessing task-related changes in ISPC, we calculated the % change from baseline. The baseline was defined as the time from 500 ms until 250 ms before onset of the moving dots cue. The time window of interest was defined based on the modulations of STN power during speed-accuracy adjustments: a 750 ms time window prior to the response for LFO and a 500 ms time window starting 150 ms after dots onset for beta. For LFO, this was computed for Fz-left STN and Fz-right STN and then averaged across hemispheres. For beta, C3-left STN was used for right-handed responses and C4-right STN for left-handed responses before averaging across hemispheres. This resulted in one ISPC value per patient (n\u00a0=\u00a08) for each cortico-STN connection (Fz-STN and C3/C4-STN). To assess putative effects of speed-accuracy adjustments, we then compared ISPC for Fz-STN and C3/C4-STN between speed and accuracy instructions. We applied permutation testing by shuffling between condition labels using 1000 permutations. Finally, we assessed whether differences in STN power, which were shown to predict trial-by-trial adjustments of decision threshold (see Results), were related to differences in cortico-STN connectivity across subjects and whether this relationship depended on the type of instruction. To this end, we entered the ISPC values into a Pearson correlation analysis with the corresponding STN power (i.e. pre-response STN LFO power for Fz-STN ISPC and cue-induced STN beta power decrease for C3/C4-STN ISPC) separately for speed and accuracy instructions. The resulting rho values for speed and accuracy were Fisher r-to-z transformed and compared between the speed and accuracy condition. In case of a significant difference the correlations within a condition, that\u00a0is, during accuracy and speed conditions separately, were tested for significance. Prior to conducting Pearson correlations, we ensured that assumptions of parametric correlations were met including absence of outliers using Grubbs test and normality using Shaprio-Wilk test. Please note that single subject estimates of decision thresholds were not used for any correlation analyses, since the hierarchical design of HDDM violates the assumption of independence of observations (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wiecki et al., 2013</a>). For all statistical tests of EEG data and cortico-STN connectivity, a statistical threshold of p=0.05 was applied correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method whenever applicable. For permutation tests, p-values are given as p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01 or p&lt;0.001 instead of precise p-values, since these can change slightly when repeating permutation tests."

The behavioral data and computational modeling of three of the subjects' decision making parameters support the notion that subjects adjusted their decision thresholds based on whether they were instructed to emphasize speed vs. accuracy during the performance of a moving dots task. The authors also demonstrate two electrophysiological correlates of speed vs. accuracy emphasis in STN: a low frequency oscillation (LFO) amplitude increase and \u03b2 decrease in \"speed trials\" trials compared to \"accuracy trials\". Further, they show that while the LFO effect dominates EEG recordings above PFC, the \u03b2 effect dominates EEG recordings above motor cortex, and that these are coherent with STN oscillatory activity that corresponds in frequency and timing, possibly indicating the involvement of distinct networks. These findings will be important for future studies aimed at revealing the circuitry and spectrotemporal fingerprints of perceptual-cognitive operations, since they emphasize that the brain might prioritize different mechanisms and underlying networks based on how subjects interpret task requirements."

Additionally, calculating the inter-trial coherence of low-frequency oscillations related to stimulus onset vs. response onset might reveal which of these two events LFOs are most synchronized to, indicating possible phase reset by stimulus onset or behavioral responding. If it turns out that LFOs are synchronized to stimulus onset (significant inter-trial coherence), and that this synchronization (ITC) is stronger in the case when speed is emphasized over accuracy, one could interpret this as in this case, bottom-up processes like oscillatory phase reset become more heavily involved in decision making."

Do the terms \"pre-response LFO power\" and \"cue-induced \u03b2 power\" indicate that while LFO amplitudes were extracted from response aligned, \u03b2 amplitudes were extracted from cue aligned trials? If the above suggested analyses indicate that LFO modulations are stronger and LFOs are \"more phase-locked\" in stimulus onset aligned data, both LFO and \u03b2 amplitudes should be measured in timeframes aligned to stimulus onset.

This is particularly true when they are analysed independently from RT, since both measures are closely related to each other (the likelihood of a response to be correct depends on the time taken for deliberation). However, our task design is unfortunately not well suited for signal detection analyses. This is because in our paradigm there is always a stimulus (moving dots) present, which in some trials is easier to detect (high coherence) than in others (low coherence), but there are no trials with only randomly moving dots. In other words, there is always a direction in which the majority of dots move. Therefore, there are no correct response omissions and, similarly, the error of omission rate is very low (&lt; 2%) rendering signal detection analyses unreliable. On the other hand, drift diffusion modelling can be interpreted as a related or extended approach to signal detection theory, which does not only take into account accuracy rates, but also the complete RT distribution of the behavioural data (for an interesting discussion of signal detection theory and sequential analysis / drift diffusion modelling see Gold and Shadlen, 2007, Annual Review of Neuroscience). Drift diffusion analysis indeed confirms what the reviewers indicated; a significant effect on a latent parameter underlying the observed behaviour (in this case decision thresholds), which could not be observed when only analysing accuracy rates. In addition, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> shows that errors were primarily observed during slow responses only after accuracy, but not speed instructions; a finding, which has been related to conditions with high decision thresholds (see Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008, Neural Computation). We hope that these observations further support the notion that task instruction indeed altered task performance even in the absence of an effect on accuracy rates when analysing them separately from RT."

We were referring to the absence of an effect of coherence on the cue-induced \u03b2 decrease even though low and high coherence trials had much stronger RT differences than speed vs. accuracy trials. However, the regression analysis showing a significant negative relationship between the \u03b2-decrease and decision thresholds in fact shows that this LFP change is related to RT differences. Furthermore, we now show that the cue-induced \u03b2 decrease is also negatively correlated with RT (see reply to comment 7). Therefore, we believe that the above statement in the previous version of the manuscript was misleading and have removed it from the article. Regarding statistical analysis of EEG data, we have now restructured this part of the Results sections, so that the statistical analysis is shown in the same sentence stating that LFO changes were stronger in Fz compared to C3/C4, while the opposite was the case for \u03b2 changes (subsection \u201cModulation of cortico-STN connectivity during speed-accuracy adjustment\u201d)."

We have now conducted additional regression analyses using RT rather than thresholds as dependent variable, which demonstrate that similar effects of STN power changes can be detected. More specifically, pre-response LFO increases predict longer RT only after accuracy, but not speed instructions, while stronger cue-induced \u03b2 power decreases predict shorter RT across instructions (subsection \u201cCombining recorded STN power changes with drift diffusion modeling\u201d, second paragraph). Regarding accuracy rates, we only have limited LFP data for incorrect trials, since error rates were &lt; 25% in low coherence trials (and virtually 0% in high coherence trials), so that only approximately 10% of all trials are errors. Therefore, we did not attempt any regression analyses (e.g. logistic regression). However, we compared STN time-frequency spectra between correct and error trials, which did not reveal any differences (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Additionally, calculating the inter-trial coherence of low-frequency oscillations related to stimulus onset vs. response onset might reveal which of these two events LFOs are most synchronized to, indicating possible phase reset by stimulus onset or behavioral responding. If it turns out that LFOs are synchronized to stimulus onset (significant inter-trial coherence), and that this synchronization (ITC) is stronger in the case when speed is emphasized over accuracy, one could interpret this as in this case, bottom-up processes like oscillatory phase reset become more heavily involved in decision making.</i> "

This analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the response- and cue-aligned data (subsection \u201cChanges in STN activity during speed-accuracy adjustments\u201d, second paragraph). Furthermore, we computed the inter-trial coherence (referred to as intertrial phase clustering). This showed that neither the response-, nor the cue-aligned changes in LFO showed any significant phase-locking across trials in the respective time windows arguing against a strong evoked component (in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). We therefore continue to use the response-related changes in LFO (750 ms before the response until the response) for all further analyses as in the previous version of the paper. This has the advantage compared to cue-aligned data that the single trial LFO changes will not fall into the post-response period for any of the trials and is consistent with the approach used in a previous paper assessing the relationship between LFO power and decision thresholds (Herz et al., 2016, Current Biology)."
