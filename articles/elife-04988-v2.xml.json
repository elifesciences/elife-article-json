This study identifies a process unprecedented in bacterial replisomes. While bacteria and phage simply recruit polymerases to the fork, we find that suppression mechanisms are used to position the distinct eukaryotic polymerases on their respective strands. Hence, Pol \u03b5 is active with CMG on the leading strand, but it is unable to function on the lagging strand, even when Pol \u03b4 is not present. Conversely, Pol \u03b4-PCNA is the only enzyme capable of extending Okazaki fragments in the presence of Pols \u03b5 and \u03b1. We have shown earlier that Pol \u03b4-PCNA is suppressed on the leading strand with CMG (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>). We propose that CMG, the 11-subunit helicase, is responsible for one or both of these suppression mechanisms that spatially control polymerase occupancy at the fork."

This study identifies a process unprecedented in bacterial replisomes. While bacteria and phage simply recruit polymerases to the fork, we find that suppression mechanisms are used to position the distinct eukaryotic polymerases on their respective strands. Hence, Pol \u03b5 is active with CMG on the leading strand, but it is unable to function on the lagging strand, even when Pol \u03b4 is not present. Conversely, Pol \u03b4-PCNA is the only enzyme capable of extending Okazaki fragments in the presence of Pols \u03b5 and \u03b1. We have shown earlier that Pol \u03b4-PCNA is suppressed on the leading strand with CMG (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>). We propose that CMG, the 11-subunit helicase, is responsible for one or both of these suppression mechanisms that spatially control polymerase occupancy at the fork."

Indeed, epitope tagging of CMG subunits, followed by cell extract pull-outs and mass spectrometry, has identified a large \u2018replisome progression complex\u2019 (RPC) that contains CMG along with several other factors, some of which are essential for cell viability (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gambus et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gambus et al., 2009</a>). Thus, RPCs contain CMG along with Mcm10, Ctf4, Pol \u03b1, Mrc1, Csm3, Tof1, FACT, and Topo I. Furthermore, there is evidence that nucleosomes may be involved in determining the size of eukaryotic lagging strand fragments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</a>). We demonstrate here a 31 protein system, requiring the three replicative Pols \u03b1, \u03b5, and \u03b4, which performs both leading and lagging strand synthesis and generates Okazaki fragments of a size similar to those observed in cells."

                        "text": "Study of the eukaryotic replisome identifies a new process that has no precedent in bacterial systems. Bacteria use simple recruitment processes to attract and hold polymerases to the fork. These are typically mediated by polymerase interactions with other proteins at the replication fork, such as the helicase and sliding clamps (<a href=\"#bib1\">Benkovic et al., 2001</a>). However, we find that in addition to recruitment processes that attract polymerases to the fork, eukaryotes use suppressive mechanisms, which prevent polymerase action on one strand or the other. Thus, while Pol \u03b5 extends the leading strand, its activity is suppressed on the lagging strand, even in the absence of Pol \u03b4. In opposite fashion, we demonstrate here that Pol \u03b4 is active on the lagging strand in the presence of Pol \u03b5 and Pol \u03b1. This activity stands in contrast to the suppression of Pol \u03b4 on the leading strand shown in our earlier report (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>). We also find that Pol \u03b1 functions with CMG on both the leading and lagging strands. However, Pol \u03b1 lacks a proofreading exonuclease and thus has lower fidelity than Pols \u03b5 and \u03b4. Interestingly, Pol \u03b1 extension activity is suppressed by Pol \u03b5 on the lagging strand, even though Pol \u03b5 is inactive on the lagging strand. Likewise, Pol \u03b4 suppresses Pol \u03b1 on the leading strand despite its inefficient extension of this strand. Thus, multiple suppression reactions exist that prevent the activity of a polymerase positioned on the \u2018wrong\u2019 strand, and the only active solution is the asymmetric Pol \u03b5/\u03b4 leading\u2013lagging strand replisome with use of Pol \u03b1 to prime the strands."

To obtain the 4-subunit Pol \u03b1, we reconstituted it by expressing the Pol1 polymerase subunit of Pol \u03b1 in yeast and Pol12 and the primase subunits, Pri1 and Pri2, in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. A mixture of cells containing the 4 subunits were lysed, and Pol \u03b1 was purified as an intact 4-subunit holoenzyme (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then studied the behavior of Pol \u03b1 with the 11-subunit CMG helicase and RPA on the forked DNA substrate. We initially assumed the lagging strand\u2013specific Pol \u03b1 would not function on the leading strand with CMG, especially since Pol \u03b4-PCNA did not function well on the leading strand with CMG in our earlier study (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>). To test Pol \u03b1 function with CMG, we primed the leading strand with an oligonucleotide and examined Pol \u03b1 DNA synthesis with CMG using <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP (see scheme in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast to our expectations, Pol \u03b1 was highly active with CMG and completely extended the leading strand (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lanes 4\u20136). Dropout reactions demonstrated that CMG is absolutely required and therefore Pol \u03b1 cannot perform this action alone (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The control shows \u03d529 Pol efficiently extends a primer through the 3.2 kb duplex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lanes 1 and 5) and thus produces an ssDNA lagging strand. However, the lagging strand ssDNA did not serve as a template to generate Okazaki fragments when Pol \u03b1 and RPA were present (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, lane 6). In contrast, lagging strand synthesis by Pol \u03b1 with CMG supports robust Okazaki fragment production by Pol \u03b1 (lane 4). The requirement of CMG for Pol \u03b1 primase activity suggests that Pol \u03b1 forms a transient but specific interaction with CMG for priming action, since use of a heterologous enzyme to unwind DNA does not support Pol \u03b1 priming activity. Although both Ctf4 and the essential Mcm10 proteins are known to bind Pol \u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gambus et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Warren et al., 2009</a>), these results demonstrate that neither Ctf4 nor Mcm10 are required for Pol \u03b1 priming function with CMG in vitro. To support this observation, we examined our protein preparations for trace contaminating Ctf4 and/or Mcm10 by mass spectrometry, but no Ctf4 or Mcm10 was detected. Consistent with results of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, Pol \u03b1 also primes the leading strand directly and priming is stimulated by the presence of CMG (compare lanes 3 and 7). The results suggest Pol \u03b1 binds CMG in the absence of Ctf4 or Mcm10 and therefore we tried to pull down a complex of Pol \u03b1 with CMG but did not obtain a positive result. Thus the interaction, if it exists, may be weak, consistent with weak helicase\u2013primase interactions in phage T4 and <i>E. coli</i> replication systems that can be deduced by activity assays but elude direct detection methods (<a href=\"#bib1\">Benkovic et al., 2001</a>)."

The Dpb2 subunit of Pol \u03b5 is known to bind the Psf1 subunit of GINS (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sengupta et al., 2013</a>), and we have previously used a glycerol gradient to demonstrate that intact Pol \u03b5 can bind CMG helicase, forming a 1:1 CMG-Pol \u03b5 (CMGE) complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Langston et al., 2014</a>). In <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, we document that the CMGE complex can also be reconstituted in a bead-based protein binding assay. In these experiments, we purified Pol \u03b5 containing an N-terminal StrepTag, incubated it with CMG, and then added Strep-Tactin magnetic beads. Biotin-specific elution of CMG in complex with StrepTag-Pol \u03b5 demonstrates that CMG is retained by Pol \u03b5, forming the 15-protein \u2018CMGE\u2019 leading strand complex.

In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, we separately monitored leading and lagging strand synthesis in Pol \u03b1/CMG reactions in the absence or presence of Pol \u03b5. The first two lanes are Pol \u03b1/CMG on the leading (lane 1) and lagging (lane 2) strands. At the concentration used, Pol \u03b1 extended the leading strand DNA to about half of full length (lane 1), and the signal for Okazaki fragment synthesis was quite strong (lane 2). When Pol \u03b5 was added, it took over the leading strand and extended it full length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lane 3); however, lagging strand Okazaki fragments were inhibited, a result we did not expect (lane 4). We also tested a higher concentration of Pol \u03b5 to see if more Pol \u03b5 was required to efficiently extend the Okazaki fragments, but lagging strand synthesis was not enhanced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lane 6) (for quantification see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> right panel and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This result is contrary to conventional wisdom because one would normally expect more synthesis upon addition of more polymerase. This is especially true considering that Pol \u03b5 enhances the leading strand in the very same reaction in which it inhibits the lagging strand (i.e., the only difference is the radioisotope)."

Moreover, Pol \u03b5 suppresses Pol \u03b1, suggesting that Pol \u03b5 gains access to lagging strand primed sites but is inactive on them. Considering that Pol \u03b5 extends DNA on RPA-coated primed ssDNA in the absence of CMG (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wold, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Garg and Burgers, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>), it is possible that CMG controls the activity of Pol \u03b5 on the lagging strand. We further supported this observation in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> by titrating Pol \u03b5 into Pol \u03b1 priming reactions and monitoring lagging strand synthesis. As Pol \u03b5 is titrated into the reaction, Okazaki fragment synthesis is inhibited, confirming that Pol \u03b5 suppresses Pol \u03b1 polymerase but is unable to extend lagging strand primers (see quantification in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right panel). Although Pol \u03b5 inhibits Pol \u03b1 on the lagging strand, a combination of Pol \u03b5 and RFC/PCNA inhibits Pol \u03b1 more than either Pol \u03b5 or RFC/PCNA alone (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, lanes 1\u20132 and 4\u20137 vs lanes 8\u201311; quantification shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Inhibition of Pol \u03b1 synthesis by RFC/PCNA is also consistent with results in the SV40 system (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991</a>) and model studies using primed ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mossi et al., 2000</a>). Hence, RFC/PCNA contributes to the observed inhibition of Pol \u03b1 synthesis in addition to Pol \u03b5."

However, Pol \u03b4-PCNA is highly processive during synthesis of the 5.4 kb primed RPA-coated \u03d5X174 ssDNA under the 50 mM potassium glutamate conditions used in the 3 kb replisome assays (<a href=\"#bib26\">Langston and O'Donnell, 2008</a>). Pol \u03b4-PCNA has been shown to be much less processive in reactions containing 125 mM added NaOAc (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chilkova et al., 2007</a>). A high ionic strength is known to decrease processivity of enzymes, as the highly processive bacterial Pol III-\u03b2 clamp replicase is decreased significantly at 100 mM NaCl (<a href=\"#bib14\">Griep and McHenry, 1989</a>). Potassium glutamate is the physiological osmolyte in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Richey et al., 1987</a>), but to the authors' knowledge, neither the intracellular ionic strength nor the major intracellular osmolytes are known for budding yeast. We do not know why Pol \u03b4-PCNA is not very active on the leading strand with CMG. However, we have shown in this report that RFC/PCNA competes with Pol \u03b1 on the leading strand (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lanes 1\u20135), indicating that PCNA is in fact loaded onto the leading strand. We demonstrate in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> that Pol \u03b4 added to the reaction exacerbates inhibition of Pol \u03b1 in the presence of RFC/PCNA, while both Pol \u03b1 and Pol \u03b5 are active in the presence of CMG and the amount of RFC/PCNA used (see quantifications in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Hence, Pol \u03b4-PCNA does not function with CMG and severely competes and limits the function of Pol \u03b1 with CMG. The addition of Pol \u03b4 to reactions containing Pols \u03b1 and \u03b5 shows no significant effect on the leading strand reactions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The result of this three polymerase reaction is consistent with and anticipated from our earlier study of leading synthesis using primed forks (i.e., no Pol \u03b1) in which we demonstrate that Pol \u03b4 is inefficient and distributive on the leading strand and that Pol \u03b5 suppresses Pol \u03b4 by taking over the 3\u2032 primed site in the CMG-dependent leading strand reaction (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>)."

The continuous nature of the leading strand is relatively simple compared to the discontinuous process of the lagging strand. Indeed, PCNA and RFC were not even required for the leading strand (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>). There are a multitude of proteins that travel with eukaryotic replication forks, many of which have been identified in the large RPC assembly (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gambus et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2009</a>).

This stands in contrast to current views in which the mechanism of polymerase placement is thought to be via recruitment (i.e., each polymerase binds a particular protein on each strand). Indeed, polymerase recruitment by binding clamps and the helicase underlies attraction of polymerases to replication forks of bacteria, its phages, and the SV40 virus. Recruitment is also partly responsible for polymerase placement in eukaryotes. For example, Pol \u03b5 binds directly to CMG helicase, stabilizing it on the leading strand (<a href=\"#bib27\">Langston et al., 2014</a>). However, the current study reveals the importance of suppression of polymerase action to the specific use of Pol \u03b5 and Pol \u03b4 on the leading and lagging strands, respectively. Thus, Pol \u03b5 function is suppressed on the lagging strand, even when Pol \u03b4 is not present. Likewise, our earlier study, confirmed here, showed that Pol \u03b4-PCNA function is suppressed on the leading strand, even in the absence of Pol \u03b5 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>)."

Pol \u03b1 lacks the high fidelity of Pols \u03b5 and \u03b4 and does not provide bulk leading or lagging strand synthesis in cells, and thus processes must exist that suppress the polymerase activity of Pol \u03b1. In fact, we find many ways that Pol \u03b1 polymerase is suppressed. One mechanism is by Pol \u03b5 positioning on the lagging strand. Interestingly, Pol \u03b5 is also suppressed on the lagging strand; perhaps, Pol \u03b5 is suppressed from function on the lagging strand by the relative orientation in which CMG holds Pol \u03b5. On the leading strand, Pol \u03b5 simply prevents Pol \u03b1 polymerase extension by switching with it and becoming processive with CMG. This can be likened to the switch of Pol \u03b4 with Pol \u03b1 that prevents leading strand synthesis by Pol \u03b1 in the SV40 system (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991</a>). Pol \u03b1 polymerase activity is also inhibited by RFC/PCNA as shown in this report and an earlier study (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mossi et al., 2000</a>)."

Pol \u03b5 prevents further polymerase activity of Pol \u03b1 by trading places with it, probably by waiting for the distributive Pol \u03b1 to dissociate from DNA (diagram B); Pol \u03b5 then takes over the leading strand. Diagram C illustrates that Pol \u03b4/RFC/PCNA also switch with Pol \u03b1 but that Pol \u03b4-PCNA cannot function in the presence of CMG on the leading strand. However, Pol \u03b4-PCNA is uniquely capable of extending Okazaki fragments in the complete system (diagram D). Hence, the three-polymerase-CMG replisome is the product of polymerase suppression reactions that enable a unique asymmetric arrangement of DNA polymerases to advance the replication fork."

The distributive behavior of Pol \u03b4-PCNA with CMG suggests that CMG exerts a negative effect upon Pol \u03b4, causing it to frequently dissociate from PCNA/DNA. A possible explanation for how CMG may cause distributive behavior of Pol \u03b4 with PCNA/DNA lies in our earlier finding that Pol \u03b4 self-ejects from PCNA upon completing replication of a template (<a href=\"#bib26\">Langston and O'Donnell, 2008</a>). This property was originally noted for the highly processive <i>E. coli</i> Pol III replicase (<a href=\"#bib34\">O'Donnell, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Studwell et al., 1989</a>). Pol III remains firmly attached to the \u03b2 clamp until reaching the last nucleotide (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stukenberg et al., 1994</a>). This also holds true for T4 polymerase upon colliding with a hairpin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hacker and Alberts, 1994</a>). Self-ejection of polymerase is thought to be useful for recycling among numerous lagging strand primers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Benkovic et al., 2001</a>). In eukaryotes, however, the self-ejection process may be used to promote polymerase asymmetry at the fork. A straightforward mechanism could be that CMG occludes the leading strand ssDNA, tricking Pol \u03b4-PCNA to eject as if it were at the end of an Okazaki fragment. If CMG were to trigger the Pol \u03b4\u2212PCNA self-ejection process, it would result in distributive behavior of Pol \u03b4-PCNA, suppressing its activity on the leading strand. Another possible mechanism could be that the 3\u2032 terminus of the leading strand is sequestered and held in a posture that Pol \u03b4 cannot freely access."

Suppression of Pol \u03b1 by Pol \u03b5 on the lagging strand could perhaps be explained by competition of these polymerases for CMG, where Pol \u03b5 is suppressed from extending the primer. In this connection, the Pol2 gene encoding the catalytic polymerase actually contains two polymerase structures: the active polymerase/exonuclease on the N-terminal half and B-family polymerase in the C-terminal half of Pol2 that is presumed to be inactive (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tahirov et al., 2009</a>). One possible mechanism by which Pol \u03b5 may suppress synthesis on the lagging strand could be that CMG positions Pol \u03b5 such that the \u2018inactive polymerase\u2019 binds lagging strand primers, preventing their elongation by Pol \u03b1 and Pol \u03b5. Interestingly, genetic studies have shown that the C-terminal \u2018inactive polymerase\u2019 region of Pol \u03b5 is required for cell viability, while the N-terminal region containing the active polymerase is dispensable (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dua et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kesti et al., 1999</a>). The binding of Pol \u03b5 to CMG involves Dpb2, and possibly the Dpb3, Dpb4 subunits of Pol \u03b5, and regions of Pol2 as well. Expression and purification of a mutant Pol \u03b5 that lacks the active N-terminal half of Pol2 (\u0394N-Pol \u03b5) yields a 4-subunit complex, while the active polymerase half of Pol \u03b5 is monomeric (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hogg et al., 2014</a>). Hence, the \u0394N-Pol \u03b5 probably connects to CMG similar to wild-type Pol \u03b5 and may carry out a vital function at the fork. Alternatively, the C-terminal portion of Pol2 could be important to an origin activation step prior to replisome formation. Although direct evidence is lacking, Pol \u03b4 is presumed to function on the leading strand in the \u0394N-Pol \u03b5 genetic background. However, the finding in this report that Pol \u03b1 functions on the leading strand with CMG while Pol \u03b4-PCNA is suppressed leaves open the possibility that Pol \u03b1 could participate as the leading strand polymerase in \u0394N-Pol \u03b5 mutants."

This is the first study to reconstitute leading/lagging strand replication with three pure polymerases in a eukaryotic system. It reveals that many of the proteins that move with forks are not required to recapitulate leading/lagging strand synthesis in vitro. For example, Ctf4/AND-1 is essential in most cells (not in budding yeast), and yeast Ctf4 helps recruit Pol \u03b1 bind to RPCs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gambus et al., 2009</a>), yet the current study shows that Pol \u03b1 functionally interacts with CMG without Ctf4. Hence, the complete role of Ctf4 remains unknown. Likewise, the essential Mcm10 protein is known to bind Pol \u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Warren et al., 2009</a>), but this study shows that Mcm10 is not required for fork function in vitro. The same can be said for a myriad of proteins that form the RPC complex, including Mrc1, Csm3, Tof1, Topo I, Mcm10, Ctf4, and FACT complex (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gambus et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gambus et al., 2009</a>). It is important to note, however, that in vitro fork progression is 4\u20135 ntds/s, 5\u201310 times slower than in vivo measurements, and thus one or more of these proteins may be required to increase the rate of fork movement."

To make the forked junction, 1050 pmol 1T oligonucleotide was annealed to 175 pmol 160mer oligonucleotide, as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>). The 160mer is the leading strand template and contains a 3\u2032 biotin and three 3\u2032 terminal thiophosphate linkages, to protect against nucleases. The synthetic fork contains a 5\u2032-phosphorylated-ACCG overhang in the duplex region that ligates to the BsaI end of the 3.2 kb nucleotide-biased duplex. To protect the BtsCI end of the 3.2 kb duplex from excision and fill-in by the proofreading exonucleases of Pols \u03b4 and \u03b5, a short protecting duplex was ligated to the BtsCI end of the forked junction. The blocking duplex was formed upon annealing 350 pmol 5\u2032-tggttagtatagcaagtagagg-3\u2032 and 2100 pmol tctacttgctatactaaccat3\u2032-\u20323-dT. After ligation, this results in a 3.2 kb duplex with two 5\u2032 terminal nucleotides at one end, to resist digestion by 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease inherent in the DNA polymerases. Both the blocking duplex and the synthetic forked junction were present in the ligation reaction. Ligation was for 18 hr at 15\u00b0C with T4 DNA ligase. Excess non-ligated oligonucleotides were removed by gel filtration over a 20 ml bed volume of Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.44. Peak fractions containing the nucleotide-biased linear forked DNA were pooled and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. When the substrate was primed, a DNA oligonucleotide was annealed to the leading strand template, DNA 37mer (C2) as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Georgescu et al., 2014</a>)."
