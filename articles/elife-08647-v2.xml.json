However, the precise molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that KPNB1, an importin \u03b2 component of the ncRNA repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NRON) ribonucleoprotein complex, mediates nuclear translocation and repressor function of the PER/CRY complex. RNAi depletion of KPNB1 traps the PER/CRY complex in the cytoplasm by blocking nuclear entry of PER proteins in human cells. KPNB1 interacts mainly with PER proteins and directs PER/CRY nuclear transport in a circadian fashion. Interestingly, KPNB1 regulates the PER/CRY nuclear entry and repressor function, independently of importin \u03b1, its classical partner. Moreover, inducible inhibition of the conserved <i>Drosophila</i> importin \u03b2 in lateral neurons abolishes behavioral rhythms in flies. Collectively, these data show that KPNB1 is required for timely nuclear import of PER/CRY in the negative feedback regulation of the circadian clock."

However, the precise molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that KPNB1, an importin \u03b2 component of the ncRNA repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NRON) ribonucleoprotein complex, mediates nuclear translocation and repressor function of the PER/CRY complex. RNAi depletion of KPNB1 traps the PER/CRY complex in the cytoplasm by blocking nuclear entry of PER proteins in human cells. KPNB1 interacts mainly with PER proteins and directs PER/CRY nuclear transport in a circadian fashion. Interestingly, KPNB1 regulates the PER/CRY nuclear entry and repressor function, independently of importin \u03b1, its classical partner. Moreover, inducible inhibition of the conserved <i>Drosophila</i> importin \u03b2 in lateral neurons abolishes behavioral rhythms in flies. Collectively, these data show that KPNB1 is required for timely nuclear import of PER/CRY in the negative feedback regulation of the circadian clock."

Conserved components include the bHLH-PAS transactivators, CLOCK/NPAS2 (fly Clk) and BMAL1 (fly Cyc). This heterodimer binds E-box elements in the promoters of two families of transcriptional repressors, the <i>PER1/PER2/PER3</i> (fly <i>Per</i>) and <i>CRY1/CRY2</i> (fly <i>Cry</i>) genes. Once translated, PERs and CRYs (Per and Tim in flies) accumulate in a cytoplasmic complex and then translocate into the nucleus to repress the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer, thereby repressing their own transcription (<a href=\"#bib23\">Panda et al., 2002</a>). This primary negative-feedback loop is complemented by an ancillary loop, which while conserved, has different components in mammals and flies. In mammals, the ROR element binding repressors REV-ERB\u03b1/\u03b2 and activators ROR\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 drive rhythmic expression of <i>BMAL1</i>. In flies, vrille (dVRI) or PAR-domain protein-1 (dPDP1) make up this ancillary loop and stabilize the <i>Drosophila</i> clock by driving rhythmic expression of <i>Clk</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yu and Hardin, 2006</a>). Further modulation of these feedback circuits occurs at the post-translational level as core clock proteins undergo phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and protein degradation by several conserved kinases (CKI\u03b4/CKI\u03b5, GSK3\u03b2; double-time [dDBT] and shaggy [dSGG]), phosphatases (PP2A; dPP2A), and E3 ubiquitin ligases (FBXL3, FBXL21; dSLMB1) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gallego and Virshup, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hirano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Yoo et al., 2013</a>)."

KPNB1 can also directly recognize the cargo and facilitate nuclear transport independently of importin \u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lam et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Forwood et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ghildyal et al., 2005</a>).

However, the specific carrier molecules responsible for nuclear translocation of the clock proteins have not been fully elucidated.

Interestingly, in immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of cells expressing several flag-tagged clock proteins, knockdown of KPNB1 completely blocked (PER1, PER2), partly blocked (CRY1), or didn't significantly block (CRY2, REVERB\u03b1, CLOCK, CHRONO [<a href=\"#bib1\">Anafi et al., 2014</a>]) nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar to the flag-tagged proteins, microscopy and immunoblot analysis of cells expressing the Venus (V)-tagged clock proteins (PER1-V, PER2-V, CRY1-V, CRY2-V), KPNB1 knockdown markedly blocked PER1 and PER2 localization and slightly or negligibly effected CRY1 and CRY2 nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In many previous studies, PER and CRY proteins have been shown to work together (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tamanini et al., 2005</a>). Hence, we looked into the effect of KPNB1 knockdown on the subcellular localization of various PERs/CRYs complexes using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shyu et al., 2006</a>). The BiFC assay showed that KPNB1 depletion significantly impaired nuclear localization of various combinations of PER and CRY proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Notably, nuclear accumulation of the PER2/CRY1 complex was totally blocked by KPNB1 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In addition to ectopically expressed clock proteins, KPNB1 depletion substantially increased cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous PER1/2 and CRY1/2 proteins thus reducing their relative levels in nuclei in most cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

                                "text": "To investigate the detailed mechanism of the PER/CRY nuclear entry by KPNB1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with cells expressing the Venus-tagged PER and CRY proteins. KPNB1 interacted more strongly with PER1 and PER2 proteins than either CRY1 or CRY2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This suggested that PER proteins may play the leading role in PERs/CRYs nuclear translocation with KPNB1. In support of this, by IF KPNB1 co-localized with both cytoplasmic and nuclear PER2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Correspondingly, KPNB1 strongly interacted with the endogenous PER2 in co-immunoprecipitation analysis using mouse liver tissue extracts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To investigate the circadian role of KPNB1 in nuclear localization of PER/CRY, we prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from mouse liver tissues collected at 4 hr intervals for 24 hr in constant darkness. By immunoblot analysis, KPNB1 exhibited a circadian pattern of nucleocytoplasmic localization with its nuclear abundance peaking at circadian time (CT) 14\u201318, when the intensive nuclear accumulation of PER2 and CRY1 occurred (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Concomitantly, we observed the significant decrease of mRNA expression of E-box dependent clock genes (<i>Per1</i>, <i>Dbp</i>, <i>Nr1d1</i>, <i>Nr1d2</i>) targeted by the clock repressors in their nuclear accumulation phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, these data clearly suggest that KPNB1 is responsible for circadian nuclear import and repressor activity of the PER/CRY complex in clock gene expression in mouse liver."

In contrast, the parallel depletion of the other NRON complex nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins, <i>TNPO1, CSE1L</i>, did not significantly affect their repressor activities (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, [<a href=\"#bib39\">Willingham et al., 2005</a>]). In support of this, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis targeting the first E-box region of human <i>PER1</i> (<i>hPer1</i>) promoter revealed significantly less recruitment of both PER1 and PER2 to the CLOCK/BMAL1 responsive element in the KPNB1-depleted U2 OS cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). Moreover, the overall expression levels of several E-box dependent genes (<i>PER1</i>, <i>CRY1</i>, <i>DBP</i>, <i>REV-ERB\u03b2</i>) were upregulated as a result of <i>KPNB1</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), consistent with loss of repressor function.

Importantly, knockdown of <i>KPNB1</i> in U2 OS cells severely disturbed circadian bioluminescence reporter activity driven by the <i>Per2</i> promoter, whereas depletion of importin \u03b11 (<i>KPNA2</i>) or importin \u03b15 (<i>KPNA1</i>) did not affect the circadian rhythmicity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). These knockdown phenotypes correspond to previous reports showing that most of the other importin \u03b1 isoforms were not critical for circadian rhythmicity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). In conjunction with these results, fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that KPNA2 or KPNA1 depletion did not alter PER2 nuclear localization, which was completely blocked by KPNB1 depletion in U2 OS cells stably expressing PER2-Venus (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>). On the other hand, KPNB1 depletion severely disrupted circadian transcription of several clock genes (<i>PER1, PER2</i>) in dexamethasone (Dex)-synchronized cells with altered nuclear accumulation of PER and CRY proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Taken together, these data show that KPNB1 gates PER and CRY localization to the nucleus independently of importin \u03b1 and plays an indispensable role in negative feedback regulation of the circadian clock in human cells."

                                "text": "The majority of core clock components are conserved between flies (cycle, clk, per, cry) and humans (BMAL1/BMAL2, CLOCK/NPAS2, PER1/PER2/PER3, CRY1/CRY2), across 600 million years of evolution. Indeed, the kinases that regulate PER/CRY translocation to the nucleus are also conserved (dbt, sg; CKI\u03b5/CKI\u03b4, GSK3\u03b2). Because KPNB1 was required for rhythmicity in human cells, we investigated the role of the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog, Fs(2)Ket, <i>ketel</i>, in the fly clock by RNAi followed by locomotor activity monitoring (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mason and Goldfarb, 2009</a>). We used the UAS/Gal4 system to target UAS-<i>ketel</i> RNAi to clock cells in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>). <i>dicer</i> was also co-expressed to increase the RNA interference effect (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dietzl et al., 2007</a>). Behavioral analysis of flies expressing UAS ketel RNAi in central clock cells, targeted by the relatively weak Pigment dispersing factor (Pdf)-Gal4 driver, revealed that 62% of flies exhibited no rhythms in constant darkness (DD). Although 38% of flies were rhythmic, their rhythm strength determined by fast Fourier transform (FFT) value was low (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). With a strong tim-UAS-Gal4 driver that is expressed in all clock cells, 100% of flies were arrhythmic (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). To exclude possible developmental effects on behavioral phenotypes in <i>ketel</i> knockdown flies, we restricted the <i>ketel</i> dsRNA expression to adult PDF<sup>+</sup> neurons using the <i>pdf</i> Gene Switch (<i>pdf</i>-GS). We crossed <i>ketel</i> RNAi transgenic flies with <i>pdf</i>-GS and then drove <i>ketel</i> dsRNAs expression with a drug (RU486) during adulthood (<a href=\"#bib21\">McGuire et al., 2004</a>). After 6\u20137 days in constant darkness, this conditional knockdown of <i>ketel</i> also resulted in weak to arrhythmic locomotor activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). 81% of flies were arrhythmic and the rest showed weak rhythmicity with low FFT values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). These results show that importin \u03b2 in PDF+ neurons is required for normal locomotor rhythms in adult flies."

The NRON complex also contains several molecules involved in protein stability and, critical for this study, nuclear translocation (KPNB1, TNPO1, CSEL1).

These data suggest KPNB1 drives circadian nuclear entry of PER/CRY. This raises the question: what causes phase-dependent KPNB1 nuclear entry? Most recently, it was reported that intracellular calcium levels regulate importin \u03b2-dependent nuclear import (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaur et al., 2014</a>). Further, a previous model suggests that KPNB1 nuclear-translocates NFAT immediately after stimulation dependent intracellular calcium influx (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>). In this regard, several studies have demonstrated the important function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in circadian clock regulation. For example, periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the cytosol, resulting from circadian variation in membrane potential or by the release of Ca(2+) from ryanodine-sensitive stores in SCN neurons, is a critical process for circadian pacemaker function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ikeda et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lundkvist et al., 2005</a>). Based on this evidence, we postulate that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rhythms contribute to driving timely nuclear localization of KPNB1 and its PER/CRY cargo as a critical step in negative feedback regulation of the clock."

More recent evidence shows that KPNB1 can function as nuclear transport receptor independently of importin \u03b1 by directly recognizing substrates such as CREB, AP-1 transcription factors, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lam et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Forwood et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ghildyal et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, a previous report showed that importin \u03b1 isoforms (RCH, QIP-1, NPI-2) mediate nuclear localization of CRY2 through direct interactions but did not investigate the functional consequence of this interaction (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sakakida et al., 2005</a>). In this regard, our data suggest that in mammals KPNB1 mediates nuclear localization of the PER/CRY complex independently of importin \u03b1, as overexpression of a KPNB1 mutant lacking an importin \u03b1 interaction domain had a similar phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with this, both KPNA2 and KPNA1, the well-known KPNB1 interacting importin alpha proteins (importin \u03b11, importin \u03b15), when depleted in cells, did not affect circadian rhythmicity or subcellular localization of PER2 or CRY2 protein (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In a recent report, cytoplasmic retention of PER proteins was accelerated by <i>KPNA2</i> overexpression in mouse stem cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Umemura et al., 2014</a>). However, intriguingly we found that <i>KPNA2</i> overexpression substantially reduced cells expressing PER2-Venus protein in our imaging studies (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Moreover, both the endogenous and overexpressed KPNA2 protein localized predominantly in the nucleus, which was confirmed by nuclear cytoplasmic fraction Western analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This suggests that KPNA2 might regulate PER2 protein level through an unknown mechanism in U2 OS cells.

Similarly, knockdown of KPNB1 increased cytoplasmic retention of endogenous PER1, PER2, CRY1, and CRY2 to varying degrees, probably through complex interactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The immunoprecipitation analysis showed that KPNB1 interacted strongly with PERs compared with CRYs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These data suggest that the PERs mediate interaction with KPNB1 and gate nuclear translocation of PER/CRY complex. This is reminiscent of a previous report indicating that the nuclear entry of CRY is mainly dependent on PER, in vivo (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 2001</a>). Finally, knockdown of KPNB1 or its fly ortholog <i>ketel</i> resulted in arrhythmic U2 OS cells or fly locomotor activity rhythms, while knockdown of most of KPNA isoforms had no significant effect on the rhythm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

(2005)</a> demonstrated that importin \u03b1 family members (including importin \u03b11, KPNA2) control nuclear translocation of CRY2 but not importin \u03b2. The data from Sakakida et al., is consistent with this study showing that depletion of KPNB1 produces minimal effects on CRY2 translocation and partial effects on CRY1 translocation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Based on these two studies, this reviewer thinks that Importin \u03b11 might control translocation of mainly CRY2 and some of CRY1. This is somewhat similar to the case of flies, where translocation of TIM (fly counterpart of CRY at least in the functional aspect) is controlled by importin \u03b11 (Jang AR et al., Plos Genetics 2014, <i>Drosophila</i> TIM binds importin \u03b11, and acts as an adapter to transport PER to the nucleus). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> luciferase results indicated that CRY1/CRY2 represses even better than PER1/PER2. Then, confusion comes from the data showing KPNA1 deficiency did not produce any defects in cellular rhythms. Thus, this reviewer is wondering how CRY2 localized in KPNA1 knockdown cells. By performing this experiment we might be able to clarify the reason why KPNA1 depletion did not produce any effects on cellular rhythms. Is that due to either (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</a>) KPNA1 does not playing any role in translocation of clock proteins (mainly CRY2) on the contrary to previous report and different from the fly case (or there might be cell-type specific issue?) or (<a href=\"#bib27\">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</a>) nuclear translocation defects of CRY2 not producing any effects on feedback repression suggesting that main repressor of feedback circuitry is PER not CRY?"

In another paper lead by some of the authors in this study, they demonstrated that importin \u03b11 protein is critical for nuclear translocation of fly circadian repressor complex PER/TIM, through direct interaction between TIM and importin \u03b11 (Jang AR et al., Plos Genetics, 2014). There, Jang AR et al. proposed the model in which TIM bound to importin \u03b11 acts as a carrier for PER translocation together with importin \u03b2. Thus, this reviewer is wondering whether nuclear translocation of TIM is also inhibited in <i>ketel</i> mutant, which will be a slightly different case to the mammals. Or, very little amounts of PER translocate to the nucleus in a TIM-independent manner through <i>ketel</i>. The authors showed only the PER patterns in <i>ketel</i> knockdown flies. By showing TIM patterns in <i>ketel</i> knockdown flies, it will be clarified that PER translocate into the nucleus as a PER/TIM/importin \u03b11/importin \u03b2 complex or via two pathways one is TIM/importin \u03b11 dependent and the other is <i>ketel</i> dependent as in mammals."

The authors clearly show that KPNB1 critically regulates the nuclear translocation of PER proteins which are largely independent from CRY proteins in U2OS cells. Interestingly, a knock-down of KPNB1 blocked the nuclear translocation of the PER/CRY complex, suggesting that PER proteins played a dominant role in the nuclear translocation of the PER/CRY complex in mammalian cells. In addition, the authors exhibit that the loss of KPNA2 does not block the nuclear translocation of PER proteins and circadian molecular rhythms in mammalian cells. Moreover, the authors show that a decrease in <i>Drosophila</i> Importin \u03b2 also blocks the nuclear translocation of PER proteins and results in the severe impairment of circadian locomotor activity rhythms in flies. By gathering these findings, the authors conclude that KPNB1 is the essential factor to elicit the cyclic nuclear translocation of PER/CRY in the negative-feedback regulation of the circadian clock."

On the other hand, KPNA2 highly expressed in early embryo or pluripotent stem cells as well as in some cancer cells. For example, the expression level of the Kpna2 transcript is extremely low in adult mice liver (Koike et al., Science, 2012). In addition, it has recently been reported that KPNA2 accelerates cytoplasmic localization of proteins in some cases (e.g. Yasuhara et al., Mol. Cell, 2012; Alshareeda et al., Br. J. Cancer, 2015). Through the accumulated findings, KPNA2 has been thought to be a unique protein among the KPNAs, and does not represent the function of other KPNAs in somatic cells. Thus, the reviewer feels curious as to why the authors performed knock-down study against KPNA2 instead of KPNA1 or any other KPNAs. The authors might have taken into account a recently reported study which mentioned KPNA2 as a factor to obstruct circadian clock cycling in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Umemura et al., PNAS, 2014). Umemura et al. showed the high level expression of KPNA2 and cytoplasmic retention of PER protein in undifferentiated ES cells. In addition, overexpression of KPNA2 did not facilitate nuclear translocation, rather accelerated cytoplasmic retention of PER proteins. Strikingly, the authors here clearly showed that knock-down of KPNA2 in U2OS cells resulted in the exclusive nuclear localization of PER2 and increased amplitude of <i>Per2</i>:dluc circadian rhythms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). These results are all well compatible with the results mentioned in the paper by Umemura et al. Therefore, the reviewer recommends that the authors discuss this point."

On the other hand, KPNA2 highly expressed in early embryo or pluripotent stem cells as well as in some cancer cells. For example, the expression level of the Kpna2 transcript is extremely low in adult mice liver (Koike et al., Science, 2012). In addition, it has recently been reported that KPNA2 accelerates cytoplasmic localization of proteins in some cases (e.g. Yasuhara et al., Mol. Cell, 2012; Alshareeda et al., Br. J. Cancer, 2015). Through the accumulated findings, KPNA2 has been thought to be a unique protein among the KPNAs, and does not represent the function of other KPNAs in somatic cells. Thus, the reviewer feels curious as to why the authors performed knock-down study against KPNA2 instead of KPNA1 or any other KPNAs. The authors might have taken into account a recently reported study which mentioned KPNA2 as a factor to obstruct circadian clock cycling in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Umemura et al., PNAS, 2014). Umemura et al. showed the high level expression of KPNA2 and cytoplasmic retention of PER protein in undifferentiated ES cells. In addition, overexpression of KPNA2 did not facilitate nuclear translocation, rather accelerated cytoplasmic retention of PER proteins.
