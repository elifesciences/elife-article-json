                    "text": "The master spindle checkpoint kinase Mps1 senses kinetochore-microtubule attachment and promotes checkpoint signaling to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. The kinetochore scaffold Knl1, when phosphorylated by Mps1, recruits checkpoint complexes Bub1\u2013Bub3 and BubR1\u2013Bub3 to unattached kinetochores. Active checkpoint signaling ultimately enhances the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) consisting of BubR1\u2013Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20, which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome bound to Cdc20 (APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>) to delay anaphase onset. Using in vitro reconstitution, we show that Mps1 promotes APC/C inhibition by MCC components through phosphorylating Bub1 and Mad1. Phosphorylated Bub1 binds to Mad1\u2013Mad2. Phosphorylated Mad1 directly interacts with Cdc20. Mutations of Mps1 phosphorylation sites in Bub1 or Mad1 abrogate the spindle checkpoint in human cells. Therefore, Mps1 promotes checkpoint activation through sequentially phosphorylating Knl1, Bub1, and Mad1. This sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade makes the checkpoint highly responsive to Mps1 and to kinetochore-microtubule attachment."

                    "text": "The master spindle checkpoint kinase Mps1 senses kinetochore-microtubule attachment and promotes checkpoint signaling to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. The kinetochore scaffold Knl1, when phosphorylated by Mps1, recruits checkpoint complexes Bub1\u2013Bub3 and BubR1\u2013Bub3 to unattached kinetochores. Active checkpoint signaling ultimately enhances the assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) consisting of BubR1\u2013Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20, which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome bound to Cdc20 (APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>) to delay anaphase onset. Using in vitro reconstitution, we show that Mps1 promotes APC/C inhibition by MCC components through phosphorylating Bub1 and Mad1. Phosphorylated Bub1 binds to Mad1\u2013Mad2. Phosphorylated Mad1 directly interacts with Cdc20. Mutations of Mps1 phosphorylation sites in Bub1 or Mad1 abrogate the spindle checkpoint in human cells. Therefore, Mps1 promotes checkpoint activation through sequentially phosphorylating Knl1, Bub1, and Mad1. This sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade makes the checkpoint highly responsive to Mps1 and to kinetochore-microtubule attachment."

This interaction requires phosphorylation of Bub1 by both Cdk1 and Mps1, and is critical for spindle checkpoint activation in human cells. We have in vitro reconstituted checkpoint-dependent APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition by MCC components, which requires a functional phospho-Bub1\u2013Mad1 scaffold. Furthermore, we have found that Mps1 directly phosphorylates Mad1 in its CTD. Phosphorylated Mad1 CTD directly binds to the N-terminal region of Cdc20 and contributes to APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition presumably through stimulating MCC assembly. Therefore, Mps1 activates the spindle checkpoint through a three-step phosphorylation cascade. Phosphorylation of Knl1 by Mps1 enables Bub1 recruitment. Phosphorylation of Bub1 by Mps1 establishes the Bub1\u2013Mad1 interaction. Phosphorylation of Mad1 by Mps1 positions Cdc20 for MCC assembly. We propose that this sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade makes the checkpoint highly responsive to Mps1 whose function is directly regulated by kinetochore-microtubule attachment."

This finding is consistent with the fact that Bub1 S459 is followed by a proline, and matches the minimal Cdk1 substrate consensus of [S/T]P. We next confirmed that Myc-Bub1 was indeed phosphorylated in mitotic HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interestingly, Bub1 S459 phosphorylation in mitosis was reduced upon treatment of the Mps1 inhibitor, reversine. Because recombinant Bub1 protein was not phosphorylated at S459 by Mps1 in vitro, the effect of Mps1 inhibition on S459 phosphorylation may be indirectly through checkpoint inactivation.

An attractive hypothesis is that phosphorylation of S459 in human Bub1 by Cdk1 similarly enables its binding to Mad1. However, despite repeated attempts, we could not detect binding between Mad1 and recombinant Bub1<sup>\u0394K</sup>\u2013Bub3 phosphorylated by Cdk1 in vitro. We decided to first examine whether phosphorylation of T453 of scBub1 (which corresponds to S459 in human Bub1) was required for binding to scMad1. Because the full-length Mad1 was difficult to express, we used a C-terminal fragment of Mad1 (Mad1<sup>E</sup>) that contains both the Mad2-interacting motif (MIM) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Co-expression of scBub1<sub>369\u2013608</sub> with the kinase domain of scMps1 in bacteria led to phosphorylation of the scBub1 fragment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib43\">London and Biggins, 2014</a>), only the phosphorylated scBub1 bound to the scMad1<sup>E</sup>\u2013scMad2 complex. Internal deletion of the CM rendered scBub1<sub>369\u2013608</sub> unable to bind to scMad1\u2013Mad2, indicating a requirement of this motif in this interaction. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis showed that the smaller phosphorylated scBub1<sub>449\u2013530</sub> fragment containing the CM bound to scMad1\u2013Mad2 with a moderate affinity of 2.2 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, this phospho-scBub1 fragment bound to the CTD of scMad1 with a similar affinity, indicating that Mad1 CTD is sufficient for the scBub1\u2013scMad1 interaction, and Mad2 and the MIM of Mad1 are not required for this interaction."

Our mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all three residues were phosphorylated in scBub1<sub>449\u2013530</sub> co-expressed with scMps1. We next synthesized scBub1 CM phospho-peptides containing pT453 or pT455 or both. We could not test the contribution of scBub1 pS458 to scMad1 binding, because the synthesis of pS458-containing peptides failed for unknown reasons. Both the singly phosphorylated pT455 peptide and the doubly phosphorylated pT453-pT455 peptide, but not the singly phosphorylated pT453 peptide, bound efficiently to scMad1 CTD (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Mutating the conserved RLK motif in Mad1 CTD abolished scMad1 binding to both scBub1 phospho-CM peptides. Furthermore, ITC analysis showed that the pT455 and pT453-pT455 peptides bound to scMad1 CTD with the same affinity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, Mps1-dependent phosphorylation of scBub1 at T455 alone is sufficient to establish scBub1\u2013scMad1 binding. The scBub1\u2013scMad1 interaction is mainly mediated by phospho-T455 of scBub1 and the RLK motif of scMad1. We note that phosphorylation of the T455 site in scBub1 has been previously reported (<a href=\"#bib43\">London and Biggins, 2014</a>), and mutation of this residue disrupts scBub1\u2013scMad1 binding and causes benomyl sensitivity in yeast cells, establishing the functional relevance of this phosphorylation event."

ITC assays confirmed that human Mad1 bound with higher affinity to the pS459-pT461 peptide than to the pT461 peptide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). As a specificity control, binding of both peptides was reduced by mutating the RLK motif in Mad1 CTD. Interestingly, the triply phosphorylated pS459-pT461-pT464 peptide bound more weakly to Mad1 than the pS459-pT461 peptide, indicating that phosphorylation of T464 had an inhibitory effect.

The pSpT antibody did not recognize the Bub1<sup>\u0394K</sup>S459A/T461A (SATA) mutant treated with both Cdk1 and Mps1, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody. The weak signal seen with Cdk1 alone was likely due to cross-reactivity of the pSpT antibody with Bub1 singly phosphorylated at S459. We then tested the order of these two Cdk1- and Mps1-mediated phosphorylation events. When we first incubated Bub1<sup>\u0394K</sup> with Cdk1 to phosphorylate S459 and then inhibited Cdk1 with RO3306, subsequent addition of Mps1 led to efficient phosphorylation at T461, as detected by the pSpT antibody (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast, when we first incubated Bub1<sup>\u0394K</sup> with Mps1, inhibited Mps1 with reversine, and then added Cdk1, Bub1<sup>\u0394K</sup> was still efficiently phosphorylated at S459, but was only weakly phosphorylated at T461, as revealed by a weak pSpT signal. This result suggests that phosphorylation of Bub1 at S459 and T461 by Cdk1 and Mps1 occurs sequentially (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Cdk1 phosphorylation at S459 primes Mps1 phosphorylation at T461.

Moreover, as we showed previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jia et al., 2016</a>), partial depletion of Bub1 and inhibition of Plk1 by BI 2536 synergistically inactivated the spindle checkpoint and reduced nocodazole-triggered mitotic arrest (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>).

Because we could not deplete Mad1 to sufficiently low levels to reveal a defect in nocodazole-dependent mitotic arrest, we adopted a previously reported strategy that involved the artificial targeting of Mad1 to kinetochores through a fusion to Mis12, a subunit of the outer kinetochore Mis12 complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Maldonado and Kapoor, 2011</a>). Expression of the Mis12\u2013Mad1 fusion protein caused spontaneous mitotic arrest, which was dependent on Mps1, BubR1, and Mad2, indicating that this arrest required an active spindle checkpoint (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>). Consistent with previous studies in yeast and human cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballister et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Heinrich et al., 2014</a>), the Mis12\u2013Mad1 fusion proteins with the MIM or RLK motifs mutated failed to induce the mitotic arrest. Thus, both the Mad2-binding and Bub1-binding activities are critical for the checkpoint function of Mad1. Taken together, our results establish the functional importance of the phosphorylation-dependent Bub1\u2013Mad1 interaction in the spindle checkpoint in human cells."

Although neither Bub1 nor Mad1 is a component of MCC, they both directly interact with MCC components. The constitutive Mad1\u2013C-Mad2 complex interacts with O-Mad2 and converts it to I-Mad2, which can bind to Cdc20 to form the Cdc20\u2013C-Mad2 complex. Furthermore, several previous studies have characterized the direct, checkpoint-relevant binding of Bub1 to Cdc20 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Di Fiore et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kang et al., 2008</a>).

Remarkably, Mps1 inhibition by reversine, mutations of S459 and T461 in Bub1 (SATA), or mutation of the Mad1 RLK motif (RLK/AAA) all greatly weakened APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition by the MCC mixture.

Mutating all identified phosphorylation sites in Mis12\u2013Mad1 (YF-14A) abolished the mitotic arrest exerted by this fusion protein.

Mass spectrometry analysis of the endogenous Mad1 immunoprecipitated from mitotic HeLa cells did not produce coverage of the T644 or T716 regions. We thus generated a phospho-specific antibody against Mad1 phospho-T716, and confirmed that ectopically expressed Mad1 (with its MIM mutated to alanine\u00a0prevent checkpoint inactivation; MIM/5A) was indeed phosphorylated at T716 during mitosis in human cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

In addition, we have identified novel phosphorylation events of Mad1 by Mps1, which are also required for checkpoint activation and APC/C inhibition. As a master kinase in the spindle checkpoint, Mps1 establishes a phosphorylation cascade by sequentially phosphorylating Knl1, Bub1, and Mad1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

In human cells, the Bub1\u2013Mad1 interaction is likely buttressed by other factors at mitotic kinetochores.

The negatively charged phospho-S459 can serve the same purpose as the \u22122 acidic residue in the substrate recognition by Mps1. This type of Cdk1-primed Mps1 phosphorylation consensus likely exists in other Mps1 substrates. To our surprise, Mad1 T716 and adjacent residues do not match the consensus of Mps1 substrates. The MELT motifs of Knl1, Bub1 T461, and Mad1 T644 are all located in loops or flexible regions. In contrast, although it is surface exposed, Mad1 T716 resides in a well-folded \u03b1 helix.

Two phosphorylation-dependent molecular interactions, the Bub1\u2013Mad1 interaction and the Mad1\u2013Cdc20 interaction, are critical for the assembly and proper function of the scaffold. We have dissected the individual contributions of these two interactions to MCC assembly and APC/C inhibition in vitro. For example, to define the function of Bub1\u2013Mad1 in MCC assembly, we eliminated the effect of Mad1 phosphorylation by Mps1 through inhibiting Mps1 prior to the addition of Mad1, and through the use of Cdc20<sup>\u0394N60</sup>, which no longer interacts with phosphorylated Mad1. Likewise, to assay the contribution of Mad1\u2013Cdc20 to MCC assembly, we simply omitted Bub1 to eliminate its contribution. Although either interaction suffices to promote MCC assembly in vitro, disruption of either Bub1\u2013Mad1 or Mad1\u2013Cdc20 interactions in human cells largely abolished checkpoint activation Therefore, these two interactions likely cooperate with each other to promote checkpoint signaling in vivo.

The scBub1 phospho-peptides or purified scMps1-phosphorylated scBub1<sub>449\u2013530</sub> fragment (300 \u00b5M) in the HEPES Buffer I or the human Bub1 phospho-peptides (500 \u00b5M) in the HEPES Buffer II were injected with an injection syringe in 19 2-\u03bcl\u00a0portions. The\u00a0raw data were processed and fitted with the NITPIC software package (<a href=\"#bib30\">Keller et al., 2012</a>)."

However, a mechanistic understanding of the catalytic assembly of the MCC at the kinetochore is still missing. In this study the authors provide important insights in the role of the kinases Cdk1 and Mps1 in promoting the interaction between Bub1 and Mad1 in human cells. In addition, they reveal a new function of MAD1 in recruiting Cdc20. Through in vitro reconstitution, they demonstrate that these interactions help to bring together the core components of the MCC, enabling its assembly. The work is of high quality and the findings are of great interest for the SAC field."
