Here, we solve the structure of double-knot toxin (DkTx), a tarantula toxin that activates the heat-activated TRPV1 channel. We also provide improved structures of TRPV1 with and without the toxin bound, and investigate the interactions of DkTx with the channel and membranes. We find that DkTx binds to the outer edge of the external pore of TRPV1 in a counterclockwise configuration, using a limited protein-protein interface and inserting hydrophobic residues into the bilayer. We also show that DkTx partitions naturally into membranes, with the two lobes exhibiting opposing energetics for membrane partitioning and channel activation. Finally, we find that the toxin disrupts a cluster of hydrophobic residues behind the selectivity filter that are critical for channel activation. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mode of toxin-channel recognition that has important implications for the mechanism of thermosensation."

Here, we solve the structure of double-knot toxin (DkTx), a tarantula toxin that activates the heat-activated TRPV1 channel. We also provide improved structures of TRPV1 with and without the toxin bound, and investigate the interactions of DkTx with the channel and membranes. We find that DkTx binds to the outer edge of the external pore of TRPV1 in a counterclockwise configuration, using a limited protein-protein interface and inserting hydrophobic residues into the bilayer. We also show that DkTx partitions naturally into membranes, with the two lobes exhibiting opposing energetics for membrane partitioning and channel activation. Finally, we find that the toxin disrupts a cluster of hydrophobic residues behind the selectivity filter that are critical for channel activation. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mode of toxin-channel recognition that has important implications for the mechanism of thermosensation."

This protein is found in the membranes of a particular type of nerve cell, and it forms a pore that allows certain ions to pass through the membrane. Along with sensing heat, TRPV1 can also be activated by a toxin called double-knot toxin \u2013 which is found in spider venom \u2013 and by capsaicin, the active ingredient in chilli peppers."

Here, Bae, Anselmi et al. use a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to produce a detailed model of the 3D structure of double-knot toxin. This model is then combined with 3D maps of TRPV1 from previous studies to predict where the toxin binds to TRPV1. This suggests that the toxin binds to a section of TRPV1 that is buried within the membrane. Moreover, the new models highlight a 'hydrophobic' region of the TRPV1 channel that may work as the heat sensor."

These toxins, which typically contain multiple disulfide bonds that stabilize their tertiary structure (<a href=\"#bib56\">Norton and Pallaghy, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pallaghy et al., 1994</a>), activate or inhibit ion channel proteins that open and close in response to membrane voltage (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cestele et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Milescu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997a</a>), binding of neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib14\">Celie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dellisanti et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ulens et al., 2006</a>) or other sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bohlen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>).

For example, the scorpion toxin charybdotoxin binds to the extracellular side of the pore of potassium channels to physically block the flow of ions (<a href=\"#bib50\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1988</a>). A recent X-ray structure of a complex between charybdotoxin and the Kv1.2-2.1 paddle chimera channel revealed that this block is effected by a lysine residue that the toxin inserts into the selectivity filter of the channel, mimicking a K<sup>+</sup> ion (<a href=\"#bib6\">Banerjee et al., 2013</a>). Another example is the tarantula toxin PcTx1, which activates acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) by clamping onto helix 5 within the large extracellular domain of the channel, and inserting an Arg finger motif into a subunit interface where protons bind (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dawson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Salinas et al., 2006</a>). The ASIC channel was also crystalized in complex with MitTx (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baconguis et al., 2014</a>), a structurally distinct two-subunit snake toxin that binds to an extended region of the extracellular domain of the channel, stabilizing it in an open conformation. The general principle of toxins binding to ion channels within aqueous environments is further illustrated by X-ray structures of a glutamate-activated cation channel in complex with the cone snail toxin con-ikot-ikot (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2014</a>), and of the extracellular domains of Cys-loop receptors in complex with cone snail or snake toxins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Celie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dellisanti et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ulens et al., 2006</a>). These striking structures not only reveal in great detail the nature of toxin-channel interactions in solution, but also provide valuable insights into the operational mechanisms of an array of ion channels. This notwithstanding, it has been recently suggested that certain types of toxins can target domains within ion channel proteins that are embedded within the lipid membrane. For example, tarantula toxins that modify the gating of voltage-activated ion channels partition into membranes and are thought to bind to the voltage-sensing domains within the membrane environment (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gupta et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lee and MacKinnon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mihailescu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Milescu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Phillips et al., 2005b</a>). Thus far, however, no structures of toxin-channel complexes have been solved for this class of toxins, and therefore our understanding of toxin-channel interactions within membrane environments is limited."

TRPV1 is a cation channel expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons that plays important roles in the transduction of noxious stimuli as well as thermosensation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Julius, 2013</a>), but the molecular mechanism of heat-dependent activation has remained elusive. From a structural perspective, DkTx is intriguing because it has an unusual bivalent architecture, being comprised of two inhibitor-cysteine-knot (ICK) motifs that have been designated as the K1 and K2 lobes. DkTx is also quite hydrophobic, requiring the use of detergents to efficiently fold in vitro (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2012</a>), which raises the possibility that the toxin might interact with TRPV1 in a membrane environment, similar to toxins targeting voltage-sensing domains of voltage-activated ion channels. In a recent breakthrough, near-atomic resolution structures of the TRPV1 channel were solved using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), including a closed state (apo), a capsaicin-bound state, and an open state with both DkTx and the vanilloid resiniferatoxin (RTx) bound (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liao et al., 2013</a>). The structure of the complex between TRPV1 and DkTx/RTx unambiguously reveals that the DkTx lobes bind to sites at the periphery of the external pore of the channel. However, the resolution of electron density maps was insufficient to reveal the structure of DkTx in atomic detail. Therefore, the binding arrangement of the two DkTx knots is unknown, as is the nature of the interactions between toxin and channel, or whether the interaction occurs in aqueous or membrane environments. How DkTx recognition ultimately results in channel opening, and how this process might relate to the mechanism of temperature-sensing, are also open questions."

We also investigate the interaction of the toxin with the TRPV1 channel and lipid membranes using fluorescence spectroscopy, electrophysiological recordings and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results demonstrate that DkTx interacts intimately with TRPV1 while inserting hydrophobic residues into the surrounding lipid membrane, and provide the first example of a complex structure between toxin and channel within a membrane environment. Comparison of the improved structures of apo and toxin-bound TRPV1 reveals novel insights into the mechanism by which DkTx induces channel opening, and provides new insight into the mechanism of thermosensation."

Because previous studies have demonstrated that the two lobes (or knots) of the toxin, K1 and K2, can fold independently and can also activate the TRPV1 channel (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>), we synthesized K1 and K2 individually using solid-phase peptide synthesis. The full-length toxin was also produced recombinantly, with and without <sup>15</sup>N-labeling. All constructs were folded in vitro in the presence of detergent, and correctly folded species were purified using reversed-phase HPLC. Our strategy was to first use two-dimensional (2D) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) to study each of the lobes separately, because these measurements would yield less crowded spectra and thus facilitate the assignment of a greater number of cross-peaks, which could then be translated into nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) inter-proton distance restraints for structure determination. We then conducted additional NMR experiments using <sup>15</sup>N labeled DkTx, taking advantage of the separation of overlapped spectra in 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H NOESY using <sup>15</sup>N, and compared the backbone proton resonances of K1 and K2 with the full-length protein."

Two notable differences between K1 and K2 are the length of loop 3, which is longer in K1 than in K2, and the configuration of a tryptophan side-chain in loop 2 (W11 in K1 and W53 in K2), which is more solvent accessible in K1 (154 \u00b1 16 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>)\u00a0than in K2 (132 \u00b1 7 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>). The latter stems from actual differences in the NOESY spectra for K1 and K2; the number of NOE cross-peaks between the conserved Trp in loop 2 and the conserved Ile and Pro residues in loop 4 are fewer in K1 than in K2. The likely cause of this structural difference is a serine (S10) to glycine (G52) substitution at the first position in loop 2, which seems to allow this loop to bend towards loop 4 in K2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>)."

These extensive and well-conserved hydrophobic surfaces are consistent with our previous finding that detergents are critical for efficient refolding of the toxin\u00a0in vitro, and with the observation that folded DkTx is more hydrophobic than the linear form (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2012</a>).

Notwithstanding the groundbreaking insights provided by these cryo-EM maps, the associated structural models deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are objectively suboptimal in several respects. Aside from the missing backbone fragments and side-chains in unresolved regions, the published structural models show a significant number of stereochemical violations and steric overlaps (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>). As an example, the MolProbity score, which is a standardized metric of model quality among structures of comparable resolution, ranks PDB entries 3J5Q and 3J5P in the 29th and 36th percentile, respectively (with 100th percentile being the best score). A specific issue pertaining to the published model of the TRPV1/DkTx/RTx complex is that it is based on a map with imposed fourfold symmetry, despite the fact that the two DkTx lobes are not identical and thus the appropriate symmetry for the complex would be twofold. More importantly, in the published structure of the TRPV1/DkTx/RTx complex, the toxin is modeled as a poly-alanine chain based on the structure of hanatoxin because an atomic-resolution structure of DkTx had not yet been solved. Assignment of the K1 and K2 knots to the EM map was therefore not possible, and so the nature of their interaction with the channel or the membrane has remained unclear."

This approach enabled us to develop atomic models of apo TRPV1 and the TRPV1-DkTx complex that are considerably improved; the updated MolProbity scores rank these complete models in the 92nd and 80th percentile, respectively, while maintaining the original quality of the fit to the experimental cryo-EM maps (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>). To construct the model of the TRPV1-DkTx complex, we used an unpublished cryo-EM map with imposed twofold symmetry, kindly provided by Yifan Cheng and colleagues. Although the resolution of this map is somewhat inferior to that of the fourfold symmetrized map utilized originally (4.3\u2009\u00c5 compared to 3.8\u2009\u00c5), densities for each of the four DxTk knots (two per toxin) are clearly discernable. We initially docked the NMR structures of K1 and K2 into these densities using Xplor-NIH, in either a clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) configuration (viewed from the extracellular side), optimizing the fit of each lobe to the EM map while also applying NOE distance restraints within each knot (based on the 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H NMR experiments for K1 and K2 in solution). These two partial models were then input into ROSETTA, which was then used to generate a randomized ensemble of 100 models of the complete TRPV1-DkTx complex for each K1-K2 configuration. Analysis of these two ensembles shows that the majority of the 100 CCW models fit to the experimental cryo-EM map significantly better, and also have a better ROSETTA score, than the majority of the 100 CW models (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This result is consistent with the observation that the number of NOE-restraint violations in the CW initial seed model generated with Xplor-NIH was twice as large as for the CCW model, for a comparable fit quality (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We can therefore conclude unambiguously that DkTx binds to the outer pore of TRPV1 in a CCW configuration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D,F</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

These two loops straddle the interface between TRPV1 subunits, with loop 2 capping the S6 helix from one subunit, while loop 4 localizes near the N-terminus of the re-entrant pore helix from the adjacent subunit. Scanning mutagenesis previously identified four residues within the outer pore domain of TRPV1, namely I599A at the top of S5, F649A in the pore loop, and both A657P and F659A at the top of S6, where mutations disrupt activation of the channel by DkTx (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>); two additional mutants in this region (V595A in S5, and T650A in the pore loop) also display diminished activation by the toxin, whereas Y631A, near the N-terminus of the pore helix, enhances the effect of DkTx. Our model indicates that among these residues, only F649, A657, T650 and Y631\u00a0could interact directly with the toxin, suggesting that the other mutations influence toxin activation of the channel through an indirect mechanism (see below). Interestingly, the model also shows that both K1 and K2 drape over the top of S6 at the presumed interface with the surrounding membrane, and position several conserved hydrophobic residues (W11, F27 and I28 in K1, and W53, F67 and I68 in K2) where they would interact directly with lipids in the bilayer."

In the case of the K2 knot, the concentration-dependence for activation of TRPV1 saturates in the low micromolar range, and the extent of maximal activation is comparable to saturating concentrations of DkTx. In contrast, saturation of the concentration-response relation cannot be observed for K1, and at the highest concentrations that can be tested, K1 produces between 6- and 12-fold weaker activation compared to a saturating concentration of K2 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Because we cannot achieve higher concentrations of K1 in aqueous solution due to limited solubility, we investigated whether this knot has lower affinity or efficacy compared to K2 by taking advantage of the fact that bivalency increases the local concentration of each lobe, and therefore will produce higher occupancy of the channel compared to the separate lobes. For these experiments, we produced bivalent versions of K1 (K1K1) and K2 (K2K2), and tested whether bivalency altered the large difference in the ability of the two lobes to activate TRPV1. K1K1 should remain a weak activator of TRPV1 if K1 has lower efficacy than K2, however, bivalency should diminish the differences between K1 and K2 if K1 has lower affinity. Indeed, we found that 1 \u00b5M K1K1 produced comparable activation to that produced by the same concentration of DkTx or K2K2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), suggesting that the efficacy of the two knots is comparable, but that the affinity of K1 is much lower than that of K2. Although both DkTx and K2K2 exhibited slow dissociation, we observed considerably more rapid dissociation for K1K1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), confirming that K1 has lower binding affinity than K2 even when tested in its bivalent form."

Specifically, chimeras in which we replace either loop 2 and loop 4 in K1 by that in K2 ought to lead to a gain of function for activating the channel, resulting from an enhanced binding affinity; in contrast, substitutions in regions not involved in the channel-toxin interface should not alter the degree of channel activation. We generated such chimeras between K1 without the linker (K1-\u0394L) and K2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), and tested their ability to activate full-length TRPV1 channels compared to a saturating concentration of capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The weak activation observed with K1-\u0394L (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; green) was not altered in constructs in which either Asn1 in the N-terminus or loop\u00a03 of K2 were transferred into K1-\u0394L [i.e. K1(D1N) or K1(K2L3)] (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). In contrast, chimeras in which loop 2, loop 4 or the C-terminal part of K2 were transferred into K1-\u0394L [i.e. K1(K2L2), K1(K2L4) or K1(K2CT)] exhibited considerably more robust activation compared to K1-\u0394L (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The negative results observed with the N-terminal mutant and the loop 3 transfer, together with the gain of function observed with loop 2 and loop 4 transfer, support the notion that these two loops engage directly with the outer pore of TRPV1, as observed in our model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). The model also provides a possible explanation for the gain of function observed when the C-terminus of K2 is transferred to K1. The location of the C-termini of K1 and K2 indicates that they are likely to interact with the pore turret (residues 604\u2013626) of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), a region absent in our model as it was deleted from the TRPV1 construct used for cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib49\">Liao et al., 2013</a>), but preserved in the full-length construct used for our functional studies."

To enhance the exploration of diverse interaction patterns in a limited simulation time (~500 ns), we coupled the \u03c7<sub>1</sub> and \u03c7<sub>2</sub> torsion angles of all interfacial side-chains in the toxin and channel to a fictitious high-temperature bath, using an extended-Lagrangian approach (<a href=\"#bib35\">Iannuzzi et al., 2003</a>) (see Methods). To preclude the dissociation of the complex under this bias, the cryo-EM envelop was used as a three-dimensional restraint. A contact map between residues in DkTx and the outer pore of TRPV1 was then generated from the last 200 ns of simulation, so as to identify the most pronounced interactions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Two regions of the extracellular surface of the channel stand out as forming the most persistent side-chain contacts with either of the two lobes of DkTx, namely the N-terminus of the pore-helix, primarily via Y631, and a stretch of the pore-loop and N-terminus of S6, including N652, D654, F655, K656, A657 and V658; additional interactions are mediated by K535 and E536, in S4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The contacts with the pore and S6 helices are particularly worth noting because the A657P mutation effectively abolishes channel activation by DkTx, while Y631A enhances it (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>). Many of the contacts on the toxin are with residues that are equivalent in K1 and K2, e.g. W11 and W53, F27 and F67, K14 and K56 and G12 and G54, respectively, and a computational alanine-scanning\u00a0(Ala-scan) analysis of the toxin-channel interface, based on the configurations explored during the MD simulation (see Methods), indicate that these are all influential (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, there are also differences between K1 and K2, which might underlie their different affinity for TRPV1. The most interesting unique interactions for K2 involve S55 (K13 in K1), L65 (M25 in K1) and R75 (K35 in K1). The persistence of these interactions is worth noting because these residues are located in either loop 2 (S55), loop 4 (L65) or the C-terminus (R75), and transfer of these segments from K2 into K1 yields a pronounced increase in the binding affinity of isolated K1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These residues are also predicted to have a significant stabilizing effect by the computational Ala-scan (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Both knots also showed some unique interactions with lipid head-groups, for example Y70 (in K2) and H30 (in K1) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,E</a>). In summary, therefore, the simulation indicates that K1 and K2 interact similarly with the outer pore of TRPV1 and the surrounding membrane, but also reveals a number of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that might explain the higher affinity of K2 for the TRPV1 channel."

For these experiments, we took advantage of the presence of a single conserved and solvent accessible Trp residue in loop 2 of both K1 and K2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; W11 and W53), and used Trp fluorescence to monitor the partitioning of the toxin from the aqueous solution into the membrane environment (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gupta et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ladokhin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Milescu et al., 2007</a>). When aqueous solutions of DkTx were excited at a wavelength of 280 nm, emission spectra with maxima at 353 nm were obtained (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, left), as expected for Trp residues residing in such an environment. In contrast, upon addition of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), the fluorescence emission spectra for DkTx shifted to shorter wavelengths (i.e. a blue shift), and the fluorescence intensity increased, suggesting that the toxin partitions into membranes where the environment of the Trp side-chains is more hydrophobic and their dynamics are more constrained (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ladokhin et al., 2000</a>). To quantify the extent of partitioning as a function of lipid concentration, we measured the relative fluorescence intensity in a blue-shifted region of the spectra (e.g. 320 nm) as a function of lipid concentration, and fit a partition function to the data to obtain a mole-fraction partition coefficient (K<sub>x</sub>) of (2.3 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>, indicating an energetically favorable interaction of DkTx with lipid membranes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right). This strong interaction of DkTx with membranes would facilitate binding of the toxin to the channel by increasing the local concentration of the toxin near the channel and by a reduction in the dimensionality of diffusion within the membrane (<a href=\"#bib2\">Axelrod and Wang, 1994</a>)."

Fitting of a partition function to the data yielded K<sub>x</sub> values of (3.9 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> for K1 and (2.0 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> for K2, suggesting that the interaction of K1 with lipid membranes is stronger compared to K2. Because the fluorescence changes for K2 were small and did not saturate even at higher lipid concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), we conducted a similar experiment using the bivalent constructs K1K1 and K2K2, which we expected would increase the K<sub>x</sub> values due to avidity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Indeed, both K1K1 ([2.9 \u00b1 0.3] \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>) and K2K2 ([8.1 \u00b1 2] \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>) showed increased K<sub>x</sub> values compared to K1 and K2, respectively, and K1K1 exhibited a higher K<sub>x</sub> value when compared to K2K2, confirming that partitioning of K1 into membranes is more favorable than K2. These results are remarkable when considering that K2 has a higher affinity for TRPV1 compared to K1, leading us to propose a model whereby partitioning of DkTx into membranes would be disproportionately mediated by K1, leaving K2 available to engage TRPV1 and initiate formation of the toxin-channel complex (see Discussion)."

Indeed, the measured free energies of membrane partitioning (\u0394G\u00b0 = \u2212RT lnK<sub>x</sub>) for DkTx (\u0394G\u00b0 = \u22128.5 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>), K1K1 (\u0394G\u00b0 = \u22128.7 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) and K2K2 (\u0394G\u00b0 = \u22126.6 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) reveal a systematic energetic penalty for bivalency between 4.8 to 6.3 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup> if we calculate the theoretical free energies for bivalent toxins (DkTx \u0394G\u00b0 = \u221213.3 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>; K1-K1 \u0394G\u00b0 = \u221215 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>; K2-K2 \u0394G\u00b0 = \u221211.6 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) from that measured for the monovalent toxins (K1 \u0394G\u00b0 = \u22127.5 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>; K2 \u0394G\u00b0 = \u22125.8 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) assuming complete additivity of the free energies for partitioning of each lobe. One possible explanation for this energetic penalty is that the linker between the two knots constrains their orientations and prevents optimal membrane interactions by both lobes concurrently. To test this possibility we constructed a version of DkTx wherein the linker was replaced with a highly flexible linker comprised of 7 Gly residues (7G-DkTx), and observed a K<sub>x</sub> value that is indistinguishable from wild-type DkTx ([4.4 \u00b1 0.03] \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). This result seems to rule out the possibility that the linker restricts the dynamics of the two lobes significantly. Therefore, we deduce that the suboptimal membrane partitioning of DkTx probably owes to direct interactions between the two lobes, possibly mediated through the same amphipathic surfaces that interact with the membrane. Although we could not observe NOEs between K1 and K2 in the NMR spectra of DkTx in solution, it is conceivable that transient and non-specific hydrophobic interactions could go undetected, or that they are prevalent only when the toxin dynamics becomes restricted by the membrane surface."

These structural changes appear to be effected through displacements in the pore helix (P) and S6 helices relative to the S1-S4 unit and the transmembrane S5 segment; individually, the S1-S5 and P-S6 units are largely unchanged (RMSD ~ 0.7\u20130.8\u2009\u00c5) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). That the P and S6 helices become displaced relative to S1-S5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) is consistent with the fact that their respective N-termini are the primary contacts for the toxin on the channel extracellular surface, as discussed above. The changes in P and S6 within a given subunit correlate very clearly with a pronounced rearrangement of the SF and pore loop in that same subunit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), but also with changes in the intracellular side of the channel. The rationale for this remote effect is that the P and S6 helices are the main interfacial elements between adjacent subunits in the transmembrane domain of the channel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>); therefore, displacements in these elements are propagated to the adjacent subunits, and compounded to the changes in their own internal structure. As a result, the S1-S4 units (which as mentioned remain largely unchanged) become noticeably displaced relative to each other, thus affecting the crossing angle of helices S5 and S6, and hence the degree of opening of the intracellular gate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>)."

This network involves, among others, residues I599, F659 and V595, F649, as well as T650. Only the latter two residues are\u00a0nearby DkTx in the toxin-bound structure; however, mutation of any of these five residues diminishes toxin-induced opening of the channel, particularly in the case of I599A, F649A and F659A (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>). To evaluate whether the distinct arrangement of this hydrophobic cluster is a significant feature of the apo and toxin-bound structures, despite their limited resolution, a MD simulation of apo TRPV1 was also carried out and contrasted with that discussed above for the toxin-bound structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), using an analogous methodology. When the degree of compactness of this hydrophobic network is quantified in terms of the number and persistence of pairwise side-chain contacts, it is apparent that there is a generalized reduction of these contacts in DkTx-bound TRPV1, relative to apo TRPV1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). In DkTx, two of the residues nearest to this hydrophobic cluster are M25 in K1 and L65 in K2, a relatively conserved position on the two knots that makes frequent contact with channel residues in the MD simulations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Accordingly, both M25 and L65 are predicted to play energetically important roles based on our computational alanine-scan of the toxin-channel interface (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although we have not yet tested other toxin residues that make direct contact with TRPV1 (such as W11/W53 and K14/K56), we mutated L65 in K2 to Ala and measured the concentration-dependence for activation of TRPV1 relative to wild-type K2. The L65A mutant dramatically reduced activation of K2 and increased the rate of dissociation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), confirming this residue mediates important interactions with the outer pore of TRPV1."

The solution NMR structure of DkTx indicates that the toxin is composed of two well-ordered ICK lobes, connected by a 7 residue linker (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), as previously surmised (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2013</a>). Our structures show that K1 and K2 lobes have similar amphipathic surfaces, which are formed by clusters of solvent-accessible hydrophobic residues (aromatic and aliphatic residues in loop 2 and loop 4) and surrounding basic and acidic residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In an improved model of the toxin docked onto the TRPV1 channel, these amphipathic surfaces on K1 and K2 can be seen to intimately interact with the TRPV1 channel, as well as with lipids in the surrounding membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Indeed, conserved aromatic residues in DkTx (W11 and F27 in K1, W53 and F67 in K2) reach into the void formed by S4, S6 and pore-helix of TRPV1, which lipid molecules would fill in the absence of the toxin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Our results demonstrate that DkTx interacts favorably with membranes in the absence of the channel such that the conserved Trp residues reside within the membrane environment and exhibit blue-shifted fluorescent emission spectra (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Taken together, our results provide direct structural evidence for a model wherein DkTx interacts with TRPV1 within the lipid membrane. Although the bivalency of DkTx clearly helps to prolong the lifetime of the toxin-channel complex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>), each lobe has relatively small protein-protein interfaces with TRPV1 (655 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> for K1 and 556 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> for K2), suggesting that the interaction of the toxin with the surrounding membrane is important for stabilizing the toxin-channel complex."

DkTx, PcTx1 and voltage-sensor toxins like hanatoxin and GxTx-1E adopt similar folds, and display amphipathic surfaces that enable interactions with lipid membranes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gupta et al., 2015</a>). In DkTx, residues in loops 2 and 4 engage the outer pore of TRPV1, while interacting with lipids in the surrounding membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8A,B</a>), and contain mostly hydrophobic residues (compare <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a> where the toxins are oriented identically). In PcTx1, residues in loops 1 and 4 form a clamp-like structure for the toxin to bind to helix-5 within the extracellular thumb domain of the ASIC channel (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dawson et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, the voltage-sensor toxin GxTx-1E also employs residues in loops 1 and 4 to bind to the S3b helix within the voltage-sensing domain of Kv channels, and these form a surface that resembles the one used by PcTx1 to bind to ASIC (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gupta et al., 2015</a>). If we orient the two lobes of DkTx with channel-binding surfaces directed down, as if viewing the toxin-channel complex from a side view in the membrane, and oriented both PcTx1 and GxTx-1E by backbone superposition (as is done in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B,D,E</a>), the channel-binding surfaces for PcTx1 and GxTx-1E would both be displaced laterally by roughly 90\u00b0 (compare the location of residues highlighted in red in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a> for K1 and K2 with <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> for PcTx1 and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a> for GxTx-1E). Interestingly, the amphipathic surface of GxTx-1E is similarly displaced relative to the amphipathic surfaces of both lobes of DkTx, which makes sense because those surfaces for both toxins are important for interacting with membranes and their target channels. Overall, this comparison suggests that the common fold of all these toxins provides at least two distinct surfaces for engaging with ion channel proteins, while maintaining favorable interactions with the lipid membrane."

                        "text": "Our results also provide important insight into the bivalent structure of DkTx. Previous studies have demonstrated that the K2 lobe is a more effective activator of TRPV1 when compared to K1 (see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), and that tethering of the two lobes of DkTx dramatically enhances the lifetime of the toxin-channel complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>), similar to the avidity effect of a bivalent antibody. We find that the two lobes of DkTx also have very different energetics for partitioning into lipid membranes, with the K1 lobe displaying considerably stronger interactions when compared to K2, a trend that can be recapitulated in the bivalent K1K1 construct when compared to the bivalent K2K2 construct (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Using bivalent K1K1 and K2K2 constructs, we also found that differences in binding affinity can explain why K2 is a much better activator of TRPV1 compared to K1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus, bivalency not only increases the lifetime of the toxin-channel complex, but also enables the two lobes to be separately tuned for optimal membrane partitioning or affinity for binding to the channel. This feature of DkTx would suggest that the toxin preferentially uses the K1 lobe to interact with membranes and thus raise the local concentration of K2 at the membrane surface, thereby promoting the initial formation of the toxin-channel complex using K2 within the interfacial region of the membrane (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). It will be fascinating to further explore the structural and biophysical basis of these mechanisms of recognition, to better understand how protein-protein interactions are modulated by the membrane environment."

This cluster appears to be a determining factor in the energetics of channel opening, as several mutations in this cluster diminish toxin activation of the channel even though most do not directly contact the toxin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bohlen et al., 2010</a>). It is tantalizing to speculate that the disruption of this cluster, which implies an increased solvent exposure of more than a dozen hydrophobic side-chains across four channel subunits, leads not only to the structural changes required for ion permeation, but also to the kind of increase in the heat capacity of the protein that has been postulated to explain temperature sensing in TRP channels, including TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Clapham and Miller, 2011</a>). Notably, mutations at positions T633, F640 and Y653 within the hydrophobic cluster have been shown to alter temperature sensitivity of the TRPV1 channel without affecting activation of the channel by capsaicin (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grandl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Myers et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Ryu et al., 2007</a>). In addition, it is interesting that an external Na<sup>+</sup> binding site in the outer pore of TRPV1 has been shown to tightly regulate temperature-sensor activation, and that DkTx renders TRPV1 temperature-insensitive over a wide temperature range (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jara-Oseguera, 2016</a>). The hypothesis that this rearranging hydrophobic cluster is involved in temperature sensing will require careful experimental examination, and could begin to provide a unifying framework to rationalize how very different stimuli cooperate to regulate TRP channel activation."

                                "text": "To prepare the structures of apo TRPV1 and the TRPV1-DxTx complex for refinement, we first modeled the missing loops, side-chains and termini into the existing structures (PDB entries 3J5P and 3J5Q), using MODELLER version 9.10 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eswar et al., 2006</a>); for the TRPV1-DxTx complex, the truncated Xplor-NIH models (CCW and CW) were merged with the published channel structure. The fit-to-density protocol (<a href=\"#bib24\">DiMaio et al., 2009</a>) of ROSETTA version 2014wk05 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Leaver-Fay et al., 2011</a>) was then used to refine the three models (apo and DxTx-bound, CW or CCW). In a first stage, 100 models were generated for each system following the \u2018relax\u2019 application in 5 cycles, using a high-resolution energy function for proteins in the membrane environment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barth et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006</a>) in addition to the experimental cryo-EM maps. The fit-to-density score was determined with a 9-residue sliding-window, and was added to the total ROSETTA score with a weight of 0.2. The symmetry of the cryo-EM maps was explicitly imposed on all the models; a fourfold symmetric map was used for apo TRPV1, and a twofold symmetric map for the DkTx-TRPV1 complex. Each of these 100 models required approximately 280 computer-hours on an Intel Xeon 2.4 GHz core-processor for the apo TRPV1 channel and 800\u2009hr for the complex. The models with the best ROSETTA score for apo TRPV1 and TRPV1 with DxTx in a CCW configuration were then used as the seed for a second refinement stage. In this stage, positional restraints were imposed on the backbone and on well-resolved side-chains, and the configuration of all remaining side-chains was refined through extensive sampling and scoring. In particular, we ranked the degree of confidence in the position of each side-chain atom by evaluating a score equal to \u2212<i>m<sub>a</sub>\u03c1</i>(<i>x<sub>a</sub>, y<sub>a</sub>, z<sub>a</sub></i>), where <i>m<sub>a</sub></i> is the mass of the atom and <i>\u03c1</i>(<i>x<sub>a</sub>, y<sub>a</sub>, z<sub>a</sub></i>) the normalized density signal at the hypothetical atom position (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Atoms for which the calculated score was in the top 20% were considered to be well resolved and were not modified further. To generate a plausible configuration for the remaining side-chain atoms, we generated 12,000 new models, using the ROSETTA energy function only (i.e. without a fit-to-map restraint). On average, each new model of apo TRPV1 and TRPV1-DkTk required approximately 15 and 25 core-minutes, respectively. To identify the most representative model for each of these ensembles, we used the clustering algorithm of Daura and colleagues as implemented in GROMACS version 4.6.5 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Daura et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hess et al., 2008</a>), using a similarity cut-off of 1\u2009\u00c5 for apo TRPV1 and 0.08\u2009\u00c5 for the toxin-channel complex. The two selected models correspond to the central structure of the most populated cluster obtained in each case (~1,100 and ~7,900 structures, respectively)."

The simulation systems were prepared using GRIFFIN (<a href=\"#bib66\">Staritzbichler et al., 2011</a>).

The equations of motion were integrated with a time-step of 2 fs. The pressure (1 atm) was maintained constant with a Nose-Hoover Langevin-piston barostat (<a href=\"#bib27\">Feller et al., 1995</a>), allowing variations in the volume of the simulation cell but keeping a constant ratio in the membrane-plane dimensions. The temperature (298\u2009K) was maintained with a Langevin thermostat. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Darden et al., 1993</a>) with a real space cutoff of 12\u2009\u00c5. The same cut-off was used for truncating van-der-Waals interactions, modeled with a shifted Lennard-Jones potential. To equilibrate the simulation systems, we used conventional MD simulations with gradually weaker positional restraints applied to the protein, the toxin and buried water molecules over 12 ns. For the toxin-channel complex, a subsequent MD simulation was carried out for 400 ns using the twofold symmetric cryo-EM map of the complex as a three-dimensional restraint, via the MDFF module in NAMD (<a href=\"#bib69\">Trabuco et al., 2009</a>) (with 0.3 kcal/mol as the scaling factor). During the last 200 ns of this simulation, we coupled the \u03c7<sub>1</sub> and \u03c7<sub>2</sub> torsions of all side-chains at the toxin-channel interface to a fictitious temperature of 3,000\u2009K, using an extended-Lagrangian approach (<a href=\"#bib35\">Iannuzzi et al., 2003</a>), so as to accelerate the configurational sampling of that interface. The set of accelerated side-chains was determined by analyzing the first 200 ns of simulation using a simple definition of toxin-channel contacts based on a distance cut-off of 3.5\u2009\u00c5; this set comprises all the residues specified in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Finally, snapshots from the last 200 ns of simulation were analyzed to identify the most persistent contacts between toxin, channel and membrane. A similar scheme was followed for the apo channel, comprising an MDFF simulation of 200 ns (using the corresponding fourfold symmetric cryo-EM map), with enhanced side-chain sampling in the last 100 ns, which were considered for analysis."

Specifically, the algorithm was used to independently identify the toxin residues at the interface with the channel, to replace these residues individually with alanine, and to estimate the effect of this mutation on the binding free energy of the complex. Positive values of this estimate imply that the alanine mutation is predicted to destabilize the complex, while negative values imply a stabilizing effect. The scan was carried for 200,000 different input configurations, extracted from the last 200 ns of the MD simulation of the complex; the results for each toxin residue were then averaged. After each alanine substitution, interfacial residues within 10\u2009\u00c5 were re-optimized using the ROSETTA repacking method."

Examination of the structure obtained in this way reveals significant lipid-toxin interaction and a relatively small toxin-channel interface as compared to other tarantula toxins. The authors confirm the lipid partitioning of the toxin by monitoring intrinsic Trp fluorescence, finding that K1 partitions more strongly into the membrane. In contrast, K2 has a greater affinity for TRPV1, a slower off-rate as monitored in electrophysiology experiments. The authors take advantage of this difference in affinity to confirm the specific toxin loops that interact with the channel using loop-swapping experiments in single-knot constructs. This leads to a novel mechanism, where one knot is optimized for lipid partitioning while the other knot is optimized for channel interaction."

The research has been rigorously conducted and described with a level of detail that is appropriate to ensure reproducibility of the results, yet still comprehensible by non-specialists.

That the P and S6 helices become displaced, relative to S1-S5, is consistent with the fact that the N-termini of P and S6, respectively, are the primary contacts for the toxin on the channel extracellular surface. The changes in P and S6 within a given subunit correlate very clearly with a pronounced rearrangement of the SF and pore loop in that same subunit, but also with changes in the intracellular side of the channel. The rationale for this remote effect is that the P and S6 helices are the main interfacial elements between adjacent subunits, in the transmembrane region of the channel; therefore, displacements in these elements are propagated to the adjacent subunits, adding to the changes in their own internal structure. As a result, the S1-S4 units (which as mentioned remain largely unchanged) become noticeably displaced relative to each other, thus affecting the crossing angle of helices S5 and S6, and thus the degree of opening of the intracellular gate."

This network involves, among others, residues I599, F659 and V595, F649, as well as T650. Only the latter two residues contacts directly DkTx in the toxin-bound structure; however, mutation of any of these residues diminishes DkTx-induced opening of the channel, particularly in the case of I599A, F649A and F659A. Therefore, it seems clear that the stability of this hydrophobic cluster is a determining factor for channel activation. It is tantalizing to speculate that the disruption of this cluster, which implies an increased solvent exposure of more than a dozen hydrophobic side-chains across the four channel subunits, leads not only to the structural changes required to allow for ion permeation, but also to the kind of increase in the heat capacity of the protein that has been postulated to underlie temperature sensing in TRP channels \u2013 i.e. the changes just described might explain, at least in part, the temperature dependence of the activation process of TRPV1."

We synthesized a new batch of this chimera and completed the requested partitioning experiments. Unfortunately they are not very informative. Although these chimeras were originally designed to identify regions in K2 that would enhance the affinity of K1 (gain of function), from the perspective of membrane partitioning they can only be used to identify regions that weaken partitioning (loss of function). The new results show that transfer of the N-terminal residue, or loops 2, 3 or 4, either leave K1\u2019s strong partitioning intact or paradoxically enhance the strength of partitioning. Transfer of the C-terminus greatly reduces the blue shift observed with partitioning, either because it weakens partitioning or because it alters the orientation of the toxin (and the relevant Trp residue) within the membrane. Unfortunately we cannot readily distinguish between these possibilities because the small blue-shift would make it impossible to construct a titration. We include these data in a new supplementary figure (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and comment briefly on them in the Results section in paragraph one of subheading \u201cMembrane partitioning of DkTx\u201d. Since none of the chimeras weakened the strong partitioning of K1, they don\u2019t provide the basis to establish a correlation or anti-correlation between partitioning and affinity, nor do they define regions of the toxins most important for membrane partitioning."

This would require additional experiments (unless there are inter domain NOEs in the data that has already been collected), although RDC data on the 15N samples already prepared for the HSQC spectra shown in the current manuscript should be relatively straightforward to perform.</i>"

This possibility was discussed because we noticed a systematic energy penalty for bivalency in the toxin-membrane interactions, and we felt compelled to comment. We have revised this section to be clear about why we think there may be inter-lobe interactions, despite the fact that we cannot see NOEs in the DkTx spectra. To our thinking, if DkTx containing the natural linker and the version with a 7-Gly linker have the same penalty, it would seem that there must inter-lobe interactions. We no longer have 15N samples to undertake RDC experiments, and we would need to prepare fresh samples, and at least for us, the requested experiments would require considerable optimization."
