These enzyme complexes are highly processive, duplex unwinding and degrading machines that require tight regulation. Here, we report the structure of <i>E.coli</i> RecBCD, determined by cryoEM at 3.8 \u00c5 resolution, with a DNA substrate that reveals how the nuclease activity of the complex is activated once unwinding progresses. Extension of the 5\u2019-tail of the unwound duplex induces a large conformational change in the RecD subunit, that is transferred through the RecC subunit to activate the nuclease domain of the RecB subunit. The process involves a SH3 domain that binds to a region of the RecB subunit in a binding mode that is distinct from others observed previously in SH3 domains and, to our knowledge, this is the first example of peptide-binding of an SH3 domain in a bacterial system."

To date, this has been limited to the initiation complex, with the protein interacting with a broken DNA end (<a href=\"#bib28\">Singleton et al., 2004</a>), and some DNA substrates representing partially unwound substrates that represent the very initial stages of the pathway (<a href=\"#bib23\">Saikrishnan et al., 2008</a>). The nuclease activity of RecBC is very much lower than that of RecBCD (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 1997</a>) so it was initially presumed that the nuclease must be a part of the RecD subunit. However, it was shown instead that the nuclease domain is actually a C-terminal domain of the RecB subunit, the activity of which is regulated by RecD (<a href=\"#bib40\">Yu et al., 1998</a>). The structure of the initiation complex revealed this is due to an \u03b1-helix that sits in the nuclease active site, thus blocking access to DNA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Singleton et al., 2004</a>). It is evident that this helix must be displaced to activate the nuclease, but the mechanism and trigger for this release was unknown."

This interaction induces a series of conformational changes that eventually result in release of the nuclease-blocking linker helix, which then re-docks at an alternative location thus opening the nuclease active site for access by the ssDNA tails of the unwound fork. A critical role for a rare bacterial SH3 domain in the RecD subunit is also revealed in the structure, and raises possibilities for a mechanism of further regulation after recognition of Chi."

However, just a single base addition on the 5\u2019-tail beyond ten residues resulted in loss of crystallisation and we were unable to obtain suitable crystals despite extensive screening. This was the first indication that the additional base on the 5\u2019-tail induces a conformational change in the protein. Consequently, despite the relatively small size of the RecBCD/DNA complex (350KDa), we turned instead to cryoEM to determine a high resolution structure of the complex. Data were collected on a Titan Krios microscope with Gatan K2 detector at the UK EM facility at Diamond. EM processing statistics are presented in the Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Electron density corresponding to the most important areas described in this manuscript is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 2</a>. Data processing revealed a major class that constituted about half of the particles and this is what is described in detail below. We utilised a DNA fork substrate with a 25 base pair duplex region, capped at one end with a five base hairpin and at the other with unpaired 3\u2019 and 5\u2019-tails (3 and 12 thymidine residues, respectively). The DNA and all domains of the three proteins were accounted for in the reconstruction derived from this major class (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In one of the other classes, density corresponding to the RecB nuclease domain was missing (18%), although other features for the rest of the protein were very similar to the main class. This class may constitute some proportion of the complex in which the flexible linker connecting the nuclease domain to the helicase domains of the RecB subunit has been cleaved or, alternatively, may be due to release of the nuclease domain from its usual binding surface observed in the initiation complex. In the latter instance, we do not see any evidence for a potential docking site for the nuclease domain anywhere else on the complex such as that proposed from SAXS studies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Taylor et al., 2014</a>). This second class was therefore of limited interest so we confine the discussion of the results to the dominant class of particles that appears to represent an intermediate on the catalytic pathway."

Comparison with the RecD2 structures (Panel B) reveals the 1A and 2A domains to be most similar in conformation to that of the protein without bound nucleotide (<a href=\"#bib24\">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, these structures also suggest that a steric clash with the RecB subunit would prevent the RecD subunit from sliding along the ssDNA in response to ATP-binding as seen for RecD2. This suggests that the DNA substrate we used here is still at least one base too short on the 5\u2019-tail to permit this final conformational change.

However, the crystal structure of the related <i>D. radiodurans</i> RecD2 protein (<a href=\"#bib24\">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</a>), and more recently of the related SF1B family helicases Dda (<a href=\"#bib13\">He et al., 2012</a>) and Pif1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zhou et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2016</a>), revealed an SH3 fold for this domain, which is rare in prokaryotic systems. These structures also revealed that the SH3 domain interacts with the ssDNA tail in a location different to that normally occupied by a peptide in canonical eukaryotic SH3 domains (<a href=\"#bib24\">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Saksela and Permi, 2012</a>), thus retaining the potential to bind peptide at the same time as the ssDNA tail. The 2B domain of the RecD subunit is visible in our current EM structure and confirms the fold of this domain is similar to that of the SH3 fold observed for RecD2. It also confirms the location and mode of DNA binding observed in RecD2. However, the domain also contacts a helix within the 2B domain of RecB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This interaction utilises a surface that is in a similar location to that used by other SH3 domains (<a href=\"#bib26\">Saksela and Permi, 2012</a>) but the mode of interaction is very different to other SH3 domains. Most SH3 domains bind an extended peptide (usually a sequence rich in proline residues) across a groove on the protein surface. By contrast, the SH3 domain of RecD binds an \u03b1-helix in this region. In addition, some of the regions that constitute the contact surfaces in canonical eukaryotic SH3 domains, such as in Abl kinase, are utilised in a different manner in the RecD SH3 domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The RT and N-Src loops are pulled back from their usual locations through interactions with the ssDNA tail and a part of the RecD 2A domain, respectively. This opens up the typical narrow peptide-binding groove that opens up the surface to interact with an \u03b1-helix in the RecB subunit. Therefore, this appears to represent a novel interaction mode for a SH3 domain."

This led to the so-called RecD ejection hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Stahl et al., 1990</a>). However, subsequent single molecule data have shown instead that RecD becomes inactivated rather than being lost from the complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Handa et al., 2005</a>). If it were to act in a conventional SH3 mode (i.e. canonical peptide binding) then it is plausible that conformational changes in response to Chi recognition might cause this domain to relocate and bind to another part of the protein complex to lock RecD in a conformation that can no longer function as a helicase/translocase, without being lost from the complex. This could either involve a similar region to that we observe in the current structure or a different one following another conformational change."

The closing of the RecD clamp brings the SH3 domain of RecD into contact with the 2B domain of the RecB subunit that appears to act as a catch to stabilise the closed conformation of RecD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). The N-terminal domain of RecD contacts the 2B domain of RecC and the conformational change in RecD has significant effects on the conformation of the RecC subunit. The RecB nuclease domain bridges a gap between the 1A and 2B domains of RecC and the conformational changes cause a significant shift in position of the RecB nuclease relative to these domains that reveals the mechanism for nuclease activation."

The crystal structure of the initiation complex of RecBCD suggested why this is the case because the nuclease requires ssDNA to be fed into it by the helicase activities of the complex. Furthermore, the structure revealed a mechanism for inhibition of the nuclease activity in which an \u03b1-helix (residues 913\u2013922) within the linker region (residues 870\u2013940) of RecB, that connects the C-terminal nuclease domain to the N-terminal helicase domains, sits in the nuclease active site thus blocking access (<a href=\"#bib28\">Singleton et al., 2004</a>). This suggested an obvious mechanism for activation in which this helix would be displaced to allow access of the ssDNA tails to the nuclease site although how this might be brought about was not evident from the structure. The EM structure now reveals the details of this process (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>)."

First, several domains of the RecC subunit also undergo a change in conformation. This change alters the interaction between the 1A domain of RecC and the nuclease domain of RecB. In the initiation complex, the \u03b1-helix that blocks the nuclease active site is stabilised by stacking contacts with another \u03b1-helix (residues 602\u2013627) from the 2B domain of RecC. This interaction is altered as a consequence of the conformational changes in the RecC subunit that shift the position of the RecC helix, breaking the contacts with the nuclease-blocking helix of the RecB linker, resulting in release of this helix from the nuclease active site, for which there is now no electron density (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This change opens up the nuclease site and allows access of DNA. Furthermore, weak electron density suggested an alternate path for the linker region compared to the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although the density was too weak to build the loop accurately, it was modelled as poly-alanine to define the overall pathway for this re-docked polypeptide. The path takes the linker along the edge of the RecD 2A domain including a short region that precedes the SH3 domain. Thus the entire linker is relocated away from the nuclease domain, relieving the block and providing access to the nuclease active site. The conformational changes are illustrated by movies created by morphing from one structure to the other (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>).

                                "text": "The activity of a highly processive helicase/nuclease could be very deleterious to a cell if unchecked. Consequently, RecBCD has evolved regulatory mechanisms that suppress activity unless the enzyme complex is bound to a <i>bona fide</i> DNA substrate (i.e. a broken DNA end). The structure we present here demonstrates the molecular basis for one such regulatory mechanism and, together with our previous structural studies, describes a pathway for this activation process. Initial binding of RecBCD to a broken end induces unwinding of up to six base pairs of DNA in the absence of ATP (<a href=\"#bib28\">Singleton et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">Wong et al., 2005</a>). The function of this unwinding is to fill up the ssDNA-binding site on the RecB subunit. ATP binding and hydrolysis now allow unwinding of the DNA duplex to begin, at first driven by just the RecB subunit. At this stage the nuclease active site is blocked by the linker helix and activity of the domain is attenuated (<a href=\"#bib23\">Saikrishnan et al., 2008</a>). As the RecB subunit begins to unwind the duplex, the 5\u2019-ssDNA tail that is produced passes along a channel through the RecC subunit towards the motor domains of the RecD subunit. Once the tail exceeds ten bases, the RecD subunit responds with a large conformational change that converts it to an active helicase/translocase conformation and in this process also transmits this change to the nuclease active site via the RecC and RecB subunits. At this point the enzyme is bound to a DNA substrate that it recognises as being initiated from a broken DNA end (or restriction enzyme digested phage genome) so can proceed to processively and rapidly digest the DNA and search for a Chi sequence. If the enzyme encounters a Chi sequence then it pauses and alters its activities to prepare the DNA end for RecA loading. RecBCD then loads the RecA protein so that homologous recombination can initiate and the repair process proceeds. For phage DNA that lacks Chi sequences, the DNA degrading machine is unregulated and continues to digest the phage genome, thereby eliminating the phage from the cell, but also at the same time providing a molecular memory of the infection via the CRISPR system to further evade future infections (<a href=\"#bib17\">Levy et al., 2015</a>)."

Thinned grids were kept for at least two weeks prior to use to allow charge dissipation. To make the carbon surface hydrophilic, prior to the sample preparation, grids were treated with the detergent n-Dodecyl \u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM) (Sigma-Aldrich) using a procedure described in (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheung et al., 2013</a>) with some modifications.

Washed grids were kept on damp filter paper and used for freezing within two hours of preparation. Sample (3 \u03bcL) was applied to the grid and evenly spread with the pipet tip before blotting and freezing in liquid ethane (Vitrobot Mark III (FEI)).

Similar results were achieved by treating grids with a 1\u00a0mM solution of Amphipol A8-35 (Anatrace,\u00a0Maumee, Ohio).

The crystal structure of RecBCD in complex with an extended DNA fork (<a href=\"#bib23\">Saikrishnan et al., 2008</a>) (PDB 3K70), was used as a template for building in Coot (<a href=\"#bib9\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) after initial global docking in chimera (<a href=\"#bib21\">Petterson et al., 2004</a>). There were significant conformational changes apparent, so the jiggle-fit and morph, with positional restraints, tools in Coot were used to obtain a better starting fit. The SH3 domain of RecD, that was absent from the crystal structure, was built manually from a homology model generated using the Phyre2 server (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kelley et al., 2015</a>) and based on the structure of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> RecD2 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Saikrishnan et al., 2008</a>).

There was insufficient density to confidently place a molecule of ADPNP in the RecD helicase domains. Weak electron density suggested an alternate path for residues 913\u2013938 in RecB compared to the crystal structure. The density was too weak to accurately build the loop and was modelled in as poly-alanine, with occupancy set to 0 and with atom B-factors set to 100. The entire model was carefully edited and fitted using real-space refinement in coot with occasional jelly-body, and at later stages later reciprocal-space, refinement with Refmac to maintain sensible geometry.

This new structure reveals conformational changes underlying the requirement for RecD to activate the nuclease activity inherent to the C-terminal domain of the RecB subunit. This entails the movement of a nuclease-occluding protein helix observed in an earlier crystal structure of RecBCD. The EM structure highlights a key role for an SH3 domain in the RecD subunit in this transition, whereby SH3 (which was disordered in the RecBCD initiation complex crystal structure) interacts with the 5' ssDNA and RecB. This is an important addition to our specific understanding of RecBCD function and its regulation, and more generally an excellent example of the sophisticated internal dynamics of a DNA-processing machine."
