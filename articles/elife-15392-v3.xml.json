                    "text": "Rapid and stable control of pupil size in response to light is critical for vision, but the neural coding mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the neural basis of pupil control by monitoring pupil size across time while manipulating each photoreceptor input or neurotransmitter output of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), a critical relay in the control of pupil size. We show that transient and sustained pupil responses are mediated by distinct photoreceptors and neurotransmitters. Transient responses utilize input from rod photoreceptors and output by the classical neurotransmitter glutamate, but adapt within minutes. In contrast, sustained responses are dominated by non-conventional signaling mechanisms: melanopsin phototransduction in ipRGCs and output by the neuropeptide PACAP, which provide stable pupil maintenance across the day. These results highlight a temporal switch in the coding mechanisms of a neural circuit to support proper behavioral dynamics."

Here, we investigated the neural basis of pupil control by monitoring pupil size across time while manipulating each photoreceptor input or neurotransmitter output of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), a critical relay in the control of pupil size. We show that transient and sustained pupil responses are mediated by distinct photoreceptors and neurotransmitters. Transient responses utilize input from rod photoreceptors and output by the classical neurotransmitter glutamate, but adapt within minutes. In contrast, sustained responses are dominated by non-conventional signaling mechanisms: melanopsin phototransduction in ipRGCs and output by the neuropeptide PACAP, which provide stable pupil maintenance across the day. These results highlight a temporal switch in the coding mechanisms of a neural circuit to support proper behavioral dynamics."

There are several different types of light-sensitive cell in the retina that perform different roles. For example, retinal cells called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (or ipRGCs for short) rapidly respond to the intensity of background light and regulate the size of the pupils to control how much light enters the eyes. These cells receive information from other light-sensitive cells in the retina called rods and cones. There are at least two mechanisms that ipRGCs may use to relay information to the brain: one uses a protein called PACAP, while the other involves a molecule called glutamate. However, it is still not clear which mechanisms are actually used by ipRGCs, or when they might use them."

Keenan, Rupp et al. investigated how ipRGCs control the size of the pupils in mice that had been genetically engineered to lack different components of the visual system. Mutant mice that lacked rod cells or were unable to produce glutamate in their ipRGCs failed to reduce the size of their pupils when a bright light was switched on. In contrast, other mutant mice that were unable to produce a light-sensitive pigment in their ipRGCs showed a normal response initially, but had trouble keeping their pupils small if the light stayed on for a longer period of time. The same was true for mice that were missing the PACAP protein in their ipRGCs."

Each photoreceptive system presumably encodes a unique aspect of the light environment, but to date no consensus exists on the photoreceptive mechanisms supporting ipRGC-dependent behaviors.

However, methods to evaluate mammalian cotransmitter systems in vivo in real time are lacking. ipRGCs contain the principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the neuropeptide PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Engelund et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hannibal et al., 2002</a>).

To do so, we have silenced each individual photoreceptor or neurotransmitter component of ipRGCs, and in multiple combinations, while measuring pupil size across environmental light intensities and time domains. We have taken advantage of the fact that the PLR provides the unique opportunity to dissect the precise temporal dynamics of inputs and outputs of the ipRGC circuit in a behaving animal.

We determined the kinetics of light information relay using a 1-s light pulse-chase. Then, we simply modulate the relative light intensity reaching the retina based on assuming continuous 1-s packets of information. At each new 1-s interval, the model samples the assumed pupil sizes currently driven by each previous packet of light information, uses the maximum value as the current pupil size, and then reduces the stimulus intensity using that pupil size.

We observed a decay in pupil constriction over time that reached a new steady state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), resulting in two phases in the PLR: transient and sustained (mean intensity to reach 50% constriction (EC<sub>50</sub>) for transient PLR = 0.53 lux, sustained PLR = 7.9 lux)(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Because pupil constriction itself lowers the amount of light reaching the retina and therefore limits the drive to continued pupil constriction, the PLR is a form of negative feedback. To test if PLR decay is a consequence of negative feedback, we measured the effect of negative feedback both computationally and experimentally, and found that it has little role in PLR decay (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, we observed full PLR decay at dim light intensities (\u22641 lux) within the first 5 min of light stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>), but full maintenance of pupil constriction at high light intensities (\u22651000 lux), with apparently slower decay rates at higher light intensities (half-life: ~2\u20135 min, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

Despite previous reports of melanopsin requirement for the transient PLR (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lucas et al., 2003</a>), we find that melanopsin is dispensable for the PLR when using more environmentally relevant stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, rod knockout mice displayed no pupil constriction until the light intensity becomes relatively bright (i.e. &gt;10 lux, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), despite the normal spatial vision in rod knockout mice at these moderate light intensities (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alam et al., 2015</a>). To corroborate these results, we tested three different cone mutant lines and two different rod mutant lines with distinct mutations and observed virtually identical results: cone mutants are similar to wildtype and rod mutants have severe transient sensitivity deficits (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>)."

Therefore, we sought to acutely modulate cone activity using a previously characterized mouse line that expresses the human \u2018red\u2019 opsin (<i>OPN1LW</i>) in place of the mouse \u2018green\u2019 opsin (<i>Opn1mw</i>) (Red cone KI), making cones the only photoreceptors with enhanced sensitivity to red light (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lall et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We found that these mice have identical transient PLR in response to red light as wildtype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating that acute cone modulation does not affect the overall magnitude of the PLR. Furthermore, crossing this line to a rod knockout line abolishes the PLR in response to red light (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These results show that rods are the predominant photoreceptor inputs for transient PLR at low to moderate light intensities, even in a mouse line with sensitized cones."

We found that the only photoreceptors capable of recapitulating the wildtype PLR are rods. Mice with only rod function had identical light sensitivity as wildtype and a similar rapid induction of pupil constriction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>), though their ability to maintain stable pupil sizes in bright light was slightly diminished (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

To directly address this issue, we rescued ipRGC function in adult melanopsin knockout mice using either chemogenetics or restoration of melanopsin expression. Using our mouse line with Cre introduced into the melanopsin locus (<i>Opn4<sup>Cre/Cre</sup></i>) and a Cre-dependent chemogenetic DREADD virus (AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(G<sub>q</sub>)-mCherry) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we administered the selective DREADD agonist CNO (<a href=\"#bib5\">Armbruster et al., 2007</a>) and observed robust and sustained pupil constriction for at least one hour (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This result demonstrates that ipRGCs and their downstream circuits remain competent for sustained signaling in melanopsin knockout mice. Furthermore, we acutely restored melanopsin in the majority of ipRGCs of melanopsin-Cre knockout mice (<i>Opn4<sup>Cre/Cre</sup></i>) using a virus that expresses melanopsin in a Cre-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>, AAV2-CMV-DIO-mRuby-P2A-Melanopsin-FLAG). Following melanopsin restoration, we observed a rescue of the sustained PLR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results demonstrate for the first time that the effect of melanopsin loss can be rescued in adulthood, indicating that melanopsin-based light detection is directly required for ipRGCs to signal sustained PLR."

However, when we tested the sustained PLR in ipRGC glutamate knockout mice, we found that their pupil constriction improved over time compared to their transient PLR sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). In contrast, PLR sensitivity either stays the same or declines in all other mutant lines, suggesting that the remaining signal in glutamate knockout mice, presumably PACAP, becomes more effective with longer stimulus duration. Intriguingly, ipRGC glutamate knockout mice showed pulsatile or periodic pupil constriction over time, potentially due to waves of neuropeptide vesicle delivery and release from ipRGC axons (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

At the brightest light intensity tested, 5000 lux, ipRGC PACAP KO mice display significantly worse sustained constriction than ipRGC glutamate KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), suggesting that PACAP is more important than glutamate for maintained responses under daylight conditions (1000\u2013100,000+ lux)."

Remarkably, the mechanisms supporting transient and sustained responses are distinct, suggesting stimulus duration as a critical determinant of circuit state. Transient PLR responses predominantly utilize classical, well-characterized visual system synaptic mechanisms: rod phototransduction and signal relay to ipRGCs, followed by ipRGC glutamatergic output. However, as conventional signaling mechanisms adapt, non-conventional mechanisms are recruited to maintain persistent signaling, including endogenous melanopsin phototransduction and peptidergic neurotransmission through PACAP. Our findings highlight fundamental circuit changes in the light-adapted retina that are relatively unexplored (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tikidji-Hamburyan et al., 2015</a>)."

That rods are capable of rapid and sensitive input to ipRGCs is not surprising given electrophysiological evidence of sensitive rod input to ipRGCs (<a href=\"#bib70\">Weng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>) and the fact that rods are widely appreciated as the mediators of dim light vision. However, their exclusive input at mesopic light intensities suggests that cone input to ipRGCs is relatively weak, consistent with the inability of cones to drive circadian photoentrainment (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lall et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mrosovsky and Hattar, 2005</a>). Furthermore, we report here that in addition to their role in high-sensitivity transient signaling, rods are capable of driving sustained signaling at bright light intensities well above their saturation level (~40 lux, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This agrees with previous findings that rods are capable of supporting circadian photoentrainment at bright light intensities (<a href=\"#bib4\">Altimus et al., 2010</a>) but also provides more precise temporal kinetics of rod input to subconscious behaviors. It has been proposed that rods never fully saturate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blakemore and Rushton, 1965</a>), and here we provide a physiological role for rod activity at daylight intensities."

This is likely due to the fact that rod and cone inputs adapt to background light, while we find no evidence of behavioral light adaptation in melanopsin phototransduction (i.e. identical sensitivity of melanopsin-only mice in transient and sustained PLR). While melanopsin phototransduction adapts in vitro (<a href=\"#bib20\">Do and Yau, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wong et al., 2005</a>), it has been proposed that only the adapted state is able to influence downstream behaviors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Do and Yau, 2013</a>). We predict that melanopsin will be required in other visual functions throughout the day, for example as in more natural photoentrainment conditions that need to precisely measure changing light intensity under bright conditions or measuring day length (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gooley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mrosovsky and Hattar, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">VanderLeest et al., 2007</a>).

We confirm previous data that ipRGCs predominantly rely on glutamatergic output for the transient PLR (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delwig et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gompf et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Purrier et al., 2014</a>). However, we show that the stimulus durations in which glutamate predominates over PACAP is relatively restricted (&lt;5\u2009min), revealing the first critical role for a neuropeptide in retinal signaling to the brain. Further, we find that PACAP appears sufficient to drive the PLR independent of its potential to modulate glutamate. There have been discrepancies in the literature about the role of PACAP in the PLR (<a href=\"#bib23\">Engelund et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kawaguchi et al., 2010</a>), which we believe is likely due to differences in light stimulus duration. Intriguingly, PACAPergic neurotransmission appears to be pulsatile, potentially reflecting the imprecision of slow vesicle delivery from the soma and suggesting why ipRGCs also require a fast and reliable glutamatergic signal. Glutamate and PACAP are the only known ipRGC neurotransmitters, but it remains possible there are neurotransmitters which remain undiscovered. An ipRGC-specific glutamate/PACAP double knockout is a crucial next step in understanding ipRGC neurotransmission. Given the expression of other neuropeptides in many RGCs, including ipRGCs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brecha et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Djeridane, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kay et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2011</a>), it remains possible that neuropeptides have a broader role in visual function than previously appreciated."

The light meter was initially calibrated by EXTECH using a Tungsten 2856\u2009K light source; because our experiments used a fluorescent bulb of 6500\u2009K, all measured light intensities reported here may vary by 0.92\u20131.12 times the actual light intensity.

For all sustained PLR, animals were kept in a cage for 60 min under the light stimulus. Animals were removed from the cage after 60 min and held in front of the camera for 30 s as for the transient PLR. All pupil images presented in the paper were cropped to a fixed square area (generally 100 \u00d7 100 pixels) surrounding the eye using GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). The images were made grayscale and then brightness and contrast were adjusted to enhance visibility of the pupil and exported as PNG files."

To engineer the targeting vector, 5\u2019 homology arm, 3\u2019 homology arm and CKO region were amplified from mouse Sv129 BAC genomic DNA and confirmed by end sequencing (Cyagen biosciences, Santa Clara, CA). The two <i>loxP</i> sites flank the second exon and when recombined, create a frameshift mutation and truncated protein. The plasmid was electroporated into W4 ES cells and cells expanded from targeted ES clones were injected into C57BL6 blastocysts. Germline transmitting chimeric animals were obtained and then mated with flpE mice to delete the <i>frt</i>-site flanked neomycin selection cassette. The resulting heterozygous offspring were crossed to generate homozygous PACAP<sup>lox/lox</sup> study subjects. All mice are thus on a mixed C57Bl6/J and 129Sv background. Offspring were genotyped by PCR using 2 primers (F: CCGATTGATTGACTACAGGCTCC and R: GTGTTAAACACCAGTTAGCCACGC) which detect the presence or absence of the 5\u2019 loxP site and a 3rd primer was used in conjunction with the forward primer (CKO-R GGGCTTTGATCTGGGAACTGAAG) to detect the recombination event. By generating mice homozygous for a germline deleted cre-deleted allele, we have established that the cre-deleted allele does not express intact <i>PACAP</i> mRNA (by PCR and by ISH). A more detailed description of the generation and use of the allele will appear in a manuscript that is in preparation (Ross and\u00a0Lowell,\u00a0unpublished)."

The authors examine changes in the pupillary light response (PLR) of unanaesthetized mice over time with a novel setup utilizing an overhead, broad-spectrum light source to simulate a range of natural sunlight conditions. Multiple mutant mouse lines are used to identify the photoreceptor inputs and neurotransmitter outputs that contribute to the rapid and stable responses of ipRGCs. Their results demonstrate that distinct mechanisms are involved in the transient and sustained pupil responses: rod phototransduction and glutamatergic output of ipRGCs predominately mediate fast, transient pupil constriction whereas endogenous melanopsin phototransduction and peptidergic (PACAP) output take over to maintain a steady state of pupil constriction."

The experiments to rescue ipRGC function by chemogenetic activation and melanopsin restoration were very nicely done and will be useful tools for future studies."

For example, rod phototransduction and glutamatergic neurotransmission of ipRGCs predominately mediate the transient pupil response but at high light intensities the transient response seems to be driven by intrinsic melanopsin signaling and peptidergic output of ipRGCs."

The importance of this paper also extends beyond the pupil, to the many other functions that are mediated by these photoreceptors, and connects to the generally elusive topic of peptidergic neurotransmission. There is much to admire here. For example, the authors provide control experiments that will be of great use to the field, marshal quite the array of mutations (some overlapping informatively), and do not shy from difficult measurements.

We applied atropine or PBS only to the left eye and then measured sustained PLR in response to overhead light (10 lux). Because we are stimulating both eyes, we should observe 50% of the impact of negative feedback on the PLR. However, we observed no differences between atropine and PBS, suggesting that negative-feedback plays little to no role in PLR decay in agreement with our model\u2019s predictions. It is important to note that it would have been ideal to measure sustained contralateral PLR for these experiments. But this is not possible since this would require anesthesia to immobilize the mouse for prolonged time and anesthesia is known to alter pupillary responses drastically."

Using higher or lower light intensities will not be as efficient in testing this model since we will be hitting either small pupillary light responses or saturated pupillary light responses."
