How these lineages segregate from neural and epidermal fates has been a matter of debate. We address this by performing a fine-scale quantitative temporal analysis of transcription factor expression in the neural plate border of chick embryos. The results reveal significant overlap of transcription factors characteristic of multiple lineages in individual border cells from gastrula through neurula stages. Cell fate analysis using a Sox2 (neural) enhancer reveals that cells that are initially Sox2+ cells can contribute not only to neural tube but also to neural crest and epidermis. Moreover, modulating levels of Sox2 or Pax7 alters the apportionment of neural tube versus neural crest fates. Our results resolve a long-standing question and suggest that many individual border cells maintain ability to contribute to multiple ectodermal lineages until or beyond neural tube closure."

This results in DiI-labeled cells localized to multiple tissues (e.g. epidermis, neural tube, neural crest and placode). These studies confirmed that the neural plate border region contributes to a mixture of cell fates. However, DiI labeling typically labels small numbers (10-50) of cells, thus leaving open the question of whether the neural plate border contains multipotent and/or intermixed, fate restricted cells and their relative positions. While single cell lineage tracing has partially addressed this issue in the trunk neural crest just prior to their emigration (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baggiolini et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">McKinney et al., 2013</a>), these studies did not examine early neural plate border stages or the relationship between different transcription factors in the border region."

To this end, we performed quantitative analysis of the transcription factors Sox2, Pax7, Msx1/2, Tfap2a and Six1 in neural plate border cells of chick embryos as a function of time. The results show that individual border cells have a high degree of overlap of multiple transcription factors at early gastrula stages. This overlap is maintained within the rising neural folds until the time of neural tube closure. Cell fate analysis further reveals that cells that initially express Sox2 contribute not only to the neural tube but also to neural crest and epidermis and that modulating transcription factor levels impacts the allocation of cells to neural versus neural crest lineages. Taken together, these results suggest that neural plate border cells have the ability to contribute to multiple ectodermal fates and that segregation of individual lineages does not occur until around the time of or after neural tube closure."

The chick embryo develops as a disc-shaped embryo on top of the yolk such that the gastrula-stage embryo (stages 3\u20134 accordingly to the criteria of Hamburger and Hamilton, HH) is flat with the presumptive neural region surrounding the primitive streak. In cross section, the neural plate is a single layer of cells surrounding the midline of the embryo, with the neural plate border being relatively broad. Here, we define the neural plate border at mid- to late gastrula stages (HH4 to HH4+) by virtue of the expression of Sox2 throughout the neural plate and Tfap2a, which is expressed throughout the presumptive non-neural ectoderm at this stage. At subsequent stages, we use Pax7 to define the extent of the border, since it is one of the earliest markers of the neural plate border and becomes quickly restricted to this region (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basch et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Khudyakov and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Otto et al., 2006</a>). With time, the neural plate border elevates to form the neural folds as the embryo undergoes neurulation until the time of neural tube closure at HH8+ in the cranial region. Neural crest emigration from the neural tube then commences at HH9. The schematic diagram in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> depicts the appearance of the whole embryo as well as transverse sections through the neural plate border as a function of time."

Similarly, cells co-expressing Msx1/2 and Sox2 can be observed at HH6 to HH10 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013H</a>). Co-expression of Msx1/2 with the placodal marker Six1 as well as Six1 plus Sox2 can be observed at HH8 in the dorsal neural folds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). At HH10, however, coexpression of Sox2, Msx1/2 and Six1 is only observed in the ectoderm since Six1 is no longer expressed in the neural crest or dorsal neural tube by this stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Interestingly, in addition to the neural plate territory, expression of Sox2 extends throughout the entire neural plate border region when compared with Msx1/2 and Pax7 at all time points examined (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013H</a>). Nevertheless, we do also observe some cells that only express a single marker at a time at all stages, though this appears to be a minority population. Altogether, our single cell analysis indicates an extensive overlap in expression of various transcription factors in individual neural plate border cells."

To assess the degree of coexpression of these markers in a quantitative manner, we used Imaris software to quantify how many cells expressed one, two or three markers simultaneously independent of expression intensity. We considered the left and right side of embryos embryos independently and evaluated six neural plate borders (4\u20135 sections each) of four embryos at HH5, eight neural plate borders (4\u20137 sections each) of five embryos at HH6, 11 dorsal neural folds (4\u20136 sections each) of six embryos at HH8 and 7 dorsal neural tubes including delaminated neural crest and Pax7+ cells in epidermis (4\u20139 sections each) of four embryos at HH9. Based on their predominant marker expression and their antibody compatibility and quality, we evaluated three markers for this analysis: Sox2, Pax7 and Six1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To unambiguously demonstrate the specificity of the antibodies used, we transfected chicken fibroblast Df1 cells with constructs expressing fluorescently tagged Sox2 or its paralog Sox1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B and G</a>). By immunostaining we find that Sox2 antibody does not recognize its paralog Sox1, even though the construct is transcribed as shown by RT-PCR. A similar experiment was performed for Pax7 and its paralog Pax3 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C,D and H</a>). The Pax7 antibody did not recognize its paralog Pax3. We also show that two different Sox2 antibodies (goat polyclonal Sox2 and rabbit monoclonal Sox2 antibodies) exhibit identical expression patterns (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and according to the manufacturer the rabbit monoclonal Sox2 antibody does not recognize Sox1 or Sox3."

To this end, we analyzed the overall tissue level expression of the transcription factors with Fiji (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>) at stages HH5 (3\u20138 sections/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a05 embryos), HH6 (six sections/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a06 embryos) and HH8 (6\u20137 sections/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a06 embryos). Since immunostaining reveals relative amounts of fluorescence, we normalized the expression levels of a given factor to a reference area to account for global differences in protein expression levels. Although markers are plotted in the same chart for better comparison of different stages, this is a measure of relative levels of each factor compared with its own reference rather than a comparison between factors. We used Pax7 expression to define the extent of the neural plate border (HH5-6) and later the dorsal neural folds (HH8) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>). We found that the neural plate border narrows over time, such that at HH5 Pax7 expression at the neural plate border is wider than at later stages of development (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>). Similarly, the intensity of Pax7 expression increases over time between HH5 to HH6 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013H</a>). Within the dorsal neural fold, there is no significant increase of Pax7 expression between HH8 (5\u20139 sections/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a07 embryos) and HH9 (3\u20136 sections/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a05 embryos), but Pax7 expression increases significantly in the delaminating neural crest, which could indicate a time point of fate determination at this stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>)."

At HH10 Sox2 expression is maintained in the dorsal neural tube even as neural crest cells begin to migrate away (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

To address this, we sought to examine the subsequent fate of cells that initially express Sox2 at gastrula through neurula stages. For this purpose, we used the well characterized N1 and N2 Sox2 enhancers to drive reporter expression in a manner that recapitulates endogenous <i>Sox2</i> gene expression only in the neural plate and neural tube (<a href=\"#bib53\">Uchikawa et al., 2003</a>). To build a Sox2-reporter that marks the entire neural plate/tube, we combined the N1 and N2 Sox2 enhancers into a construct that drives H2B-eGFP. eGFP protein is highly stable and has a half-life of approximately 26 hr in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999</a>); addition of a H2B nuclear localization signal has been reported to further stabilize the fluorescent label (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foudi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kanda et al., 1998</a>), making it an advantageous tool to trace cell fates. Because these enhancers do not drive expression in the neural crest (<a href=\"#bib53\">Uchikawa et al., 2003</a>), we were able to follow the contributions of cells that initially express <i>Sox2</i> to embryonic tissues (e.g. neural tube, neural crest, and/or ectoderm) at later times."

We next asked whether the ability of H2B-eGFP labeled cells to contribute to the neural crest decreases with time. To this end, we electroporated the N1N2 Sox2-H2B-eGFP reporter at progressively later stages. We targeted the closing neural tube at HH7 (2ss) to HH8 (4ss) in ovo, reflecting stages just before and after neural tube closure, respectively. Interestingly, we observe migrating neural crest cells that expressed the eGFP reporter after electroportion at both stages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), indicating that cells continue to produce eGFP protein under control of these neural enhancers until time points just before neural crest migration initiates. These results suggest that neural plate border/neural fold cells that express Sox2 are able to give rise to not only CNS but also neural crest cells at the time of lineage labeling."

To test this, we electroporated a destabilized version of eGFP by adding a PEST domain (N1N2-eGFP-Pest). The Pest domain has been reported to reduce the half-life of GFP to 9.8 hr in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999</a>). After electroporation of the destabilized Sox2-reporter, we observe only a very low level of enhancer driven eGFP expression in the dorsal neural tube (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In contrast, endogenous Sox2 expression is readily detectable by immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2019</a>, bracket). Consistent with this, the N1N2-reporter is not detectable in migrating neural crest cells, whereas low levels of Sox2 protein expression remain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2019</a>, arrowheads). This indicates that Sox2 protein expression in neural crest cells perdures from transcription and translation occurring prior to migration rather than being newly produced."

At HH7 and HH8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>) we observe strong <i>Sox2</i> mRNA in the neural plate border and dorsal neural folds and complete overlap with the Pax7 protein expression domain as detected by immunostaining after in situ hybridization. At HH9 <i>Sox2</i> mRNA expression in the dorsal neural tube is greatly reduced to almost undetectable levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). This drop of Sox2 mRNA expression between HH8 and HH9 is consistent with the decline of Sox2 protein at that stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>) although it remains detectable. At HH13 we no longer see <i>Sox2</i> transcripts in the dorsal neural tube (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2019</a>), whereas Sox2 protein is still present in that region likely due to protein stability after <i>Sox2</i> mRNA is degraded. <i>Sox2</i> mRNA expression is barely detectable in migrating neural crest as it can only be observed at very low levels in the rhombomere 4 stream (pre-otic level) where the neural crest population is very dense (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2019\u2019</a>). ISH also reveals overlap of Pax7 and the neural plate border markers <i>Msx1</i> and <i>Tfap2a</i> at mRNA level. At HH6 we see <i>Msx1</i> mRNA expression nested within the Pax7 protein expression domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). At HH9 <i>Msx1</i> mRNA expression overlaps with Pax7 protein expression in the dorsal neural tube and the delaminated neural crest. Similarly, Tfap2a mRNA expression overlaps with Pax7 protein expression in the dorsal neural fold at HH8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a>)."

To this end, we electroporated one side of HH4 chicken embryos with a Sox2 translation-blocking morpholino (MO) and the other side with a control morpholino at a concentration of 0.5 mM. This resulted in a small but statistically significant decrease in Sox2 protein levels that in turn caused a statistically significant increase of Pax7 protein expression (5\u201311 sections/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a09) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). Higher concentrations of Sox2 MO resulted in cell death in the neural tube and were not evaluated further. To control for the specificity of Sox2 MO and to demonstrate that the observed phenotype was not due to off-target binding, we co-electroporated the Sox2 MO with pCaggs-Sox2 (4\u20137 sections/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a016 embryos). This resulted in marked rescue of the loss-of-function phenotype, restoring Pax7 expression (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further demonstrate morpholino specificity and efficacy, we show that the Sox2 MO causes knock-down of a construct with the Sox2 UTR sequence driving RFP expression but has no effect on an analogous construct with the Sox3 UTR (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D,H</a>)."

We therefore turned to investigating whether we could detect Sox2 expression level changes on the single cell level. Using Fiji software, we measured the intensity of Sox2 and Pax7 expression in cells with very strong RFP expression in embryos that were injected with Pax7-H2B-RFP on the one side and H2B-RFP on the other side (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). As expected, cells expressing high levels of RFP also express high levels of Pax7 on the Pax7-H2B-RFP treated side (total of 44 cells of 5 embryos, 2\u20136 sections evaluated per embryo) but not on the H2B-RFP control side (total of 35 cells of 5 embryos, 4\u20136 sections evaluated per embryo) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The Pax7-H2B-RFP treated side also had a statistically significant decrease of Sox2 protein expression in these cells when compared to the control side (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>).

Transcriptional priming, or the expression of numerous mixed-lineage-affiliated programs, has been described extensively during stem cell fate determination in the hematopoietic system (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Laslo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Olsson et al., 2016</a>). These mixed-lineage states are generally achieved by expression of alternative lineage determinants like transcription factors and have been proposed to be mandatory steps in cell fate specification. Additionally, single-cell analysis of primary chicken erythroid progenitors revealed a peak of high cell-to-cell variability in gene expression, that precedes an irreversible commitment to differentiation, before being strongly decreased (<a href=\"#bib39\">Richard et al., 2016</a>)."

By performing an in depth and detailed analysis of differential transcription factor expression at single cell resolution, we have gained a fine-grained view of the signatures of markers indicative of diverse cell fates in this region. Although previous studies have examined gene expression at the neural plate border by in situ hybridization (<a href=\"#bib23\">Khudyakov and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Streit and Stern, 1999</a>), the resolution was not sufficient to resolve whether there are characteristic subdomains of cells fated toward neural crest, ectodermal placode, neural or epidermal fates. Our results show that individual neural plate border cells have a high degree of overlap of multiple markers even at early gastrula stages. This overlap is maintained within the rising neural folds until the time of neural tube closure and in some migrating neural crest cells. This suggests that the neural plate border region is not comprised of separate zones containing prospective placodal, neural and neural crest, but rather contains a mixture of intermingled precursors which are not fate-restricted. Consistent with flexibility of cell fates, explant experiments have shown that intermediate neural plate tissue, normally fated to form CNS, can give rise to neural crest cells when exposed to BMP signaling in culture (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liem et al., 1995</a>). Thus, we speculate that initially na\u00efve cells are open to many possible fates and retain the ability to contribute to multiple lineages ranging from neural crest, placodal, epidermal and central nervous system fates."

Although this may indicate commitment to a particular lineage, it is equally possible that stochastic gene expression accounts for this variation in cell to cell protein expression (<a href=\"#bib13\">Elowitz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McAdams and Arkin, 1997</a>). It is interesting to note that the number of cells expressing single markers did not increase as a function of time, as might be expected with progressive commitment toward a particular fate, but rather dropped. Furthermore, single cells that concomitantly expressed multiple markers were much more prevalent than those expressing a single factor. Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of neural plate border cells are open to multiple fates."

Consistent with this view, we see Six1 expression primarily in the lateral portions of the neural plate border and Pax7 expression biased toward the medial regions. However, no sharp demarcations exist between precursor populations and we noted extensive intermixing such that even cells expressing a single marker were adjacent to border cells expressing multiple markers. These results are consistent with explant studies performed in mouse embryos. Explants of the prospective neural plate border at a late blastula stage (HH2) were found to express neural, neural crest, epidermal and to a small extent placode markers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Patthey et al., 2009</a>). In agreement with these findings, we conclude that the idea of distinct precursor subdomains within the vertebrate neural plate border cannot be substantiated."

Even urochordates have an invariant cell lineage such that the fate of neural versus epidermal precursors is fixed prior to the gastrula stages (<a href=\"#bib10\">Conklin, 1905</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lemaire, 2009</a>). However, recent evidence has shown that the caudal neural plate border of <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> contains a precursor to bipolar tail neuron (BTNs) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stolfi et al., 2015</a>) that delaminates and migrates along the paraxial mesoderm on either side of the neural tube. These cells share some properties as well as some molecular markers with vertebrate neural crest cells, including co-expression of neural plate border and neural crest markers like <i>Msx</i> and <i>Snail</i>. Thus, an intriguing possibility is that advent of neural crest and placode cells in the vertebrate lineage resulted in the superposition of a multifated neural plate border region onto a sharp neural/epidermal border in the chordate ancestor and that urochordates may already possess an \u2018intermediate\u2019 neural plate border with partial overlap of marker expression."

Although enhancer-mediated expression is turned off as neural crest cells emigrate, the results show that cells initially expressing Sox2 can contribute not only to the central nervous system but also to the neural crest and non-neural ectoderm. This was true for electroporations performed from gastrula stages to the time of neural tube closure. This suggests that Sox2 is present and translated in neural crest precursors until the time they initiate detachment from the dorsal neural tube. These results favor the idea that many individual border cells maintain the ability to contribute to multiple ectodermal fates until the time of neural tube closure. Accordingly, previous single cell lineage analyses in chick (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">McKinney et al., 2013</a>) and mouse (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baggiolini et al., 2015</a>) trunk have shown that individual dorsal neural tube cells are multipotent and able to contribute to both neural crest and dorsal neural tube."

                        "text": "Consistent with these lineage studies, our data suggest that the majority of neural plate border cells in vertebrate embryos are open to numerous prospective fates. We further suggest that small changes in transcription factor levels can bias cells toward a particular lineage. For example, we find that subtle modulations of either Sox2 or Pax7 levels can shift the balance of neural versus neural crest cells. This is similar to the well-known Drosophila gap gene scenario where mutually repressive transcription factors regulate each other\u2019s relative expression, leading to sharp segmental borders (<a href=\"#bib21\">J\u00e4ckle et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jaeger, 2011</a>). During patterning of the vertebrate neural tube, a transcriptional network of three transcription factors (Pax6, Olig2 and Nkx2.2) defines the final positions of the boundaries of distinct ventral progenitor domains (<a href=\"#bib5\">Briscoe et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ericson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Novitch et al., 2001</a>). It was proposed that this three transcription factor circuit encodes a multistable switch that results in stabilizing neural tube patterning (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balaskas et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, we propose that the mutual repression of Sox2 and Pax7 can lead to a bistable switch with three solutions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>): an unstable state occurs when the concentration of two cross-repressing factors is similar. However, increasing the concentration of one transcription factor causes a switch from unstable to a stable state where the other one is repressed. According to this model, increase of Sox2 expression above a certain threshold represses expression of Pax7 that in turn leads to neural fate. In the reciprocal situation, high levels of Pax7 induce reduction of Sox2 in the dorsal neural fold and lead to a neural crest fate. In Xenopus a similar model has been proposed for protein cross-regulation during cranial ganglion neurogenesis. This work shows that high levels of the placodal genes Eya1 and Six1 promote proliferation of placodal neuronal progenitor by modulating SoxB1 expression, while lower levels promote neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schlosser et al., 2008</a>)."

By inhibiting or ectopically activating endogenous Dlx protein, these authors observed an expansion of the neural plate into the non-neural ectoderm or reduction of neural differentiation, respectively. Similarly, altering BMP levels in frog and chick embryos shifts the position of the neural plate border (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marchant et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Streit and Stern, 1999</a>). Overexpression of Sox2 in the neural folds causes down-regulation of neural crest specifier genes <i>FoxD3, Snail2</i> and <i>Sox10</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wakamatsu et al., 2004</a>).

Briefly, a thin bed of agar/albumin was poured into two-well Lab-Tek chambered #1 coverglass slides (Thermo Scientific) and allowed to solidify. Embryos were screened under an Olympus MVX10 stereomicroscope for the presence of the fluorescent reporter and normal morphology. Selected embryos were transferred dorsal side down on the agar/albumin bed before returning them to the 37\u00b0C incubator for another 2 hr to allow the embryo to settle down into the agar/albumin layer before imaging was initiated.

Pax7 expression was used to define the area of interest (extent of neural plate border/dorsal neural folds) at different stages. By using the spot function, a dot was placed on every nucleus that expressed Pax7. A second and third spot function was created to place dots on every nucleus that expressed Sox2 and Six1, respectively. Spots were placed independent of intensity of markers. Total number of nuclei expressing one marker was displayed by the respective spot function. Overlapping expression was evaluated by manually counting nuclei with two or three dots. Data were transferred to Microsoft Excel and for each neural plate border/neural fold the average of data collected for the according sections was formed. This was done for each developmental stage. Then, counts for each marker were normalized to the total number of counted cell nuclei per section. This was done for each neural plate border/neural fold for all stages (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Since the Imaris spot function does not discriminate if nuclei express more than one marker, it was then calculated how many nuclei express one, two or three markers by subtraction. In scatterplots, each circle represents the average of all sections measured for one neural plate border/neural fold and the bar represents the median of all neural plate borders/neural folds per developmental stage."

In Excel, background was subtracted from marker expression intensity and the intensity of the reference area. Then the ratio between background-adjusted marker intensity and background-adjusted reference intensity was obtained for each position. Negative numbers were changed to zero. The average and standard deviation was calculated for all embryos per developmental stage. The smallest value (Excel Min function) was subtracted from the value in each position to ensure similar levels of graphs on y-axis for better comparability of graphs between different developmental stages.

The study reports on the time course of expression of various transcription factors in the neural border zone during the developmental window when neural plate, neural crest and placode fates should be segregating. The work takes full advantage of available reagents and methods to interrogate the dynamics of key fate determining transcription factors in the development of neural crest cells. By using immunofluorescent detection, the authors uncovered that the majority of cells in the neural border zone (which ultimately assumes neural plate, neural crest and placode fates) express more than one TF indicating that cell fate may remain plastic for longer periods of time than previously anticipated. The findings that cells in the border zone are expressing several TFs simultaneously are novel, and they lead to the important conclusion that these cells are multipotent for longer in development than anticipated from prior studies based on mRNA expression domains (ISH). These findings present important new data for the fields of neural crest and placode development, and have broader implications for all areas, particularly stem cell biology, in which understanding the progression of cell fate restrictions is important."
