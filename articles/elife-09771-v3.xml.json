The current paradigm of characterizing synthetic networks in cells results in lengthy design-build-test cycles, minimal data collection, and poor quantitative characterization. Cell-free systems are appealing alternative environments, but it remains questionable whether biological networks behave similarly in cell-free systems and in cells. We characterized in a cell-free system the \u2018repressilator\u2019, a three-node synthetic oscillator. We then engineered novel three, four, and five-gene ring architectures, from characterization of circuit components to rapid analysis of complete networks. When implemented in cells, our novel 3-node networks produced population-wide oscillations and 95% of 5-node oscillator cells oscillated for up to 72 hr. Oscillation periods in cells matched the cell-free system results for all networks tested. An alternate forward engineering paradigm using cell-free systems can thus accurately capture cellular behavior."

The current paradigm of characterizing synthetic networks in cells results in lengthy design-build-test cycles, minimal data collection, and poor quantitative characterization. Cell-free systems are appealing alternative environments, but it remains questionable whether biological networks behave similarly in cell-free systems and in cells. We characterized in a cell-free system the \u2018repressilator\u2019, a three-node synthetic oscillator. We then engineered novel three, four, and five-gene ring architectures, from characterization of circuit components to rapid analysis of complete networks. When implemented in cells, our novel 3-node networks produced population-wide oscillations and 95% of 5-node oscillator cells oscillated for up to 72 hr. Oscillation periods in cells matched the cell-free system results for all networks tested. An alternate forward engineering paradigm using cell-free systems can thus accurately capture cellular behavior."

Electronic circuits are tested on a breadboard to verify circuit design and aircraft prototypes are tested in a wind tunnel to characterize their aerodynamics. A simplified environment does not exist for characterizing and engineering complex biological networks, requiring system analysis to be conducted primarily in cells. Performing extensive, quantitative and rapid network characterization in cells is limited due to difficulties associated with measuring parts, components, and systems in complex and ill-defined cellular hosts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kwok, 2010</a>). Particular problems include: I) lack of precise control over network component concentrations, II) unpredictable interactions and integration with host cell processes, III) cumbersome molecular cloning, and IV) technical challenges and limited throughput associated with single cell measurements."

Reconstituted biochemical systems have allowed the study of complex dynamic and self-organizing behaviors outside of cells such as switches, oscillators and pattern-forming regulatory networks (<a href=\"#bib26\">Schwille and Diez, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Genot et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">van Roekel et al., 2015</a>). Networks assembled from simplified biochemistries such as oligonucleotide polymerization and degradation reactions can produce complex behaviors such as oscillations and provide insights into the working principles of biological regulatory systems (<a href=\"#bib9\">Genot et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">van Roekel et al., 2015</a>). While a high degree of abstraction and simplification makes it easier to analyze the underlying principles of biological networks, it becomes challenging to implement more complex networks and to directly transfer results and networks between the cell-free and the cellular environment. Implementation of genetic networks in transcription-translation reactions has gained considerable traction because they rely on the cellular biosynthesis machinery and are compatible with a broad range of regulatory mechanisms. A growing number of synthetic gene networks with increasing complexity have been implemented in cell-free transcription-translation systems (<a href=\"#bib20\">Noireaux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Shin and Noireaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Takahashi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Pardee, 2014</a>). We and others have recently shown that oscillating genetic networks can be implemented in vitro outside of cells using microfluidic devices (<a href=\"#bib19\">Niederholtmeyer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Karzbrun et al., 2014</a>). However, whether these cell-free systems reflect the cellular environment sufficiently well to be of significance to biological systems engineering and analysis remains an open question. A few studies investigated whether individual components such as promoters and ribosomal binding sites express at comparable strengths in cell-free systems\u00a0and in cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chappell et al., 2013</a>). Comparisons of the behavior of genetic networks in cell-free systems\u00a0and in cells are still limited to a few examples such as repressor-promoter pairs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chappell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Karig et al., 2012</a>) and a RNA transcriptional repressor cascade (<a href=\"#bib35\">Takahashi et al., 2015</a>). Thus far, however, it has not been shown whether genetic networks with complex dynamic behavior function similarly in cell-free\u00a0and cellular environments."

We go on to show that our 3- and 5-node oscillator networks were functional in cells and that their periods were comparable to those observed in the cell-free system, indicating that the cell-free system accurately emulated the cellular environment for the complex dynamic networks developed and tested in this study. Cells carrying our 3-node networks oscillated on a population level, which was previously only observed in actively synchronized oscillators using quorum-based coupling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Danino et al., 2010</a>). The in vitro and in vivo oscillations of our 5-node negative feedback networks confirm theoretical predictions on biomolecular ring oscillators and represent the largest synthetic negative feedback networks implemented simultaneously in cell-free systems and in cells."

We have recently described a microfluidic nano-reactor device capable of emulating cellular growth and division. A discontinuous flow of TX-TL reagents through miniaturized reactors at rates matching natural <i>E. coli</i> dilution rates keeps transcription and translation rates at constant steady state levels and removes reaction products, which is critical for the implementation of dynamic genetic networks (<a href=\"#bib19\">Niederholtmeyer et al., 2013</a>). Using a TX-TL expression system in the microfluidic nano-reactor device thus provides a simplified and controlled environment, which can be applied to rapid prototyping (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun et al., 2014</a>) and characterization of genetic networks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, top, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, TX-TL provides significant time savings over traditional prototyping in cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, bottom, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Linear DNA can be used in <i>lieu</i> of plasmid DNA, and the DNA source does not require specific compatible origins of replication or antibiotic markers. Therefore, DNA can be assembled completely in vitro based on premade modules within 3 hr (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, the time needed does not scale with circuit complexity, as each circuit component can be added as a separate linear template, which can be easily replaced or varied in concentration in following design-build-test cycles. This is particularly advantageous for large circuits, where dosage or part changes require extensive re-cloning of plasmids for cellular testing, but no additional time for in vitro testing. We estimate that prototyping a genetic circuit in TX-TL requires 4 to 78 hr, as opposed to prototyping in <i>E. coli,</i> which requires a minimum of 52 hr to several weeks."

We successfully implemented the original repressilator network in our cell-free system and observed long-term sustained oscillations with periods matching the in vivo study (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We compared the original repressilator to a modified version containing a point mutation in one of the CI repressor binding sites in the promoter regulating LacI (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This mutation increases the repressor concentration necessary for half-maximal repression (<i>K</i>), and reduces cooperativity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rosenfeld et al., 2005</a>). At long dilution times (t<sub>d</sub>) both circuits oscillated, but with shifted absolute reporter protein concentrations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). At decreasing dilution times amplitudes decreased and periods became faster with a linear dependence on t<sub>d</sub>. Faster dilution times, however, did not support oscillations for the modified network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Experimentally, the range of dilution times supporting oscillations can serve as a measure for robust oscillator function, which generally diminishes with decreasing synthesis rates or when binding of one repressor to its promoter is weakened as in the O<sub>R</sub>2* mutant (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s3\">3</a>). Initial conditions can influence the dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems but are difficult to control in cells. In order to explore the dynamics of the repressilator in response to different initial conditions we varied the starting concentrations of TetR and CI repressor. For all conditions tested the system quickly approached limit cycle oscillations and was invariant to initial conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This analysis of the repressilator network in phase space provides an example for an experimental characterization that would be challenging or impossible to perform in a cellular environment."

In our characterization of the repressilator network and the 3n1 oscillator we found dilution rates to be critical for the existence, period and amplitude of oscillations. Protein degradation is similar to dilution in that it results in removal of repressor proteins. In order to study the effect of degradation we constructed a second 3n network (3n2) using TetR, PhlF and SrpR repressors on linear DNA. One version of the circuit used strong ssrA ClpXP degradation tags, while the second used untagged repressors. We observed oscillations for both circuits (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, the circuit without ssrA-tag mediated protein degradation exhibited slower oscillations, which extended to lower dilution times, showing that protein degradation, just like dilution, affects oscillator function and period. Effects of ClpXP-mediated protein degradation, which have been shown to be important for existence and frequency of oscillations in vivo (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cookson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Prindle et al., 2014</a>), can thus be emulated in a cell-free environment. We characterized the repressilator (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and the novel 3n1 network (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) on plasmid DNA, reasoning that this is the closest approximation to the situation in a cell and because promoter strengths compare better when measured on a plasmid (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chappell et al., 2013</a>). However, for a more rapid analysis of novel networks and network variants it is advantageous if laborious cloning steps are not required to obtain initial results on circuit performance. Construction and comparison of two 3n2 network variants, which only required a few PCR reactions to synthesize the linear DNA templates, showed that it is possible to go from theoretical design of a circuit to first experimental results in a very short timeframe (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Next, we went on to test this concept for novel and more complex network architectures."

We experimentally built and tested a 4-node circuit from LacI, TetR, PhlF and SrpR on linear DNA. Initial pulses of LacI inducer IPTG or TetR inducer aTc allowed us to switch expression into either one of the two stable steady states (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Stable steady states were reached after an initial adjustment phase of 5 to 10 hr and remained stable until the experiment was terminated after 22 hr. These results show that non-oscillating networks also function in the cell-free environment and that the oscillations we observe for the 3-node networks are determined by network architecture and not established by particular reaction conditions in the microfluidic reactor."

We expected these circuits to oscillate, as they were built from an odd number of repressors. Despite their considerable complexity both circuits indeed oscillated over a broad range of dilution times. The period of the 5n networks (up to 19 hr) was significantly longer than that of the 3n networks (up to 8 hr). Comparing all ssrA-tagged 3n and 5n ring architectures, we show that the observed periods\u00a0could be accurately predicted for all four networks by computational simulations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Our cell-free system allows characterization of complex networks from rapid testing on linear DNA to verifying networks cloned onto a single plasmid, which is the closest approximation to cellular implementation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Like the 3n networks we cloned both 5n oscillators onto low-copy number plasmids to transfer the two networks we had initially prototyped on linear DNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) into <i>E. coli</i>. <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows the complete cell-free prototyping cycle for the 5n1 oscillator from design by testing on linear DNA to validation of the final cloned oscillator plasmid. In <i>E. coli,</i> 5n1 was not viable when co-transformed with a high expression-strength reporter, but was viable with a low expression-strength reporter. Specifically, 5n1 with a high expression-strength reporter caused slow growth and high cell death rates when run on the mother machine \u2013 we hypothesize that this is due to loading effects from high protein production, as decreasing the reporter expression strength resolved cell viability issues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ceroni et al., 2015</a>). When tested with a low expression-strength reporter both 5n oscillators showed robust oscillations in <i>E. coli</i> that were maintained for at least 70 hr, and over 95% of all analyzed traps containing healthy cells oscillated (n=104). In addition, both 5n networks oscillated with similar periods: 8 hr for 5n1, and 9 hr for 5n2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media7\">7</a>)."

Starting from a single cell we observed striking oscillation pulses of the entire growing microcolony (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8</a>,<a href=\"#media9\">9</a>). These population level pulses were also apparent when using three different fluorescent reporters simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). We did not observe population level oscillations in either the original repressilator, the O<sub>R</sub>2* mutant (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) or the 5n networks. Synchronized oscillations were not reported with the original repressilator (<a href=\"#bib6\">Elowitz and Leibler, 2000</a>), and have only been observed in oscillators using intercellular communication (<a href=\"#bib5\">Danino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Prindle et al., 2012</a>). In contrast to these quorum-sensing mechanisms that can actively couple and synchronize oscillator states (<a href=\"#bib5\">Danino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Prindle et al., 2012</a>) we do not believe the population-wide in-phase oscillations we observed are due to an active coupling mechanism. We hypothesize that the population-level oscillations of the 3n1 and 3n2 networks are due to increased repressor concentrations as compared to the original repressilator network, which increases the inheritance of the period phenotype and minimizes the rapid de-phasing expected from stochastic cellular protein fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kiviet et al., 2014</a>). However, a quantitative characterization of this slow de-phasing phenotype requires more in depth understanding of stochastic effects in vivo."

Our results demonstrate the utility of this approach for biological systems engineering and component characterization. The cell-free system resulted in the experimental validation of previous theoretical predictions on even- and odd-numbered cyclic negative feedback circuits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Smith, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hori et al., 2013</a>) and enabled the in vivo implementation of robust 5-node genetic oscillators. The cell-free environment can thus fill the gap between theoretical network design and in vivo implementation of biological systems and provide a simplified and controlled environment that drastically reduces the design-build-test cycle (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun et al., 2014</a>). In order to match the cell-free and cellular environments as closely as possible we prepared an extract-based TX-TL expression system from the same <i>E. coli</i> strain we used for in vivo experiments by a method that preserves the endogenous biosynthetic and protein degradation machinery (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shin and Noireaux, 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). Similar expression systems had previously been applied to the prototyping of promoters and ribosomal binding sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chappell et al., 2013</a>). Here we showed that they can also be used for the prototyping of entire genetic networks when they are analyzed in a microfluidic system that emulates cellular growth. Oscillation periods in negative feedback ring oscillators are mainly determined by degradation and dilution rates (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hori et al., 2013</a>), which explains the good correspondence between oscillation periods in our cell-free environment and in <i>E. coli</i>. By constructing and testing novel network architectures we show that almost all prototyping can be done on linear DNA, which requires less than 8 hr to assemble and test. This allows rapid screening of different network topologies and rapid screening of parameters important for the desired function of a network. We observed some differences between the cell-free and cellular environment, particularly in the difficulty of predicting cellular toxicity and loading effects of the 5n oscillators in vivo, and some differences between promoter and repressor strengths. With a better understanding of loading effects cell-free prototyping environments may predict when cells will be overloaded. We also add that the complete cell-free prototyping cycle that worked for 5n1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was not entirely successful for the 5n2 network. 5n2 showed similar oscillations as compared to 5n1 when analyzed on linear DNA in the cell-free environment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) and on plasmid DNA in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), but we did not observe oscillations for 5n2 when run from the same plasmid DNA in the cell-free environment. We hypothesize this is due to differences in expression efficiencies from linear and plasmid DNA in cell-free prototyping environments (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chappell et al., 2013</a>), and/or differences between repressor strengths in the cell-free and the cellular environment (particularly for QacR, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). While more work is necessary describing and explaining differences between in vitro and in vivo environments, the observed behavior of complex networks in our cell-free environment reflected network behavior in vivo well. Cell-free systems are thus a powerful emulator of the cellular environment allowing precise control over experimental conditions and enabling studies that are difficult or time consuming to perform in cells. We envision that it will not only be useful for prototyping and characterizing novel synthetic systems but also facilitate in-depth analyses of native biological networks in a simplified setting. With further developments in cell-free lysate systems and supporting technologies, the cell-free approach is posed to play an increasing role in biological systems engineering and provides a unique opportunity to design, build, and analyze biological systems."

Linear DNA constructs are summarized in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>. The original repressilator plasmid, pZS1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Elowitz and Leibler, 2000</a>) was used as a template for initial characterization and for construction of the O<sub>R</sub>2* mutant. Transfer function plasmids were constructed by Transcriptic, Inc. For other plasmids, partial sequences were either obtained from Addgene (<a href=\"#bib31\">Stanton et al., 2014</a>) or synthesized on gBlocks or ssDNA annealed oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies).

JS006 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Stricker et al., 2008</a>) was co-transformed with origin-of-replication compatible plasmids to create engineered strains.

To modulate the reporter copy number, all experiments were conducted below 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fitzwater et al., 1988</a>). Strain passage was minimized to avoid plasmid deletions due to the <i>recA</i> + nature of JS006 and the high complexity of oscillator plasmids or triple-reporter plasmid. Based on the in vitro and in silico results, we used strong transcriptional and translational (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mutalik et al., 2013</a>) units to maximize gain."

Reaction temperature was 33\u00b0C. Lysate was diluted to 2x of the final concentration in 5 mM HEPES 5 mM NaCl buffer (pH 7.2). The reaction buffer mix was combined with template DNA and brought to a final concentration of 2x. For a 24 hr experiment 30 \u00b5l of these stocks were prepared. During the experiment, lysate and buffer/DNA solutions were kept in separate tubing feeding onto the chip, cooled to approximately 6\u00baC, and combined on-chip.

These were achieved with dilution steps exchanging between 7 and 25% of the reactor volume with time intervals of 7 to 10 min, which alternately added fresh lysate stock or fresh buffer/DNA solution into the reactors. Dilution rates were calibrated before each experiment. Initial conditions for the limit cycle analysis of the repressilator network were set by adding pre-synthesized repressor protein at the beginning of each experiment. For this, CI repressor (together with Citrine reporter) and TetR repressor (together with Cerulean reporter) were expressed for 2.5\u00a0hr in batch.

Fluorescence traces of cell populations with synchronized oscillations were extracted from CellASIC movies using background corrected mean fluorescence intensity from the entire field of view. For cells that were not synchronized over the complete field of view, we tracked regions of oscillating sister cells at the edge of the microcolony. We used ImageJ to define polygonal regions around those cells and manually shifted the polygonal region to track the front of growing cells. Periods were determined from fluorescence traces derived from mother machine and CellASIC movies by measuring the time from one oscillation peak to the next peak. Doubling times were estimated by averaging over the doubling times of at least ten individual cells."

Based on this result, we computed the Jacobian eigenvalues with varying <i>K<sub>3</sub></i>, which we denote by <i>K<sub>cI</sub></i>, and <i>T<sub>d</sub></i>. The values in the parameters table above were used for the other parameters. The plasmid concentration was set as <i>g</i> = 5.0 nM in the computation."

After prototyping the oscillator circuits in vitro, they are implemented in <i>E.coli</i> and shown to function in vivo with similar dynamics, demonstrating a remarkable portability from in vitro to in vivo systems. This is important work, which significantly advances the state-of-the art in terms of circuit design and experimental approach. In particular, the article also contains the first realization of a synthetic 5-node genetic ring oscillator, which functions both in vitro and in vivo."

It may also be misleading to term the observation \"population level synchronization\" (as in the last paragraph of the Main text). For synchronization, one would also expect evolution from an initially unsychronized state towards synchrony. In the present experiments, the bacteria start in a synchronized state and stay approximately synchronized due to slow dephasing (this interpretation is given in the subsection \u201cTransfer of in vitro prototyped 3- and 5-node oscillators to <i>E. coli</i>\u201d). Thus the observation might have a very different cause than the prototypical synchronization of coupled oscillators (as for quorum sensing-coupled bacteria)."

For instance, the ability of 3n1 and 3n2 constructs to show population level oscillations is biologically interesting, but unfortunately remains a mere observation with a speculative interpretation. It may also be misleading to term the observation \"population level synchronization\" (as in the last paragraph of the Main text). For synchronization, one would also expect evolution from an initially unsychronized state towards synchrony. In the present experiments, the bacteria start in a synchronized state and stay approximately synchronized due to slow dephasing (this interpretation is given in the subsection \u201cTransfer of in vitro prototyped 3- and 5-node oscillators to</i> E. coli<i>\u201d). Thus the observation might have a very different cause than the prototypical synchronization of coupled oscillators (as for quorum sensing-coupled bacteria).</i>"

We did not want to imply that the population-wide oscillation we observed with 3n1 and 3n2 resulted from an active mechanism coupling the oscillator states in different cells. We removed the term \u201csynchronization\u201d throughout the manuscript and replaced it by \u201cpopulation-level\u201d or \u201cpopulation-wide oscillations\u201d to describe our observation. We extended the description of our observation and made the distinction from active synchronization mechanisms involving intercellular communication clearer. Just like the reviewer states, we explain the population-level oscillations we observed in growing microcolonies with a slow dephasing of cells that descended from a common mother cell. Our hypothesis is that this is due to increased repressor concentrations in cells carrying the 3n1 and 3n2 networks as compared to other oscillator networks for which we did not observe similar population-wide oscillation pulses. Higher protein concentrations would lead to reduced stochastic fluctuations during cell divisions and increase inheritance of the oscillator state from mother to daughter cells. We believe that these striking population-wide oscillations are an interesting observation that merits inclusion into our paper. With our focus on the engineering, prototyping and transfer of novel networks into cells it is however beyond the scope of our study to go into more detail on the stochastic effects that caused this interesting phenotype."

We hypothesize that this is the result of too much protein production, as decreasing the reporter strength resolved viability issues. Furthermore, we observed this trend with both 5n1 and 5n2, where cellular growth rates were slower than 3n1 and 3n2. We agree that this is an interesting point of further discussion, but defer to future work as loading effects in cells from synthetic circuits are still relatively poorly understood. However, with more understanding of loading effects one can theoretically implement those limitations into cell-free prototyping. We believe this is a rich area of future research with high value in the field. We have added to the manuscript the following to address this point:"

For instance, the 3n1 oscillator is implemented on a plasmid, while the 3n2 network is implemented on linear DNA. This is not motivated, however. Is this done for simplicity and faster prototyping?</i> In order to test if the cell-free environment could be potentially useful for prototyping of genetic networks with complex dynamics and transferring these between cell-free and cellular environments, we first tested the repressilator as a model circuit. Because this was an in vivo circuit it was located on a plasmid. When we found that it worked in the cell-free environment, we cloned the next novel network (3n1) onto a similar plasmid because this is the closest approximation to the situation in cells. When this novel network also worked, we decided to test even more novel network architectures. The real advantage of prototyping in a cell-free environment becomes clear when laborious cloning steps can be abolished for initial testing of networks, which is why we tested all further networks (3n2, 4n, 5n1, 5n2) first on linear DNA. Especially for large networks such as the 5-node oscillators the plasmid carrying the network becomes large and laborious to clone. In fact, if we had not found in our cell-free experiments with linear DNA that they had the potential to work in cells, we would not have attempted to implement them in <i>E. coli</i> and carried on when toxicity and loading effects further slowed cloning and in vivo testing."
