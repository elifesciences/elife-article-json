Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased tumor volume compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. Cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using ACHN renal cell carcinoma cells did not differ from vehicle control treatment, similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 1; Sirota et al., 2011). Doxorubicin treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not result in a statistically significant difference compared to vehicle control despite tumor volume being reduced to levels similar to those reported in the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011). Finally, we report a random effects meta-analysis for each result. These meta-analyses show that the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant effect, as did the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by doxorubicin. The effect of cimetidine on ACHN derived tumors was not statistically significant, as predicted."

Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased tumor volume compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. Cimetidine treatment in a xenograft model using ACHN renal cell carcinoma cells did not differ from vehicle control treatment, similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 1; Sirota et al., 2011). Doxorubicin treatment in a xenograft model using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not result in a statistically significant difference compared to vehicle control despite tumor volume being reduced to levels similar to those reported in the original study (Figure 4C; Sirota et al., 2011). Finally, we report a random effects meta-analysis for each result. These meta-analyses show that the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant effect, as did the inhibition of A549 derived tumors by doxorubicin. The effect of cimetidine on ACHN derived tumors was not statistically significant, as predicted."

For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kandela et al., 2015</a>) for a paper by Sirota et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications."

Cimetidine, an H2 receptor blocker used to treat gastric ulcers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kubecova et al., 2011</a>), was predicted to be a therapeutic approach for lung adenocarcinoma. Using a xenograft model with the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line, cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant decrease in tumor volume on the last day of the experiment compared to vehicle control (<a href=\"#bib15\">Sirota et al., 2011</a>). A decrease in tumor volume was also observed with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, a positive control therapy. Cimetidine treatment was also tested in mice implanted with the ACHN renal cell carcinoma cell line, which did not change tumor volume compared to vehicle control. This was in agreement with the prediction and demonstrated specificity of the approach by Sirota and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib15\">Sirota et al., 2011</a>)."

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 4C\u2013D and Supplemental Figure 1 of <a href=\"#bib15\">Sirota et al., 2011</a>. Tumor volume was determined by caliper daily for the duration of the study (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While the original study included three doses of cimetidine in the experimental design, this replication attempt was restricted to only the highest dose (100 mg/kg). Tumors from A549 cells treated with cimetidine grew to an average of 2.37 times their original volume by day 11 [n=13, <i>SD</i>=0.723], similar to the ~2.3 times reported in the original study. This is in comparison to tumors from A549 cells treated with vehicle, which grew to an average of 3.29 times their original volume by day 11 [n=14, <i>SD</i>=1.17], similar to the ~3.3 times reported in the original study. Tumors from ACHN cells treated with vehicle or cimetidine grew to an average of 2.96 [n=15, <i>SD</i>=0.952] or 3.37 [n=15, <i>SD</i>=1.50] times their original volume by day 11, respectively. ACHN derived tumors were similar in volume compared to tumors from A549 cells treated with vehicle in this study. This differed from the tumor volumes reported in <a href=\"#bib15\">Sirota et al., 2011</a>, which were ~2.1 and ~2.0 times the original volume in tumors from ACHN cells treated with vehicle or cimetidine, respectively, compared to ~3.3 times the original volume in tumors from A549 cells treated with vehicle. Additionally, the relative standard deviation (RSD) associated with this replication attempt (A549 \u2013 vehicle treated = 35.6%; A549 \u2013 cimetidine treated = 30.5%; ACHN \u2013 vehicle treated = 32.1%; ACHN \u2013 cimetidine treated = 44.5%) was generally larger than the RSD observed in the original study (A549 \u2013 vehicle treated = 17.0%; A549 \u2013 cimetidine treated = 35.5%; ACHN \u2013 vehicle treated = 10.3%; ACHN \u2013 cimetidine treated = 12.0%), however, the range of RSD among the conditions was more consistent in this replication attempt compared to the original study."

So while some aspects, such as site of injection, number of cells injected, strain of mice, and manufacturer of the drugs were maintained, others were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as circadian biological responses to therapy (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fu and Kettner, 2013</a>), mouse sex and strain stocks (<a href=\"#bib2\">Clayton and Collins, 2014</a>), the microbiome of recipient mice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</a>), housing temperature in mouse facilities (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kokolus et al., 2013</a>), cell line drift (<a href=\"#bib6\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>), and differing compound potency resulting from different stock solutions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kannt and Wieland, 2016</a>).

Tumor (caliper measurements) and body weight (scale: Scout Pro O\u2019Haus, model # SP202 (S/N: B443188875)) were measured three times a week before enrollment to reduce stress in the mice and were measured daily during the course of the experiment. Once the tumor reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were randomized into the treatment groups (vehicle (DPBS), 100 mg/kg cimetidine (dissolved in DPBS and pH adjusted and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m syringe), or 2 mg/kg doxorubicin (dissolved in DPBS and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m syringe)), taking into account the pre-specified group sizes. Two mice were not enrolled in the study due to unanticipated death and a small tumor size. Injections were administered via the intraperitoneal (IP) route using a 1\u2009ml syringe (BD, cat # Z192090) with 27 gauge needles (BD, cat # 305109) as a repeat dose each day for cimetidine and twice a week for doxorubicin for 11 days with a dosing volume of 100 \u00b5l per 20 gram mouse.

The final caliper measurement was also the approach taken in the original paper.
