Different pathways diverge at this point by a mechanism that remains unclear. Here we show that the peptide-binding pocket of the Dvl PDZ domain can be occupied by Dvl's own highly conserved C-terminus, inducing a closed conformation. In <i>Xenopus</i>, Wnt-regulated convergent extension (CE) is readily affected by Dvl mutants unable to form the closed conformation than by wild-type Dvl. We also demonstrate that while Dvl cooperates with other Wnt pathway elements to activate canonical Wnt signaling, the open conformation of Dvl more effectively activates Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest that together with other players in the Wnt signaling pathway, the conformational change of Dvl regulates Wnt stimulated JNK activity in the non-canonical Wnt signaling."

Different pathways diverge at this point by a mechanism that remains unclear. Here we show that the peptide-binding pocket of the Dvl PDZ domain can be occupied by Dvl's own highly conserved C-terminus, inducing a closed conformation. In <i>Xenopus</i>, Wnt-regulated convergent extension (CE) is readily affected by Dvl mutants unable to form the closed conformation than by wild-type Dvl. We also demonstrate that while Dvl cooperates with other Wnt pathway elements to activate canonical Wnt signaling, the open conformation of Dvl more effectively activates Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest that together with other players in the Wnt signaling pathway, the conformational change of Dvl regulates Wnt stimulated JNK activity in the non-canonical Wnt signaling."

By regulating the cellular \u03b2-catenin level, canonical Wnt signaling controls cell fate, while non-canonical Wnt signaling plays a key role in controlling convergent extension (CE) and polarized cellular orientation. Dishevelled (Dvl, or Dsh in <i>Drosophila</i>), a key component of both Wnt signaling pathways, relays Wnt signals downstream from the membrane-bound Wnt receptor Frizzled (Fz) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Noordermeer et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Theisen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Axelrod et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Simons et al., 2009</a>). While Dvl mediates both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signals, different pathways diverge at this point. Therefore, Dvl has been described as the \u2018policeman\u2019 at the intersection who directs different Wnt signals in different directions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boutros and Mlodzik, 1999</a>). However, the mechanism by which Dvl relays Wnt signals from Fz to different downstream components is not well understood."

The PDZ and DIX domains are reported to be involved in canonical Wnt signaling, while the PDZ and DEP domains play a crucial role in non-canonical Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sokol et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Axelrod et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Boutros et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moriguchi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yamanaka et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gao et al., 2010</a>). The central PDZ domain not only participates in both pathways but also binds directly to the membrane-bound Wnt receptor Fz (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wong et al., 2003</a>). Many Wnt signaling regulators have been reported to mediate the different Wnt signaling pathways by interacting directly with the PDZ domain of Dvl (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wharton, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gao and Chen, 2009</a>). Notably, in most species the extreme C-terminus of Dvl resembles a class III PDZ-binding motif (E/D-X-\u0424, where \u0424 represents hydrophobic residues such as F, I, L, M, or V), while that of Dsh resembles a class II PDZ-binding motif (\u0424-X-\u0424) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tonikian et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee and Zheng, 2010</a>).

We first used a competitive binding assay. Binding of the PDZ domain to a fluorescently-labeled peptide (Rox-DprC) derived from the C-terminus of Dapper (Dpr), a known binding partner of the Dvl PDZ domain (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheyette et al., 2002</a>), was monitored by fluorescence polarization. Both Dvl-C and Dsh-C peptides competitively inhibited the interaction of Rox-DprC with the Dvl-1 PDZ domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), indicating that the three peptides competed for the same binding site on the PDZ domain. The inhibition constants (K<sub>I</sub>) calculated from two independent experiments (12.3 \u00b1 7.8 \u03bcM for the Dvl-C peptide and 26.8 \u00b1 8.4 \u03bcM for the Dsh-C peptide) were similar to the binding affinity of Rox-DprC to the PDZ domain (K<sub>D</sub> \u223c 7.9 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2009b</a>).

The Dvl PDZ domain contains six \u03b2-strands (\u03b2A\u223c\u03b2F) and two \u03b1-helix (\u03b1A and \u03b1B) structures (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2009b</a>). As expected, we found that the Dvl-C peptide fits into the \u03b1B/\u03b2B peptide-binding groove of the Dvl PDZ domain and forms an additional \u03b2-strand with the \u03b1B-structure of the Dvl PDZ domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data indicated that six residues in the Dvl-C peptide participate in binding (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1, 2</a>). The side chain of Met(0) in the Dvl-C peptide is located within a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of residues Leu262, Ile264, and Ile266 in the \u03b2B-structure and residues Val325, Leu321, and Val318 in the \u03b1B-helix structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Notably, the side chain of residue Asp(-2) in the Dvl-C peptide forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of residue Arg322 in the Dvl PDZ domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

We then examined the binding of Rox-DprC to the two constructs. Little polarization change was observed when mC1 proteins were added to Rox-DprC solution, whereas large polarization changes were induced by adding mC1-C\u03947 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), indicating that the binding pocket of the Dvl PDZ domain was occupied by its intrinsic C-terminus in the mC1 construct. The binding affinity between Rox-DprC and mC1-C\u03947 was 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, closely approximating the affinity between Rox-DprC and the Dvl-1 PDZ domain. In contrast, the estimated binding affinity between Rox-DrpC and mD1 was greater than 70 \u03bcM, suggesting not only that the Dvl PDZ domain binds intrinsically to the Dvl C-terminus but also that this binding interferes with interactions between the Dvl PDZ domain and its other binding partners in the Wnt signaling pathways."

We first generated two constructs, both myc-tagged at the N-terminus: wild-type <i>XDsh</i> (residues 1\u2013732) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sokol, 1996</a>) and mutant <i>XDsh-C\u03948</i> (residues 1\u2013724, lacking the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif and therefore unable to form the intrinsic interaction between the its PDZ domain and the C-terminus). To avoid interfering the function of Dvl C-terminus, we placed the myc-tag at the N-terminus. However, the tag may affect the N-terminal DIX domain or potentially have some nonspecific effects.

Although the binding affinity of this reaction is not notably high, the closed conformation is stable and may predominate among intracellular Dvl proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhou et al., 2006</a>). To compare the effects of the two Dvl conformations, we examined a C-terminal\u2013truncated Dvl mutant, the established Xdd1 mutant (neither of these forms the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation in solution), and wild-type Dvl in different <i>Xenopus</i> assays and found that both of the \u2018open\u2019 Dvl constructs significantly enhanced the CE phenotype mediated by Wnt-JNK signaling. To further support this observation we observed the competitive binding to the PDZ domain of the Dvl C-terminus and two agents known to bind the Dvl PDZ domain\u2015the peptide TMEM88-C and the small-molecule inhibitor 3289\u20138625 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grandy et al., 2009</a>); we reasoned that by competing with the intrinsic binding of the C-terminus, these two agents should induce an open Dvl conformation. Indeed, the two molecules enhanced JNK activation by wild-type Dvl. Interestingly, consistent with these findings, several groups have reported that JNK is activated by sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug we previously demonstrated to bind to the Dvl PDZ domain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Czibere et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rice et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Singh et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we conclude that the open conformation of Dvl is likely to initiate JNK activation."

                        "text": "Dvl has been suggested to exist in activated and inactivated states within the cell and to be activated by Wnt signals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wharton, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gao and Chen, 2009</a>); however, the form of the \u2018active state\u2019 has not been determined. Our findings suggest that the activation state of Dvl is determined by its conformation, such that in the absence of Wnt ligand, Dvl adopts a closed conformation that represents its inactive state. Wnt signaling opens the closed conformation of Dvl and thereby activates Dvl. For example, in a working model of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the simultaneous binding of Wnt ligand to both of its membrane-bound receptors, Fz and LRP5/6, initiates canonical Wnt signaling by causing dimerization of the two receptors. Within the cell, the close proximity of the two receptors' cytoplasmic tails triggers the formation of signalosomes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bilic et al., 2007</a>) containing Dvl and Axin; Dvl binds to Fz through its PDZ domain (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wong et al., 2003</a>), thus acquiring the open conformation. This open conformation also allows the Dvl DEP domain to interact with the membrane through nonspecific charge\u2013charge interactions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Noordermeer et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Theisen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Axelrod et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wong et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Simons et al., 2009</a>) that in turn promote the Fz\u2013Dvl interaction. Axin binds LRP5/6 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mao et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tamai et al., 2004</a>), and the DIX domains of Dvl and Axin interact to further stabilize the complex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fiedler et al., 2011</a>). The network of interactions in the super-complexes stabilizes the signalosomes remarkably, although the individual interactions are relatively weak. Energetically, the super-complex is more stable than the closed conformation of Dvl and therefore can capture the PDZ domain of Dvl. By ousting the Dvl C-terminus from its bond with the Dvl PDZ domain, the Fz binding motif also opens the conformation of Dvl as it is captured in the signalosome. Although other Wnt signaling pathways are less well defined, it is clear that most, if not all, non-canonical Wnt pathways are triggered by the interaction between Fz and Dvl, which is likely to open the conformation of Dvl as well (<a href=\"#bib16\">Habas and Dawid, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gao and Chen, 2009</a>). Therefore, we propose that the active form of Dvl is its open conformation and that this active form initiates JNK-related Wnt signaling pathways."

Daam1 binds to the Dvl DEP domain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Habas et al., 2001</a>), which is likely to be obstructed in the closed conformation. Therefore, opening of Dvl's conformation is a key step in the Wnt-stimulated cascade that activates JNK."

All experiments were performed at least in triplicate using different batches of embryos and the mean value was calculated using Student's <i>t</i>-test."

For the dose-depending studies, three different amounts of <i>XDsh</i> and <i>XDsh-C\u03948</i> mRNAs (80 pg, 200 pg and 500 pg) were used. The embryos were cultured to the larval stage, then grouped and counted according to normal, mild, or severe CE abnormal (JNK gain-of-function) phenotype. To investigate the effect of XDsh, XDsh-C\u03948, and Xdd1 on CE in vitro, the same mRNAs were injected, alone or with <i>dnJNK</i> mRNA, into the animal pole region of 2-cell <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Ectodermal explants were dissected at the early blastula stage, incubated with activin for 1 hr, cultured to the early neurula-stage equivalent, and examined for the extent of explant elongation. To investigate how the C-terminal region of TMEM88 affects Dvl function, equal amounts of mRNAs (500 pg) encoding the C-terminal half of TMEM88 (TMEM88-C) and wild-type XDsh were coinjected into the two dorsal blastomeres at the 4-cell stage, and the embryos were again grouped and counted as having normal, mild, or severe CE phenotypes. The above experiments were performed at least twice using different batches of embryos."

The authors provide significant evidence uncovering a physical interaction between the PDZ domain of the protein and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. Since the two domains might be expected to interact, this result, on its own, is not a surprise, but the authors propose that this interaction is critical for the ability of Dishevelled to signal. According to their model, the intramolecular association is responsible for the closed conformation of Dishevelled, which prevents JNK activation and convergent extension defects (referred to as noncanonical signaling). The comparison of Dishevelled constructs shows that the protein with a deleted C-terminus (C\u22068) and the one with a nonfunctional PDZ domain (Xdd1) activate JNK and interfere with convergent extension stronger than the wild-type protein. Similar effects are observed for two Dvl antagonists that bind to the PDZ domain, consistent with the proposed model. Interestingly, the effects on beta-catenin reporters are opposite to those obtained for AP-1 luciferase, suggesting that the \u2018open conformation\u2019 of Dishevelled inhibits canonical Wnt signaling. This is another important point, although it is not emphasized in the manuscript."

They should also confirm that the inhibitors used (TMEM88-C and 8625) interfere with the PDZ-PBD binding in vitro. I feel that the paper would benefit from showing an effect of a Wnt signal on the proposed intramolecular interaction, although these experiments might be considered beyond the scope of the present study.

We propose that inside the cell, these interactions compete with each other, and the surrounding condition the Dvl inside the cell determines the binding partner(s) of the Dvl PDZ domain. We discussed this issue in the Discussion section. For example, in the current working model of the canonical Wnt signaling, the binding of Wnt to both its receptors, Fz and LRP5/6 triggers the formation of the signalosome. The network of interactions in the signalosome super-complexes stabilizes the signalosomes remarkably, although the individual interactions are relatively weak. Energetically, the supercomplex is more stable than the \u201cclosed\u201d conformation of Dvl and therefore can capture the PDZ domain of Dvl. By ousting the Dvl C-terminus from its bond with the Dvl PDZ domain, the Fz binding motif also opens the conformation of Dvl as it is captured in the signalosome."
