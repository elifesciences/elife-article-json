By directly responding to G proteins, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup>, GIRK is under the control of multiple signaling pathways. In this study, the mammalian GIRK2 channel has been purified and reconstituted in planar lipid membranes and effects of G\u03b1, G\u03b2\u03b3, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> analyzed. G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2</sub> must be present simultaneously to activate GIRK2. Na<sup>+</sup> is not essential but modulates the effect of G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2</sub> over physiological concentrations. G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GTP\u03b3S) has no effect, whereas G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) closes the channel through removal of G\u03b2\u03b3. In the presence of G\u03b2\u03b3, GIRK2 opens as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction with Hill coefficient 2.5 and an affinity that poises GIRK2 to respond to natural variations of PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration. The dual requirement for G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2</sub> can help to explain why GIRK2 is activated by G<sub>i/o</sub>, but not G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs."
