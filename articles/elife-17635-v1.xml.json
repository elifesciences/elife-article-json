We found that p110\u03b2 localizes to membrane rafts in a Rac1-dependent manner. This localization potentiates Akt activation by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus genetic targeting of a Rac1 binding-deficient allele of p110\u03b2 to rafts alleviated the requirement for p110\u03b2-Rac1 association for GPCR signaling, cell growth and migration. In contrast, p110\u03b1, which does not play a physiological role in GPCR signaling, is found to reside in nonraft regions of the plasma membrane. Raft targeting of p110\u03b1 allowed its EGFR-mediated activation by GPCRs. Notably, p110\u03b2 dependent, PTEN null tumor cells critically rely upon raft-associated PI3K activity. Collectively, our findings provide a mechanistic account of how membrane raft localization regulates differential activation of distinct PI3K isoforms and offer insight into why PTEN-deficient cancers depend on p110\u03b2."

We found that p110\u03b2 localizes to membrane rafts in a Rac1-dependent manner. This localization potentiates Akt activation by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus genetic targeting of a Rac1 binding-deficient allele of p110\u03b2 to rafts alleviated the requirement for p110\u03b2-Rac1 association for GPCR signaling, cell growth and migration. In contrast, p110\u03b1, which does not play a physiological role in GPCR signaling, is found to reside in nonraft regions of the plasma membrane. Raft targeting of p110\u03b1 allowed its EGFR-mediated activation by GPCRs. Notably, p110\u03b2 dependent, PTEN null tumor cells critically rely upon raft-associated PI3K activity. Collectively, our findings provide a mechanistic account of how membrane raft localization regulates differential activation of distinct PI3K isoforms and offer insight into why PTEN-deficient cancers depend on p110\u03b2."

PI3Ks catalyze phosphorylation of the 3\u2019OH group on phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane, which induces translocation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt. Once recruited to the plasma membrane, Akt becomes activated by PDK1 and mTOR2 dependent phosphorylation events (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alessi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sarbassov et al., 2005</a>).

The most extensively studied class I PI3Ks are activated by growth factor receptors. Of these, class IA enzymes are activated via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), small G-proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and PI3K signaling is functionally antagonized by the PIP<sub>3</sub> degrading PI3 phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sang et al., 2012</a>). p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 are the catalytic class IA isoforms with a ubiquitous expression pattern (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jia et al., 2009</a>). Heterodimerization with the regulatory p85 subunit stabilizes p110 isoforms but at the same time keeps their kinase activity in check through inhibitory interactions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). Although both p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 form heterodimers with p85 and catalyze the same biochemical reaction upon activation, studies have indicated that they have distinct functions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Foukas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jackson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guillermet-Guibert et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ni et al., 2012</a>). p110\u03b1 appears to mediate bulk of PI3K signaling downstream of RTKs whereas p110\u03b2 preferentially signals downstream of GPCRs. Notably p110\u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms are involved in mutually exclusive signaling complexes with distinct members of small GTPase protein superfamily, Ras and Rac1 respectively (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gupta et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fritsch et al., 2013</a>). However, we are far from a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that account for the full spectrum of their functional differences."

This reliance of tumors on p110\u03b1 may be partially explained by the fact that it has much higher specific activity compared to p110\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beeton et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Knight et al., 2006</a>). Indeed in a GEM model of breast cancer driven by Her2, knockout of p110\u03b1 blocked tumor formation while knockout p110\u03b2 actually caused tumors to develop more quickly- a surprising result explained by a competition model where the less active p110\u03b2 binds to the same limiting number of p85/p110 binding sites on Her2 and thus actually lowers signaling output compared to the case where only p110\u03b1 is expressed and hence can bind to all of the PI3K binding sites on the receptor (<a href=\"#bib38\">Utermark et al., 2012</a>). Notably tumors that have lost expression of PTEN are largely dependent on p110\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wee et al., 2008</a>), an unexpected outcome given its weaker kinase activity. While it is possible that some loss of PTEN tumors feature activation of GPCRs thus explaining their p110\u03b2 dependence (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rodriguez et al., 2016</a>), that does not appear to be a unifying theme."

On the other hand PTEN was shown to localize selectively to nonraft membrane microdomains in human embryonic kidney cells, possibly further restricting Akt activation in these regions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gao et al., 2011</a>).

Using this strategy, we investigated Akt activation, cellular proliferation and migration in response to growth factors, when expression of particular class IA PI3K isoforms was directed to membrane rafts or nonraft regions of the plasma membrane. We found that raft targeting of either p110\u03b1 or p110\u03b2 potentiates GPCR mediated activation of Akt. In addition, we determined that p110\u03b2 required Rac1 binding for raft localization and G\u03b2\u03b3 association for activation downstream of GPCRs, whereas raft-targeted p110\u03b1 was dependent on EGFR activity. Notably we found that PI3K signaling was also dependent on raft integrity in PTEN null cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that any class IA PI3K catalytic isoform, when targeted to GPCR signaling permissive membrane microdomains, could activate Akt and maintain downstream PI3K signaling through distinct mechanisms. Finally, our data has novel implications concerning the optimal methods for inhibiting Akt activation in PTEN null tumors."

To determine whether wt p110\u03b2 becomes differentially localized to membrane microdomains upon GPCR activation, we first analyzed triton sensitive and resistant membrane fractions in p110\u03b1-wt and p110\u03b2-wt DKO add-back MEFs. Our fractionation experiments demonstrated that p110\u03b2 resides in detergent resistant membranes in addition to soluble and detergent sensitive fractions where p110\u03b1 is primarily detected (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). A detergent-free fractionation based on density gradient centrifugation in HMECs confirmed the notion that there are distinct pools of p110\u03b2 localized to raft and nonraft membrane microdomains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Of note, Rac1, which is known to interact with p110\u03b2 displayed a similar fractionation pattern. p110\u03b1 in comparison, can only be found in nonraft membranes. In addition to MEFs and HMECs; we analyzed HEK293, DU145, PC3, MCF7 and BT549 cancer cell lines by examination of triton sensitive and resistant membrane fractions and detected p110\u03b2 in raft as well as nonraft fractions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "As a canonical class IA PI3K isoform, p110\u03b2 functions as a GPCR effector and interacts with the G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0component of the tripartite G-protein (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guillermet-Guibert et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dbouk et al., 2012</a>). Physical association of p110\u03b2 with Rac1 is also required to potentiate signaling (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fritsch et al., 2013</a>). To test whether Rac1 or G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0may be responsible for localization of p110\u03b2 to membrane rafts, we introduced point mutations to p110\u03b2 that abolish its binding to Rac1 or G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Fritsch et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dbouk et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Next, we generated DKO add-back MEF lines that express p110\u03b2-wt, G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0(GBM) or Rac1 (RBM) binding mutants as their only class IA PI3K isoform (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). p110\u03b2-GBM or RBM DKO add-backs displayed retarded proliferation in comparison to either wt or p110\u03b2-wt DKO add-back MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and were largely deficient in migration through Transwell inserts towards chemoattractants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Starvation and serum or GPCR agonist stimulation experiments demonstrated that although p110\u03b2 deficient in either G\u03b2\u03b3 or Rac1 binding, instigated Akt phosphorylation upon serum stimulation, both were significantly impaired in elevating p-Akt, in response to two GPCR agonists; lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Interestingly, fractionation of raft versus nonraft membrane microdomains revealed that only p110\u03b2-GBM but not p110\u03b2-RBM localizes to rafts suggesting that Rac1 binding to p110\u03b2 might constitute a raft localization signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We next attempted to verify this in HMECs, where p110\u03b2 could readily be detected in triton resistant membrane fractions. We knocked-down Rac1 expression using Rac1 specific siRNAs and analyzed triton sensitive and resistant membrane microdomains. Downregulation of Rac1 led to a displacement of p110\u03b2 from membrane rafts whereas raft and nonraft membrane marker distributions were unchanged (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

To this end, we selectively disrupted the formation of membrane rafts with the cholesterol-depleting agent, methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) in starvation-LPA stimulation experiments. Both p110\u03b2-Lyn and p110\u03b2-Lyn RBM failed to induce p-Akt when rafts were disrupted by M\u03b2CD, a defect which was rescued upon addition of excess cholesterol to the cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Specifically we analyzed the efficiency of our DKO add-back MEFs in wound healing assays. Wound closure was monitored up to 12\u2009hr upon scratching. p110\u03b2-Lyn RBM DKO add-back MEFs migrate more efficiently into the wound than p110\u03b2-Lyn GBM DKO add-back cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). This observation is consistent with a distinct activating role of G\u03b2\u03b3 on p110\u03b2, which cannot be compensated by relocalization of the molecule to rafts. Transwell migration assays using the same add-back lines reinforced the notion that selective raft targeting is compensatory for p110\u03b2-RBM whereas p110\u03b2-Lyn GBM DKO add-backs are defective in migration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Taken together, this data is again consistent with the idea that the primary function of p110\u03b2-Rac1 binding lies in the placement of p110\u03b2 in membrane rafts and thus creating a GPCR signaling competent PI3K module."

To this end, we generated vectors that selectively target wt p110\u03b1 to subdomains of the plasma membrane. Following our previous work, p110\u03b1 was targeted to membrane rafts by using the Lyn-derived targeting motif and to nonraft membranes by the motif derived from Kras (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Analysis of homogenized samples fractionated via density gradient centrifugation confirmed enriched localization of p110\u03b1-Lyn to rafts, whereas p110\u03b1-Ras was more prominently localized to nonraft regions of the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Elution of triton sensitive and triton resistant membrane fractions further demonstrated enrichment of the targeting plasmids at the desired microdomains (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Previous reports suggest that GPCR activation can also trigger widespread downstream signaling via modulation of various growth factor receptor pathways (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsieh and Conti, 2005</a>). For instance, LPA stimulation promotes metalloprotease-mediated transactivation of EGFR, and EGFR activity itself is responsible for major growth-promoting effects of GPCR signaling (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prenzel et al., 1999</a>). Since p110\u03b1 has no G\u03b2\u03b3 or Rac1 binding site, we hypothesized that GPCR mediated EGFR activity might be critical for raft-localized p110\u03b1 to modulate Akt function in LPA signaling. To test this idea, we selectively inhibited G\u03b2\u03b3, EGFR or PDGFR with gallein, lapatinib and crenolanib respectively, in serum starved and LPA stimulated p110\u03b1-Lyn or p110\u03b2-wt DKO add-back MEFs. EGFR activation as well as Akt and the downstream S6 phosphorylations were observed for both MEF lines upon stimulation with LPA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In support of our hypothesis, EGFR but not G\u03b2\u03b3 or PDGFR inhibition reduced p-Akt/S6 in p110\u03b1-Lyn DKO add-back MEFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, compare lanes 3, 4 and 5). In contrast, G\u03b2\u03b3 activity was critical for p110\u03b2-wt mediated GPCR signaling while EGFR inhibition had only a modest effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, compare lanes 8 and 9). Consistent with these results, p110\u03b1-Lyn DKO add-back MEFs were more resistant to gallein in cellular proliferation assays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, left), whereas p110\u03b2-wt DKO add-backs were refractory to EGFR inhibition by lapatinib (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, right). These results suggest that the EGFR activation by LPA stimulated GPCRs is required for raft-localized p110\u03b1 to promote Akt phosphorylation and activation; whereas the canonical G\u03b2\u03b3 pathway was essential for p110\u03b2-mediated GPCR signaling."

We and others have demonstrated that tumors deficient of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are often dependent on the p110\u03b2 isoform. Therefore we employed PTEN intact and PTEN null cancer cell line pairs and attempted to disrupt rafts by inhibiting cholesterol function. First, we treated PTEN positive DU145 and PTEN null PC3 prostate cancer cells with increasing doses of the cholesterol-depleting agent M\u03b2CD. PC3 cells were significantly more sensitive to M\u03b2CD treatment than DU145 cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Next we used PTEN wt MCF7 and PTEN null BT549 breast cancer cells to further test our hypothesis. Along the same line, BT549 breast cancer cells were more susceptible to M\u03b2CD than MCF7 cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). As an independent approach, we utilized simvastatin, an FDA-approved inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step (HMG-CoA to mavelonic acid) in cholesterol biogenesis in order to lower cholesterol levels. Once again, PC3 cells were considerably more sensitive to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis than DU145 cells. A simvastatin concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcM was sufficient to potently inhibit proliferation of PC3 cells, which did not impede growth of DU145 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Next we treated PTEN wt MCF7 and PTEN null BT549 cells with simvastatin. Treatment of BT549 cells with simvastatin led to a significant impediment of proliferation at 1\u20132\u2009\u03bcM concentrations, which was not growth inhibitory for MCF7 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>).

In an attempt to restore PI3K pathway activation, we expressed constitutively active, oncogenic mutants of p110\u03b1, H1047R and E545K in PC3 cells. Notably this lead to an activation of Akt as anticipated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Next, we treated these cells with the cholesterol-lowering agent, simvastatin. Although control PC3 cells were quite susceptible to simvastatin treatment, PC3-p110\u03b1 H1047R or E545K expressing cells proliferated more robustly in the presence of previously deleterious doses of the inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E and F</a>). A biochemical analysis of these cells showed that Akt activation was repressed in PC3 cells treated with simvastatin and this repression was relieved by p110\u03b1-H1047R or E545K expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). These results suggest that raft specific inhibition of PI3K function in PC3 cells can be partially alleviated by expression of constitutively active oncogenic alleles of p110\u03b1, which presumably utilize raft independent modes of activation. As a complementary approach, we re-expressed either a wt or a catalytically dead version of human Pten (Pten C124S) in PC3 and BT549 cells. Restoration of wt Pten lead to a reduction in Akt activation as judged by levels of pAkt (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A and D</a>).

We have used a molecular genetic system that allowed us to express specific membrane-targeted isoforms of either p110\u03b1 or p110\u03b2 in an isogenic p110\u03b1/p110\u03b2 DKO background. This genetic system enabled functional comparisons between wild type and membrane-targeted alleles of class IA PI3Ks. Interestingly for p110\u03b2, raft targeting alleviates the requirement for Rac1 binding. However, G\u03b2\u03b3 association is unable to be rescued by raft targeting. These results indicate that Rac1-p110\u03b2 interaction may be necessary for localization of p110\u03b2 to GPCR signaling permissive membrane microdomains, whereas its association with G\u03b2\u03b3 remains crucial for the activation of its lipid kinase activity upon ligand binding to GPCRs. Interestingly, even p110\u03b1, which is usually unresponsive to GPCR activation, becomes responsive if properly localized.

One fundamental difference between these PI3Ks however, is in their intrinsic membrane binding properties. p110\u03b2, by virtue of its association with Rac1, is naturally localized to membrane rafts. On the other hand, p110\u03b1 does not reside in rafts under physiological conditions. However, when it is artificially targeted to the rafts, p110\u03b1 is capable of functioning downstream of GPCRs.

In the physiological case p110\u03b2 is activated via its interaction with G\u03b2\u03b3. However, we found that EGFR activity is essential for raft-localized p110\u03b1 mediated Akt phosphorylation. EGFR is enriched in raft fractions, and its activity has been intimately linked to GPCR signaling. LPA stimulation, for instance, was reported to induce EGFR phosphorylation and transactivation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Daub et al., 1997</a>). Membrane bound metalloproteases and non-receptor tyrosine kinases like Src and Pyk2 are implicated in this regulation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prenzel et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andreev et al., 2001</a>). Our results suggest that LPA stimulated-EGFR could contribute to activation of raft-localized p110\u03b1, whereas the canonical G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0association is the prominent form of activation for p110\u03b2. However, we cannot rule out a modest contribution of EGFR in raft-localized p110\u03b2 activation, as we detected residual activation of Akt in cells expressing raft-targeted, G\u03b2\u03b3 binding deficient p110\u03b2 upon LPA treatment. Notably p110\u03b2 may also be dependent on Rac mediated raft localization for its activation in the non-physiological conditions of PTEN loss. However, in the case of p110\u03b2 activation in response to PTEN loss yet another mechanism may be involved as the second step in p110\u03b2 activation- further experimentation will be required to test this point."

Raft targeting of mutant versions of p110 enabled us to infer that Rac1 binding, at least in a PTEN wild-type setting, is crucial for localization of p110\u03b2 into signaling permissive membrane microdomains. G\u03b2\u03b3 interaction on the other hand, provides the basis for p110\u03b2 activation upon ligand-induced stimulation of GPCRs. We further verified the involvement of raft microdomains in LPA mediated GPCR signaling via cholesterol deprivation experiments. Cholesterol depletion specifically inhibited activating Akt phosphorylations whereas Erk phosphorylation was largely unaffected. These results indicate that activation of the MAPK signaling cascade by GPCRs is not crucially dependent on raft integrity, reinforcing the notion that critical role of membrane compartmentalization may be unique to PI3K/Akt signaling."

Thus the reported selective localization of PTEN in nonraft domains suggests that it might exert relatively little control on raft recruitment of p110\u03b2 and activation of Akt, while preventing the resulting signals from propagating outside raft domains. The elevated signaling potency observed when either p110\u03b1 or \u03b2 is targeted to rafts could be explained by a regional lack of PTEN dependent negative regulation. In tumor cells lacking PTEN, such p110\u03b2 dependent signaling could spread to larger portions of the cells greatly strengthening PI3K signaling. However the fact that p110\u03b2 signaling in PTEN null cells is still dependent on raft integrity suggests that the second, Rac-independent 'G\u03b2\u03b3 like' signal activating p110\u03b2 is likely to initiate in rafts in the absence of PTEN. We do not feel that this second signal is G\u03b2\u03b3 itself in most PTEN null cells as Akt activation is often not blocked by GPCR antagonists."

Similarly the Vanhaesebroeck group has found that not all tumors arising in mice with global knockout of a single PTEN allele are dependent on p110\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berenjeno et al., 2012</a>).

Our data warrant further work on the role of membrane partitioning in regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and offer novel therapeutic aspects concerning treatment of PTEN null cancers."

Cell-associated dye was extracted with 2\u2009ml of 10% acetic acid for 15\u2009min and the optical density (OD) was measured at 595 nm. Values were normalized to the OD at day 0 or to vehicle treatment at day seven for each sample. Each data point was determined in either duplicates or triplicates. For experiments performed with limited supplementation, DMEM with 2% FBS was used. For experiments with cancer cells, RPMI with 4% FBS was used.

Re-expression of Pten lead to a reduction in p-Akt in both PC3 and BT549 cells, whereas expression of a phosphatase-dead version of Pten did not alter levels of p-Akt. Interestingly, restoration of Pten expression rendered PC3 and BT549 cells more resistant to simvastatin treatment. These results complemented the data obtained upon use of oncogenic p110\u03b1 mutants in simvastatin treated PC3 cells. Both PC3 and BT549 cells could be partially saved from the adverse effects of simvastatin via expression of Pten, which attenuates the activity of Akt that functions downstream of PI3K signaling. These results further corroborated the notion that Pten loss might be critical in lipid raft mediated p110beta activation. You can now find these results in <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>."

According to our western blot analysis, we have obtained 2 MEF lines with near complete knock-out of PTEN. As expected, a significant increase in p-Akt and p-S6 levels were detected accompanying the loss of PTEN expression (Figure A). We used these PTEN knock-down MEF lines alongside with control cells to study phenotypes associated with PI3K inhibition and simvastatin treatment. Initially we treated these cells with isoform specific inhibitors of class IA PI3Ks; BYL719 (a p110\u03b1 specific inhibitor), KIN193 (a p110\u03b2 specific inhibitor), CAL101 (a p110\u03b4 specific inhibitor) or GDC001 (a pan-PI3K inhibitor). wt MEF cells are inherently more dependent on p110\u03b1 mediated signaling. A modest concentration of p110\u03b1 inhibitor (1\u03bcM) significantly inhibited cellular growth of exponentially growing cells. Comparable amounts of p110\u03b2 or p110\u03b4 specific inhibitors do not significantly affect cellular growth (Figure B). Of note, knock-down of PTEN with 2 shRNAs did not alter this prevalent isoform dependence. PTEN silenced MEFs are still p110\u03b1 dependent for growth and do not display a significant growth reduction upon inhibition of p110\u03b2 or p110\u03b4 isoforms. In addition, all these MEF lines were exquisitely sensitive to pan-PI3K inhibition by GDC. We have also verified this biochemically in a short-term inhibitor treatment assay analyzing p-Akt and p-S6 in the same MEF lines. Treatment with BYL719 for 2 hours almost completely wiped out p-Akt or p-S6 in either control or PTEN silenced MEF lines whereas KIN193 displayed a much reduced potency in downregulating Akt and S6 phosphorylations in control or PTEN knock-down MEFs (Figure D). In line with the assays using isoform-specific inhibitors, treatment of either control or PTEN silenced MEFs with simvastatin lead to a similar level of growth inhibition. In brief, PTEN loss in untransformed MEFs rendered them neither p110\u03b2 dependent nor more sensitive to interference with raft function. These results were indeed intriguing given the strong correlation between PTEN loss and the dependence on the p110\u03b2 isoform."

Indeed, in an animal model of prostate tumor formation induced by Pten loss, in only one out of the three mouse prostate lobes ablation of p110\u03b2, but not that of p110\u03b1, impeded tumorigenesis with a concomitant diminution of Akt phosphorylation (Jia et al. Nature, 2008). The Vanhaesebroeck lab also found tumor formation driven by PTEN loss was not always blocked by ablation of p110\u03b2 activity in a different GEM model. Clearly, additional parameters seem to be involved in optimal activation of p110\u03b2 in a PTEN null setting. At the present time we have not incorporated this data into the text \u2013 we feel that negative data is not sufficient to make strong inferences. However if the reviewers or editors prefer we are willing to incorporate this data (probably as a point in the Discussion and supplemental figure)."
