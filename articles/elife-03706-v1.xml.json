While it has been described that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation becomes defective in old age, the cellular mechanism is largely unknown. Autophagy is a major cellular lysosomal degradation pathway of bulk material, and levels are known to fall with age. In this study, we describe a novel role for autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation. Mice lacking the autophagy gene <i>Atg7</i> in T cells failed to establish CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory to influenza and MCMV infection. Interestingly, autophagy levels were diminished in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from aged mice. We could rejuvenate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in elderly mice in an autophagy dependent manner using the compound spermidine. This study reveals a cell intrinsic explanation for poor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory in the elderly and potentially offers novel immune modulators to improve aged immunity."

While it has been described that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation becomes defective in old age, the cellular mechanism is largely unknown. Autophagy is a major cellular lysosomal degradation pathway of bulk material, and levels are known to fall with age. In this study, we describe a novel role for autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation. Mice lacking the autophagy gene <i>Atg7</i> in T cells failed to establish CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory to influenza and MCMV infection. Interestingly, autophagy levels were diminished in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from aged mice. We could rejuvenate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in elderly mice in an autophagy dependent manner using the compound spermidine. This study reveals a cell intrinsic explanation for poor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory in the elderly and potentially offers novel immune modulators to improve aged immunity."

While the cytokines, surface molecules, and signaling components involved in T cell memory formation have been extensively studied, the molecular pathways supporting these cell fate decisions are poorly understood. The T memory population is (1) quiescent, (2) long-lived and actively maintained, and (3) relies on mitochondrial respiration (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pearce and Pearce, 2013</a>). Both reduced cell cycling and longevity of this stem cell-like population demand rigorous maintenance of the cytoplasm as debris cannot be diluted to daughter cells, reminiscent of true stem cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mortensen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Guan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Warr et al., 2013</a>).

However, while the role of autophagy in the homeostasis of na\u00efve T cells is well studied (<a href=\"#bib39\">Puleston and Simon, 2014</a>), nothing is known about the requirement of autophagy in antigen-experienced T cells. The T cell memory pool has previously been shown to be controlled by PI3K/Akt and AMPK signaling as well as mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibition (<a href=\"#bib3\">Araki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rolf et al., 2013</a>), all of which also control autophagy (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jung et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, T cell memory responses can be improved with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Araki et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, rapamycin also rejuvenates HSCs in old mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2009</a>). Neither of these studies addressed autophagy as a contributing mechanism."

While <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> T cells respond normally during the early stages of live viral challenge, a severely compromised memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment was found in response to influenza and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Using bone marrow (BM) chimeras, we excluded that this is due the effects of lymphopenia; poor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help; exhaustion, or altered cytokine receptor expression. Moreover, autophagy was found to be highest in antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells when compared to na\u00efve cells. Antigen-specific <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also underwent more cell death at the time of memory formation, display compromised mitochondrial health, and increased expression of the glucose receptor GLUT1, a marker for glycolysis. Furthermore, recall CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to repeat immunizations and vaccination protocols were greatly diminished. This being reminiscent of the human ageing immune system (<a href=\"#bib11\">Haq and McElhaney, 2014</a>), we confirmed reduced autophagy at the transcriptional and functional level in murine T cells from old mice. Importantly, we were able to restore the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory response in old mice with the autophagy-inducing compound spermidine, but not in autophagy-deficient mice. Finally, we found that spermidine induces autophagy independently of mTOR in T cells. Enhancing autophagy in an mTOR-independent manner may provide a safe way to improve vaccine responses in the elderly."

Successful excision and thereby absence of <i>Atg7</i> mRNA and Atg7 protein was confirmed in purified T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>, respectively). Using the imaging flow cytometer (ImageStream) to count LC3 puncta in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Phadwal et al., 2012</a>), we demonstrated that functional autophagy was significantly diminished in <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> with examples of ImageStream images in right panel).

                                "text": "Previous reports have noted a number of changes to the na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment in the absence of autophagy, with T cell lymphopenia, a consistent observation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pua et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Puleston and Simon, 2014</a>). We set out to investigate if an altered na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment exists in T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice. We confirmed observations from previous reports using similar autophagy-deficient mouse models (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pua et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2009</a>) that thymic development of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was normal in 6-week old T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, mice were lymphopenic for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lymph nodes and blood (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Moreover, <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited an activated phenotype with increased CD44 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and decreased CD62L expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), resembling a \u2018virtual memory\u2019 compartment (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akue et al., 2012</a>). We observed similar frequencies of central effector memory CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>, however, T-<i>Atg7</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice accumulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with an effector memory phenotype (CD62L<sup>\u2212</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Similarly, data from a mouse model in which another essential autophagy gene, <i>Atg5</i>, was deleted under the hematopoietic stem cell-specific promoter Vav, showed T cell lymphopenia and the expanded virtual memory T cell compartment (CD8<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>) suggesting this phenotype is not <i>Atg7</i> specific (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Next, we established that proliferation was increased in the activated CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment by Ki-67 staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The observed activated phenotype and increased cell turnover in <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are likely driven by homeostatic proliferation in an attempt to fill the depleted T cell niche. Indeed, the expression of the homeostatic proliferation marker CD24 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2006</a>) was found to be significantly increased on <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). To investigate whether lymphopenia drives this activated phenotype in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment, we generated 1:1 mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras from CD45.2<sup>+</sup> T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> BM mixed with CD45.1<sup>+</sup> wild-type BM. Both BMs contributed equally to form the new hematological system (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were still diminished even in the presence of a replete T cell niche, suggesting the survival defect previously described for autophagy-deficient T cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pua et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mortensen et al., 2010</a>) is cell-intrinsic (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). However, the activated <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotype was no longer detected in BM chimeras as measured by the frequency of donor CD45.2<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells found to be CD62L<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) and CD44<sup>hi</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). These data indicate that the observed homeostatic proliferation and the change in surface phenotype of <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are driven by lymphopenia and are not cell-intrinsic."

                                "text": "Previous studies have shown a role for autophagy in naive T cell organelle homeostasis and survival (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pua et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jia and He, 2011</a>). However, the importance of autophagy in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to infection is unknown. To investigate this, we challenged <i>T-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice with influenza (PR8 strain) and MCMV. In T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, we found normal expansion of the antigen-specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell (CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub>) compartment using influenza-specific tetramers on day 10 (peak response) in the lungs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, due to the pre-existing lymphopenia observed in na\u00efve mice, the absolute counts were diminished (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub> response to MCMV in the blood on day 7 was also normal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hutchinson et al., 2011</a>). However, the ability of T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice to form memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub>) to both influenza and MCMV is severely compromised (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Performing serial bleeding on influenza infected mice over time, we demonstrated a catastrophic collapse of the antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pool at day 21, resulting in a failure to retain CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> in T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, the response to the \u2018inflationary\u2019 epitopes m38 and IE3 from MCMV is also compromised (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In response to these epitopes, wild-type CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells continue to expand throughout MCMV chronic infection. However, <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells fail to inflate and instead undergo a dramatic contraction leading to a failure to form a MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory pool. This profound CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell contraction in T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice is also observed in response to a conventional, non-inflating MCMV epitope (m45, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While viral titers against influenza in the lungs of wild-type and T-<i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice were comparable at day 3 of infection, they were significantly higher on day 6 in T-<i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This is most likely due to the significantly lower absolute number of antigen-specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. As T-<i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice survived influenza challenge, we expect that the virus is eventually cleared in all mice. In keeping with these findings, autophagy levels (CytoID) are significantly increased in the antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment compared to na\u00efve T cells (CD44<sup>lo</sup>) in response to influenza in both spleen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) and lungs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>), indicating autophagy is induced upon antigen stimulation in vivo<i>.</i>"

Even in the context of a BM chimera, <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells fail to generate a CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> pool following influenza infection, suggesting this defect is cell intrinsic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). By using BM chimeras to observe antigen-specific <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, we excluded a number of explanations as to why T-<i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice fail to form CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub>: (1) lymphopenia, (2) defective CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help, and (3) the excision of <i>Atg7</i> in CD4-expressing antigen-presenting cells affecting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming. Furthermore, a defect in the frequency of memory precursor cells might also impact upon CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> formation in T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice. Mixed BM chimeras demonstrated that the frequency of short-lived effector (SLEC, CD127<sup>+</sup>KLRG1<sup>\u2212</sup>) and memory precursor (MPEC, CD127<sup>\u2212</sup>KLRG1<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was in fact normal in T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We then tested whether the lack of memory response is due to exhaustion of autophagy-deficient antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While in T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, we found a sharp increase of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells co-expressing the exhaustion markers PD-1<sup>+</sup> and TIM-3<sup>+</sup>; this was not found in the mixed BM chimeras. This indicates that without lymphopenia, exhaustion is not a hallmark of <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and cannot explain the diminished CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> compartment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We then sought to determine if altered expression of cytokine receptors crucial for CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> maintenance could explain the defective CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> compartment.

                                "text": "To understand the mechanism that leads to the failure to maintain a memory compartment in the absence of autophagy, we next checked if <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were undergoing more cell death than wild-type cells. While this is well described for na\u00efve autophagy deficient T cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Puleston and Simon, 2014</a>), it had not been analyzed in antigen-specific T cells. As expected, in wild-type mice challenged with MCMV, we found highest levels of cell death among antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells just after the peak of the effector phase on day 9, whereas in T-<i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, cell death was found to increase over time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This could not be explained by a change in levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The control of mitochondrial quality and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via mitophagy, the degradation of mitochondria, has been found to prevent cell death in T cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pua et al., 2009</a>). In keeping with this, mitochondrial content (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and mitochondrial ROS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) were significantly increased in <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. While this likely explains the increased cell death, as shown for other hematopoietic cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mortensen et al., 2010</a>) and T cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pua et al., 2009</a>), mitophagy is also thought to be essential for maintenance of healthy mitochondrial energy generation. This notion is consistent with our data in other <i>autophagy-deficient</i> hematopoietic cell types (macrophages and primary leukemic lines, submitted) demonstrating increased glycolytic enzymes by proteomic analysis, increased lactate production and decreased oxygen consumption using metabolic seahorse measurements. Indeed, studies by Pearce et al showed that formation of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> pool is accompanied by a switch to mitochondrial respiration (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pearce et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sukumar et al., 2013</a>). However, in the physiological viral infection models used here, aiming to mimic human infection, the scarcity of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells prevented us from performing these metabolic measurements. In addition, due to the loss of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> in the absence of <i>Atg7</i> by day 30, any metabolic analysis was restricted to early time points when antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are still present in T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice. We resorted to the measurement of a surrogate marker of glycolysis, the glucose transporter GLUT-1 on antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by two different techniques, (a) the fluorescently labeled GLUT-1 binding domain of HTLV (human T cell leukemia virus), which specifically detects GLUT-1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Manel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kinet et al., 2007</a>), and (b) a GLUT-1 antibody staining. As expected, GLUT-1 is upregulated on CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub> (day 9) and then downregulated on CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> (day 22) in wild-type mice as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells switch to mitochondrial respiration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, antigen-specific <i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub> expresses more GLUT-1 and downregulation does not occur to the same extent at the later time points compared to WT cells (day 22) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This suggests that autophagy supports the metabolic switch during the differentiation from T<sub>eff</sub> to T<sub>mem</sub>. This was confirmed using the GLUT-1 antibody (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, treatment with the anti-diabetic drug metformin that induces mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation metabolism in T cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pearce et al., 2009</a>) did not rescue the memory T cell compartment in this model (data not shown)."

When the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell kinetics to the vaccine regimen were followed over time in the blood of T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, influenza-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected at normal frequencies to primary immunization but the secondary \u2018booster\u2019 vaccine was unable to induce an increase in NP-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency like it could in wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Similarly, vaccinated T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice failed to generate significant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to viral challenge in the blood (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As before, all mice survived the live viral challenge (data not shown). In summary, these data indicate that autophagy is required for the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recall response to either repeated immunizations with live virus or vaccination followed by live viral challenge. However, these results were not repeated in a mixed bone marrow chimera setting, making it difficult to exclude that lymphopenia, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help or CD4-expressing antigen-presenting cells might be responsible for defective recall response in T-<i>Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice."

We first confirmed that spermidine induces autophagy in T cells in vitro in a dose and time-dependent manner shown by increased levels of LC3-II (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Spermidine levels in the blood are known to decrease with age (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pucciarelli et al., 2012</a>). To mimic this, we used the inhibitor of the natural spermidine synthesis pathway DFMO in the human Jurkat T cell line and found that autophagy levels detected by LC3 western blot significantly dropped in BafA treated samples and untreated samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Autophagy levels could be rescued by the addition of very low levels of spermidine in T cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). As mTOR inhibition, such as achieved with rapamycin, is well known for its multiple side effects (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lamming et al., 2013</a>), we confirmed that spermidine induces autophagy in T cells in an mTOR-independent manner. Rapamycin completely abolished the phosphorylation of S6K, a major target downstream of activated mTOR, whereas spermidine had no such effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Finally, we administered spermidine to old and young mice via the drinking water at concentrations known to induce autophagy (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eisenberg et al., 2009</a>) during the influenza vaccination protocols as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>. In response to first and second vaccination, and as observed in ageing humans, old mice do not mount a robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response as compared to young mice. Spermidine dramatically enhanced influenza-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in old vaccinated wild-type mice but not in old vaccinated T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice as tracked over time in blood (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Similarly, the response to live influenza challenge in the blood was improved twofold to threefold (back to levels similar to young mice) when spermidine was administered to old mice, but not in the absence of autophagy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). In the lungs, the number of NP-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to influenza challenge in vaccinated old mice were improved fivefold to sixfold in the presence of spermidine, but had little effect on the response of aged T<i>-Atg7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>)."

In this study, we show how this lymphopenia drives the remaining T cells to take on an activated/memory phenotype as they proliferate in an attempt to re-fill the T cell niche, often termed \u2018virtual memory\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jia and He, 2011</a>). Thus, we provide a link between lymphopenia and the formation of the \u2018virtual memory\u2019 compartment and highlight the significant changes in T cell surface phenotype that can occur in a lymphopenic environment. Interestingly, the virtual memory compartment is also a hallmark of the ageing adaptive immune system.

Interestingly, the severely depleted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recall response did not prevent T-<i>Atg7</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice from surviving a lethal secondary heterotypic influenza challenge. Influenza virus is typically controlled by both antibodies and cellular immunity. However, in a heterotypic challenge, the surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (recognized by antibodies) differ between the two heterotypic strains, while the viral internal proteins (presented by MHC class I to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) remain the same, leaving the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to provide protection (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rimmelzwaan et al., 2007</a>). The unique protective role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in heterotypic immunity was described several decades ago in mice (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rimmelzwaan et al., 2007</a>). The observation that the majority of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes are cross-reactive between subtypes and are located in the most conserved regions of the internal proteins (nucleoprotein and matrix protein) confirms their role. In humans, the evidence, typical for human studies, is sparse and more circumstantial. A study from 1983 by McMichael et al demonstrated that in experimentally infected individuals, virus-specific cytotoxicity inversely correlated with the extent of virus shedding in the absence of virus-specific antibodies for the strain that was used for infection (<a href=\"#bib27\">McMichael et al., 1983</a>). More recently, Lalvani et al found higher frequencies of pre-existing T cells to conserved epitopes in individuals who developed less severe illness in the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic in the absence of cross-protective antibodies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sridhar et al., 2013</a>). We would postulate therefore that the survival of the T-<i>Atg7</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice after the secondary heterotypic challenge relies on the very few effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generated.

Regarding the first one, we show evidence for the accumulation of mitochondria and ROS in the absence of autophagy. However, a limitation of our study is, we did not test for accumulation of other organelles and protein aggregates. As for the second hypothesis, initial studies involved TRAF6 (TNFR-associated factor 6) in the regulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> development by modulating fatty acid metabolism and thereby increasing mitochondrial respiration (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pearce et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">van der Windt et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, TRAF6, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has recently been shown to stabilize essential proteins in the autophagy pathway such as Ulk1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nazio et al., 2013</a>) and Beclin-1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shi and Kehrl, 2010</a>). We therefore hypothesize that TRAF6 controls metabolism via autophagy and propose three mechanisms contributing to autophagy's role in mitochondrial respiration: (1) through lipophagy, the degradation of lipids (<a href=\"#bib50\">Weidberg et al., 2009</a>), autophagy provides the fatty acids that fuel the Krebs cycle with Acetyl-CoA though \u03b2-oxidation, (2) through degradation of glycolytic enzymes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Xiong et al., 2011</a>), and (3) through mitophagy, autophagy provides mitochondrial quality control that is required for functional mitochondrial ATP generation. We provide evidence for the latter mechanism here. This suggests that autophagy is important in the control of metabolic pathways in T cells. Interestingly both the accumulation of damaged mitochondria/oxidative stress as well as a bias to preferentially use glycolysis are hallmarks of the ageing cell (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hipkiss, 2006</a>)."

We expect that fasting or other mTOR-independent drugs such as resveratrol (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morselli et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Morselli et al., 2010</a>) may also be beneficial for CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>mem</sub> maintenance. However, spermidine is significantly more attractive than previously published T<sub>mem</sub>-boosting compounds such as metformin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pearce et al., 2009</a>) and rapamycin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Araki et al., 2009</a>), that come with unwelcome side effects and toxicity in humans. The elucidation of the precise role of spermidine will be the subject of future work and will enable its development as a safe, readily administrable immune-modulating drug."

However, it is notable that mouse survival is not affected by autophagy deficiency in T cells. The reviewers ask whether the authors have tried to use higher titers of the viruses or lethal strains such as those described before (Virology 2011, 412:36-45). If antibodies are the main effectors against influenza and CD8 T cells are not sufficient or required for the protection against influenza challenge, this should be clarified by the authors. In addition, the authors should more fully discuss the data on the role of human CD8 T cell responses in protection against influenza challenge after vaccines. The argument that the findings in mice may have relevance to diminished vaccine responses to flu vaccines in elderly relies on the relevance of CD8 T cell memory responses to vaccine efficacy. The final paragraph mentions briefly that CD8 T cell responses are an important correlate of vaccine protection; however, this should be discussed more extensively in light of the lack of in-depth experimental evidence in this study in the mouse for a role of memory CD8 T cells in protection against disease caused by viral challenge."

While viral titers in the lungs of T-Atg7-/-mice are comparable to WT mice at day 3 of infection, they are significantly higher on day 6, suggesting T-Atg7-/- mice clear virus less efficiently than WT mice. This is probably due to the significantly lower absolute count of effector antigen-specific CD8 T cells. We expect that T-Atg7-/- mice would eventually clear the influenza virus as they survive the influenza challenge. The reason we did not measure this in a bone marrow chimera or adoptive transfer setting is because both the Atg7+/+ CD45.1 and Atg7-/- CDD45.2+ CD8 T cells would contribute toward viral clearance and it would be impossible to discern either's contribution. However, an additional mouse model as suggested by the reviewer, i.e. adoptive transfer experiments of Atg7-/- T cells into a T cell depleted host, would probably address this issue. This experiment could not be accomplished in the time frame given. We have now added the graph of viral clearance as <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a> to the manuscript."
