Here, we used the <i>Drosophila</i> tracheal system to study the complex relationship between the ECM and epithelial cells during development. We show that there is an active feedback mechanism between the apical ECM (aECM) and the apical F-actin in tracheal cells. Furthermore, we reveal that cell-cell junctions are key players in this aECM patterning and organisation and that individual cells contribute autonomously to their aECM. Strikingly, changes in the aECM influence the levels of phosphorylated Src42A (pSrc) at cell junctions. Therefore, we propose that Src42A phosphorylation levels provide a link for the ECM environment to ensure proper cytoskeletal organisation."

Here, we used the <i>Drosophila</i> tracheal system to study the complex relationship between the ECM and epithelial cells during development. We show that there is an active feedback mechanism between the apical ECM (aECM) and the apical F-actin in tracheal cells. Furthermore, we reveal that cell-cell junctions are key players in this aECM patterning and organisation and that individual cells contribute autonomously to their aECM. Strikingly, changes in the aECM influence the levels of phosphorylated Src42A (pSrc) at cell junctions. Therefore, we propose that Src42A phosphorylation levels provide a link for the ECM environment to ensure proper cytoskeletal organisation."

The experiments reveal that rings of actin filaments form on the apical side of tracheal cells before the ridges appear. These rings generate regular folds in the membrane that surrounds each tracheal cell and are required for an enzyme to accumulate in the cells. This enzyme produces chitin, leading to its deposition in stripes above the actin rings."

On the one hand, the ECM has a key role in cell signalling events, either acting as a storage compartment for growth factor molecules or by modifying and/or stabilising such growth factors. On the other hand, the ECM provides an environment with a variable degree of stiffness that, until recently, has been considered a physical support to ensure the arrangement of softer parts of body organs. However, increasing evidence indicates that the ECM not only provides a passive contribution to organ shape but also impinges on the cell behaviour and genetic programmes of the organ (<a href=\"#bib5\">Daley and Yamada, 2013</a>). The ECM is emerging as a direct modulator of many aspects of cell biology, rather than as a mere physical network that supports cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hynes, 2014</a>). But how does the ECM influence cell biology and which molecules are involved?"

The assembly of these structures requires a complex set of diverse events involving protein secretion, as well as the modification of these proteins. In spite of the relevance of ECMs, it is not yet well understood how they are generated. In particular, a fascinating aspect of ECMs is the fact that they usually constitute a structure contributed to and shared by many cells. But how do individual cells participate in the generation of a supracellular ECM with an overall common organisation that overruns cellular borders?"

Once the different branches of the tracheal system have been established to cover the overall embryonic body, tracheal cells begin to secrete the components of a chitin-rich aECM that lines up the lumen of the tracheal tubes and can be visualised by the incorporation of chitin-binding probes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Moussian et al., 2005</a>). A distinctive feature of this aECM are taenidial folds, a series of cuticle ridges that compose a helical structure running perpendicular to the tube length along the entire lumen (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wigglesworth, 1990</a>). Taenidia are believed to confer mechanical strength to the tubes and have been compared to a coiled spring within a rubber tube (<a href=\"#bib30\">Thompson, 1929</a>) or to the corrugated hose of a vacuum cleaner (<a href=\"#bib17\">Manning and Krasnow, 1993</a>). From the very first descriptions, it was noticed that taenidia are unaffected by the presence of cell boundaries (<a href=\"#bib30\">Thompson, 1929</a>), thereby indicating that they are a supracellular structure and suggesting a substantial degree of intercellular coordination. More recently, it has been reported that taenidial organisation correlates with that of the apical F-actin bundles in underlying cells\u2014the formation of these bundles preceding the appearance of taenidia (<a href=\"#bib18\">Matusek et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kondo et al., 2007</a>). However, the relationship between these bundles and taenidia is still poorly understood. In addition, physical modelling has recently revealed that the interaction of the apical cellular membrane and the aECM determines the stability of biological tubes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dong et al., 2014</a>), thus generating more questions about how this interaction occurs."

We focused on the main branch of the trachea, the dorsal trunk (DT), where taenidia are more conspicuous. It is worth mentioning that, prior to taenidial fold formation, a transient chitin filament is formed inside the tracheal lumen. This filament has been postulated to regulate tube length and diameter expansion (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tonning et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Moussian et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Luschnig and Uv, 2014</a>). As this filament is a transient structure, its appearance in and disappearance from the lumen of the DT is a useful landmark to precisely stage embryos. Taenidia began to be detectable by late stage 16 when the chitin filament was still present in the tracheal lumen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Optical section analysis showed that taenidia develop at the more external luminal sections, while the chitin filament lies in a central position inside the lumen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). From early stage 17, a stage when the luminal chitin fibre is already absent (<a href=\"#bib21\">Moussian et al., 2006b</a>), taenidia became increasingly more prominent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). As mentioned above, taenidial folds were organised as spiral rings that span many distinct cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>)."

At early stage 16, when taenidia were not yet detectable, we distinguished some actin rings in the cells of the DT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

Shortly after, actin rings in other cells were detected throughout the length of the DT, but these were much weaker than those present in the fusion cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2019\u2019</a>).

In embryos, it is more difficult to reach a clear conclusion from confocal projection images, as the two structures are in different planes. However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the embryonic tracheal DT show the presence of electron dense structures in the cytoplasm underneath the taenidia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>, open arrow). These densities are likely to be cross-sections of actin filaments and not vesicles or microtubules because of their size. Whereas microtubules appear as circular structures of about 25 nm in diameter and vesicles are generally 5\u201320 times larger, actin filaments are only about 7 nm in diameter (<a href=\"#bib10\">Grazi, 1997</a>).

EM images have identified the accumulation of electron-dense material at the base of the taenidia that is thought to correspond to the chitin synthesis complex (<a href=\"#bib32\">Uv and Moussian, 2010</a>) and that appears to be located at the top of actin fibres (<a href=\"#bib21\">Moussian et al., 2006b</a>). Thus, the tracheal actin rings may instruct taenidial fold shaping by dictating the sites of chitin production. In the <i>Drosophila</i> trachea, this production is carried out by the membrane-inserted chitin synthase encoded by the <i>krotzkopf verkehrt</i> (<i>kkv</i>) gene (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ostrowski et al., 2002</a>). The Kkv chitin synthase enzyme catalyses the linkage between N-acetyl-glucosamines supplied in the cytoplasm and extrudes the polymers across the plasma membrane (for a review see [<a href=\"#bib21\">Moussian et al., 2006b</a>]). Therefore, we analysed Kkv distribution in tracheal cells. For this purpose, we made use of a recently generated transgenic strain carrying a <i>kkv-GFP</i>-tagged construct under the control of the UAS promoter sequences (<a href=\"#bib22\">Moussian et al., 2015</a>). When driven by the trachea-specific <i>btlGal4</i> driver, it rescued the tracheal phenotype of the <i>kkv</i> mutants (our own results and [<a href=\"#bib22\">Moussian et al., 2015</a>]), thereby indicating that the Kkv-GFP-tagged protein is fully functional and localises properly."

As when studying the contribution of tracheal actin rings to this process, we chose mutants that do not completely inhibit chitin deposition, as these mutants would probably heavily impair tracheal development, thus hindering specific analysis of the morphogenesis of taenidia. Thus, we turned to <i>Blimp-1</i>, an ecdysone response gene (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chavoshi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Beckstead et al., 2005</a>) that encodes the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of the transcriptional factor <i>B-lymphocyte-inducing maturation protein</i> gene and whose mutants have been reported to have misshapen trachea almost completely devoid of taenidia (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ng et al., 2006</a>)."

Consistent with this observation, <i>Blimp-1</i> mutants showed a pale ectodermal cuticle with smaller denticles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>), although their phenotype is weaker than that of the <i>kkv</i> chitin synthase mutants (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ostrowski et al., 2002</a>). This observation suggests that, while chitin deposition is severely impaired, some still accumulated in the cuticle of <i>Blimp-1</i> mutant embryos. In support of this hypothesis, we detected lower levels of fluostain signal in the trachea of <i>Blimp-1</i> mutants compared to the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, D</a>). Thus, we expected to find similarly less conspicuous taenidia, which was indeed the case. However, the most obvious abnormal feature of taenidia was their pattern, as they were not organised in folds perpendicular to the tube axis but instead ran parallel to it (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Given the close correlation between taenidia and actin bundle organisation, we examined actin arrangement in <i>Blimp-1</i> mutants and found that it was severely impaired. In most <i>Blimp-1</i> mutants examined (67%, n\u00a0=\u00a018), we did not observe tracheal actin rings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). However, in the mutant embryos in which we detected apical actin bundles (33%, n\u00a0=\u00a018), these were oriented in parallel to the tube length (data not shown) like the chitin structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Thus, as is the case for the other mutant genotypes examined so far, in <i>Blimp-1</i> embryos the lack of a proper arrangement of taenidial folds correlates with either the absence or abnormal pattern of actin rings."

To assess whether the effect of <i>Blimp-1</i> mutations on actin organisation was indeed a consequence of abnormal chitin deposition in the tracheal cuticle rather than the result of a direct and yet unknown role of <i>Blimp-1</i> in F-actin bundling, we examined tracheal actin organisation in mutants for <i>kkv</i>, a gene required for chitin morphogenesis only (<a href=\"#bib19\">Moussian et al., 2005</a>). Surprisingly, <i>kkv</i> mutants also lacked actin rings (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), thereby indicating a feedback role of proper chitin-mediated tracheal cuticle in F-actin organisation. In addition, F-actin bundles formed normally and thereafter collapsed in <i>kkv</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I-L</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>). This finding indicates that a proper cuticle is not required for the establishment of the F-actin rings but instead for their maintenance. This implies that proper chitin deposition/organisation contributes to ensure the proper organisation and stability of the apical F-actin rings."

We observed that both <i>kkv</i> and <i>Blimp-1</i> mutations had an effect on tracheal cell shape. In the wild-type trachea, the cells of the DT were organised such that the longest axis of their apical shape is parallel to the tube axis. However, in both <i>Blimp-1</i> and <i>kkv</i> mutant trachea (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B, C</a>), the anteroposterior elongation of the cells of the DT was lost, causing cells to be more square shaped. Thus, we hypothesised that the change in taenidial orientation in <i>kkv</i> and <i>Blimp-1</i> mutants could be attributed to the alteration in the overall orientation or shape of the tracheal cells. Interestingly, a modification of cell shape/orientation also occurs in embryos mutant for the Src-family kinase Src42A (<a href=\"#bib8\">F\u00f6rster and Luschnig, 2012</a>). However, and as previously reported for F-actin (<a href=\"#bib8\">F\u00f6rster and Luschnig, 2012</a>), we found taenidia to follow the same organisation in <i>Src42A</i> mutant embryos as the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) indicating that proper organisation of taenidia can be uncoupled from correct tracheal cell shape/orientation and thus that the former is not merely a consequence of the latter."

To generate tracheal DTs with distinct cellular composition, we used an <i>AbdB-Gal4</i> line that drives expression only in the posterior part of the embryo (<a href=\"#bib8\">F\u00f6rster and Luschnig, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">F\u00f6rster et al., 2010</a>). This approach also allowed us to have an internal control within the same embryo. Upon expression of <i>UASBlimp-1</i> under these conditions, lower levels of chitin were detected in the posterior metameres (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Thus, chitin deposition seems to be highly dependent on the levels of Blimp-1 activity as both loss-of-function mutations and overexpression of <i>Blimp-1</i> induce low levels of chitin. We also noted that overexpression of <i>Blimp-1</i> gives rise to tracheal cells with a less elongated apical side (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2019\u2019</a>), like that of <i>Blimp-1</i> and <i>kkv</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B, C</a>). We then examined the trachea at the border of the <i>AbdB-Gal4</i> domain, finding a perfect correlation between the different physical appearance of taenidia and cells and their genotype, with either wild-type or increased levels of <i>Blimp-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We then generated flip-out clones expressing <i>Blimp-1</i> in a <i>wild-type</i> background and obtained similar results in these clones (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B, C</a>, arrows). Thus, we conclude that <i>Blimp-1</i> regulates chitin accumulation in a cell-autonomous manner and that each cell contributes independently to the chitin deposition of their corresponding segments of the taenidial folds."

For both mutants, we saw a rescuing effect in the posterior tracheal metameres as taenidial folds became organised perpendicularly to the tube length (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D, E</a>). Using this approach, we were able to generate borders of cells with and without <i>tal/pri</i> and <i>Blimp-1</i> function and analyse taenidia in these conditions (red dotted line, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D, E</a>). In the case of the <i>tal/pri</i> rescue experiment, we detected a difference between the cells expressing the wild-type <i>tal/pri</i> gene and those with a wild-type phenotype, an observation consistent with the non-cell autonomous function of the Tal/Pri peptides (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kondo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Galindo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chanut-Delalande et al., 2014</a>). However, in the case of the <i>Blimp-1</i> rescue experiment, taenidia tended to follow the orientation dictated by the genotype of their respective cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D and F</a>). Moreover, and due to the expression domain of the <i>AbdBGAL4</i> driver not being completely continuous, we observed single cells of one of the genotypes surrounded by cells of the other and could detect either mutant cells with a longitudinal arrangement of the taenidia (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2019</a>, arrow) or 'rescued' cells with a perpendicular arrangement (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2019</a>, arrowhead); in this case, there was a correlation between the physical appearance of taenidia and the corresponding cell genotype. Interestingly, we also detected intermediate orientations between the prototypical longitudinal taenidia in the mutant domain and the perpendicular ones in the rescued domain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2019</a>, asterisk). These results suggest that cells 'adapt' the orientation of 'their' segments of the taenidia to the global orientation of the segments of the taenidia contributed by neighbouring cells."

A communal orientation of the intracellular apical actin bundles could arise from cells responding to a common extracellular cue. Alternatively, although not mutually exclusive, tracheal cells could coordinate the orientation of their apical actin bundles by means of their cell-cell junctions. Therefore, we sought to analyse the role of cellular junctions in the supracellular organisation of taenidial folds. We first attempted to downregulate cell-junction components in the embryonic trachea by means of expressing their corresponding double- stranded RNA constructs; however, we did not obtain a clear taenidial mutant phenotype. As mentioned before, RNAi-mediated knockdown often does not work during <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis and so we repeated the same experiments in the trachea of the 3rd larval instar. Upon expression of a dsRNA targeted at the gene encoding alpha-catenin (\u03b1-cat), we found that DE-cad was strongly downregulated (undetected by antibody staining), demonstrating that adherens junction (AJ) formation is disrupted in the DT of these embryos (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). By downregulating AJs, we found that in these embryos taenidia organised in groups of independent units, not encompassing the overall tracheal tube diameter (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9 B</a>) (cell-cell junction taenidial disruption was detected in 123 out of 156 DT cells analysed (79%), n\u00a0=\u00a018 larvae). Strikingly, despite the observed role of cell-cell junctions in taenidial continuity, these are still placed perpendicular to the tube length. This suggests that tracheal cells are able to sense a global orientation cue and align their actin bundles appropriately (<a href=\"#bib18\">Matusek et al., 2006</a>), despite having their continuity disrupted at the level of the cell-cell junctions. Also, in this mutant background, taenidia organisation mimicked the distribution of actin bundles (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which were similarly restricted to these independent units (100%, n\u00a0=\u00a017 larvae). Double labelling these trachea with fluostain and an apical cell membrane marker showed that these units corresponded to single cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B and C</a>), thereby confirming the role of cell-junctions in coordinating the pattern of F-actin bundles from neighbouring tracheal cells and ensuring a supracellular taenidia organisation encompassing the overall tracheal tube."

Less clear is how the chitin ECM could ensure the organisation of the tracheal actin rings. Previous work has also reported other effects of chitin on cytoskeletal organisation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tonning et al., 2005</a>), and in this case neither is it known how this effect is mediated. To advance in this direction, we sought to identify the proteins that could act as a link between the extracellular environment and the cytoskeletal organisation. To this end, we focused our attention on Src42A because of the role of the Src kinases in mediating extracellular signals to modulate actin organisation (for a review see [<a href=\"#bib28\">Parsons and Parsons, 2004</a>]) and because of the influence of constitutive Src42A activity in taenidial organisation. In particular, constitutively active mutations of Src42A disturb tracheal actin bundling (<a href=\"#bib8\">F\u00f6rster and Luschnig, 2012</a>) and, consequently, taenidial formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7 F</a>)."

However, the differences in Src42A phosphorylation were too variable to unequivocally analyse differences in levels. To clearly ascertain this effect, we used the <i>AbdBGal4</i> line, which allowed us to generate internal controls within the same embryos. Although the <i>kkv</i> RNAi inactivation appeared to be highly inefficient in this context as we obtained very few embryos with lower levels of chitin at their posterior tracheal metameres, in all these cases (n\u00a0=\u00a04) there was an increased level of phosphorylated Src42A in the metameres where <i>kkv</i> expression was downregulated (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A, D</a>). This observation was confirmed by the difference in levels of phosphorylated Src42A between <i>kkv</i> mutant and <i>kkv</i>-rescued cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C, F</a>). In addition, lower levels of phosphorylated Src42A were detected in regions with higher chitin levels upon Blimp-1 rescue of the posterior tracheal region of <i>Blimp-1</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B, E</a>). This observation was confirmed by Kkv rescue of <i>kkv</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C, F</a>). To check whether these differences could be attributed to differences in overall Src protein levels, we analysed Src protein in <i>kkv</i> mutant embryos and in embryos where Kkv was downregulated at the posterior end.

A functional redundancy could account for this observation and Src64 would be a likely candidate for such a phenomenon. However, we did not detect any actin ring phenotype in the trachea of double mutant embryos for both <i>Src42A</i> and <i>Src64B</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Thus, and irrespective of the nature of the role of Src42A activity on actin ring patterning, these results suggest that the feedback mechanism of the chitin aECM through Src42A is not mainly in instructing actin ring organisation but in preventing its disturbance by downregulating Src42A phosphorylation to levels compatible with proper actin ring organisation. Accordingly, genetic removal of <i>Src42A</i> in <i>Blimp-1</i> homozygous embryos, rescues the taenidial organisation phenotype to wild-type levels, while keeping other <i>Blimp-1</i> mutant features in all double mutant embryos observed (n = 12, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G-I</a>), confirming the biological role of Src42A in the mechanism underlying the supracellular organisation of the tracheal aECM."

In the light of the above and previously published results, we propose the following model for the formation of the taenidial folds that expand the overall diameter of the tracheal tube (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). On the one hand, actin polymerises in rings at the apical side of the tracheal cells in a <i>tal/pri</i>-dependent process; these actin rings are then required for the particular accumulation of the <i>kkv</i> chitin synthase and for the appearance of folds in the plasma membrane. In turn, <i>kkv</i> accumulation leads to a localised increased production and deposition of chitin along specific enriched stripes above the actin rings in a <i>Blimp-1</i>-mediated process. On the other hand, the cellular AJs are instrumental in ensuring that apical F-actin bundles from each cell follow a supracellular organ arrangement. It has to be noted that each cell appears to independently organise or maintain, to a certain degree, the proper orientation of their actin bundles, as determined by <i>Blimp-1</i> clonal analysis and the disruption of cell adhesion by downregulation of \u03b1-Cat and, consequently, DE-Cad. These results further suggest cell polarity along the circumferential axis of the tracheal tube. Nevertheless, this is not an absolute value as cells also have the capacity to modify the orientation of their sections of the taenidia to keep the continuity of these structures along the tube. In this regard, cell adhesion is central to ensure the continuity of the intracellular actin bundles as a patterning element for the overall tube. Subsequently, the chitin aECM feeds back on to the cellular architecture by stabilising F-actin bundling and cell shape via the modulation of Src42A phosphorylation levels. The combination of all these phenomena \"<i>explain just how it is that the cells of the tracheal epithelium can cooperate unconsciously so as to form a helicoid [chitinous] thickening continuous from one end of the trachea to another\"</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Thompson, 1929</a>)."

The authors characterize the construction and alignment of parallel actin filaments and chitin ECM structures (taenidia) constructed perpendicular to the tube axis. They describe the phenotypes of tal/pri (peptides with both extracellular and intracellular functions), blimp (TF) mutants by in situ stainings and TEM. The new intriguing observation is that in blimp mutants the cytoskeletal filaments are disrupted but some remaining mis-oriented chitin assemblies are formed suggesting that the structure and alignment of the chitin polymers contributes to the construction of cytoskeletal elements. As src42 activity has been shown to control cell shape changes during tracheal tube growth the authors investigated the effect of blimp and kkv inactivation on the levels of phospho-src in the tubes. They show that p-src levels vary in response to the level/structure of intraluminal chitin. The paper closes with a model proposing the interplay between chitin ECM and the cytoskeleton indicating that blimp regulates chitin filament formation and tal/pri the construction and alignment of junctions."

It is now clear that the src42; src64 double does not have an actin ring phenotype, and it is understandable that making a triple mutant for src42, src64 and btk is technically difficult and phospho-Btk reagents do not appear to be available. The new model in which feedback from the ECM to Src prevents Src over-activation that would disrupt actin ring formation is very elegant and does account for the known results, but an equally plausible possibility is that ECM-regulated changes in Src phosphorylation are \"off pathway\" and do not have biological significance. Consequently, it is unclear whether this manuscript has defined an important feedback loop between ECM and actin organization and thus whether the manuscript will have a substantial impact on the field."

The reviewers appreciate that it is quite possible, perhaps even likely, that ECM will have a more complex role in actin ring formation than keeping Src activity low, and thus that the proposed double mutants will still have abnormal actin rings, but it is essential for this paper to demonstrate an actual role for Src in actin ring formation. The proposed double mutant experiments are not presented as required experiments, but rather as possible experiments that could, using loss-of-function approaches, demonstrate a role for Src in actin ring formation. Alternative experiments would be acceptable, as long as they demonstrate a biologically meaningful role for Src in actin ring formation."

However, in the same work it has been shown that constitutive phosphorylation of Src42 produces an alteration of the same actin structure. Thus, while Src42 protein is not an absolute requirement for actin ring formation (see below), its phosphorylation needs to be below a given threshold to ensure that the actin rings form properly."

A possible explanation to account for this observation could be another protein having a redundant function; among those Src64 would be a likely candidate. In this regard and as suggested, we examined <i>Src42;Src64</i> mutant embryos but we did not observe any actin ring phenotype in these double mutants. This observation does not completely rule out the redundant hypothesis as other proteins, such as Btk also mentioned by the reviewers, could substitute for Src42 and/or Src64 functions on what regards actin ring organization. In this regard, we would like to mention that Btk is supposed to be downstream of both <i>Src42A</i> and <i>Src64B</i> and there are some data showing that Btk enhances the hypomorph phenotype of <i>Src42A</i> (Tateno et al. Science 200 and Roulier et al., Mol Cell 1998) while, on the other hand, Btk is also said to be activated in a Src-independent way by other kinds of kinases (Takahashi, et al., Development 2005; Matusek et al. Development 2006, Roulier et al. Mol Cell 1998, Lu et al., EMBO J. 2004 and Thomas and Wieschaus, Development 2004). Altogether, the analysis of a possible redundancy involving three or more elements becomes very complicated. On the other hand, we have not been able to identify in the literature an anti-p-Btk antibody which would have allowed us to assess changes in Btk phosphorylation upon changes in the ECM."

If the current model is correct that Src is not required for actin ring formation, but that Src activity must not be too high, then it should be the case that a Blimp-1;src42 or kkv;src42 double will have intact actin rings because there is no Src activity to disrupt them. The reviewers appreciate that it is quite possible, perhaps even likely, that ECM will have a more complex role in actin ring formation than keeping Src activity low, and thus that the proposed double mutants will still have abnormal actin rings, but it is essential for this paper to demonstrate an actual role for Src in actin ring formation. The proposed double mutant experiments are not presented as required experiments, but rather as possible experiments that could, using loss-of-function approaches, demonstrate a role for Src in actin ring formation. Alternative experiments would be acceptable, as long as they demonstrate a biologically meaningful role for Src in actin ring formation.</i>"
