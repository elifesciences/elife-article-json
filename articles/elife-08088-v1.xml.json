To investigate how Csk activity regulates T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, we utilized a mouse expressing mutated Csk (Csk<sup>AS</sup>) whose catalytic activity is specifically and rapidly inhibited by a small molecule. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> during TCR stimulation led to stronger and more prolonged TCR signaling and to increased proliferation. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> enhanced activation by weak but strictly cognate agonists. Titration of Csk inhibition revealed that a very small increase in SFK activity was sufficient to potentiate T cell responses to weak agonists. Csk plays an important role, not only in basal signaling, but also in setting the TCR signaling threshold and affinity recognition."
