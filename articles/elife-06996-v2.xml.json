Leaf and Von Zastrow tagged the dopamine receptor with a fluorescent protein that allowed its movement through a cell to be followed under a microscope. This revealed that the dopamine receptor slides into cilia from another part of the cell's membrane. To do so, the dopamine receptor binds to a pair of proteins known to help move receptors around the cell. A third protein called Rab23 then acts as a gatekeeper that allows the dopamine receptor to pass into the cilia. Reducing the amount of Rab23 in a cell prevented dopamine receptors from entering the cilia. Furthermore, Leaf and Von Zastrow found that other receptor proteins incorrectly moved into the cilia if they were bound to Rab23."

Future studies to further reveal how Rab23 directs receptors to cilia, and to determine which other ciliary proteins might use this transportation process, will lead to a better understanding of the normal structure and activity of primary cilia. This could lead to new strategies for treating the human diseases that involve defective cilia."

Physiological signaling from cilia critically depends on the selectivity of receptor targeting to the ciliary membrane, and disturbances in this targeting are thought to underlie a variety of pathological conditions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hsiao et al., 2012</a>). The remarkable specificity of ciliary membrane targeting is clear among G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Some members of this large receptor family robustly accumulate in the ciliary membrane while others, including closely related homologues, are found throughout the extra-ciliary plasma membrane but are effectively excluded from cilia (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schulz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Marley and von Zastrow, 2010</a>). Understanding how particular GPCRs localize to primary cilia with such exquisite selectivity is a fundamental problem with broad physiological significance (<a href=\"#bib13\">Emmer et al., 2010</a>)."

This can explain how GPCRs are retained in cilia once delivered, but not how they are delivered in the first place. Two basic routes of ciliary membrane delivery have been described: first, receptors can originate from an intracellular source, through fusion of post-Golgi transport vesicles with the ciliary membrane in or near the transition zone. A number of membrane proteins are targeted to cilia by this route, and molecular machineries supporting it have been identified (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deretic and Papermaster, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Geng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mazelova et al., 2009</a>). Second, receptors can originate from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane. This route, first described in a seminal study of flagellar agglutinins in <i>Chalmydomonas</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hunnicutt et al., 1990</a>), contributes to ciliary targeting of the atypical seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo; <a href=\"#bib36\">Milenkovic et al., 2009</a>) in mammalian cells. Is the lateral delivery route relevant to ciliary localization of conventional GPCRs?"

Here, we show that D1Rs are delivered to the cilium from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane. Further, we show that the D1R cytoplasmic tail is both necessary and sufficient to direct receptor targeting to the ciliary membrane, and this requires a distinct set of cellular proteins including the anterograde IFT-B complex and ciliary kinesin, KIF17. Moreover, we identify an essential role of the small GTP-binding protein, Rab23, in the ciliary targeting mechanism. Rab23 is not only necessary for D1R access to cilia, it is also sufficient to drive strong ciliary localization of a non-ciliary GPCR. D1Rs thus reveal a discrete route and mechanism of ciliary GPCR targeting in which Rab23 plays an unprecedented and essential role."

We verified appropriate ciliary localization of engineered receptors by anti-Flag Alexa555 surface labeling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, top row). Locally photoactivated D1Rs were distributed non-uniformly on cilia immediately after the 405-nm illumination pulse and then equilibrated throughout the cilium within seconds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>; whole-cell images shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, there was no visible spread of labeled receptors outside of the cilium on this time scale. Consistent with this, total PA-GFP fluorescence intensity integrated over the ciliary length remained unchanged throughout an 80-s interval after local photoactivation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

We sought to measure this delivery by taking advantage of the irreversible nature of PA-GFP photoactivation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2003</a>). Multiple 405-nm light pulses were delivered in rapid succession to photoactivate the majority of D1Rs present in the cilium. We then assessed the effect of administering a subsequent 405-nm pulse at a later time. We reasoned that, because D1Rs delivered from outside the cilium would not have been previously photoactivated, their arrival in the cilium would result in an increment in the ciliary PA-GFP signal elicited by a subsequent 405-nm pulse. This was indeed the case: when a subsequent 405-nm pulse was administered shortly (\u223c30 s) after the initial photoactivation series, little (\u223c15%) increase of ciliary PA-GFP fluorescence was observed, consistent with a small residual fraction of D1Rs escaping photoactivation in the initial pulse series (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, left bar). However, when the subsequent 405-nm pulse was administered 30 min after the initial series, the increment of ciliary PA-GFP fluorescence was markedly increased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, right bar). Additionally, the degree of the PA-GFP fluorescence increment increased with time (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and we verified that the PA-GFP fluorescence increment was negligible when measured in fixed cells (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These results directly verify active delivery of D1Rs to the ciliary membrane compartment and provide a rough estimate of the rate of this delivery, on the order of \u223c1% of the total ciliary D1R pool per min."

To distinguish these possibilities, we further elaborated the sequential photoactivation technique by taking advantage of dual labeling of surface D1Rs using anti-Flag conjugated to Alexa555, whose fluorescence was not affected by the 405-nm pulses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). If D1R delivery originates from an internal membrane pool, we expected (1) unchanged PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio over the 30-min incubation after initial photoactivation because receptors delivered during this interval would not contribute fluorescence in either channel and (2) increased PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio above the initial value after the subsequent photoactivation pulse because newly delivered receptors would contribute PA-GFP but not Alexa555 signal. On the other hand, if ciliary D1R delivery originates from a plasma membrane pool, we expected (1) decreased PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio during the 30-min incubation after initial photoactivation because newly delivered D1Rs would be labeled with Alexa555 but lack PA-GFP signal and (2) return to the initial value after the subsequent 405-nm pulse because newly delivered D1Rs would then contribute both Alexa555 and PA-GFP signal. We observed precisely the latter result: PA-GFP/Alexa555 decreased by approximately 50% during the 30-min incubation after initial photoactivation and returned to a value close to the initial ratio after the subsequent photoactivation pulse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>; example images from separate fluorescence channels shown in <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These observations indicate that D1Rs are delivered to the ciliary membrane compartment primarily from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane pool. Supporting the validity of this fluorescence ratio determination, bleaching of both fluorophores was negligible after sequential image acquisitions exceeding the number required for this experiment (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), and there was negligible bleed-through from the 488 channel into the 555 channel (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>)."

Previous studies of other cilia-localized receptors have identified targeting determinants located either in a cytoplasmic loop (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berbari et al., 2008a</a>) or the cytoplasmic tail (C-tail; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deretic et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Corbit et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Geng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jenkins et al., 2006</a>). Progressive truncation of the D1R C-tail (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) strongly reduced ciliary localization of receptors. Truncating the distal end had no effect (e.g., D1-415T; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), but removing a larger portion strongly reduced ciliary receptor localization (D1-382T; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). A 15-residue sequence within this region markedly reduced D1R ciliary localization when selectively deleted (D1\u2206381\u2013395; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; whole-cell images for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a> are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

However, fusion of a shorter fragment of the D1R C-tail was not sufficient to confer ciliary localization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013J</a>; whole-cell images for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a> shown in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), even though it contained the necessary 381\u2013395 sequence, and chimeras exhibited similar levels of overall surface expression (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Additionally, we found that fusion of a smaller region of the D1R C-tail that also contains residues 381\u2013395 (Flag-DOR-D1(379\u2013400)) was not sufficient to confer ciliary localization on DOR. 23 out of 23 cells expressing the chimeric receptor had no visible enrichment of receptor in the cilium (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Together, these results indicate that the structural information required for D1R ciliary targeting is contained in the receptor's C-tail and requires residues 381\u2013395 for full activity.

Duplexes were transfected individually into IMCD3 cells stably expressing the Flag-D1R, using a clone with particularly strong ciliary receptor accumulation, and ciliary D1R localization was scored visually. No effect was found for siRNAs targeting several proteins implicated in ciliary localization other GPCRs, including TULP3 and BBSome components important for ciliary localization of SSTR3, MCHR1, and Gpr161 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berbari et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2013</a>).

IFT-B knockdown was complicated by reduced ciliogenesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), but in the ciliated cells remaining in the transfected cell population, reduced D1R targeting was clearly evident. This was verified by both quantitative metrics of ciliary D1R localization, and this was specific to ciliary targeting because knockdown produced little or no effect on the overall surface expression of receptors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As IFT57 tolerates an N-terminal epitope tag while IFT172 does not (<a href=\"#bib14\">Follit et al., 2009</a>), we tested rescue of the IFT57 knockdown effect using an N-terminally HA-tagged IFT57 construct engineered with silent mutations in the sequence targeted by IFT57 siRNA (HA-IFT57-NTM).

To ask if IFT57 interaction with D1R is directly congruent with ciliary targeting activity, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis comparing HA-IFT57 pull-down with wild-type Flag-D1R and FlagD1\u0394381-395. Deletion of resides 381\u2013395 of the D1R C-tail, a mutation that profoundly impairs ciliary targeting, did not reduce IFT57 co-IP. To the contrary, the co-IP signal was significantly enhanced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). This suggests that the D1R C-tail, while both necessary and sufficient for ciliary receptor targeting, likely functions in a more complex manner than can be explained by a single interaction surface with IFT-B."

KIF3A is required for delivery of axonemal components and overall ciliogenesis, while KIF17 is not essential for ciliogenesis and is proposed to have more specialized cargo transport functions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jenkins et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>). We verified the presence of KIF17-IFT57 complexes in IMCD3 cells, as reported previously by others (<a href=\"#bib26\">Insinna et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Howard et al., 2013</a>), by co-immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Thus, we hypothesized that KIF17 may function as a specific motor supporting D1R delivery to cilia. To test this, we introduced a point mutation in the KIF17 motor domain at a conserved residue in the switch II region (KIF17-G234A) that is essential for kinesin motor activity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rice et al., 1999</a>). D1Rs were visible on cilia in essentially all cells expressing the motor-defective HA-KIF17-G234A, but the degree of ciliary receptor enrichment was greatly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, expression of wild-type KIF17 did not visibly affect D1R ciliary localization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; whole-cell images verifying HA-KIF17-G234A and HA-KIF17 expression shown in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Verifying this, KIF17-G234A, but not KIF17, selectively reduced the fold-enrichment metric while having little effect on the fraction of receptor-positive cilia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). As an independent assessment of the role of KIF17 on D1R ciliary localization, we examined the effect of expressing a different dominant negative KIF17 construct (HA-KIF17-DN) containing only the cargo-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jenkins et al., 2006</a>). Expression of HA-KIF17-DN also significantly reduced D1R ciliary enrichment (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Further, this effect was specific to D1Rs because KIF17-G234A did not reduce ciliary enrichment of SSTR3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>; whole-cell images verifying HA-KIF17-G234A expression in <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Expression of HA-KIF17-G234A did not significantly affect overall surface expression of either D1R or SSTR3 (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

This effect was dependent on the nucleotide state of Rab23 because a GTP binding-defective mutant allele (D1\u0394381-395-Rab23-S23N) failed to produce detectable ciliary receptor localization, while fusion of an activated Rab23 allele (D1\u0394381-395-Rab23-Q68L) drove ciliary localization even more robustly than the D1R C-tail itself (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>; overall surface expression is shown in <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Remarkably, activated Rab23 drove robust ciliary localization of DOR (DOR-Rab23-Q68L, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013I</a>; whole-cell images are shown in <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). While fusion of Rab23-Q68L to the mutant D1R increased overall receptor surface expression (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the opposite was observed for fusion to DOR (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This indicates that the ciliary targeting activity of Rab23 is separable from its effects on overall surface receptor expression. Moreover, this ciliary targeting activity was specific for Rab23 because fusion of an activated allele of the closely related Rab paralogue, Rab11 (DOR-Rab11-Q70L), or of Rab8 (DOR-Rab8-Q67L) that is known to localize to cilia, failed to drive detectable ciliary targeting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). The ability of activated Rab23 to confer ciliary localization on a non-ciliary GPCR was not limited to DOR. Fusion of activated Rab23 to the C-tails of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and beta-2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR), which are normally excluded from cilia, conferred robust ciliary localization on both receptors (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Together, these results support the hypothesis that Rab23 plays a key role in determining the specificity of ciliary receptor targeting."

As noted above, disrupting KIF17 motor activity strongly reduced ciliary enrichment of the wild-type D1R. In contrast, ciliary enrichment driven by direct fusion of the activated Rab23 to the D1R (D1\u0394381-395-Rab23-Q68L) was unaffected by this manipulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>; whole-cell images verifying HA-KIF17-G234A expression are shown in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, full ciliary enrichment of D1\u0394381-395-Rab23-Q68L remained in the presence of IFT172 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), suggesting that fusion to activated Rab23 can also override the IFT-B requirement. We also noted that Rab23 knockdown did not prevent or reduce D1R association with IFT-B, as estimated by co-immunoprecipitation of IFT57 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). To the contrary, Rab23 knockdown tended to increase the IFT57-D1R co-IP signal (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). In contrast to its clear effect on the ciliary concentration of D1Rs, disrupting KIF17 motor activity did not prevent Rab23 localization to cilia (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these results suggest that IFT-B/KIF17 and Rab23 are all required for efficient targeting of D1Rs to cilia and may indeed function in an integrated pathway."

In contrast, we found that D1Rs are delivered to cilia from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane. We also found that ciliary D1R delivery is directed by the receptor C-tail. However, we were unable to find any sequence in the D1R C-tail conforming to a previously defined ciliary targeting motif (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deretic et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Geng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jenkins et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Berbari et al., 2008a</a>). Also, our mutational studies suggest that the structural determinant required for ciliary D1R targeting is a relatively extended structure. We identified a distinct set of trans-acting proteins important for ciliary targeting of D1Rs. We were unable to detect a requirement for TULP3 or BBSome components, although these are essential for ciliary localization of SSTR3 and MCHR1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berbari et al., 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</a>).

Thus, D1Rs add to a growing appreciation that there exist receptor-specific differences in mechanisms of ciliary membrane targeting."

Several IFT-B components (IFT20, IFT57, and IFT140) have been implicated in rhodopsin delivery to the rod outer segment (<a href=\"#bib31\">Krock and Perkins, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Keady et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Crouse et al., 2014</a>), and IFT172 was recently implicated in Smo localization to primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kuzhandaivel et al., 2014</a>). The present finding that IFT57 and IFT172 are required for ciliary D1R targeting provides further evidence that IFT-B contributes to ciliary delivery of select membrane cargoes."

KIF17 is necessary for ciliary localization of an olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jenkins et al., 2006</a>), but to our knowledge, KIF17 has not been shown previously to function in localizing a GPCR to cilia. Our results identify a specific role of KIF17, and of KIF17 motor activity, in promoting ciliary concentration of the D1R but not the SSTR3. Further supporting the proposed role of KIF17 as an anterograde transport motor for D1Rs, we found that D1Rs specifically co-IP IFT57 from intact cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and verified IFT57 association with KIF17 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Insinna et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Howard et al., 2013</a>). An interesting related observation is that deletion of residues 381\u2013395 in the D1R tail, a manipulation that inhibits D1R ciliary targeting, did not disrupt the D1R-IFT57 interaction, but rather, increased it. This supports the idea that ciliary targeting of D1Rs is likely a complex process."

To our knowledge, this represents the first evidence that Rab23 is required for ciliary localization of any signaling receptor or membrane cargo. Previous studies of other cilia-localized membrane proteins, such as polycystin-2 and Smo, have not observed such a requirement (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eggenschwiler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boehlke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hoffmeister et al., 2011</a>). Thus, we think it likely that Rab23's function in ciliary membrane targeting is specific to a subset of cilia-localized cargoes. We note that ciliary localization of SSTR3 is also sensitive to Rab23 knockdown, even though, in contrast to D1R, its ciliary targeting is insensitive to manipulation of KIF17 motor activity. This provides further support for the existence of receptor-specific differences in the ciliary targeting mechanism."

Our results support the hypothesis that these components function together in an integrated ciliary delivery pathway and suggest that they have distinguishable functional effects in the delivery pathway. First, disrupting KIF17 motor activity strongly reduced ciliary D1R enrichment without affecting the fraction of receptor-positive cilia. This is potentially consistent with KIF17 motor activity promoting cililary D1R concentration, but not being essential for ciliary D1R access. Second, direct fusion of activated Rab23 to the D1R C-tail can promote ciliary targeting in a manner that is apparently insensitive to KIF17 motor activity. Third, Rab23 knockdown did not disrupt the D1R/IFT-B interaction as estimated by co-immunoprecipitation. These results also support the idea that the lateral delivery mechanism is complex, but additional studies are required to further delineate the precise functions of each of these identified components."

First, given that receptor accumulation in the ciliary membrane is dependent on Rab23 nucleotide state, an important next question is how this nucleotide state is controlled. A second question, which may be related to the first, is how selective cargo engagement with the ciliary delivery mechanism is determined. The present data strongly suggest a functional interaction between Rab23 and the D1R ciliary targeting determinant, but we have been unable, so far, to establish direct physical interaction between the D1R and Rab23. It is conceivable that IFT-B links D1Rs and Rab23, or that unidentified additional protein(s) explain the functional interaction observed. A third question is to ascertain precisely how Rab23 directs receptor delivery to the ciliary membrane. Based on precedent of other Rab protein functions, we speculate that there is a specific effector of Rab23 that operates at or near the ciliary diffusion barrier. A fourth question is what broader physiological significance the discrete, Rab23-dependent ciliary targeting mechanism has. We note that a mutation in Rab23 produces excessive Hedgehog signaling in vivo (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eggenschwiler et al., 2001</a>). One possibility is that this reflects a disruption of ciliary signaling normally mediated by a Rab23-dependent receptor. Thus, further investigation of the receptor-specific ciliary targeting mechanism identified here may provide fundamental insight into the role of primary cilia as physiological signaling devices and toward understanding pathologies associated with ciliary defects."

A single photoactivation pulse was delivered with continuous confocal imaging at 0.5 Hz to monitor changes in the distribution of photoactivated Flag-D1-PAGFP in the cilium over time. To estimate new receptor delivery to the cilium, three 405-nm pulses were delivered over 10 s, determined empirically to photoactivate the majority of Flag-D1-PAGFP present in the cilium. We then acquired a subsequent GFP image, delivered another (single) 405-nm pulse, and acquired the GFP image again. This sequential \u2018image-photoactivate-image\u2019 sequence was applied either immediately (approximately 30 s) after the initial 405-nm pulse series or 30 min after. New delivery was estimated by the increment of integrated PA-GFP fluorescence intensity measured after the subsequent 405-nm pulse minus before, normalized to the integrated fluorescence intensity measured after. The anti-Flag Alex555 channel (unaffected by 405-nm pulses) was used to optimize focus on the cilium and to verify that the specimen did not move significantly between the \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 images. To assess the source of Flag-D1-PAGFP delivery to the cilium, we used a similar strategy as described above but quantified in the photoactivation series both PA-GFP and Alexa555 channels and determined their ratio. New receptor delivery from internal relative to plasma membrane sources was distinguished by changes in the PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio, based on selective labeling with Alexa555 of only the plasma membrane pool, as discussed in text."

Although protein trafficking to the cilium is well studied, this study indicates that new insights remain to be uncovered. The authors report that D1R has a unique cytoplasmic C-terminal sequence that appears to be required for targeting D1R; the C-terminal can induce ciliary targeting of the non-ciliary delta opiod peptide receptor (DOR). Using a small siRNA screen and dominant negative constructs, the authors report that D1R targeting also requires IFT-B, KIF17 and Rab23, and they show some data they interpret as a hierarchical regulation of these additional components. Overall, this is an interesting and well documented study that may be of broad interest. However, there are a number of criticisms that need addressing."
