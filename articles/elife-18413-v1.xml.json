The order of assembly and disassembly of these two structures remains unknown. Time course analysis of granule assembly suggests that core formation is an early event in granule assembly. Stress granule disassembly is also a stepwise process with shell dissipation followed by core clearance. Perturbations that alter liquid-liquid phase separations (LLPS) driven by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDR) of RNA binding proteins in vitro have the opposite effect on stress granule assembly in vivo. Taken together, these observations argue that stress granules assemble through a multistep process initiated by stable assembly of untranslated mRNPs into core structures, which could provide sufficient high local concentrations to allow for a localized LLPS driven by IDRs on RNA binding proteins."

The order of assembly and disassembly of these two structures remains unknown. Time course analysis of granule assembly suggests that core formation is an early event in granule assembly. Stress granule disassembly is also a stepwise process with shell dissipation followed by core clearance. Perturbations that alter liquid-liquid phase separations (LLPS) driven by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDR) of RNA binding proteins in vitro have the opposite effect on stress granule assembly in vivo. Taken together, these observations argue that stress granules assemble through a multistep process initiated by stable assembly of untranslated mRNPs into core structures, which could provide sufficient high local concentrations to allow for a localized LLPS driven by IDRs on RNA binding proteins."

Since IDR-containing proteins are enriched in stress granules and other mRNP granules (<a href=\"#bib8\">Decker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gilks et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jain et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">King et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Reijns et al., 2008</a>), this has led to the suggestion that IDRs on mRNA binding proteins form hetero- and homotypic interactions that drive initial formation of stress granules and P-bodies (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gilks et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Decker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Patel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>).

In contrast, small aliphatic molecules, such as 1,6-Hexanediol, are hypothesized to perturb weak hydrophobic interactions, and thus disassemble assemblies that exhibit liquid-like properties\u00a0in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Patel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2002</a>). These in vitro observations suggest that manipulation of these properties might be useful for discerning the molecular interactions and mechanisms that drive assembly and regulate stress granules in vivo. Indeed, since mammalian stress granules have been reported to disassemble when cells are treated with 1,6-Hexanediol, they have been inferred to be LLPSs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kroschwald et al., 2015</a>)."

Interestingly, formation of in vitro liquid droplets by IDRs have been observed to mature into a second, less dynamic phase comprised in part of stable amyloid-like assemblies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Murakami et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Patel et al., 2015</a>). A parsimonious model therefore is that stress granules may initially assemble to first form a LLPS comprised of multivalent, weak and dynamic interactions, and over time a less dynamic, more viscous second phase matures from the continued supersaturation of IDRs, thereby generating stress granule cores (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jain et al., 2016</a>). Here, we set out to test several predictions of this model: (i) that lower temperature should enhance granule assembly, as LLPS driven by IDRs on RNA binding proteins have been shown to be enhanced at lower temperatures (<a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nott et al., 2015</a>); (ii) that stress granules are sensitive to drugs, such as 1,6-Hexanediol, that are predicted to disrupt weak hydrophobic interactions; (iii) that stress granule dynamics decrease and core size should increase over time as stress granule structure matures."

Moreover, we observe that 1,6-Hexanediol triggers stress granule formation in both yeast and mammalian cells, as well as altering many cellular structures including the cytoskeleton and the nuclear pore complex. Finally, we observe stress granule dynamics and core size is unchanged during prolonged stress. Given these observations we suggest an alternative model where untranslating mRNPs initially oligomerize into stable cores, thereby nucleating an initial shell layer and providing a platform for the growth of a more dynamic shell around these cores, followed by merger of these individual core/shell assemblies into large mature stress granules. Stress granule disassembly is also a stepwise process where shell dissipation occurs first followed by clearance of cores."

This experiment is analogous to experiments done in vitro where the recovery rates of LLPS driven by IDRs of RNA binding components decrease over time revealing a maturation process within these reconstituted assemblies (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Murakami et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Patel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Thus, we examined if the dynamics of normal stress granules change over time, which might reveal an analogous maturation process in cells. We observed that the recovery rates of GFP-G3BP1 were essentially identical after 30 min, 60 min, or 120 min of exposure to NaAsO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), although the half-time of recovery was slightly faster at 30 min (18.5 s) as compared to 60 min (35 s) and 120 min (31 s). This slightly faster recovery rate is likely to simply reflect that at 30 min stress granules are still undergoing growth, which will increase the apparent rate of recovery. We interpret this observation to argue there is not a global transition of stress granule components to a more stable state within the time periods assessed. However, we cannot rule out that specific components of stress granules become less dynamic over time."

To distinguish between these early events, we first tested whether stress granule assembly is enhanced at lower temperatures. The logic of this experiment is based on multiple experiments in vitro showing that IDRs from RNA binding proteins can form either LLPS (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Murakami et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nott et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>) or hydrogels, which in this context are a meshwork assembly of protein filaments (<a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). In these experiments, the LLPS or hydrogel formation is enhanced at lower temperatures, which would be expected to lower the critical concentration required for assembly (<a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Murakami et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nott et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2012</a>).

To test this possibility, we examined stress granule formation at different temperatures in GFP-G3BP1 U-2 OS cells, in response to NaAsO<sub>2</sub> treatment."

If the interactions holding stress granules together are dependent on higher temperatures, then stress granules formed at higher temperatures should disassemble at lower temperatures. Conversely, if stress granules are assemblies that have a temperature dependent step in their assembly, then once formed they should persist after a drop in the temperature. To test these possibilities, we induced stress granule formation at 37\u00b0C for 45 min then imaged the cells at a lower temperature (30\u00b0C) for 15 min (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). We observed that once formed, stress granules persist at a lower temperature and do not appreciably decrease in size. It should be noted that shifting cells to 30\u00b0C (without NaAsO<sub>2</sub>) does not induce stress granule formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This is inconsistent with stress granules being held together by interactions that are enhanced at higher temperatures, and instead argues stress granules have a step in their assembly that is inhibited at low temperatures, but once formed stress granules are stable at both high and low temperatures. This suggests that the primary driving forces of stress granule assembly are not weak interactions between IDR domains that are enhanced at low temperatures."

As the nuclear pore is proposed to be a LLPS (<a href=\"#bib38\">Patel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Updike et al., 2011</a>), a prediction is that 1,6-Hexanediol should disrupt this structure in vivo. Consistent with this prediction, the addition of 10% 1,6-Hexanediol to yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kroschwald et al., 2015</a>), rapidly disrupted the nuclear pore, as adjudged by the loss of punctate, peri-nuclear localization of the nuclear pore protein, Nsp1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, we noticed that the effect of 1,6-Hexanediol was not limited to cellular structures that are known to represent a LLPS. We observed that 1,6-Hexanediol (but not 1, 4, 6-Hexanetriol) caused a significant disruption of actin and tubulin organization, as adjudged by the localization of Sac6-GFP (an actin binding protein) and Tub1-GFP (Alpha-Tubulin) respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and data not shown). This disruption of cytoskeleton organization occurred within two minutes of 1,6-Hexanediol treatment. Interestingly, Sac6 changed localization twice \u2013 once rapidly to go from punctate to diffuse; and later from diffuse to into rod-like structures in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Membrane bound cellular structures such as the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER, observed using Get1-GFP) and mitochondria (observed using Atp1-GFP) were not affected by 1,6-Hexanediol. These observations suggest that 1,6-Hexanediol will disrupt a variety of cellular structures."

In the first model, stress granules form by a loose condensation of IDR containing proteins to form an initial phase-separated, dynamic structure and over time stable cores mature within this dynamic structure. This model is suggested by recent findings in vitro, demonstrating LLPS can be driven by IDRs and these LLPS subsequently mature to form a second, less dynamic phase (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Murakami et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Patel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>).

First, as soon as stress granules are observed in cells, they are stable in lysates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Second, the size distribution of the stable components of stress granules in lysates is similar from 15 to 120 min of stress, arguing that stress granule core formation is not a late step in stress granule assembly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Third, as soon as technically possible to assess, the FRAP behavior, as observed by the GFP-G3BP1 mobile fraction, of stress granules remains unchanged from 30 min to 120 min of stress (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This also argues that stress granules are not undergoing a dramatic change in biochemical state, and is inconsistent with models where stress granules initially consist of a uniform and dynamic LLPS, that then matures into a mature biphasic stress granule. Finally, when examined using super resolution microscopy, we observe granules exhibit a heterogeneous distribution of protein even at early time points (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Taken together, these observations are consistent with granules assembling from the oligomerization of individual mRNPs into stable core complexes. The oligomerization of individual mRNPs into core structures would be analogous to a liquid-liquid phase separation driven by multivalent interactions, but because the core structures are stable to dilution, could be considered a liquid-solid demixing phase separation.\u00a0It should be noted we cannot rule out the formal caveat that stress granules initially condense into a weak dynamic assembly, that immediately transitions to a stable assembly, or that stress granule shells and cores form independently as two immiscible liquid phases which later fuse as has been suggested to explain the assembly of nucleolus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Feric et al., 2016</a>). We hypothesize that these stable core assemblies could provide a structural platform, due to the high concentration of IDRs on stress granule components to then rapidly phase-separate a dynamic shell that grows as a result of fusion with other small granules and surface exchange with an increasing pool of untranslating mRNPs."

The issue is that IDRs are thought to interact with each other to drive LLPS often by weak dynamic interactions, proposed to involve Arg-Aromatic interactions in some cases (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nott et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pak et al., 2016</a>). Since these interactions are limited to few amino acids, one anticipates that any given interaction would be expected to have low specificity, and as such would be expected to interact with many proteins when dispersed in the cytosol. Thus, for such weak and promiscuous interactions to drive <i>a priori</i> the assembly of a stress granule would be difficult since the interactions between stress granule components would always be in competition with other cytosolic factors. When the initial step in stress granule assembly is formation of a stable core, which by definition involves relatively stable interactions, the core structure could then provide a high local concentration of IDRs on stress granule components, which could then be envisioned to trigger a local phase separation, possibly what we refer to as the shell phase of a stress granule. This general principle is also seen in the formation of the nuclear pore, wherein the creation of a high local concentration of FG repeat proteins by the structure of the nuclear pore, allows for a phase transition within the nuclear pore itself, even if the interactions between the FG repeats are relatively weak and non-specific (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frey and G\u00f6rlich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">H\u00fclsmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Schmidt and G\u00f6rlich, 2016</a>)."

Second, although 1,6-Hexanediol can prevent LLPS by IDRs from RNA binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Molliex et al, 2015</a>), we observed that 1,6-Hexanediol effectively induces stress granules in both yeast and mammals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9,</a> and <a href=\"#fig10\">10</a>). These observations suggest that the process of stress granule assembly in cells is not primarily driven by weak, dynamic homo- and heterotypic interactions between IDRs on RNA binding proteins analogous to the LLPS driven by these protein domains in vitro. However, we hypothesize that weak, dynamic interactions between IDRs could be important in forming the shell structure of stress granules, once the core is nucleated by more stable interactions."

We do not understand the basis for the difference between our results and those published earlier, although it could be due to differences in cell handling, growth conditions, or analysis. In any case, the sensitivity of a cellular structure to 1,6-Hexanediol does not appear sufficient to conclude the structure forms by LLPS. We suggest this cautionary note for three reasons. First, we observed that some, but not all, cellular structures were sensitive to 1,6-Hexanediol, including well described cytoskeleton elements (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Second, one should anticipate that, depending on the chemical nature of interactions driving assembly, many different types of assemblies could be sensitive to 1, 6-Hexanediol. Finally, one should also expect LLPS assemblies can form by many types of promiscuous or specific interactions, some of which would be expected to be resistant to 1,6-Hexanediol."

In those experiments, treatment of cells with nocadazole, which depolymerizes microtubules, prevents the fusion of the small initial stress granules into larger assemblies. Based on these results, a reasonable model is that cores are brought together to form larger assemblies by movement on microtubules. Disassembly may involve a reverse process where the microtubule network may facilitate retrograde transport of mRNPs away from a disassembling stress granule."

This observation has several corollaries. First, upon re-establishment of translation, mRNA is thought to be in rapid equilibrium between the cytosol and stress granules. This exchange appears to influence stress granule structural integrity and may account for titration of select RNAs into translation. The lag in the clearance of granule cores may reflect the requirement of a myriad of ATP-dependent remodeling complexes (e.g. heat shock 70 or p97/VCP AAA-ATPase complexes [<a href=\"#bib4\">Buchan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Walters et al., 2015</a>]) and could serve as a cytoprotective mechanism to acutely re-nucleate stress granules if the cell re-encounters stress."

First, a shell in mammalian cells provides a scaffold for dynamic exchange of select RNAs out of the translational pool. This could represent a thermostatic mechanism where select RNAs (possibly important housekeeping genes) could be still translated under stress without overtly outcompeting the translation of stress-specific messages essential for survival under stress. These shell-specific RNAs would be expected to be primed for reentry into translation during recovery and may also represent a metastable structural scaffold that fractures during stress granule disassembly. Meanwhile, further compartmentalization into less dynamic cores could provide an additional layer of sequestration of select messages. This could possibly serve as a biochemical sorting mechanism where 'fit' mRNPs could be remodeled under stress by concentrating similar RNPs, while 'unfit' mRNPs could be sorted for decay or not remodeled to reenter the translational pool."

Previous work by these authors had revealed that stress granules have a structure defined by a more stable \"core\", surrounded by a more dynamic \"shell\". Here the authors utilize light microscopy approaches, combined with chemical and physical (i.e. temperature) perturbations, to test two different models: 1) the core is formed first followed by a shell, or 2) the whole structure assembles and then a more mature core nulceates within. The authors conclude that the first model is correct. The conclusion of initial core assembly followed by dynamic shell formation is based on some findings indicating stable cores are present in stress granule from the early stage of assembly, and that the assembly of a liquid-like shell is not required for stress granule assembly. Overall, this study has some interesting observations but the conclusions are not strongly supported. In particular:"

Some stress granule proteins are able to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, raising the possibility that LLPS may play a role in stress granule assembly. This model has gained some support recently since it has been demonstrated that liquid droplets can mature into more stable structures over time. How LLPS initially provides the specificity needed to recruit stress granule components and exclude other cytoplasmic proteins, however, is not known. An alternative model is that stress granule assembly is initiated by the formation of stable complexes through conventional protein/protein interactions. These cores create localized foci of high concentration of RNA-binding proteins, which in turn template local phase separation to create the more dynamic shell. In the present study, the authors present evidence in support of core-first/shell-later model using a time course analysis of stress granule assembly. They demonstrate that stable cores appear in cell lysates within minutes of stress induction and that stress granules have a non-homogeneous appearance immediately upon assembly. The authors also show that exposure to low temperature, which should enhance LLPS, interferes with stress granule formation. Furthermore, they show that treatment with hexanediol, which has been used to dissolve weak assemblies in cells, affects too many cellular structures to be diagnostic and in fact induces stress granules."

This seems to be an over-interpretation of the images shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, given their low resolution.

However, we point out that two perturbations expected to either decrease LLPS (1,6-Hexanediol treatment) or increase LLPS (lower temperatures), provide evidence that a 1,6-Hexanediol sensitive, low temperature induced LLPS is not a pre-requisite for stress granule formation. Specifically, the treatment thought to decrease LLPS (1,6-Hexanediol) actually triggers robust stress granule formation in yeast and mammals, and the treatment thought to increase LLPS (lower temperatures) actually inhibits stress granule formation. We agree with the reviewer that we cannot rule out that cores and shells form essentially at the same time, and we have re-written the text to reflect this possibility."

First, as previously shown, 1,6-Hexanediol induces the formation of assemblies that contain known stress granule proteins in both yeast and mammalian cells (HeLa and U-2 OS cells). Second, we now show 1,6-Hexanediol induced assemblies are sensitive to cycloheximide treatment, a drug known to block stress granule assembly, in both yeast and mammalian cells. Third, we now show 1,6-Hexanediol-induced assemblies from both yeast and mammals are stable in lysates suggesting that the material properties of these assemblies contain a relatively stable set of interactions similar to normal stress granules. Fourth, we show that eiF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is induced to a similar extent by 1,6-Hexanediol compared to arsenite, consistent with 1,6-Hexanediol inducing stress granules by inhibiting translation initiation. Finally, as requested, we provide FRAP of 1,6-Hexanediol-induced granules in mammalian cells which indicates that 1,6-Hexanediol induced stress granules behave similar to normal stress granules. These observations lead us to conclude that 1,6-Hexanediol induces stress granules in yeast and mammalian cells."

As the reviewer points out, our data reveals GFP-positive foci in lysates at time zero. This is because we always observe a few cells in even unstressed cultures that have stress granules. The key point of this experiment is that as stress granules are induced in cells, we observe an increasing amount of stress granule cores stable in lysates, even at early times. Thus, we feel confident in concluding that, at least as soon as we can detect stress granules in cells, stress granule cores are stable in lysates."

To directly test whether core size increases during the \u2018growth\u2019 phase, we have examined the size using nanoparticle tracking analysis of stress granule cores at 15 minutes of arsenite stress. We observe a similar size distribution even at 15 minutes of arsenite stress, as compared to 30\u2019, suggesting that granule cores even at early time points do not appreciably increase in size as compared to the later time points assayed. Together, we believe this result strengthens our conclusion that stress granule cores may represent an early stable compartment that serves as a platform for the accretion of substrate into the larger shell."

Together, we believe this strengthens our claim that stress granule formation is delayed at lower temperatures despite being in conditions, sufficient substrate and lower temperatures, predicted to enhance phase separation (i.e. granule formation)."
