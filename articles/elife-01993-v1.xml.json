Helicase activation converts this species to two active single hexamers that encircle single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The molecular details of MCM DNA interactions during these events are unknown. We determined the crystal structure of the <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> MCM N-terminal domain hexamer bound to ssDNA and define a conserved MCM-ssDNA binding motif (MSSB). Intriguingly, ssDNA binds the MCM ring interior perpendicular to the central channel with defined polarity. In eukaryotes, the MSSB is conserved in several Mcm2-7 subunits, and MSSB mutant combinations in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Mcm2-7 are not viable. Mutant Mcm2-7 complexes assemble and are recruited to replication origins, but are defective in helicase loading and activation. Our findings identify an important MCM-ssDNA interaction and suggest it functions during helicase activation to select the strand for translocation."

Helicase activation converts this species to two active single hexamers that encircle single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The molecular details of MCM DNA interactions during these events are unknown. We determined the crystal structure of the <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> MCM N-terminal domain hexamer bound to ssDNA and define a conserved MCM-ssDNA binding motif (MSSB). Intriguingly, ssDNA binds the MCM ring interior perpendicular to the central channel with defined polarity. In eukaryotes, the MSSB is conserved in several Mcm2-7 subunits, and MSSB mutant combinations in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Mcm2-7 are not viable. Mutant Mcm2-7 complexes assemble and are recruited to replication origins, but are defective in helicase loading and activation. Our findings identify an important MCM-ssDNA interaction and suggest it functions during helicase activation to select the strand for translocation."

Moreover, \u2018A\u2019 always paired with \u2018T\u2019, and \u2018C\u2019 always paired with \u2018G\u2019. Therefore, if the two strands were separated, each could be used as a template to guide the synthesis of a new complementary strand and thus create two copies of the original double-stranded molecule. One of the first steps in this replication process involves a ring-shaped complex of six proteins, called an MCM helicase, separating the two strands."

In eukaryotic cells, six related Mcm proteins (Mcm2-7) form a ring-shaped heterohexamer, the Mcm2-7 complex. Hexameric MCM rings act as the replicative DNA helicase (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ilves et al., 2010</a>), encircling the leading strand DNA template at the replication fork (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fu et al., 2011</a>). Replication forks are established in a cell-cycle-regulated manner at specific regions of DNA called replication origins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bell and Dutta, 2002</a>). Mcm2-7 complexes are loaded onto double-stranded DNA at each replication origin by the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Remus and Diffley, 2009</a>). Because replication origins are located far from the DNA ends, loading of Mcm2-7 hexamers such that they encircle double-stranded DNA requires opening of the Mcm2-7 ring. A \u2018gate\u2019 between the Mcm2 and Mcm5 subunits has been identified and is the likely site of ring opening and closing (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Costa et al., 2011</a>). After helicase loading, the two Mcm2-7 complexes encircle double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as a head-to-head double hexamer (<a href=\"#bib23\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Remus et al., 2009</a>) that is inactive as a helicase."

These proteins together stimulate the Mcm2-7 ATPase and helicase (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ilves et al., 2010</a>) and with Mcm2-7 form the active replicative DNA helicase, the CMG complex (Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moyer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ilves et al., 2010</a>). The initially loaded double-hexamer has the capacity to passively slide over dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Remus et al., 2009</a>), suggesting MCM DNA interactions are not fixed at this stage. Upon activation, the two Mcm2-7 helicases translocate independently (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yardimci et al., 2010</a>) in a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 direction on the single-stranded leading strand DNA template (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fu et al., 2011</a>). This transformation necessitates two structural changes in the initially loaded double-hexamer that are poorly understood: (i) the double-hexamer interface must be broken to allow independent replisome movement; (ii) the dsDNA at the origin must be melted and the lagging strand DNA template excluded from the central channel of each MCM hexamer. How Mcm2-7 retains one strand in its central channel while excluding the other during this transition is unknown."

Although no atomic structure has been determined for the complete archaeal or eukaryotic Mcm hexamer, hypothetical atomic models for full-length archaeal MCM hexamers have been generated by superimposition of six copies of a monomeric crystal structure of nearly full-length MCM onto the hexameric structure of <i>Mt</i>MCM<sub>N</sub> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brewster et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bae et al., 2009</a>)."

Atomic structures of MCM bound to DNA have not been reported. Given the different forms of DNA that are bound to the MCM complex during the steps of the initiation pathway, the MCM proteins must transition between different DNA interactions during this process. To investigate the interactions after origin melting and how the MCM hexamer selectively encircles the leading strand template, we determined the crystal structure of the MCM<sub>N</sub> hexamer of <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> bound to ssDNA. We present an analysis of this the structure and biochemical and genetic characterizations of archaeal and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> proteins with mutations in the identified ssDNA binding region. These findings reveal two residues on the surface of the MCM OB-fold that are critical for MCM DNA-binding and contribute to multiple Mcm2-7 functions during replication initiation. Our findings support a model in which the identified MCM-ssDNA interactions contribute to the selection of the leading strand DNA template during helicase activation."

The ssDNA circles the interior of the <i>Pf</i>MCM<sub>N</sub> ring in a plane perpendicular to the central channel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is in contrast to the ssDNA passing through the central channel, as observed in the structures of the nucleic acid complexes of the motor domains of the hexameric helicases E1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</a>), Rho (<a href=\"#bib57\">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</a>), and DnaB (<a href=\"#bib29\">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</a>). This distinction suggests that the newly identified MCM-ssDNA interactions might serve a function distinct from motor-driven helicase and translocase activities. The ssDNA binds to the MCM<sub>N</sub> OB-fold subdomain C at a region consistent with that of the prototype OB-fold protein SSB, but the ssDNA is oriented approximately perpendicular to that seen in SSB-ssDNA structures (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">Raghunathan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chan et al., 2009</a>). The ssDNA does not progress towards a specific end of the channel; therefore, the ssDNA does not have an assignable entry or exit direction from the ring. Instead, the ssDNA has a defined polarity relative to the MCM ring. When viewed from the C-terminal side of the complex (as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction of the bound ssDNA proceeds clockwise around the channel. This polarity is observed for both ssDNAs in each hexamer of the asymmetric unit."

In each hexamer, the bound nucleotides are not continuous but are separated into two stretches. Overall, two 7-mer stretches are observed in hexamer 1, and 11-mer and 4-mer stretches are observed in hexamer 2. The subunits that interact with DNA use a consistent binding mode with four nucleotides per subunit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The fourth nucleotide from the 5\u2032-end of this binding mode is visible in the cases where it spans binding at adjacent subunits, but it is often disordered at the 3\u2032-end of a ssDNA stretch. The four nucleotide per subunit binding increment contrasts with the motor domains of other hexameric helicases that bind either one (E1, <a href=\"#bib20\">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</a>; Rho, <a href=\"#bib57\">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</a>) or two (DnaB, <a href=\"#bib29\">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</a>) nucleotides per subunit and indicates that 24 nucleotides can bind if all the subunits simultaneously engage the ssDNA. The absence of ssDNA binding at some subunits is not due to insufficient DNA length because a 30-mer oligonucleotide was used for crystallization. The discontinuous DNA could result from the hexamer binding two separate 30-mer strands simultaneously or from the hexamer tightly binding one 30-mer ssDNA strand at two regions with the intervening nucleotides binding either weakly or not at all. We consider the latter to be more likely because binding of two parts of the same strand is anticipated to be cooperative."

These residues interact with oxygen atoms of the sugars and bases of the ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and are highly conserved in other MCM proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

In contrast to our original studies, helicase loading in these assays was performed using purified proteins. In addition to measuring new DNA synthesis, we monitored association of Mcm2-7, the helicase activation proteins Cdc45 and GINS and the ssDNA binding protein, RPA, with the origin DNA during the reaction. The analysis of protein associations provided insights into the step during replication initiation during which the mutant Mcm2-7 complexes fail. Consistent with their inability to support cell growth, none of the mutant complexes supported significant DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Analysis of FLAG-Mcm3 DNA association showed that, as in the loading assays, the Mcm4D/6D and Mcm6D/7D complexes are retained on the DNA more strongly than the Mcm4D/7D complex. Cdc45 association mirrored the level of FLAG-Mcm3 association with the DNA, suggesting Cdc45 recruitment is independent of the MSSB (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, all of the Mcm2-7 double mutants showed similarly strong defects (\u226510-fold) in both GINS and RPA DNA association. In the case of Mcm4D/7D mutant, the DNA replication, GINS and RPA DNA association defects are consistent with its helicase-loading defect. In contrast, for Mcm4D/6D and Mcm6D/7D, the extent of helicase loading and Cdc45 DNA association is distinct from the much larger losses in GINS and RPA DNA association and DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data strongly suggest that an inability to recruit or maintain GINS and/or RPA is responsible for the replication defects exhibited by these mutants. Because RPA DNA binding is a readout for ssDNA formation and GINS is required to activate the Mcm2-7 helicase, both of these defects indicate that the Mcm4/6 and Mcm6/7 MSSB mutants are defective for helicase activation."

These residues are important for binding ssDNA and, to a lesser extent, dsDNA. A DNA-binding role for positively charged residues in this region is consistent with previous mutational analysis of <i>Sso</i>MCM showing that K129A (equivalent to <i>Pf</i>MCM R124) displays very little binding to ssDNA, blunt duplex DNA, and bubble-DNA substrates (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pucci et al., 2004</a>). Although a positive residue equivalent to <i>Pf</i>MCM R186 is not conserved in <i>Sso</i>MCM, mutation of an adjacent residue, K194A also displays very little binding to these DNA substrates (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pucci et al., 2004</a>). As previously noted in overall sequence comparisons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pucci et al., 2004</a>), residues in the MSSB motif are conserved in specific families in eukaryotic Mcm2-7. Importantly, we show that conserved residues within this motif are critical for <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cell division and multiple Mcm2-7 functions during replication initiation."

Two mutant complexes (Mcm4D/7D and Mcm4D/6D/7D) show strong defects in Mcm2-7 loading. This is unexpected because Mcm2-7 proteins are loaded around dsDNA and there is no evidence for ssDNA at this stage of replication (<a href=\"#bib23\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Remus et al., 2009</a>). It is possible that one or more MSSB motifs interact with dsDNA prior to ssDNA formation at the origin and that these interactions stabilize loaded Mcm2-7. This would be consistent with the dsDNA binding defects observed for the <i>Pf</i>MCM<sub>N</sub> R124A/R186A double mutant (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and also the (R124-equivalent) K129A mutant of <i>Sso</i>MCM. Alternatively, elimination of positive charges in the central channel could alter the opening and closing of the Mcm2-7 ring. The abundance of positive charges in the Mcm2-7 ring could predispose the ring to remain open prior to DNA binding. Encircling dsDNA could neutralize the repulsion and favor ring closing. It is possible that a reduction in positive charge in the mutant complexes leads to the Mcm2-7 ring spending more time in the closed state, inhibiting entry of the dsDNA during loading. Analogously, the reduced positive charge of the MSSB mutants could destabilize ring closure around dsDNA during loading. Consistent with this model, the Mcm2-7 complex appears as a cracked-ring in solution (<a href=\"#bib17\">Costa et al., 2011</a>). As we observe, both scenarios predict that the strongest loading defects would be observed for the Mcm4D/6D/7D mutant that eliminates the greatest number of positive charges. Among the double mutants, the strongest loading defect is observed when the Mcm4 and Mcm7 subunits are mutated, which are across from the Mcm2/5 gate and could influence opening and closing more than other subunits."

First, the MCM-ssDNA interactions identified in our structure predominantly involve the sugars and bases of the ssDNA, ideally suited to bind and shield one strand from its complement during melting. Also consistent with a role in dsDNA melting, the Mcm2-7 MSSB mutant complexes showed strong defects in events linked to helicase activation. The MSSB mutations did not alter Cdc45 recruitment, consistent with the observation that this event can occur in G1 phase prior to ssDNA formation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aparicio et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tanaka et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the levels of GINS and RPA DNA association by each of the MSSB mutant complexes were strongly defective. The defect in RPA DNA binding is almost certainly due to reduced ssDNA generation by the mutant complexes. The reduction in DNA-associated GINS could be the result of a defect in recruitment or retention of GINS. Unlike Cdc45, GINS recruitment does not occur until entry into S phase (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kanemaki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Takayama et al., 2003</a>) and, therefore, could require ssDNA formation. Alternatively, it is possible that the defect in ssDNA binding prevents the CMG complex from attaining a particular DNA binding state and this destabilizes GINS binding."

Consistent with a role for the MSSB in unwinding, the <i>Sso</i>MCM K129A mutant (<i>Pf</i>MCM R124 equivalent) is defective for helicase activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pucci et al., 2004</a>). Although the MCM ATPase domain alone is sufficient to produce unwinding activity in <i>Sso</i>MCM (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pucci et al., 2007</a>) and in <i>Aeropyrum pernix</i> MCM (<a href=\"#bib5\">Atanassova and Grainge, 2008</a>), unwinding displays greater processivity in the presence of the N-terminal domain for <i>Sso</i>MCM (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barry et al., 2007</a>). Thus, although the N-terminal domain and the residues of the MSSB are not intrinsically required to produce an unwinding activity, the N-terminal domain can regulate and enhance MCM unwinding activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barry et al., 2007</a>). The positively charged residues of the MSSB could help maintain a closed MCM ring as described above for loading, and thus contribute to the enhanced processivity afforded by the N-terminal domain. It is also possible that ssDNA binding by the MSSB has a more direct impact on DNA unwinding. For example, the directional ssDNA:MSSB interactions observed here could influence the polarity of unwinding either during initiation (see below) or elongation. To permit the ssDNA:MCM<sub>N</sub> interactions that we observe, the ssDNA would need to alter its trajectory as it passes through the MCM central channel. Alternatively, the MSSB could bind ssDNA differently during unwinding. An interesting possibility is that during elongation the MCM OB-fold binds ssDNA similar to the OB-fold prototype SSB (<a href=\"#bib46\">Raghunathan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chan et al., 2009</a>). This mode of binding would place the ssDNA approximately parallel to the central channel (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), a position consistent with the expected ssDNA trajectory during unwinding. Different modes of interaction between the MSSB and ssDNA could be modulated by the AAA+ domain of MCM and a conserved \u2018allosteric communication loop\u2019 (ACL, <a href=\"#bib50\">Sakakibara et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">Barry et al., 2009</a>) that projects from the N-terminal domain towards the anticipated position of the ATPase domain. The ACL directly follows the \u03b2-strand that contains the second positively charged MSSB residue (<i>Pf</i>MCM residue R186) and thus could couple the MSSB to the ATPase domains."

Given that the Mcm2-7 complex is initially loaded around dsDNA, only one of the two strands of dsDNA can easily attain the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 coplanar clockwise configuration observed in our structure: the DNA strand that passes from the C- to N-terminus of the MCM complex in a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Intriguingly, this strand corresponds to the leading strand DNA template that is encircled by the MCM complex during translocation/DNA unwinding. For the opposite strand to interact with the MCM<sub>N</sub> with the observed polarity, it would either need to pass through the other strand or dramatically re-orient. Thus, if ssDNA is formed within the MCM ring during origin melting (see below), our structure predicts that MCM<sub>N</sub> would preferentially bind to the translocating strand (i.e., the leading strand DNA template). Consistent with this model, the 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 helicase polarity of <i>Sso</i>MCM is only observed when the N-terminal domain is present, implicating this domain in substrate selection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barry et al., 2007</a>)."

This analogy further supports a role for the MCM OB-fold during helicase activation prior to unwinding. The crystal structure of Rho with RNA bound at the OB-fold (<a href=\"#bib54\">Skordalakes and Berger, 2003</a>) suggests that 70\u201380 nucleotides of RNA would adopt a circular path around the ring (<a href=\"#bib54\">Skordalakes and Berger, 2003</a>) that is roughly perpendicular to the hexameric channel. This arrangement is conceptually similar to our <i>Pf</i>MCM<sub>N</sub>:ssDNA structure. The Rho OB-fold is believed to bind RNA and facilitate encircling of single-stranded RNA during ring closure by the ATPase domains (<a href=\"#bib54\">Skordalakes and Berger, 2003</a>), a prerequisite for establishing an activated helicase. Subsequently, the proposed unwinding mechanism for Rho exclusively involves distinct interactions between the ATPase motor domain and RNA (<a href=\"#bib57\">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</a>). The MCM N-terminal domain may also function to enable the ATPase domains to select and encircle one strand of DNA during ring closure. A key difference between MCM and Rho is that the Rho helicase ring is loaded on a species that is already single-stranded, whereas the MCM hexamer is first loaded onto double-stranded DNA that must somehow be converted to single-stranded DNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Evrin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Remus et al., 2009</a>)."

After helicase loading, we propose that DNA melting is initiated by activating the ATPase domains of the double-hexamer to pump dsDNA from the C-terminal lobe side towards the double-hexamer interface (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This is consistent with the known direction of MCM DNA translocation (<a href=\"#bib37\">McGeoch et al., 2005</a>) as well as observations that Mcm complexes can translocate on dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kaplan et al., 2003</a>). As additional nucleotides of DNA are forced to occupy the same distance along the DNA helical axis, a B-form structure can no longer be maintained. We predict that the DNA strands would be forced apart at the site where the diameter of the MCM central channel is largest. Intriguingly, the MSSB is on the surface of the largest diameter of the MCM<sub>N</sub> central channel (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), putting the MSSB in a prime position to bind the leading strand ssDNA upon DNA melting. The channel diameter elsewhere in the MCM<sub>N</sub> is too narrow to permit B-form DNA strands to separate. Such melting activity requires that the two hexamers are anchored to one another because the two hexamers would otherwise simply translocate away from one another without melting the DNA. Further dsDNA pumping after the volume around the MSSB has been filled would require the MCM ring to open and allow the unbound lagging strand DNA template to exit (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The presumed exit site would be through the Mcm2/5 gate (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Costa et al., 2011</a>). Intriguingly, Mcm2 and Mcm5 are the only two subunits that lack a conserved positive residue at the <i>Pf</i>MCM R124 position, reducing ssDNA affinity and potentially facilitating strand exit. Following strand exit and extrusion of additional lengths of ssDNA, ring closure would poise each isolated hexamer to unwind DNA using a strand exclusion mechanism (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fu et al., 2011</a>). The event that would drive double hexamer separation is unclear but could be facilitated by the change from encircling dsDNA to ssDNA, binding of additional factors (e.g., Mcm10) or modification of the helicase. A definitive test for this model awaits the development of assays that directly monitor the events of origin DNA melting and strand exclusion. Nevertheless, our studies provide structural and biochemical evidence that the MSSB is a critical ssDNA binding domain that functions during helicase loading and activation and provide initial insights into how ssDNA binding by MCM complex could facilitate selection of one strand during helicase activation."

This fragment was digested with BamHI/SalI, ligated into the BamHI/XhoI-prepared vector, and was transformed into DH5\u03b1 cells. The integrity of a single colony clone was verified by restriction digest pattern and by DNA sequencing (pLE009.3).

Phosphorylated MCM complexes were then activated with 750 \u03bcg S phase extract in the replication reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH7.6), 12.5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM zinc acetate, 300 mM potassium glutamate, 20 \u03bcM creatine phosphate, 0.02% NP40, 10% Glycerol, 3 mM ATP, 40 \u03bcM dNTPs, 200 \u03bcM CTP/UTP/GTP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 \u03bcCi [\u03b1-P<sup>32</sup>] dCTP and 2 \u03bcg creatine kinase, 40 \u03bcl) for 1 hr at 25\u00b0C and 1200 RPM in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf). After the reaction, DNA synthesis was monitored using alkaline agarose gel. DNA bound proteins were released from the beads by DNase I treatment and analyzed by immunoblot. S phase extracts were prepared from ySKS10 and ySKS11 as described previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heller et al., 2011</a>)."

Furthermore the crystal structure from the Archeal Mcm from <i>Pf</i> MCM combined with the in vivo and biochemical studies from the eukaryote <i>Sc</i> MCM's allow for exciting speculation as to how the earliest steps in initiation might occur. The work allows for a plausible model for the mechanism of how the leading strand might be selected in the duplex DNA concomitant with the melting and extrusion of the lagging strand from the central channel.
