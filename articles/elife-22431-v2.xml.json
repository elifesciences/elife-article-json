During natural vision, however, images do not arrive in isolation, but follow each other rapidly, separated by sudden gaze shifts. We here report that, contrary to standard models, specific ganglion cells in mouse retina are suppressed after a rapid image transition by changes in visual patterns across the transition, but respond with a distinct spike burst when the same pattern reappears. This sensitivity to image recurrence depends on opposing effects of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition and can be explained by a circuit of local serial inhibition. Rapid image transitions thus trigger a mode of operation that differs from the processing of simpler stimuli and allows the retina to tag particular image parts or to detect transition types that lead to recurring stimulus patterns."

During natural vision, however, images do not arrive in isolation, but follow each other rapidly, separated by sudden gaze shifts. We here report that, contrary to standard models, specific ganglion cells in mouse retina are suppressed after a rapid image transition by changes in visual patterns across the transition, but respond with a distinct spike burst when the same pattern reappears. This sensitivity to image recurrence depends on opposing effects of glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition and can be explained by a circuit of local serial inhibition. Rapid image transitions thus trigger a mode of operation that differs from the processing of simpler stimuli and allows the retina to tag particular image parts or to detect transition types that lead to recurring stimulus patterns."

Often, this encoding is thought to be largely captured by the cells\u2019 receptive fields, so that a cell\u2019s activity reflects an increase of the preferred stimulus feature inside its receptive field. In the retina, for example, neurons generally respond strongly to local or global increases in preferred visual contrast inside their spatial receptive fields (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kuffler, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Meister and\u00a0Berry, 1999</a>). Thus, when a new image comes into view, increases in spiking activity of ganglion cells are expected to represent image parts that contain large local contrast changes. During natural vision, however, images do not arrive in isolation, but are embedded in a continuous, strongly structured stream of visual stimulation. Brief periods of relatively stable fixation are interspersed with sudden shifts in the direction of gaze (\u2018saccades\u2019), so that images come in rapid sequences, separated by brief transition periods. Saccades of the eyes or head are ubiquitous among vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib35\">Land, 2015</a>), including mice (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Keller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), and they can exert a strong influence on ganglion cell spiking, evoking transient spike bursts in some ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Noda and Adey, 1974</a>) and suppressing activity in others by triggering inhibition in the retinal network (<a href=\"#bib62\">Roska and Werblin, 2003</a>)."

In particular, systematic investigations are lacking of how the previously fixated visual pattern affects the encoding of a newly arriving image. Moreover, the rapid image sequences and the strong, global motion signal during a saccadic transition appear to trigger specific excitatory and inhibitory circuit elements (<a href=\"#bib56\">Passaglia et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Roska and Werblin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Geffen et al., 2007</a>), which may alter the processing of visual information compared to responses under simpler, more traditional laboratory stimuli."

Various examples have shown that such interactions can mediate specific, functionally relevant response characteristics beyond contrast detection inside the receptive field for a number of ganglion cell types (<a href=\"#bib51\">Olveczky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fcnch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00f6linger and Gollisch, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vaney et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). The examples have led to the hypothesis that many amacrine cells function in a highly task-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib42\">Masland, 2012a</a>), making it difficult to study their influence on retinal signal processing with simple, generic stimuli and suggesting to systematically explore the characteristics of stimulus encoding under more natural stimulus dynamics. A particularly suited stimulus context appears to be given by eye-movement-like rapid image transitions. These are characterized by a fairly stereotypic temporal structure of alternating image fixations and shifts, yet the rapid image sequences and the strong, global motion stimulus during a transition can be expected to trigger various neuronal interactions in the retinal network."

This revealed that, contrary to common stimulus\u2013response models, particular ganglion cells robustly responded to recurrences of the same image across the transition, but were suppressed when the image position changed. Finally, a combination of pharmacological interventions, intracellular recordings, and computational modeling indicated that this unexpected sensitivity to image recurrence is mediated by a circuit of serial inhibition, demonstrating how saccade-triggered inhibitory interactions can alter retinal stimulus encoding."

We recorded the spiking activity of individual ganglion cells in the\u00a0isolated mouse retina with multi-electrode arrays while stimulating the photoreceptors with saccade-like shifts of a spatial grating. After each shift, the grating stopped randomly for a brief fixation at one out of four different spatial phases, here called positions 1 to 4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), resulting in 16 possible transitions. Each transition occurred many times in this random sequence, and we collected the responses from all instances of a transition to compute a firing rate profile (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, top). To compare responses from all 16 transitions, we arranged these profiles in a matrix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, bottom) to denote the dependence on the positions prior to the transition (\u2018starting position\u2019) and afterwards (\u2018target position\u2019). The response matrix of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> shows that this particular sample cell preferred certain target positions (here position 2 or 3), and responses were further enhanced when the starting position was among the reversed positions (here 1 and 4). This response structure is consistent with the classical idea of receptive field activation, yielding the strongest responses when, after the transition, the stimulus inside the receptive field (better) matches the cell\u2019s preferred contrast."

The variations in transition duration were accompanied by corresponding differences in the speed of the saccade-like shifts. The characteristic IRS responses are visible in all cases. Note, though, that longer saccade-like shifts produced additional intermediate activity peaks. Apparently, the sequence of bright and dark illumination is now slow enough so that the neurons can follow and produce transient activation, for example, when the grating position temporarily matches the starting position during the saccadic transition. For example, for 300 ms shifts, the transition from position 1 to 3 yields two response peaks in addition to the transition-onset peak, in agreement with the fact that the transition here goes through 2.5 grating periods. For the transition from position 3 to 1, the grating only goes through 1.5 periods, and there is correspondingly only one additional peak.

As expected, IRS cells responded well to the flashed gratings at all four positions. Compared to the responses after fixation onset of a recurring grating, the responses to isolated gratings occurred with shorter latency, yet were generally weaker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This is noteworthy because under the saccade-like stimulation, the prior exposure to the same grating should lead to adaptation and thereby decrease sensitivity to the recurrence of the grating. Furthermore, the spike burst that occurs during the transition itself and that precedes the spike burst at the onset of the new fixation by a mere 100\u2013150 ms should trigger spike-frequency adaptation in the ganglion cell (<a href=\"#bib50\">O'Brien et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kim and Rieke, 2003</a>) and thereby additionally decrease sensitivity when the grating recurs after the transition. Yet, despite these adaptation processes, the responses to recurring gratings were still stronger than for isolated gratings. This suggests that mechanisms beyond standard stimulus integration and response adaptation are involved in creating this non-standard history dependence."

We therefore tested whether the sensitivity to image recurrence is affected by contrast changes. To do so, we randomly selected the contrast for each fixation to be either 30 or 60% and masked the transition periods by background illumination. We found that, regardless of the combination of contrast before and after the transition, post-transition spike bursts only occurred for equal starting and target position of the grating (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating a certain invariance to contrast in the detection of a recurring spatial stimulus layout by the IRS cells. The robustness of the characteristic IRS responses is also underscored by varying the duration of the transition. In fact, we found that the specific sensitivity to image recurrence for these cells occurred for transition durations from few tens to some hundreds of milliseconds (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This indicates that the response to a recurring image does not result from an intrinsic oscillation mechanism that would resonate with the disappearance and reappearance of the image at some optimal interval."

To test whether the recurrence of one or the other of these components generates the IRS response, we decomposed the grating into its bright and dark stripes and presented transitions between patterns of only bright stripes as well as between patterns of only dark stripes. Here, we did not use actual saccadic shifts because these would simply correspond to a bright/dark grating with altered mean illumination and reduced contrast. Thus, we focused on transitions that were masked by background (gray) illumination. Unlike for the full grating transitions, which always combine brightening at some locations with darkening at others, some stimulus locations now remain unchanged at transition onset and/or fixation onset, and the other locations simultaneously all experienced either brightening or darkening (see schematic stimuli in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We found that the dark bars alone were sufficient to trigger the characteristic IRS response, with strong post-transition peaks in the firing rate only when the target position matched the starting position of the dark bars (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Note, though, that transitions with a change in grating position now caused slightly increased post-transition responses as compared to stimulation with the full grating, indicating that the response suppression for a change in stimulus position was not as robust as for a true saccade-like transition where the mean stimulus intensity during transition and fixation matched. Transitions of only bright bars, on the other hand, did not evoke post-transition responses by themselves, but triggered the first response peak that occurred during the transition, indicating that this is a response to the offset of non-preferred stimulus contrast."

These image recurrences indeed generally led to the strongest post-transition responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Furthermore, similar to the grating stimuli, the responses of IRS cells to natural images were largely independent of whether the transition occurred in a saccade-like or blink-like fashion, with the motion masked by mean illumination. Note, though, that responses of individual cells for different fixation positions were somewhat more variable than for grating stimuli. This response variability is likely due to variability of stimulus patterns inside the receptive field; patches of fairly homogeneous bright illumination, for example, are not expected to yield strong IRS responses because of the Off-type nature of these cells."

For both\u00a0transition onset and fixation onset,\u00a0receptive field activation was here computed as the integrated amount of darkening, weighted by the profile of the receptive field. Indeed, we found systematically positive correlations both between the amount of darkening at transition onset and the size of the first response peak (p=1.1\u00b710<sup>\u22126</sup>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) as well as between the amount of darkening at fixation onset and the size of the second response peak (p=2.3\u00b710<sup>\u22124</sup>). Thus, variations in receptive field activation by natural images appear to be a strong source of response variability. Note, however, that despite this response variability on the single-cell level, the population response of IRS cells can still robustly encode global image recurrences, with the strongest contributions to the population response generally coming from different subsets of IRS cells for different images."

This inhibition was suppressed when the grating reappeared with the same spatial phase (peak currents 280 pA\u00a0\u00b1110 pA and 1070 pA\u00a0\u00b1170 pA, mean \u00b1 SEM, for recurrence and change, respectively; p=0.0054, paired <i>t</i>-test). A corresponding dependence on image recurrence was observed for the excitatory input. Here, a second response peak occurred only when the grating reappeared with the same spatial phase. When the grating phase changed across the transition, this excitatory input was suppressed (peak currents \u2212249 pA\u00a0\u00b1\u00a043 pA and \u221218 pA\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041 pA, mean \u00b1 SEM, for recurrence and change, respectively; p=0.031, paired <i>t</i>-test; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Thus, both inhibition and excitation depend on the stimulus transition in a way that supports strong responses for recurring images. This parallel modulation of excitation and inhibition may be explained by a single source of inhibition, which acts both directly onto the ganglion cell as well as onto the bipolar cell terminals that mediate the excitatory synaptic input to the ganglion cell. This inhibition would be active after a transition with a change in grating position and thereby provide inhibitory input to the ganglion cell and simultaneously suppress the excitatory input. Such dual effects of inhibitory signals are well known; AII amacrine cells, for example, project both directly onto transient Off-alpha cells as well as onto their presynaptic bipolar cell terminals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bloomfield and Dacheux, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ivanova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Manookin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Murphy and Rieke, 2008</a>)."

When we applied the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine, we found that IRS cells lost their specificity in responding to recurring images. Instead, the cells responded non-specifically to all fixations under strychnine (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). By contrast, when we applied the GABA<sub>A</sub>-antagonist gabazine to the retina, we found that the sensitivity to image recurrence was also abolished, but now because the response for the recurring image was suppressed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Thus, blocking glycinergic inhibition and blocking GABAergic inhibition had opposite effects, with the former leading to an increase of activity after change across the transition and the latter to a suppression of activity after image recurrence. Together, this suggests that glycine-mediated inhibition acts directly onto the ganglion cell or onto its excitatory input, whereas GABAergic inhibition has an indirect effect because the activity reduction upon its block indicates a sign-inverted effect of this inhibitory signal. This lets us hypothesize that the presynaptic circuit of IRS cells involves serial inhibition, with glycinergic inhibition acting directly on the ganglion cell activity and GABAergic inhibition acting on the source of the glycinergic inhibition."

The responses to very brief and long transitions point to shortcomings of the model for processing rapid stimulus components. Apparently, the applied bipolar cell filters are too weakly activated under 33-ms transitions of recurring images. Furthermore, for longer transitions, the model is quite sensitive to the stimulus dynamics during a saccadic transition, producing a second response peak under 200-ms transitions for the transitions from positions 3 to 1 and 4 to 2, but not for the opposite transitions. Note that this asymmetry is connected to our implementation of the shift distance, which covers 1.5 grating cycles for the former transitions, but only 2.5 grating cycles for the latter. Masked transitions, on the other hand, which have no fast stimulus dynamics during the transitions, produce more robust IRS responses for longer transition durations, supporting the notion that the lack of appropriate dynamics for integrating rapid stimulus fluctuations causes the model\u2019s deviations from data for short and long transitions."

Locations with net brightening, however, provide slow, strong, long-lasting inhibition through the activity of the On-type amacrine cell, which is triggered by both transition onset and fixation onset. This inhibition suppresses activity after fixation onset, but, owing to the low-pass filtering, is too slow to suppress the earlier activity peak during the transition."

Thus, here, the first excitation peak, generated by transition onset at \u2018Bright-to-bright\u2019 locations, leads to spiking because it escapes the slower inhibition, and the second excitation peak, generated by fixation onset at \u2018Dark-to-dark\u2019 locations, leads to spiking once it overcomes the decaying On-type inhibition."

The isolated flash of a grating triggers both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the ganglion cell. Because excitation is faster than inhibition (in the model reflected by the low-pass filtering of the On-type amacrine cell), a spike burst is generated at short latency, but the peak response is then already suppressed by the rising inhibition. For an image recurrence, on the other hand, inhibitory inputs are present during the early phase of the new fixation (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, \u2018Dark-to-dark\u2019), preventing short-latency spiking.

When applying the model to transitions of different durations (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we observed that IRS-like responses occurred for transition durations as short as 33 ms and that longer transitions led to a gradual decline of the IRS response patterns and the emergence intermediate activity peaks, qualitatively similar to the experimental data (cf. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). There are, however, substantial quantitative deviations of the model responses from the experimental data for short and long transitions, in particular for saccade-like transitions, though less so for masked transitions. These indicate shortcomings of the model in its ability to resolve fast stimulus components, such as the very brief transitions or the stimulus fluctuations during the long transition period for long transitions.

Furthermore, this analysis indicates that the qualitative behavior of the model does not depend sensitively on individual parameters, such as the strength of the On-type or Off-type inhibition or the time scales of the filters."

This encoding of image recurrence is robust to changes in transition type, visual contrast, and spatial structure of the image (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>) and is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the image on a scale of few tens of micrometers, suggesting a potential role in monitoring fixational eye movements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

Commonly used simple stimuli, such as isolated images or white-noise flicker, will therefore not effectively activate this interaction. Thus, rapid image transitions trigger a mode of operation in the retina that differs from the processing of simpler stimuli. It will be interesting to see whether similar operational switches can be found in other circuits or under other naturalistic stimulus contexts, thereby potentially allowing individual ganglion cells to fulfill different visual tasks in a stimulus-context-dependent fashion. Furthermore, one may expect that comparable studies of other cell types under stimulation with rapid image transitions or with\u00a0similar naturalistic stimulus dynamics will help elucidate further features of the inhibitory interactions in the retinal circuitry."

The occurrence of such dual information channels has been linked to the need for efficiently covering the natural range of a given stimulus feature (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gjorgjieva et al., 2014</a>). Another counterpart to the sensitivity to change is formed by suppressed-by-contrast ganglion cells, which display response suppression for most changes in visual input and which have recently been implicated in the detection of image transitions (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tien et al., 2015</a>). Yet, while the suppressed-by-contrast cells display suppression fairly unselectively to nearly any stimulus transition, the IRS responses depend in a specific fashion on the net change in the visual pattern across a transition. Also, the IRS responses to the drift-reset stimulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) bear some resemblance to the synchronized activity of ganglion cells under reversal of motion direction (<a href=\"#bib66\">Schwartz et al., 2007</a>).

The grating was presented at 60% Michelson contrast and was held fixed for 800 ms at one of four linearly spaced spatial phases before being shifted during 100 ms to stop again at one of the four spatial phases to start another 800-ms fixation. For each shift, the spatial phases before and afterwards are termed \u2018starting position\u2019 and \u2018target position\u2019, respectively. The sequence of fixation positions was chosen randomly. During each shift, the grating covered a distance of 1.5 to 2.5 spatial periods, depending on the exact difference between starting and target position. For transitions between contrast-reversed gratings, either 2.5 or 1.5 spatial periods could be applied, and we here chose for concreteness to use the former for the two transitions from position 1 to 3 and from 2 to 4 and the latter for the two opposite transitions. The range of transition distances corresponds to shifts of around 13\u201322\u00b0 of visual angle, in the range of saccade amplitudes observed in mice (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sakatani and Isa, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Keller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). For the special case where the saccade duration was reduced to 33 ms, the shift was reduced to the range of 0.5 to 1.5 spatial periods to minimize aliasing by the monitor refresh rate. Firing rate profiles were obtained for each transition as peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) with a bin size of 10 ms. Post-transition peak latency was determined from the PSTH by identifying the bin with the\u00a0maximum firing rate, fitting a second-order polynomial through this and the two neighboring data points and determining the peak time from the fit."

We restricted the analysis to transitions with equal starting and target position and to transitions masked by the blurred image in order to be independent of the complex stimulus dynamics during a motion transition. To compute the activation at, for example, fixation onset, we subtracted the blurred image from the actual image to obtain a measure of contrast for each pixel. To take the receptive field profile into account, we used a 2D Gaussian fit of the spatial receptive field and multiplied each pixel contrast value by the value of the Gaussian profile at the corresponding location. To focus on the negative contrast (since the IRS cells are Off-type cells), we set all positive pixel values to zero, then sign-inverted all pixel values and summed them up over space. We then computed, for each cell and image, the correlation coefficient R between the four activation values (corresponding to the four fixation positions) and the peak size of the second peak in the PSTHs. Finally, we tested whether the collection of these R values significantly deviated from a distribution around zero by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The analysis for transition onset proceeded in an analogous fashion, except that we here subtracted the actual image from the blurred image (instead of the other way around) and that the size of the first firing rate peak was used for the correlation."

The receptive field of the ganglion cell was composed of four non-overlapping spatial subunits that together covered one spatial period of the grating. Each subunit contains an Off-type bipolar cell, which provides excitatory input to the ganglion cell, and an On-type bipolar cell, which is the source of inhibitory input to the ganglion cell via an intermediate On-type amacrine cell in the subunit. The ganglion cell summed over the excitatory and inhibitory inputs from all subunits, and its half-wave rectified activation was interpreted as the firing rate (in arbitrary units). As a critical circuit element, each subunit also contained serial inhibition, mediated by an Off-type amacrine cell, which received excitatory\u00a0input from the Off-type bipolar cell and inhibited the On-type amacrine cell. By assuming that the On-type amacrine cell, which suppresses the\u00a0ganglion cell activity, is glycinergic and that the Off-type amacrine cell, whose influence on the ganglion cell is indirect, is GABAergic, this circuit is consistent with the observed response-increasing action of the gabazine blocker strychnine and with the indirect, response-suppressive action of the GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker gabazine (cf. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

For a better match with physiology, each individual model bipolar or amacrine cell should be thought of as a collection of several, smaller cells, which all receive approximately identical inputs because they are stimulated by the same region of the grating. Furthermore, for simplicity, we restricted the On-type inhibition to act directly on the ganglion cell. Yet, letting this inhibition instead act on the synaptic terminals of the Off-type bipolar cells leads to a functionally nearly identical model. We implemented this by subtracting the inhibitory signal of each On-type amacrine cell from the four Off-type bipolar cell inputs to the ganglion cell before the synaptic rectification instead of afterwards. To keep the net strength of this inhibition fixed, we multiplied the activity of the On-type amacrine cell by 0.5, since the grating activates two Off-type bipolar cells simultaneously. The results from this \u2018presynaptic-inhibition\u2019 model are compared to the standard, \u2018postsynaptic\u2019 model in <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>."

However, this would require that the On-type bipolar cell itself be slow enough so that its activity would control the level of inhibition well beyond the stimulation of the On-type bipolar cell during\u00a0the transition. As this \u2018long memory\u2019 of bipolar cells appears less likely, we here focused on the described direct interaction of glycinergic and GABergic inhibition for exploring their opposing effects."

They find that 5-10% of RGCs are \"image-recurrence sensitive,\" meaning that their spiking is generally suppressed after a transition from one spatial pattern to the next, unless the same pattern reappears. IRS cells correspond to transient Off \u03b1 RGCs. Through a series of clever manipulations of a shifting grating stimulus, pharmacology, intracellular recordings and computational modeling, they convincingly show that the IRS response is mediated by a serial inhibition circuit in the inner retina. The authors argue that this type of feature sensitivity may be useful in guiding micro saccades to correct for fixational drift. The mechanistic explanation of this unexpected IRS response is very solid, and it stands as an unusually convincing example of attributing some feature of retinal computation to a serial inhibition circuit. This is achieved mostly through the authors' clever stimulus design and willingness / ability to use whole cell recordings from identified OFF \u03b1 cells. The effort to firmly identify these IRS cells as the transient OFF \u03b1 RGCs is very nice."

We found systematic positive correlations both for transition onset and fixation onset and report on these findings in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>. This indicates that, as expected, variations of stimulus structure inside the receptive field are an important source of response variability. We did not aim at predicting these variations through our model because this would require substantial additional assumptions and parameters, regarding the size and placement of the actual receptive fields of the circuit\u2019s interneurons.

However, we now show in the new <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> that presynaptic inhibition can be used just as well without changing the response of the model."

This shows that the model does not require fine tuning of parameters to qualitatively reproduce the IRS responses. Furthermore, we added some explanations regarding the model\u2019s free parameters in the methods section. Please note, though, that we did not perform any systematic optimization of the free parameters to fit the experimental data because the model aims at providing a proof-of-principle explanation of the IRS responses rather than a detailed reproduction of the firing rate profiles."
