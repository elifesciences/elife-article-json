Ankyrins specifically bind to numerous membrane targets through their 24 ankyrin repeats (ANK repeats), although the mechanism for the facile and independent evolution of these interactions has not been resolved. Here we report the structures of ANK repeats in complex with an inhibitory segment from the C-terminal regulatory domain and with a sodium channel Nav1.2 peptide, respectively, showing that the extended, extremely conserved inner groove spanning the entire ANK repeat solenoid contains multiple target binding sites capable of accommodating target proteins with very diverse sequences via combinatorial usage of these sites. These structures establish a framework for understanding the evolution of ankyrins' membrane targets, with implications for other proteins containing extended ANK repeat domains."

Ankyrins specifically bind to numerous membrane targets through their 24 ankyrin repeats (ANK repeats), although the mechanism for the facile and independent evolution of these interactions has not been resolved. Here we report the structures of ANK repeats in complex with an inhibitory segment from the C-terminal regulatory domain and with a sodium channel Nav1.2 peptide, respectively, showing that the extended, extremely conserved inner groove spanning the entire ANK repeat solenoid contains multiple target binding sites capable of accommodating target proteins with very diverse sequences via combinatorial usage of these sites. These structures establish a framework for understanding the evolution of ankyrins' membrane targets, with implications for other proteins containing extended ANK repeat domains."

Wang, Wei et al. found that the ankyrin protein fragment bound to the inner surface of the part of the helix formed by the first 14 ankyrin repeats. The target protein region also bound to the helix's inner surface. Wang, Wei et al. show that this surface contains many binding sites that can be used, in different combinations, to allow ankyrins to interact with diverse proteins."

There are three members in the human ankyrin family: ankyrin-R/B/G (AnkR/B/G) encoded by <i>ANK1/2/3</i>, respectively. They all consist of a highly similar N-terminal membrane binding domain composed of 24 ankyrin (ANK) repeats, a spectrin-binding domain comprised of two ZU5 domains, and a UPA domain followed by a death domain (DD) and a variable C-terminal regulatory domain (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Although sharing similar domain organization, the three ankyrins have distinct and non-overlapping functions in specific membrane domains coordinated by ankyrin-spectrin networks (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mohler et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">He et al., 2013</a>). As ankyrins are adaptor proteins linking membrane proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton, ankyrin dysfunction is closely related to serious human diseases. For example, loss-of-function mutations can cause hemolytic anemia (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gallagher, 2005</a>), various cardiac diseases including several cardiac arrhythmia syndromes and sinus node dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mohler et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Le Scouarnec et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hashemi et al., 2009</a>), bipolar disorder (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ferreira et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dedman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rueckert et al., 2013</a>), and autism spectrum disorder (<a href=\"#bib40\">Iqbal et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Shi et al., 2013</a>)."

One good example is the formation and maintenance of axon initial segments (AIS) in neurons. Interaction between AnkG and L1 cell adhesion molecules (e.g., the 186 kDa neurofascin, referred to as Nfasc in this study) is required for the formation and stability of the AIS (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hedstrom et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zonta et al., 2011</a>). AnkG is in turn responsible for clustering voltage-gated sodium channels at the AIS, which underlies the mechanistic basis of action potential generation and propagation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garrido et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kole et al., 2008</a>) (see review by <a href=\"#bib60\">Rasband, 2010</a>). Anchoring of L1 cell adhesion molecules also directs inhibitory GABAergic synapse innervation at the AIS of excitatory Purkinje neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ango et al., 2004</a>), a critical step for balanced neuronal circuit formation. Depletion of AnkG both in cultured hippocampal neurons and in mice causes axons to lose axonal properties and acquire the molecular characteristics of dendrites, showing that AnkG is required for the maintenance of axonal polarity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hedstrom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sobotzik et al., 2009</a>)."

Although the critical functions of ankyrins in the specialized membrane domains have been recognized for decades, the underlying mechanistic basis governing ankyrin's coordination with such broad spectrum of membrane targets remains essentially unknown, largely due to challenges in characterizing the biochemical and structural properties of the elongated ANK repeats. Additionally, it is noted that the ANK repeats of ankyrins have been extremely conserved, whereas the membrane targets have continued to expand throughout evolution, presumably due to functional requirements for membrane microdomain-mediated fast signaling events in higher eukaryotes including mammals."

We solved the crystal structures of ANK repeats in complex with an auto-inhibitory segment from AnkR C-terminal domain and with a peptide from Nav1.2, respectively. The 24 ANK repeats of ankyrins form a superhelical solenoid with an extremely conserved elongated inner groove, which contains multiple quasi-independent target binding sites. We further show that ankyrins can accommodate different membrane targets with diverse sequences by combinatorial usage of these binding sites. The ankyrin-Nav1.2 complex structure also provides a mechanistic explanation for the mutation found in Nav channels that causes cardiac disease in humans. Collectively, our findings provide a first glimpse into the mechanistic basis governing membrane target recognition by the highly conserved ANK repeats in ankyrins and establish a structural framework for future investigation of ankyrin's involvement in physiological functions and pathological conditions in diverse tissues. Our results also provide a molecular mechanism for the rapid expansion of ankyrin partners in vertebrate evolution. These insights also will be valuable for understanding the recognition mechanisms of other long ANK repeat proteins as well as many other long repeat-containing proteins in living organisms in general."

However, extensive trials of crystallizing ANK repeat domains of AnkR/B/G were not successful, presumably because of the highly dynamic nature of the extended ANK repeat solenoid (<a href=\"#bib36\">Howard and Bechstedt, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). Anticipating that ANK repeats binders may rigidify the conformation of ANK repeats, we turned our attention to the ANK repeat/target complexes. The C-terminal regulatory domains have been reported to bind to ANK repeats intra-molecularly and modulate the target binding properties of ankyrins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davis et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdi et al., 2006</a>). We measured the interaction of AnkR_repeats with its entire C-terminal regulatory domain (residues 1529\u20131907) using highly purified recombinant proteins, and found that they interact with each other with a K<sub>d</sub> of around 1 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). It is expected that the intra-molecular association between ANK repeats and its C-terminal tail of AnkR is very stable, and thus the full-length AnkR likely adopts an auto-inhibited conformation and ANK repeats-mediated binding to membrane targets requires release of the auto-inhibited conformation of AnkR."

Further truncation at either end of this 48-residue AS fragment significantly decreased its binding to AnkR_repeats (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The corresponding sequence does not exist in AnkB or AnkG, indicating the AS is specific to AnkR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). AnkR_AS was found to bind to AnkR/B/G ANK repeats with comparable affinities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), as expected since AnkR/B/G share extremely conserved ANK repeat sequences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and see below). Thus, we tried the complexes of AnkR_AS with ANK repeats of all three isoforms to increase the chances of obtaining suitable crystals. Although crystals of various complexes were obtained, they all diffracted very poorly. After extensive trials of screening and optimization, we succeeded in obtaining good-diffraction crystals of AnkR_AS fused at its C-terminus with the AnkB_repeats and solved the structure of the fusion protein at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

The 24 ANK repeats form a left-handed helical solenoid with each repeat rotating anti-clockwise by \u223c16\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Except for the capping helices in the first and last repeats (i.e., \u03b1A of R1 and \u03b1B of R24), each repeat has the typical ANK repeat sequence pattern and forms a helix-turn-helix conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). A well-defined finger-like hairpin loop (finger loop) connects two consecutive repeats. The inner \u03b1A helices and the finger loops of the 24 repeats line together to form an elongated concave inner groove, and the \u03b1B helices of the repeats form the solvent-exposed convex outer surface. The ANK repeats superhelix has outer and inner diameters of approximately 60 \u00c5 and 45 \u00c5, respectively, and a total height of \u223c150 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The size of the ANK repeats revealed here is consistent with the previous measurement by atomic force microscopy (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). The C-terminal half of the ANK repeats structure aligns well with the apo-form structure of the last 12 ANK repeats of AnkR with an overall r.m.s.d. of 1.6 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Michaely et al., 2002</a>)."

Further analysis reveals that residues forming the target binding concave inner groove (i.e., residues of the finger loops and \u03b1A helices of the 24 repeats) are essentially identical among vertebrate AnkR/B/G (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that both the structure and the target binding properties of their ANK repeats are likely to be the same (also see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Additionally, the residues in the entire inner groove of the ANK repeats superhelix are highly conserved for all ankyrins throughout evolution (from worm to human) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), suggesting that the functions of ANK repeats in different species of ankyrins are highly conserved during evolution and that the inner groove of ANK repeats is the general binding site for membrane-associated targets of ankyrins. Consistent with this prediction, binding of AS to AnkG_repeats prevents voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2 and Nfasc from binding to AnkG (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the ANK repeats/AS structure presented here serves as a general framework for understanding how ankyrins engage their membrane targets, and tested this hypothesis using mutations designed and tested as described below."

Nonetheless, this division is supported by several lines of evidence. Structurally, there is a fairly clear boundary between each of the two binding sites in the ANK repeats/AS complex structure, whereas the interactions within each site are rather concentrated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The most direct evidence is from the interaction between ANK repeats and Nav1.2 (see below). In the case of Nav1.2 binding, R1\u20136 of ANK repeats binds to the C-terminal half of the Nav1.2_ABD (ankyrin binding domain) and R11\u201314 binds to the N-terminal half of Nav1.2_ABD. R7\u201310 is not involved in the Nav1.2 binding. Thus, one can naturally divide ANK repeats R1\u201314 into three parts. Such division is further supported by the accepted concept that four to five ANK repeats can form a folded structural unit. In our case, sites 2 and 3 contain four repeats each, and site 1 contains five repeats if we do not count the repeat 1 which serves as a capping repeat."

The K<sub>d</sub> of the binding of AnkG_repeats to the Nav1.2_ABD (residues 1035\u20131129, comprising the majority of the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices II and III, see below for details) and to the Nfasc_ABD (a 28-residue fragment in the cytoplasmic tail; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and see <a href=\"#bib25\">Garver et al., 1997</a>) is 0.17 and 0.21 \u03bc\u039c, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, upper panels). To probe the binding sites of Nav1.2 and Nfasc on AnkG, we constructed AnkG_repeat mutants with the corresponding hydrophobic residues in binding site 1 (Phe131 and Phe164 in R4 and R5, termed \u2018FF\u2019), site 2 (Ile267 and Leu300 in R8 and R9; \u2018IL\u2019), and site 3 (Leu366, Phe399, and Leu432 in R11, R12, and R13; \u2018LFL\u2019) substituted with Gln (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and examined their binding to the two targets. The mutations in site 1 significantly decreased ANK repeat binding to Nav1.2, but had no impact on Nfasc binding. Conversely, the mutations in site 2 had minimal impact on Nav1.2 binding, but significantly weakened Nfasc binding. The mutations in site 3 weakened ANK repeat binding to both targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The above results indicate that the two targets bind to ANK repeats with distinct modes, with Nav1.2 binding to sites 1 and 3 and Nfasc binding to sites 2 and 3. This conclusion is further supported by the binding of the two targets to various AnkG_repeat truncation mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

The mutations in sites 1 and 2 led to \u223c20-fold decrease in AnkR_AS binding, while the site 3 mutation only caused an approximately threefold decrease in AnkR_AS binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Finally, we tested the binding of another two reported ankyrin targets, the KCNQ2 potassium channel (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pan et al., 2006</a>) and the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cunha et al., 2011</a>), to the ANK repeats and its mutants, and found that KCNQ2 mainly binds to sites 1 and 2, and Cav1.3 primarily relies on site 2 of ANK repeats (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Taken together, the above biochemical analysis plus the structure of the ANK repeats/AS complex reveals that through combinations of multiple binding sites on the extremely conserved and elongated inner groove formed by the 24 ANK repeats, ankyrins can bind to numerous targets with diverse amino acid sequences. It is likely that some ankyrin targets may bind to the groove formed by the rest of the repeats in addition to R1\u201314."

Previous studies have reported that the intracellular loop connecting the transmembrane helices II and III (loop 2) is responsible for targeting Nav1.2 to the AIS via directly binding to AnkG, and identified a 27-residue motif within loop 2 (\u2018ABD-C\u2019, indicated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>) as the AnkG binding domain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garrido et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lemaillet et al., 2003</a>). First, we confirmed that a 95-residue fragment (ABD, residues 1035\u20131129; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) is sufficient for binding to AnkG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, upper left panel). Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal part of the ABD (ABD-C, the 27-residue motif identified previously for ANK repeats binding) binds to ANK repeats with an affinity \u223c15-fold weaker than the entire ABD, indicating that the ABD-C is not sufficient for binding to ANK repeats (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Consistent with this observation, the N-terminal 68-residue fragment of loop 2 (ABD-N, residues 1035\u20131102) also binds to ANK repeats, albeit with a relatively weak affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of \u223c8 \u03bc\u039c; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). We further showed that the ABD-C fragment binds to repeats 1\u20136 (R1\u20136) of ANK repeats, as ABD-C binds to R1\u20136 and the entire 24 ANK repeats with essentially the same affinities (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). These results also reveal that, like the AnkR_AS, the Nav1.2 peptide segment binds to ANK repeats in an anti-parallel manner. Taken together, the biochemical data shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> indicate that two distinct fragments of Nav1.2 loop 2, ABD-N and ABD-C, are responsible for binding to ANK repeats. The previously identified ABD-C binds to site 1 and ABD-N binds to site 3 of ANK repeats, and the interactions between the two sites are largely independent from each other energetically."

In particular, the hydrophobic residues of Nav1.2_ABD-C and AS occupy very similar positions on the hydrophobic groove formed by residues from ANK repeats R4 and R5, and subtle conformational differences in the finger loops of R4 and R5 can accommodate amino acid sequence differences between the two targets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This similar pattern and subtle accommodation illustrate that ANK repeats in general are incredibly adaptable and versatile as protein binding modules. Unique to Nav1.2, the binding of ABD-C extends all the way to R1 via charge\u2013charge and hydrogen-bond interactions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,E</a>). We also compared our ANK repeats complex structure with two recently determined peptide-bound ANK repeats structures, ANKRA2 and RFXANK in complex with HDAC4 and RFX5 peptides, respectively (<a href=\"#bib68\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Although the HDAC4 and RFX5 peptides also bind to ANKRA2 and RFXANK ANK repeats in extended conformations, the key target binding residues are restricted to a small set of hydrophobic residues in the A helices of the five ANK repeats. Accordingly, a consensus sequence motif can be recognized to bind to the ANKRA2 and RFXANK ANK repeats."

In contrast to the common expectation of directly interacting with positively charged residue(s), Glu1112 of Nav1.2 is buried deeply in the groove and forms hydrogen bonds with the sidechains of Thr94 and Asn98 in the R2 and R3 finger loop (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Charge potential calculation shows that the Glu1112 binding pocket formed by R2 and R3 is highly positive, and thus nicely accommodates the negatively charged carboxyl group of Glu1112 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). As expected, the charge reversal mutation of Nav1.2 (E1112K) abolished the channel's binding to ANK repeats. Even mild substitutions (E1112Q- and E1112A-Nav1.2) weakened the binding of Nav1.2 to ANK repeats by \u223c30-fold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In agreement with our findings, E1112Q- and E1112A-Nav1.2 (or E1100 in Nav1.6) failed to cluster at the AIS of hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fache et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gasser et al., 2012</a>). Conversely, substitutions of Thr94 and Asn98 of ANK repeats with Ala and Glu, respectively, also weakened the ANK repeats/Nav1.2_ABD interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The above biochemical and structural data illustrate the importance of the absolutely conserved Glu in various ankyrin binding targets shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> in anchoring these binding domains to site 1 of ANK repeats.

It is predicted that the \u2018FF\u2019 mutant in site 1 of AnkG_repeats disrupts its Nav1.2 binding but retains the Nfasc binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). As shown previously (<a href=\"#bib31\">He et al., 2012</a>), the defect in both AIS formation and Nav channels/Nfasc clustering at the AIS caused by knockdown of endogenous AnkG could be rescued by co-transfection of the shRNA-resistant, WT 270 kDa AnkG-GFP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The \u2018FF\u2019 mutant of 270 kDa AnkG-GFP was concentrated normally at the AIS, but failed to rescue clustering of endogenous Nav at the AIS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C,D</a>), consistent with the significantly weakened binding of the mutant AnkG to Nav1.2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). This result confirms that the proper clustering of Nav at the AIS depends on AnkG (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zhou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Garrido et al., 2003</a>). In contrast, Nfasc clustered properly at the AIS in neurons co-transfected with \u2018FF\u2019-AnkG (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>), which was predicted since the \u2018FF\u2019 mutant had no impact on AnkG's binding to Nfasc. Interestingly, both the \u2018IL\u2019 (site 2) and \u2018LF\u2019 (part of site 3) mutants of AnkG-GFP failed to cluster at the AIS of hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the L1-family members (Nfasc and/or Nr-CAM) or other potential ANK repeats site 2/3 binding targets may play a role in anchoring AnkG at the AIS.

Gene duplications as well as alternative splicing have generated much functional diversity of ankyrins in various tissues in vertebrates. However, the N-terminal 24 ANK repeats of ankyrins have remained essentially the same for at least 500 million years (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, the membrane targets for ankyrins have expanded greatly in respond to physiological needs (e.g., fast signaling in neurons and heart muscles in mammals) throughout evolution, and these membrane targets almost invariably bind to the 24 ANK repeats of ankyrins. Intriguingly, among about a dozen ankyrin-binding membrane targets identified to date (see review by <a href=\"#bib7\">Bennett and Healy, 2009</a>) and those characterized in this study, the ankyrin-binding sequences of these targets are highly diverse. It has been unclear how the extremely conserved ANK repeats can specifically bind to such a diverse set of target sequences. Additionally, it is mechanistically unclear why the membrane targets instead of ANK repeats have undergone amino acid sequence changes in respond to functional diversification in higher vertebrates during evolution. The structure of the entire 24 ANK repeats in complex with an auto-inhibitory domain, together with the structure of part of ANK repeats in complex with its binding domain of Nav1.2, begin to offer insights into the issues above."

We identified three distinct target binding sites in the first 14 repeats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This is in agreement with earlier studies showing that three to five ANK repeats can form a stable structural unit capable of recognizing certain target sequences (<a href=\"#bib50\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tamaskovic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we predict that the last 10 ANK repeats of ankyrins can contain an additional two to three target binding sites. Importantly, the target binding sites on ANK repeats behave rather independently, as mutations/disruptions of interactions in each site do not lead to large perturbations in the interactions in the neighboring sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Equal importantly, the ANK repeats targets bind to the inner groove with extended conformations, and the segments responsible for binding to each site do not seem to cooperate with each other (i.e., an alteration in one segment does not have a large impact on the neighboring segments) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Therefore, the multiple target binding sites on ANK repeats are quasi-independent."

One can envision that such combinatorial usage of multiple quasi-independent sites can in principle generate a large repertoire of binding targets with different sequences for ANK repeats. Although a number of ion channels use site 1 as the common binding site, the amino acid sequences of the corresponding site 1-binding peptide segments are rather diverse (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). One can expect that the sequences of target peptide segments responsible for binding to sites 2 and 3 will be even more diverse (e.g., the corresponding site 3 binding sequence of AnkR_AS and Nav1.2 ABD_N have no detectable sequence similarity), as the interactions in these two sites are more hydrophobic in nature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). The combinatorial usage of the quasi-independent sites, together with the low sequence specificity of each binding site as well as the structural plasticity of the ANK repeat solenoid (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2006</a>), indicate that ANK repeats can have large capacities in binding to numerous membrane targets with diverse sequences. In light of the above points, unidentified ANK repeat binding proteins will likely be difficult to predict simply based on amino acid sequences, although a firm conclusion awaits detailed characterizations of more ankyrin binding targets."

It is possible such a combinatorial target binding strategy may be a common feature for many other elongated repeat-containing proteins in diverse living organisms. The combinatorial multi-site interaction mode may also be advantageous for efficient regulation of ANK repeats/target interactions. By spreading a target binding to multiple sites along the ANK repeats inner groove that are not directly coupled, each binding site can be regulated independently and in a graded fashion. This might allow multiple regulatory signals to be integrated in a combinatorial manner to regulate ankyrin/membrane target interactions. Such a graded regulatory mechanism can be important for ankyrins to respond to various signal inputs when multiple membrane targets co-exist. For example, AnkG co-exists with Nfasc and sodium and potassium channels at the AIS (<a href=\"#bib41\">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Le Bras et al., 2013</a>), and the components of the AnkG-mediated complex at the AIS can undergo distinct activity-dependent changes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kuba et al., 2010</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib44\">Kole and Stuart, 2012)</a> and exhibit AIS plasticity during development (<a href=\"#bib22\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gutzmann et al., 2014</a>). It has been reported that Nfasc and sodium channels can undergo activity-dependent phosphorylation in their ANK repeat binding domains (<a href=\"#bib25\">Garver et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Whittard et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brechet et al., 2008</a>), which may underlie the distinct patterns of concentration gradients and their activity-dependent changes along the AIS."

In contrast, most, if not all, currently identified ANK repeat-binding segments of ankyrin's membrane targets are either shown or predicted to be unstructured before binding to ankyrins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</a>). Such unstructured sequences are more tolerant of mutations as alterations are likely to have a minimal impact on the overall folding of proteins harboring them. Additionally, the conformational malleability is also advantageous for these unstructured peptide sequences to bind to ANK repeats with a molded groove. Since ANK repeats of ankyrins are responsible for binding to numerous targets with diverse sequences, it is likely that there is evolutionary pressure against random mutations in the ANK repeat sequences (the residues in the inner groove in particular). The core function of the ankyrin/spectrin duo in patterning membrane micro-domains has remained unchanged throughout evolution, and thus the amino acid sequences of ANK repeats and the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrins are highly conserved (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2012</a>).

Since the three isoforms of ankyrins have distinct physiological functions, highly variable sequences outside the extremely conserved ANK repeats and spectrin-binding domain likely play critical roles in determining the cellular functions of each ankyrin isoform. Finally, proteins with extended ANK repeat domains (e.g., TRP channels, elongation factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, and various scaffold proteins) may also interact with diverse partners via combinatorial uses of multiple, quasi-independent binding sites and thus are particularly suited as adaptors for assembling macromolecular complexes with broad cellular functions."

Since the AS peptide contains three Met residues, the building of the AS structure was guided by the Se-anomalous difference map as the reference (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Each asymmetric unit contains one ANK repeats/AS molecule. The model was refined against the Se-Met dataset of ANK repeats/AS in PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2002</a>). COOT (<a href=\"#bib19\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>) was used for model rebuilding and adjustments. In the final stage, an additional TLS refinement was performed in PHENIX. The initial phase of the Nav1.2_ABD-C/AnkB_repeats_R1\u20139 complex was determined by molecular replacement using the different repeat regions of the ANK repeats structure as the search models. The Nav1.2_ABD-C peptide was further built into the model. The model was refined using the same strategy as that used for ANK repeats/AS. The model qualities were checked by MolProbity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Davis et al., 2007</a>). The final refinement statistics are listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>.

Ankyrin is key protein in assembly of specific membrane complexes and in connecting membrane and cytoskeletal components. The authors solve the structure of the full 24-repeat ankyrin array, a challenging target that has been elusive for many years. To do this, the authors attach recognition sequences to one end of the ankyrin domain in cis. For two different target fusions, diffraction quality crystals were obtained, and structures solved. The structures nicely suggest autoinhibition of AnkR, and guides mutagenesis of potential binding sites for peptides from membrane protein targets."

The current mode of interaction involves an extended polypetide that binds to an elongated groove under the beta-hairpin, and appears to represent a mode by which ankyrin domains can recognize intrinsically disordered regions of targets."

Along these lines, the motivation for switching to fluorescence-based affinity assays from ITC part way through the manuscript is unclear. One of the best motivations would be to measure lower affinity interactions, though this advantage seems not to be used to determine the \u201cND\u201d interactions from ITC. Note it is unclear that wild-type ANK R-AS fluorescence affinity is well determined. It is quite near the saturation limit, and there appears to be little data defining the saturated baseline."

In the case of Nav1.2 binding, R1-6 binds to the C-terminal half of the Nav1.2_ABD (ankyrin binding domain) and R11-14 binds to N-terminal half of Nav1.2_ABD. AnkB_repeats R7-10 is not involved in the Nav1.2 binding. In addition, isolated R1-6 is stable and binds to the C-terminal half of the Nav1.2_ABD with a reasonable affinity (Kd \u223c2.3 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), supporting that R1-6 can function as a structural unit for Nav1.2 binding. Thus, one can naturally divide AnkB_repeats R1-14 into three parts, as the middle part is not used for binding. Such division is further supported by the binding data of Nfsac to AnkB_repeats R1-14. Neither the mutations in nor the truncation of R1-6 had any impact on AnkB_repeats R1-14\u2019s binding to Nfasc. Isolated R1-6 has no detectable binding to Nfasc. Thus, Nfasc binds to the R7-14 of AnkB_repeats, and the site-1 is not operational for this binding."

However, obvious differences exist even in these short ankyrin repeats/target interactions. First, the orientation of peptide is reversed in ANKRA2/HDAC4 and RFXANK/RFX5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1A</a>).

Because of such complications, we switched to the ITC-based method due to its label-free nature, and the majority of our binding data shown in the manuscript are based on ITC-derived measurements. Nonetheless, a large body of binding measurements derived from FITC-based assay is still valid, and chose a subset of the data to present in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>.
