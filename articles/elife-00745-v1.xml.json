                    "text": "Nucleocytoplasmic transport is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded in the nuclear envelope. About 30 different proteins (nucleoporins, nups) arrange around a central eightfold rotational axis to build the modular NPC. Nup188 and Nup192 are related and evolutionary conserved, large nucleoporins that are part of the NPC scaffold. Here we determine the structure of Nup188. The protein folds into an extended stack of helices where an N-terminal 130 kDa segment forms an intricate closed ring, while the C-terminal region is a more regular, superhelical structure. Overall, the structure has distant similarity with flexible S-shaped nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). Intriguingly, like NTRs, both Nup188 and Nup192 specifically bind FG-repeats and are able to translocate through NPCs by facilitated diffusion. This blurs the existing dogma of a clear distinction between stationary nups and soluble NTRs and suggests an evolutionary relationship between the NPC and the soluble nuclear transport machinery."

About 30 different proteins (nucleoporins, nups) arrange around a central eightfold rotational axis to build the modular NPC. Nup188 and Nup192 are related and evolutionary conserved, large nucleoporins that are part of the NPC scaffold. Here we determine the structure of Nup188. The protein folds into an extended stack of helices where an N-terminal 130 kDa segment forms an intricate closed ring, while the C-terminal region is a more regular, superhelical structure. Overall, the structure has distant similarity with flexible S-shaped nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). Intriguingly, like NTRs, both Nup188 and Nup192 specifically bind FG-repeats and are able to translocate through NPCs by facilitated diffusion. This blurs the existing dogma of a clear distinction between stationary nups and soluble NTRs and suggests an evolutionary relationship between the NPC and the soluble nuclear transport machinery."

They found that Nup188 has a structure that consists of stacked helices and is more flexible than other nups. Moreover, its structure was very similar to those of soluble nuclear transport receptors, and this led Andersen et al. to investigate whether Nup188 also had similar functional features."

                        "text": "Nucleocytoplasmic transport across the nuclear envelope is controlled and facilitated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), very large, modular protein assemblies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Brohawn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Capelson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aitchison and Rout, 2012</a>). NPCs are positioned in circular openings within the nuclear envelope, generated by the fusion of inner and outer nuclear membrane. About 30 different proteins, collectively called nucleoporins or nups, make up an NPC. These nups are arranged around a central eightfold rotational symmetry axis along the central pore opening. Cryo-electronmicroscopic (EM) studies have shown that the principal architecture of the NPC is conserved among all eukaryotes, however metazoan NPCs are more elaborate and have additional features compared to single cell organisms, explaining in part substantially different size estimates for the assembly (60\u2013120 MDa vs 40\u201350 MDa) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Reichelt et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alber et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Brohawn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Grossman et al., 2012</a>). The entire structure is built around a central, donut-shaped scaffold, with prominent extensions that distinguish both the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic faces of the NPC. The center of the NPC is thought to be filled by unstructured, highly repetitive protein extensions characterized by phenylalanine-glycine dipeptides (FG repeats), which are found in \u223c1/3 of all nups (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rout et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Cronshaw et al., 2002</a>). FG repeats are critical for NPC function and allow for selective passage of transport cargos that are bound to soluble nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) (<a href=\"#bib30\">G\u00f6rlich and Kutay, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Weis, 2003</a>). The mechanistic details of how FG repeats contribute to NPC selectivity remain somewhat controversial, however, it has been firmly established that all soluble NTRs specifically bind to FG-repeat domains and that interactions between NTRs and FG repeats are critical for nucleocytoplasmic transport. The central scaffold of the NPC donut structure is formed by approximately 15\u201320 nups that are organized into four major subcomplexes. These are the Y- (or Nup84) complex, the Ndc1 complex, the Nsp1 complex, and the Nic96 complex. The Y-complex is essential for NPC biogenesis and has been well characterized. It contains seven universally conserved proteins that form a highly branched, Y-shaped structure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lutzmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kampmann and Blobel, 2009</a>). Currently \u223c90% of the complex has been elucidated in crystallographic detail (<a href=\"#bib13\">Berke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Brohawn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Brohawn and Schwartz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Leksa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Whittle and Schwartz, 2009</a>). From this analysis it is evident that the structural elements, and also their interactions are shared with vesicle coats, specifically the outer coat of COPII vesicles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Devos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Brohawn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Onischenko and Weis, 2011</a>). The Ndc1 complex contains proteins thought to anchor the NPC in the highly-curved pore membrane (<a href=\"#bib53\">Onischenko et al., 2009</a>). The Nsp1 complex is built from three coiled-coil proteins, each with prominent FG-repeats. The Nsp1 complex is centrally located in the NPC, with the FG-repeats contributing to the selective transport barrier (<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00fclsmann et al., 2012</a>), and the coiled-coil moiety functioning as a bridge to the other NPC scaffold units (<a href=\"#bib31\">Grandi et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bailer et al., 2001</a>)."

To obtain structural information for these two related proteins, we set out to crystallize Nup188. We succeeded in solving the structures of two fragments, together covering 85% of the 202 kDa full-length protein. Nup188 is a stacked helical protein with intrinsic flexibility. Interestingly, a structural comparison reveals similarity between Nup188 and NTRs. Moreover, we can show that both Nup188 and Nup192 specifically bind to FG-repeats and translocate across NPCs by facilitated diffusion. These findings blur the line between the strict separation of soluble NTRs and stationary nups, question some of the current models of FG-repeat organization, and suggest that the NPC and the soluble transport machinery are evolutionary related."

Although the <i>Mt</i> homolog behaved better in vitro, it did not yield crystals of the full-length protein. Using a series of truncation constructs, generated through a combination of limited proteolysis, phylogenetic analysis and structure prediction, we were able to obtain crystals of two major parts of <i>Mt</i>Nup188. The N-terminal fragment (Nup188N) includes residues 1\u20131160 and its structure was solved to 2.65 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

They fold into a large right-handed superhelical ring that resembles a lock washer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although the overall structure has a general repeat pattern and is built around 2-helix (HEAT repeat), and 3-helix (ARM-repeat) elements, several distinct details specific to Nup188 make it a rather unique protein. We can discern an inner ring of helices forming the concave surface and an outer ring of helices forming the convex surface creating three distinct subdomains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The first subdomain consists of 15 helices that are arranged in irregular orientations without an obvious repeat pattern. Next, helices \u03b116\u201325 make up subdomain II and are organized around three HEAT repeats (\u03b116/17, \u03b118/19, \u03b122-23). Helix \u03b123 protrudes from the molecule and is sandwiched between helices \u03b124 and \u03b125, such that they are splayed apart at a 90\u00b0 angle. In consequence, the helical stack pattern is interrupted. Subdomain III includes helices \u03b126 to \u03b152 and is structured around the second helical stack element, pivoted against subdomain II. It has 10 helical repeats of both the HEAT and the ARM type and forms two curved layers of helices. Between helix \u03b132 and \u03b133, we find a \u03b2-stranded insertion with structural homology to Src-homology (SH3) domains (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The Nup188N ring structure is closed by four helices (\u03b110\u2013\u03b113) from subdomain I that latch onto a complementary surface created by helices \u03b144, \u03b146 and \u03b147. The interface is mixed in character, with van der Waals contacts as well as polar and ionic interactions. In total, the latch covers an 1511 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> interface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

The domain is arranged in five anti-parallel \u03b2-strands that fold into a \u03b2-barrel, characteristic for the SH3 protein family (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction of Nup188 from a broadly diverged range of species indicate that all Nup188 orthologs contain this SH3-like domain and that the position within the protein is conserved (data not shown). In contrast to canonical SH3 domains, the SH3-like domain in Nup188 has a different \u03b2-strand topology, which represents a circular permutation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). SH3 domains are protein interaction domains known to predominantly bind proline-rich peptides (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ren et al., 1993</a>), although non-consensus ligands have also been found in recent years (<a href=\"#bib60\">Saksela and Permi, 2012</a>). The surface residues typically involved in peptide binding in previously characterized SH3 domains are not present in Nup188. Instead Nup188 has a different set of residues that are conserved between Nup188 orthologs. This conservation suggests that Nup188 also binds a specific protein or peptide motif, but it most likely does not interact with known SH3 targets."

The first helical pair (\u03b11 and \u03b12) forms a HEAT repeat followed by 5 ARM repeats. The inner face of the structure is built from helices \u03b12, \u03b15, \u03b18, \u03b112, \u03b115, and \u03b119. The C-terminal helix \u03b119 caps the structure. At the N terminus, helices \u03b11 and \u03b12 expose a hydrophobic surface, which strongly suggests that the full-length protein continues in a stacked pattern. This hydrophobic surface engages in a twofold symmetric crystal packing contact with a neighboring Nup188C molecule resulting in a horseshoe-shaped dimer. Because this contact is generated by a protein truncation, we suggest that it is a crystal artifact and not physiologically relevant. Similar packing contacts are frequently observed with truncated, stacked helical proteins. Interestingly, the two Nup188C copies in the asymmetrical unit have a different curvature, likely reflecting the intrinsic flexibility of the molecule (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

To start, secondary structure prediction suggests that the segment folds into 10 helices. Furthermore, the adjacent ends of both crystallized fragments, Nup188N and Nup188C, are regular repeats, therefore we reasoned that the missing segment very likely forms five helical pairs connecting the two parts into one continuous superhelical element (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This assumption is supported by 3D comparisons of the crystallized fragments with published structures of other stacked helical proteins. For both fragments we find superposable helical proteins in the PDB that extend in a repeat pattern further into the space where we expect the missing residues of Nup188 to be positioned. The assumption of a continuous helical structure is also supported by limited proteolysis experiments. Although <i>Mt</i>Nup188 is cut in numerous positions, the resulting fragments still behave like the full-length protein in a gel filtration experiment (data not shown)."

The most regular part of Nup188N is subdomain III, which was found to be structurally similar to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). A shared core of helical repeats superimposes with an RMSD of 3.6 \u00c5 to importin-\u03b1 (276 C-\u03b1 positions) and 4.5 \u00c5 to importin-\u03b2 (263 C-\u03b1 positions), respectively.

We first set out to examine whether Nup188 and Nup192 share the unifying feature of all NTRs and interact with nucleoporin FG-repeats. <i>Mt</i>Nup188, <i>Mt</i>Nup192, importin \u03b2 from <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> (<i>Sc</i>Kap95) or 3xGFP were incubated with a selection of immobilized budding yeast FG-repeat domains and the interactions were monitored in pulldown experiments. To control for binding specificity all proteins were pre-mixed with excess bacterial extract proteins (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The panel of FG-repeat regions included Nup116(348\u2013458), Nup100(1\u2013310) and Nup100(1\u2013610) representing GLFG-type repeats, and Nsp1(1\u2013603) representing FXFG-type repeats (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamada et al., 2010</a>). In addition, we included the Nup116(348\u2013458) 10xFA mutant, which lacks the key phenylalanine residues necessary for binding to NTRs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bayliss et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Patel et al., 2007</a>). As expected, <i>Sc</i>Kap95 was firmly enriched (10-fold to 40-fold over bulk bacterial extract proteins) on both types of wild-type FG-repeat regions. This interaction was highly specific since <i>Sc</i>Kap95 did not bind to the Nup116(348\u2013458)10xFA mutant and no interaction between FG-coated beads and 3xGFP could be detected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Of note, <i>Sc</i>Kap95 was efficiently eluted with 1M NaCl from all the FG-coated beads consistent with the relatively weak interaction between <i>Sc</i>Kap95 and FG-repeat regions (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pyhtila and Rexach, 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

We therefore conclude that both these nucleoporins can specifically bind to the FG-repeats in vitro and behave like the NTR <i>Sc</i>Kap95 in this assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). The only notable deviation from the FG-binding pattern was observed with <i>Mt</i>Nup188, which was relatively inefficiently eluted with 1M NaCl from Nup100(1\u2013310) and Nup100(1\u2013610), suggesting that <i>Mt</i>Nup188 either interacts with these FG-repeat regions more tightly than <i>Sc</i>Kap95 or that these interactions are more hydrophobic in nature (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

We followed the nuclear accumulation kinetics of each protein and calculated initial nuclear translocation rates by fitting each set of kinetic data to a single exponential decay function (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, see also \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). While both nucleoporins translocated slower than YFP-<i>Hs</i>Importin-\u03b2, their translocation rates exceeded the values of 3xGFP by at least 30-fold indicating that both proteins indeed cross the NPCs in a facilitated manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The digitonin permeabilization protocol does not remove all endogenous NTRs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nachury and Weis, 1999</a>). To test whether the nuclear translocation rates of <i>Mt</i>Nup188 or <i>Mt</i>Nup192 can be enhanced by the removal of endogenous NTRs that remain tightly associated with NPCs we performed similar analyses with nuclei that were pre-treated with RanGTP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nachury and Weis, 1999</a>). While we saw an increase in the YFP-<i>Mt</i>Nup188 translocation rate, no effect on YFP-<i>Mt</i>Nup192 was observed. Under these conditions the translocation kinetics of <i>Mt</i>Nup188 and <i>Mt</i>Nup192 were approximately equal, but still about fourfold below the values for YFP-<i>Hs</i>Importin-\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that the slower nuclear translocation rates of <i>Mt</i>Nup188 and <i>Mt</i>Nup192 are intrinsic properties of these two proteins. Interestingly, both <i>Mt</i>Nup188 and <i>Mt</i>Nup192, unlike <i>Hs</i>Importin-\u03b2 accumulated within nuclei in the absence of exogenous energy without reaching notable saturation during the time frame of our experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Furthermore, both proteins continued to accumulate in nuclei even after subsequent 10-fold dilution, suggesting that they have strong intranuclear binding sites (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In summary, these results demonstrate that <i>Mt</i>Nup188 and <i>Mt</i>Nup192 share functional characteristics with NTRs and translocate across NPCs by facilitated diffusion without a requirement for other cytosolic factors."

                        "text": "The analysis of the largest universally conserved nucleoporin Nup188, which we present here, fills the last gap in the inventory of architectural nucleoporin structures. We find that the topology of Nup188 is distinctly different from all other scaffold nups, except for the related paralog Nup192, in that it appears to be inherently flexible. Negative stain EM analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) reveals that the stacked helical domain can adopt a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation seen in the crystal, but that the protein can also \u2018open\u2019 up. A similar degree of flexibility was recently also observed for Nup192 by negative stain EM analysis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Flemming et al., 2012</a>). Other, mainly helical scaffold nucleoporins contain elements that prevent such flexibility. For instance, the ACE1 class of nucleoporins (Nic96, Nup84, Nup85, Nup145C) share a distinct foldback architecture where a string of helices latches onto the core helical stack, thereby prohibiting the bending of neighboring helical elements (<a href=\"#bib16\">Brohawn et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2009</a>). Three conserved scaffold nups (Nup120, Nup133, Nup170) share a topology where an N-terminal \u03b2-propeller is linked to a C-terminal helical stack domain. For each of these three nucleoporins there is structural evidence that stretches within the helical elements are somewhat flexible, but likely not to the extent that is observed for Nup188 and Nup192 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Whittle and Schwartz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bilokapic and Schwartz, 2012</a>). How does this exceptional flexibility shape the functional role of Nup188 and Nup192? Based on current data, we can only speculate. It is conceivable that structural changes within these large nups are critical during the assembly and biosynthesis of the NPC. Alternatively, plasticity of Nup188, Nup192, and the Nic96 complex as a whole, may be important for the nuclear transport function of the NPC, for example, by accommodating large soluble cargos or regulating the translocation of inner nuclear membrane proteins."

                        "text": "Although Nup188 and Nup192 are paralogous proteins with very similar structural arrangements, they have acquired distinct functions during evolution. For instance, the depletion of Nup188 was shown to increase the size limit for the transport of inner nuclear membrane proteins, but this was not observed upon removal of Nup205 (the Nup192 homolog in vertebrates) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Theerthagiri et al., 2010</a>). Our structure unexpectedly shows that Nup188 contains an SH3-like domain, but a similar domain cannot be detected in Nup192. Whether this SH3-like domain contributes to the functional diversification of these two large nups in transmembrane transport is currently unknown and is an interesting question for future studies. SH3 domains are generally involved in protein-protein interactions but the typical residues needed for the interaction with known SH3 substrates, are not conserved in Nup188. Therefore, it will be important to identify the binding partners of the SH3-like domain in Nup188 and to directly test whether this domain functions, for example, in the transport of transmembrane cargos."

                        "text": "So far, soluble NTRs and scaffold nucleoporins were considered to be functionally and evolutionarily separated groups of proteins that were already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor each very likely originating from relatively few ancestor proteins through multiple gene duplication events (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mans et al., 2004</a>). Intriguingly, our crystallographic analysis revealed that Nup188 is structurally related to NTRs. Moreover, single particle EM analysis showed that both Nup188 and its paralog, Nup192, resemble the overall shapes of NTRs and display exceptional flexibility characteristic for NTRs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Conti et al., 2006</a>). However, the structural similarity is rather general and not specific to a particular NTR. Following the entire 202 kDa structure, one finds a patchwork of 10\u201340 kDa substructures that are closer related to one NTR vs another. Based on the structure alone it is not possible to conclude a common phylogenetic origin; too many proteins involved in diverse protein\u2013protein interactions adopt stacked helical domains and these domains likely have evolved multiple times throughout evolution (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aravind et al., 2006</a>). We therefore tested whether Nup188 and Nup192 have functional similarities with NTRs. All known NTRs bind FG-repeats, typically exhibiting various binding sites dispersed over their surface (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bednenko et al., 2003</a>). Intriguingly, both Nup188 and the related Nup192 directly and specifically bind to FG-repeats (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Furthermore, both Nup188 as well as Nup192 can translocate across intact NPCs in vitro, again recapitulating the behavior of NTRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). By contrast, we do not observe RanGTP binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), another characteristic of the importin\u2013\u03b2 family of NTRs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Floer and Blobel, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chook and Blobel, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Cook et al., 2007</a>). Unlike the FG-binding pockets, the RanGTP interaction site is much larger and sequence-conserved, thus easier to recognize. Neither Nup188 nor Nup192 show surface conservation consistent with Ran binding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cook et al., 2007</a>). Yet, the combination of shared FG-binding activity, common NPC translocation properties combined and general structural similarity make it tempting to speculate that Nup188, Nup192 and NTRs, indeed, might have a common evolutionary origin. This blurs the line of a strict functional separation between nucleoporins and NTRs, and allows for a number of interesting hypotheses. Could it be that the ancestral NPC had only a few core nucleoporins, from which NTRs evolved to become the separate, \u2018soluble phase\u2019? Or alternatively, could some soluble NTRs or shuttling cargos have evolved to bind tightly to the original NPC membrane coat and become part of the architectural scaffold?"

                        "text": "The finding that architectural nucleoporins bind FG-repeats and display NTR-like properties, raises the question of the biological function of these properties. Once incorporated into NPCs Nup188 and Nup192 are unlikely to shuttle across the nuclear envelope. The very low mobility of their common binding partner, Nup93 in vertebrate NPCs and an exceptionally slow protein turnover suggest that both proteins are very stable NPC components (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rabut et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Savas et al., 2012</a>). However, the NTR-like activity of Nup188 and Nup192 could be critical for de novo NPC biosynthesis during interphase nuclear growth in higher eukaryotes or in organisms, which undergo a closed mitosis when new NPCs assemble de novo into the intact nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#bib23\">D\u2019Angelo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Menendez-Benito et al., 2013</a>). Interphase NPC assembly seems to rely on steps that occur on both the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope and thus nuclear translocation of NPC components through already existing pores might be critical for new NPC assembly in intact nuclei. Another possibility is that FG-scaffold interactions are important for the structural integrity of the NPC by enabling connections between subcomplexes. Interactions within specific subcomplexes have been studied extensively and are rather well characterized. In contrast, the interaction between subcomplexes is much more poorly understood, and it remains unclear how subcomplexes come together to assemble into the oligomeric NPC ring structure. Interestingly, the ability to interact with FG-repeats may extend to other scaffold nucleoporins as well. Nic96 and its vertebrate ortholog, Nup93 bind GLFG-type domains in vitro (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schrader et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Xu and Powers, 2013</a>). Furthermore, budding yeast scaffold nucleoporins can be biochemically purified together with NTRs from yeast extracts using FG-repeat regions as a bait (<a href=\"#bib5\">Allen et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, the interactions between FG-repeats and scaffold nups could possibly be part of the glue that holds the NPC scaffold together."

FG domain interactions with scaffold Nups could connect FG-repeat regions to the wall of the NPC questioning models in which FG-repeats function exclusively within the central channel of the NPC to mediate nuclear transport. Future experiments will be needed to test these models and to characterize the role of the FG-scaffold interactions in NPC biogenesis, structure or function."

Out of 23 possible sites SHELXC/D/E (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sheldrick, 2010</a>) found 22 selenium sites, which were refined in Phaser-EP (<a href=\"#bib45\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>). An interpretable map was obtained after density modification using Parrot in the CCP4 suite (<a href=\"#bib68\">Winn et al., 2011</a>). After most of the model was built, native data was used for the final rounds of model building and refinement using Coot (<a href=\"#bib26\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and Phenix (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). Five loops (residue 85\u201391, 447\u2013459, 673\u2013682, 886\u2013902, 963\u2013970) and the very C-terminal 11 residues could not be built, due to poorly defined electron density. The structure of Nup188C was also solved using SAD phases from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal. All three possible sites of both molecules in the asymmetric unit were found using <i>phenix.autosol</i>. In the initial solvent-flattened electron density map several helices of both Nup188C molecules were well defined and could be built. In general, one copy of Nup188C is better defined then the other, presumably because of tighter crystal packing. Phases were improved by combining SAD phases with model phases using Phaser-EP. Even though the overall structure is similar, both Nup188C molecules were built independently, without using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The conformation between both molecules is different enough, that NCS was not beneficial even in the early rounds of refinement. The structure is complete except for three loops (residues 1495\u20131509, 1534\u20131538, 1705\u20131720) and the very C-terminal four residues, all of which are poorly defined in the electron density map.

The fluorescence intensity inside each nucleus and the average background fluorescence intensity were determined for both the YFP/GFP and TRITC channels. The intranuclear to extranuclear ratios were then calculated giving normalized fluorescence intensities for both the protein of interest and the dextran. All nuclei with normalized dextran fluorescence ratio greater than 0.3 were considered to be \u2018non-intact\u2019 (permeable to the dextran) and rejected. Only \u2018intact\u2019 nuclei were subject to further analysis (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For time-lapse experiments, the time-dependent normalized fluorescence intensity of the protein of interest was determined for each nucleus and then fit to a single exponential curve, <i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>A</i>*(1\u2212exp[<i>k</i>*<i>t</i>])+<i>C</i>, where <i>A</i>, <i>k</i>, and <i>C</i> are fit parameters, and <i>t</i> is time. The initial rate of nuclear accumulation is given by the time derivative at <i>t</i> = 0 (i.e., \u2212<i>Ak</i>)."

In line with that, it had been previously demonstrated that saturation with importins also lowers the passive exclusion limit of authentic NPCs (Mohr, 2009) or of pure FG domain systems (Frey, 2009; Jovanovic-Talisman, 2009).

They are, however, fully consistent with the previous discussion of Schrader (2008) and models that assume that FG domains form a barrier by the formation of physical meshes. It is now very nice to see that the scaffold of the NPC contributes directly to such mesh formation."

More likely explanations are volume exclusion effects and the introduction of additional meshes into the permeability barrier, caused by the multivalent FG-importin interactions. In line with that, it had been previously demonstrated that saturation with importins also lowers the passive exclusion limit of authentic NPCs (Mohr, 2009) or of pure FG domain systems (Frey, 2009; Jovanovic-Talisman, 2009).

To address points 5 and 6, we have reworded the text, and now only conclude (a) that the inhibition by WGA and importin beta demonstrates that MtNup188 and MtNup192 translocate through the NPC, and (b) that MtNup188 and MtNup192 are too large to translocate through the NPC by simple passive diffusion."

They are, however, fully consistent with the previous discussion of Schrader (2008) and models that assume that FG domains form a barrier by the formation of physical meshes. It is now very nice to see that the scaffold of the NPC contributes directly to such mesh formation</i>."
