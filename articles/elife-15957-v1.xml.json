This tale, by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, is strangely similar to a parasitic infection but with an important twist. Schistosomes are a type of parasitic flatworm, or fluke, and inhabit a site in the human body that is inhospitable to most other parasites \u2013 the blood. Yet instead of succumbing to our immune cells, the flukes can dwell in the bloodstream for many years. The fluke\u2019s outer surface, or tegument, is key to its success as a long-lived parasite. The tegument clothes the entire adult fluke and hides its most vulnerable tissues from the prying eyes of the immune system. As such, it is us as human hosts (and not the flukes) who are fooled by the parasites\u2019 remarkable \u201cclothes\u201d."

Now they build on this discovery to show that these stem cells are biased towards generating new cells for the tegument and presumably replenish tissue at the host-parasite interface that has been damaged.

However, Collins et al. also inferred that genes that were down-regulated only at the later time point would instead most likely represent genes that are active in cells that rely on the stem cells in some way. For example, these genes might be active in tissues that\u00a0must be replenished by new cells that develop from the stem cells."

Many of the DIS genes encode for proteins that are expressed in the tegument (<a href=\"#bib1\">Braschi and Wilson, 2006</a>). Indeed, many of the proteins encoded by DIS genes show promise as vaccines in animal models of schistosomiasis, and a small number of them are in early phase clinical development and trials (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hotez et al., 2010</a>)."

Their work reveals how the schistosome tegument undergoes constant stem cell-mediated regeneration, a process that likely allows this highly evolved parasite to evade our best attempts to eradicate it. Future work might focus on methods by which to interrupt this regeneration process via drugs and/or vaccines. Indeed, praziquantel \u2013 a widely used drug for schistosomiasis \u2013 acts by destroying the tegument and revealing the vulnerable tissues underneath that can be attacked by the immune system in some individuals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Mutapi et al., 2013</a>). Understanding the natural processes of tegument regeneration will accelerate the development of new control strategies that are urgently required for some of the world\u2019s most impoverished and under-served populations."
