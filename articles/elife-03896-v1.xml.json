Cocultures of <i>Aplysia</i> sensory and motor neurons were trained with spaced pulses of serotonin, which induces long-term facilitation.  Serotonin (5HT) triggered growth of new presynaptic varicosities, a synaptic mechanism of long-term sensitization.  Following 5HT training, two antimnemonic treatments-reconsolidation blockade and inhibition of PKM-caused the number of presynaptic varicosities to revert to the original, pretraining value.  Surprisingly, the final synaptic structure was not achieved by targeted retraction of the 5HT-induced varicosities but, rather, by an apparently arbitrary retraction of both 5HT-induced and original synapses.  In addition, we find evidence that the LTM for sensitization persists covertly after its apparent elimination by the same antimnemonic treatments that erase learning-related synaptic growth.  These results challenge the idea that stable synapses store long-term memories."
