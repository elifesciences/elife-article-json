This is a serious limitation in important areas, including the phenotypic screening of human genes in transgenic mice by study of embryos undergoing advanced organogenesis. We have built an optical lens system for 3D imaging of objects up to 6 mm wide and 3 mm thick with depth resolution of only a few microns instead of the tens of microns currently attained, allowing sub-cellular detail to be resolved throughout the volume. We present this lens, called the Mesolens, with performance data and images from biological specimens including confocal images of whole fixed and intact fluorescently-stained 12.5-day old mouse embryos."

This is a serious limitation in important areas, including the phenotypic screening of human genes in transgenic mice by study of embryos undergoing advanced organogenesis. We have built an optical lens system for 3D imaging of objects up to 6 mm wide and 3 mm thick with depth resolution of only a few microns instead of the tens of microns currently attained, allowing sub-cellular detail to be resolved throughout the volume. We present this lens, called the Mesolens, with performance data and images from biological specimens including confocal images of whole fixed and intact fluorescently-stained 12.5-day old mouse embryos."

(<a href=\"#bib14\">White et al., 1987</a>). In specimens such as mouse embryos at the 10\u201312.5 day stage, when the major organs are developing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kaufman, 1992</a>), it was impossible to see individual cells in the interior despite the lateral (XY) resolution being sufficient. Since then, stitching and tiling of large datasets has proved to be possible using computer-controlled specimen stages, but this results in a checker board pattern in the final image due to inhomogeneity of illumination and focus height errors which often cannot be corrected by software. Commercial and open source software algorithms are available to perform stitching and tiling but inhomogeneities and problems with dataset registration are clearly visible (<a href=\"#bib5\">Legesse et al., 2015</a>). Because of the continuous scanning laser spot that we use with the Mesolens, we do not observe differences in fluorescence signal from one region of the image to another unless it is present in the specimen."

                        "text": "More recently, methods to expand the tissue volume using synthetic polymers have been demonstrated, increasing the size of the sub-micron sized structures until they can be imaged by an ordinary low-magnification, low-resolution lens, but this inevitably results in some tissue distortion (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). We decided that what was needed was a 4x magnification lens with an N.A. of approximately 0.5, rather than the 0.1 or 0.2 currently available, to support imaging with sub-cellular resolution through the entire specimen. Off-the-shelf lenses with the right characteristics, for example camera lenses, which could be adapted for microscopy by placing the specimen in the plane intended for the camera sensor and forming a x4 image in what would normally be the object space, were found to be unsuitable because of poor aberration correction including high field curvature, particularly when focused deeply into specimens immersed in fluid. The most successful attempt with a camera lens has been made recently by Zheng, Ou and Yang (<a href=\"#bib16\">Zheng et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ou et al., 2016</a>)\u00a0who used a high-quality Pentax TV lens with an N.A. of approximately 0.3 to produce an image of a 10\u2009mm diameter field with a lateral resolution of 1.56 \u00b5m. For samples such as a 10\u00a0day old mouse embryo, which is 2\u20133\u2009mm thick, however, an immersion lens is needed for optically-sectioned imaging, so that the spherical aberration introduced when imaging from air and through thicker material than the thin coverslip for which the lens is designed does not destroy the optical performance as the light is focused into the specimen. Large-field of view (FOV) water-immersion lenses of great complexity have been developed for photolithography in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, but these work only with monochromatic light (e.g. at a wavelength of 193 nm) and a fixed object distance so they are not useful for biomedical imaging (<a href=\"#bib6\">Matsuyama et al., 2006</a>). Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) can give a very wide field of view image with sub-micron resolution (<a href=\"#bib15\">Zheng et al., 2013b</a>). However, the depth of focus is purposefully large (~0.3\u2009mm) in order to provide a large tolerance to microscope slide placement errors. This very large depth of focus is not suited to confocal laser scanning microscopy, where a small depth of focus is needed for optical sectioning of the imaged specimen. Also, the low N.A. lens used in wide-field FPM is for use in air only. While this is acceptable for thin tissue sections, restriction to air immersion would give dramatic fall-off in axial resolution performance at depth when imaging thick tissues because of spherical aberration, for which there are presently no correction collars or any other means of compensation. Furthermore, as noted by Zheng <i>et al</i>. the current FPM method is not a fluorescence technique. Therefore, while FPM gives high-resolution color images of thin specimens such as pathology slides, it is not suitable for fluorescence imaging of either thin or thick specimens in either 2D or 3D. Fluorescence Talbot microscopy is another method that can provide imaging over a large field of view. This usually involves placing the specimen in direct contact with the imaging sensor (<a href=\"#bib10\">Pang et al., 2013</a>), which, because of the requirement for immersion and mounting of specimens in high-index material, is impractical for thick tissue imaging. The work of Pang <i>et al</i>. overcomes this limitation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Pang et al., 2013</a>), and makes possible imaging of specimens spatially separated from the sensor with fluorescence contrast and an exceptionally wide field of view. However, while the lateral performance is good the reported depth of focus limit of 60 \u00b5m is too large to be useful for optically sectioning of thick tissue volumes. The imaging speed of 23 s of the instrument described by Pang <i>et al</i>. is attractive but the reported unevenness of Talbot spots over an area of 1\u2009mm x 1\u2009mm of 4.73% is very high when compared with both standard wide-field imaging and our wide-field imaging using the Mesolens. Tsai et al. have performed large FOV two-photon microscopy using a commercial low-magnification objective lens (XL Fluor 4X/340, N.A.=0.28, Olympus), but they observe modest depth penetration and low axial resolution of 16 \u00b5m, as expected from the N.A. of the objective (<a href=\"#bib13\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, for objectives designed for multi-photon imaging, the performance (primarily colour correction) at visible wavelengths is poor or unpublished. Serial two-photon tomography can provide very high lateral resolution images of the fluorescent mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib7\">Oh et al., 2014</a>). However, this imaging method requires the tissue to be destroyed because of the microtome sectioning needed and this makes repeat imaging impossible. More importantly, stitching and tiling of multiple datasets is required because of the large diameter of the tissue, and this can result in poor image registration and differences in fluorescence signal from one dataset to another. We finally note that some commercial microscopes are described as capable of imaging the same specimen from the macro-scale to the micro-scale (e.g. AZ100 Multizoom, Nikon) but at the low magnifications that permit imaging of large specimens, the N.A. of these microscopes is low, and thus the performance is as for a low N.A. objective. In this paper we present a cure for this problem. We describe a multi-immersion objective lens for wide-field epi-fluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy with a working distance of over 3\u2009mm and a 6\u2009mm FOV that is corrected for a wide range of wavelengths and demonstrate its advantages with large biological specimens."

Since the depth of field (z resolution) is inversely proportional to the square of the numerical aperture, it rapidly becomes poor for low N.A. lenses. Below N.A.=0.45 the lateral resolution remains tolerable but the axial resolution is no longer sufficient for resolving sub-cellular details (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Another important design parameter was the large working distance, to enable focusing through the embryo which, at 10 days old, is around 3\u2009mm thick. This dictated that the lens elements should be physically large, to accommodate the wide collection angles for light originating at a large distance from the lens."

The Mesolens was designed for immersion into non-corrosive immersion media such as oil (Type DF), water and glycerol. We use BABB only as a mounting medium, and the specimen and BABB are separated from the immersion fluid by a type 1.5 coverslip. This meant providing means to shift lens element groups during use so that adequate correction for spherical and other aberrations could be obtained for the different liquids. In practice, the necessary shift was controlled by two knurled rings on the lens barrel, similarly to a standard microscope objective that corrects for the coverslip thickness or immersion fluid. In addition, a further interchangeable flat compensator plate was incorporated into the design to compensate for spherical aberrations introduced by the different immersion fluids, with a thickness specific to the immersion medium used. The main challenge in our lens design was to achieve the colour correction between 400 nm and 700 nm (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Also, the diverse glass types required all had to be tested for auto-fluorescence, and the precise refractive index of each selected sample had to be ascertained and the lens design adjusted to accommodate the small variations from one melt to another of nominally the same glass."

We used custom mirrors together with a galvo scanner (8360K, Cambridge Technology) which were made from lightweight beryllium and back-thinned to reduce the mass. These mirrors were required to be flat to \u03bb/10 for sufficiently small aberrations. A multi-element scan lens made to our design by Beck Optronic Solutions was used to image the back focal plane of the Mesolens into an aperture of 30\u2009mm diameter.

This is similar to the time needed to image 6\u2009mm x 6\u2009mm using multiple images from a 10x objective with N.A.=0.4 yielding a similar z-resolution, and stitching and tiling them. With our imaging system, however, we circumvent the problems of image alignment. In this case the mirror speed is a mere 92\u2009Hz, which is at the limit of what such large mirrors can achieve. In summary, despite appearance, this imaging system is not slower in data rate than a standard laser scanning confocal microscope.

Plan, Nikon) a light-emitting diode (HLMP-2855, Broadcom) was used as a specimen of standard luminosity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beach and Duling, 1993</a>). The LED was driven at constant current and the intensity was monitored using a photodiode. The specimen was set up with the same CCD camera for the Mesolens in oil-immersion mode and the 4x/0.1\u2009N.A. objective. Using the same exposure time the intensity with the Mesolens was found to be 25x that with the conventional objective, in good agreement with the 4.7 times higher N.A. available from the Mesolens. To measure the optical throughput we compared the laser power immediately after the beam splitter in the periscope (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) with the laser power at the specimen plane at a wavelength of 488 nm, and we measured an on-axis transmission of 11%. A significant loss results from overfilling the top mirror in the periscope, which is required in order to achieve the flattest possible wavefront. There are also additional losses from the scanning mirrors and in the scan lens. Although the optical throughput of a standard microscope objective can be several tens of percent, the transmission of the complete system is more similar to what we measure here. We also note that the transmission value of the complete system is rarely given explicitly by microscope manufacturers but, based on the quoted power of the laser system (e.g. 50 mW for a Krypton-Argon laser operating at a wavelength of 488 nm) and measuring the maximum average power at the specimen plane (e.g. 3 mW after the objective lens), we measure a similar magnitude of optical loss with commercial confocal microscopes compared to the Mesolens. The good transmission of the Mesolens itself is also confirmed by our comparison of the transmission of the Mesolens with that of a 4x/0.1\u2009N.A. lens in camera mode."

A custom multiband reflector (Chroma) was used with a multiband barrier filter and, for each image, a different excitation waveband was selected from a mercury arc lamp. This image clearly shows the excellent chromatic correction of the lens with all three colours simultaneously in focus. Furthermore, the image demonstrates the possibility to view both the full large FOV and tiny details in the same image, using only (17x) software zoom."

HCX PL Fluotar, Leica Microsystems) mounted on an upright laser scanning microscope. The embryo was lying on its side so that XY scanning produced an optical section that was anatomically sagittal. The XZ images are displayed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a and b</a>. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a> was taken with a z-plane spacing of 1.5 \u00b5m and a line average of n=12 and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a> has a plane spacing of 1 \u00b5m and no averaging. For both lenses, but acutely for the 5x/0.15\u2009N.A. lens, this is much smaller than the size of the PSF. The Mesolens can image throughout the entire 2\u2009mm thick embryo with sub-cellular resolution (we can see individual nuclei all the way through). This is in contrast to the image with the commercial low magnification, low N.A. objective, where the long needle-like vertical structures indicate a very poor z resolution. The lateral resolution also remains micron-sized throughout the embryo, as can been seen from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>, which presents an XY cross section midway through the same embryo. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a> the dark cavity within the midbrain on the left and the neural canal within the spinal cord on the right are imaged with good axial resolution even though they are deep within the embryo, which is equally-well resolved at the top and bottom of the z range. Although the larger cavities are also visible in the image taken with the 5x lens, finer details such as the dark extracellular spaces in the bright neural tube to the right of the image and the epithelial cell monolayer (upper right margin and left lower corner) are only visible in the Mesolens image (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). In the XY section (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) similar fine details including individual cell nuclei in all the tissues are clearly resolved. Structures within the embryo were identified by means of (Kaufman,\u00a01992). The constant signal with increasing depth throughout the specimen arises from having a well-cleared specimen. We did not adjust the laser power or detector gain when imaging deeper into tissue."

This embryo was stained with an antibody against axonal beta tubulin coupled to the fluorescent dye Alexa 594, to highlight nerve cells and with acridine orange, here used chiefly as a nuclear marker. A dual-colour single optical section of a 12.5 day embryo stained following this protocol is presented as <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, with a 3D rendering around one of the eyes of the embryo shown as <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>. A lower-quality, smaller version of the same data is available as <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>. In the 3D rendering there are 60 images axially separated by 3.33 \u00b5m, imaging a total thickness of 200 \u00b5m and we used the fluorescence mode of our image reconstruction software (Volocity, Perkin Elmer) which applies a direct opacity rendering. We can clearly identify fine structures throughout the embryo such as the developing heart muscle fibers and fine details in the eye such as the corneal endothelium. The inset shows a blow-up of the eye region revealing the individual cell nuclei. We emphasize that this image is only a software zoom from the full scan range of the confocal Mesolens system, not a smaller scanned region. In the eye, the lens was visible as a slightly absorbing structure with a sharply defined outline, surrounded in turn by cells within the aqueous humour and then the strongly-stained retina. All these structures were enclosed in the corneal stroma, lined on the inside with the corneal endothelium and on the outside with the epithelial precursor of the conjunctiva."

We call this lens the Mesolens. In doing this work we have departed from a design principle of more than a century, which is that the number of lateral resolution units in the field diameter should be approximately the same for all objectives. As we have shown here, the lateral resolution in the image field of this new lens is too great for the human eye, but suits cameras of the highest pixel number available or laser scanning confocal operation and, crucially, the axial resolution justifies the collection of several hundred optical sections of a thick specimen within the working depth. We have shown that single cells, including the nucleated erythrocytes of mouse embryos, and syncytial heart muscle fibres can be seen not just near the surface as with conventional objectives but throughout the depth of the embryo. A biologist can therefore discover whether, for example, a defect in development involves changes in the shape of a deep-located organ, or of cell shape or cell number, or of the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. No existing microscope can show all of these features simultaneously in an intact mouse embryo in a single image."

The 25x higher optical throughput could also facilitate imaging of weakly emitting specimens, for example specimens expressing fluorescent proteins at a low level or containing single cells bearing luciferase as a bioluminescent marker."

To immobilize the beads they were dried down on to cleaned coverslips and immersed in a Gelvatol medium (341584, Sigma-Aldrich) containing DABCO (diazo-bis-cyclo-octane, 290734, Sigma-Aldrich) as antifade.

For the fluorescence imaging with this specimen a mercury lamp was used for excitation, with custom filters designed for DAPI, Alexa 488 and Alexa 546 (Chroma). Two different cameras were used to image the same region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). A low-power image was made by recording the entire field of the Mesolens on a monochrome 35\u2009mm CCD chip with 10 megapixels, each of 9 \u00b5m square (C3900-024, Hamamatsu). Three images, using UV, blue or green excitation from the mercury lamp were merged and coded blue, green and red respectively. A high-power image was made with a small format color camera Nikon DSL1 (used without a magnifier, in contrast to the resolution measurements described above), recording only a 2.2\u2009mm x 1.6\u2009mm portion of the Mesolens field with a square pixel size of 3.4 \u00b5m. The theoretical resolution of the Mesolens (0.6 \u00b5m) corresponds to 2.4 \u00b5m in image space in the camera, so neither camera allowed Nyquist sampling. In the <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, the wide-field epi-fluorescence image is first software-zoomed and then replaced by the image from the smaller format camera, which is further software zoomed and the view is software-panned around the region recorded in the small-format camera. This procedure was necessary to overcome the lack of a camera able to record hundreds of megapixels in a single image."

First, the embryo was transferred to xylene, and left to soak in several changes of xylene to remove the BABB over a period of days. It was then transferred from xylene to three changes of absolute ethanol, then 90% ethanol, 10% water by volume, then 75% ethanol, 50% ethanol and finally into distilled water (with at least 10\u2009min in each change). Acridine orange powder was dissolved in PBS to a pale yellow solution. The embryo was left in the staining solution overnight with gentle rolling on a slow turntable. The embryo was then washed in two changes of PBS over an hour and passed through the same series of alcohols up to xylene and then rolled in BABB overnight. These embryos were imaged in BABB."

The Mesolens has unique strengths as it combines the ability to image a large field of view (at low magnification) with an optical design that offers an unusually high numerical aperture: the authors show that their customized confocal microscope equipped with the Mesolens is capable of imaging a field of view up to 6 mm with an axial resolution of about 7 microns. There is currently no commercial system that would allow confocal imaging with comparable optical performance."

The optical design and optical engineering of the Mesolens are cutting-edge and the authors put substantial effort into the characterization and evaluation of their optical system. The manuscript is well written and the presentation of the results is clear and convincing. I believe the development of optical systems with the ability to image large specimens and high resolution (and without the need for tiling and post-hoc image stitching) is not only an important but also a very timely endeavor. Moreover, optical components with such capabilities may be useful not only in the context of confocal microscopy but could also synergize well with other state-of-the-art large-volume imaging techniques, such as light-sheet microscopy."

However, the depth of focus of their instrument is purposefully large (~0.3 mm) in order to provide a large tolerance to microscope slide placement errors. This very large depth of focus is not suited to confocal laser scanning microscopy, where a small depth of focus is needed for optical sectioning of the imaged specimen. As such, our instrument was designed to provide a depth of focus around two orders of magnitude less than that of the system by Zheng et al. Also, the low N.A. lens used in this demonstration of wide-field FPM is for use in air only. While this is acceptable for thin tissue sections, restriction to air immersion would give dramatic fall-off in axial resolution performance at depth when imaging thick tissues because of spherical aberration, for which there are presently no correction collars or any other means of compensation. Furthermore, as noted by Zheng et al. in their published work, they state that \u201cthe current FPM method is not a fluorescence technique, as fluorescent emission profiles would remain unchanged under angle-varied illumination\u201d. Therefore, while FPM gives high-resolution colour images of thin specimens such as pathology slides, it is not suitable for fluorescence imaging of either thin or thick specimens in either 2D or 3D."

As the authors gently explain, this is \u201cnot a standard laboratory preparation procedure\u201d, and because of the requirement for immersion and mounting of specimens in high-index material, would be impractical for thick tissue imaging. The work of Pang et al. overcomes this limitation, and makes possible imaging of specimens spatially separated from the sensor with fluorescence contrast and an exceptionally wide-field of view. However, while the lateral performance is quite good (an xy resolution of 1.2 microns, compared with our sub-micron lateral resolution), the reported depth of focus limit of 60: m is too large to be useful for optical sectioning of thick tissue volumes. The imaging speed of 23 seconds of the instrument described by Pang et al. is attractive but the reported unevenness of Talbot spots over an area of 1 mm by 1 mm of 4.73% is very high when compared with both standard wide-field imaging and our wide-field imaging with the Mesolens."

(1). In specimens such as mouse embryos at the 1012.5 day stage, when the major organs are developing (2), it was impossible to see individual cells in the interior despite the lateral (XY) resolution being sufficient. Since then, stitching and tiling of large datasets has proved to be possible using computercontrolled specimen stages, but this results in a checker board pattern in the final image due to inhomogeneity of illumination and focus height errors which often cannot be corrected by software. Commercial and open source software algorithms are available to perform stitching and tiling but inhomogeneities and problems with dataset registration are clearly visible (ref Legesse et al). Because of the continuous scanning laser spot that we use with the Mesolens, we do not observe differences in fluorescence signal from one region of the image to another unless it is present in the specimen.\u201d"
