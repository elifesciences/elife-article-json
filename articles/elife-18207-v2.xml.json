In this study, we investigated differentiation-induced transformations in MSC cellular and nuclear biophysical properties and queried their role in mechanosensation. Our data show that nuclei in differentiated bovine and human MSCs stiffen and become resistant to deformation. This attenuated nuclear deformation was governed by restructuring of Lamin A/C and increased heterochromatin content. This change in nuclear stiffness sensitized MSCs to mechanical-loading-induced calcium signaling and differentiated marker expression. This sensitization was reversed when the \u2018stiff\u2019 differentiated nucleus was softened and was enhanced when the \u2018soft\u2019 undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment. Interestingly, dynamic loading of undifferentiated MSCs, in the absence of soluble differentiation factors, stiffened and condensed the nucleus, and increased mechanosensitivity more rapidly than soluble factors. These data suggest that the nucleus acts as a mechanostat to modulate cellular mechanosensation during differentiation."

In this study, we investigated differentiation-induced transformations in MSC cellular and nuclear biophysical properties and queried their role in mechanosensation. Our data show that nuclei in differentiated bovine and human MSCs stiffen and become resistant to deformation. This attenuated nuclear deformation was governed by restructuring of Lamin A/C and increased heterochromatin content. This change in nuclear stiffness sensitized MSCs to mechanical-loading-induced calcium signaling and differentiated marker expression. This sensitization was reversed when the \u2018stiff\u2019 differentiated nucleus was softened and was enhanced when the \u2018soft\u2019 undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment. Interestingly, dynamic loading of undifferentiated MSCs, in the absence of soluble differentiation factors, stiffened and condensed the nucleus, and increased mechanosensitivity more rapidly than soluble factors. These data suggest that the nucleus acts as a mechanostat to modulate cellular mechanosensation during differentiation."

However, the manner in which soluble and physical cues are integrated to inform lineage specification and commitment is only just beginning to be understood (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guilak et al., 2009</a>). One potentially confounding feature is that the physical properties of MSCs themselves likely change coincident with lineage specification, and such changes might alter cellular perception of super-imposed mechanical perturbations that arise from the microenvironment."

Lamins change during differentiation as well; mouse ES cells start expressing high levels of A-type lamin during cell differentiation, suggestive of a role in the maintenance of differentiated state. Further, chromatin reorganization mediated by lamins can enhance heterochromatin formation in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Galiov\u00e1 et al., 2008</a>), and haplo-insufficiency of LMAC can limit certain lineages (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sehgal et al., 2013</a>). In C2C12 cells, a myogenic cell line, LMAC becomes heavily concentrated at the nuclear periphery with myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Markiewicz et al., 2005</a>), and mutant isoforms of LMAC can block myogenic lineage specification (<a href=\"#bib41\">Markiewicz et al., 2005</a>).

Specifically, we examined the nuclear mechanics and mechanosensitivity of MSCs as they transited toward a differentiated (fibrochondrogenic) lineage on aligned nanofibrous scaffolds. These scaffolds not only direct new tissue formation for fibrous tissue engineering (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nerurkar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baker et al., 2012</a>) but also provide a useful template for the application of coordinated cell deformation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nathan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Han et al., 2013</a>). Using this experimental platform, we show that MSC fibrochondrogenesis mediated by soluble factor addition over the long term (days to weeks) increases nuclear stiffness, alters organization of key nuclear structural elements, and as a consequence, changes the manner in which MSCs respond in the short term (seconds to minutes) to dynamic mechanical signals from the microenvironment. We further demonstrate that the repeated application of this short term dynamic mechanical stimulation (as opposed to application of soluble differentiation factors) can itself evoke some of these same changes in nuclear structure and mechanics, and that it does so more rapidly than soluble factor addition alone. This implies that nuclear stiffening may be both a consequence and mediator of differentiation, tuning how progenitor cells interpret mechanical cues from their microenvironment. Such changes may act to first inform, and then reinforce, signals that promote and preserve lineage specification."

Therefore, the peri-nuclear stiffness was measured both with and without the addition of cytochalasin D to remove potential contributions from the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b, c</a>). Over seven days, the peri-nuclear stiffness did not change for undifferentiated MSCs (Ctrl), but increased by\u00a0&gt;50% in differentiated MSCs (Diff, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>).

To do so, MSCs were removed from the scaffold on day 7 (with trypsin) and re-seeded for 24 hr onto fresh scaffolds. Re-seeded MSCs from both Ctrl and Diff conditions adopted a highly aligned morphology (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Consistent with the above findings, nuclei of these re-seeded differentiated MSCs (Diff) did not deform (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f,\u00a0g</a>) when the scaffold was stretched to 10%, while re-seeded undifferentiated MSC nuclei (Ctrl) increased in NAR by\u00a0~25%. These findings indicate that deposited extracellular matrix is not responsible for the observed attenuation in nuclear deformation with scaffold stretch. Additionally, we measured substantial increases in cytoskeletal contractility (which would tend to increase rather than decrease nuclear deformation, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To interrogate the force generating and strain transfer capacity of the actin cytoskeletal network, MSCs were also cultured on elastomeric micropost array detectors following culture on aligned scaffolds for 7 days in Ctrl or Diff conditions. Traction force increased over the first 16 hr of exposure to TGF-\u03b23 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Actin stress fibers were prominent in both undifferentiated (Ctrl) and differentiated (Diff) cells, although differentiated cells induced significantly greater post deflections (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Quantification of the total strain energy per cell revealed a significant increase in traction forces (~5 fold) with differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). On scaffolds, blockade of acto-myosin contractility decreased nuclear deformation in undifferentiated cells (Ctrl/Y27, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>), implicating the need for a patent and contractile cytoskeleton in the transfer of deformation from the scaffold to the nucleus. Taken together, these findings suggest that nuclear stiffening with differentiation dominates the response, resulting in a nucleus that no longer deforms when the cell is stretched."

Given this transformation, we next asked whether such changes in nuclear stiffness alter the degree to which mechanical perturbation of the whole cell regulates signal transduction as a function of differentiation state. To answer this question, cells on scaffolds were stretched rapidly, and short-term changes in calcium signaling were used as an early readout of altered mechanotransduction. Additionally, the stiff nuclei of differentiated MSCs (Diff) were softened via chemical pre-treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA [<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerlitz and Bustin, 2010</a>]) and the soft nuclei of undifferentiated cells (Ctrl) were transiently stiffened by short-term osmotic shock using D-mannitol (DM) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Irianto et al., 2013</a>) prior to the application of this mechanical perturbation."

While TSA did not alter the distribution or the amount of LMAC in these differentiated cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c\u2013e</a>), it did partially restore nuclear deformation in response to scaffold stretch (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,\u00a0b</a>). To examine the link between nuclear stiffness and cellular mechanotransduction, we next evaluated changes in intracellular calcium in response to a rapidly applied stretch. In undifferentiated MSCs (Ctrl), a rapid stretch resulted in a small increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When the same perturbation was applied to differentiated MSCs (Diff), a much larger increase was observed (p&lt;0.01, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c,\u00a0i</a>). Interestingly, this enhanced sensitivity was reversed by pre-treatment of differentiated MSCs with TSA (Diff/TSA). This sensitization to mechanical perturbation with differentiation (and blockade with TSA treatment) was also observed for aggrecan and collagen II gene expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d,\u00a0e</a>). With TSA pre-treatment (Diff/TSA), we found no significant changes in cytoskeletal structure, contractility (as assessed by myosin light chain phosphorylation, pMLCK) or migration rate (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013e</a>)."

However, cells in mechanically loaded tissues experience repeated bouts of mechanical stimulation that, over time, can summate to drive lineage specification and/or regulate tissue homeostasis. To determine whether such mechanical signals on their own could elicit similar changes as the addition of soluble factors, undifferentiated MSCs were exposed to dynamic tensile loading in the absence of exogenous TGF-\u03b23. These studies showed that short periods of dynamic loading [1 hr of dynamic stretch (3%, 1 Hz)] that was applied each day for 5 days did not alter LMAC distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,\u00a0b</a>). However, when the same loading regimen was applied for 3 or 6 hr per day, LMAC reorganization was evident by day 5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,\u00a0d</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Strain magnitude also modulated this process; LMAC reorganization was evident with 1.5% and 3% stretch, but not at 0.75% stretch (applied for 6 hr per day, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d\u2013g</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). LMAC staining intensity and organization in these mechanically pre-conditioned MSCs (i.e. those exposed to higher levels of DL for longer periods of time) was similar to that observed in MSCs differentiated via soluble mediators (Diff, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>), suggesting that LMAC reorganization mediated through mechanical signals matches or exceeds that of soluble-factor-mediated differentiation. Similarly, dynamic loading (DL) conditions led to a marked increase in heterochromatin content, comparable to that induced by soluble factors (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1d,\u00a0e</a>)."

This precocious chromatin restructuring under DL conditions was further quantified using an image-based technique (<a href=\"#bib33\">Irianto et al., 2013</a>) that determines a \u2018chromatin condensation parameter\u2019 (CCP) based on the amount of free space and number of visible edges in DAPI-stained images of the nucleus.

While the mechanisms by which nuclear deformation regulates transcriptional activities are only now beginning to be elucidated, our data suggest that the nucleus acts as a mechanical rheostat within progenitor cells, where increases in nuclear stiffness sensitize the entire transduction machinery to prime the cell response to mechanical perturbation. Our data show that soluble differentiation factors as well as mechanical perturbation on its own, elicit marked changes in nuclear deformability, stiffness and organization as a direct consequence of chromatin condensation and restructuring of the Lamin A/C network in both adult progenitor cells and in embryonic stem cells. This change in nuclear mechanics and organization led to a greater mobilization of intracellular calcium when pre-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells were exposed to stretch, likely as a consequence of the nucleus transforming from a strain sink (an object that readily deforms) to a strain concentrator (an object that stops deforming, forcing other components to deform more). These changes would be expected to increase stress and/or deformation occurring at nucleo-cytoskeletal and cytoskeletal linkages (i.e. LINC complex) to the ECM (i.e. focal adhesions). When one element of an elastic mechanical linkage stiffens, the other weaker elements must deform more when the system is elongated by a set amount. Indeed, the enhanced mechanical sensitivity seen in differentiated cells was reversed when the \u2018stiff\u2019 differentiated nucleus was softened and was enhanced when the \u2018soft\u2019 undifferentiated nucleus was stiffened through pharmacologic treatment."

Swift and colleagues recently showed that the stiffness of native tissue extracellular matrices defines the resting levels and ratios of Lamin isoforms in adult cells, with stiffer microenvironments increasing nuclear mechanics (<a href=\"#bib54\">Swift et al., 2013</a>). Our data extend this concept to cells transiting from an undifferentiated to a differentiated phenotype as a result of soluble factor addition and exposure to repeated mechanical deformtion. This phenomenon may drive cell differentiation or maintain the differentiated phenotype to better match the dynamic mechanical tissue environment in which they operate. For instance, as soon as muscular contraction begins in the developing embryo, mesenchymal precursors are exposed to dynamic mechanical perturbation, and blockade of mechanical signaling during development interrupts joint formation and tissue maturation. In the context of injury and repair, recruited stem cells experience the mechanical environment of the tissue being repaired, and so for musculoskeletal tissues, experience dynamic mechanical stimulation as part of their normal microenvironment. Thus, dynamic mechanical forces transmitted through the environment may continuously adjust nuclear mechanics to modulate progenitor cell mechanosensitivity during tissue formation and repair."

For example, both BMP and TGF-\u03b2 signaling increase baseline cellular contractility (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhadriraju et al., 2007</a>). Our data show that TGF-\u03b2 expression is highly upregulated with dynamic stretch at early time points and while TGF-\u03b2 in the media did not reach detectable levels, we did observe increased Smad3 signaling in response to stretch (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>, [<a href=\"#bib18\">Furumatsu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2015</a>]). Thus, elements of the TGF-signaling pathway may be mechano-responsive, in a ligand or ligand-less fashion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heo et al., 2016</a>). Mechanical perturbation itself can also increase cell contractility and spreading (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cui et al., 2015</a>), and influence the subsequent mechano-response. Kaunas et al. showed that artificially increasing Rho GTPase activity in endothelial cells sensitizes their response to applied stretch (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kaunas et al., 2005</a>), and Deguchi et al. showed that fluid shear stress, which also increases contractility, can stiffen the endothelial cell nucleus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deguchi et al., 2005</a>). Recent work by the Shivashankar and Burridge groups has shown that local application of mechanical force to the apical surface of cells causes local chromatin reorganization (<a href=\"#bib34\">Iyer et al., 2012</a>) and that pulling on isolated nuclei results in changes in Lamin organization and nuclear stiffening (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guilluy et al., 2014</a>)."

We recently showed that ATP-purinergic signaling is a central modulator in the load-induced-chromatin condensation in MSCs, as is signaling thorough Smad proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Heo et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2016</a>).

This transformation hyper-sensitizes the differentiated cell to respond to mechanical perturbation (red stars) by increasing stress at each point of cytoskeletal connectivity (focal adhesions and LINC complex).

This suggests that the mechanical environment plays a significant role in dynamically modulating nuclear properties. Given that such changes act to first inform, and then reinforce, signals that promote and preserve lineage specification, this time dependence has implication for therapeutic use. That is, as MSCs transit between phenotypes, one would expect that their current differentiation status and time history of exposure to soluble or mechanical factors could influence their mechanobiologic response upon implantation. This understanding may aid in the design of biomaterials that can promote (or restrict) certain lineages based on nuclear remodeling. For example, if nuclear stiffening via Lamin reorganization is counter the intended differentiation pathway, then materials may be modified with ligands that interrupt mechano-sensing pathways, for example by decreasing cell contractility based on ligand presentation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cosgrove et al., 2016</a>). Alternatively, materials could be engineered to promote nuclear deformation (e.g. by aligning the cell population from the outset) so as to more efficiently transfer strain from the material to the nucleus to promote nuclear remodeling and achieve a differentiated status more quickly (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2011</a>)."

If nuclear deformation is essential for physiologic function, then complete elimination of nuclear deformation (as a consequence of soluble factor addition) may result in aberrant mechano-signaling. This has implications for establishing better cellular biophysical benchmarks by which small molecule drivers of differentiation are judged. These benchmarks may prove relevant for cell-based therapeutics, wherein naive stem cells are placed in a mechanically loaded environment. While it is not yet clear how permanent these changes are once soluble and mechanical stimuli are removed, it does suggest that care must be taken to preserve the appropriate mechano-response. In conclusion, the data presented herein demonstrates a mechanism whereby nuclear architecture and stiffness can be tuned to dynamically regulate cellular mechanosensitivity to promote and preserve lineage specification."

The PCL solution was extruded at a rate of 2.5 ml/hr using a syringe pump (KD Scientific, Model 780100). Fibers were collected onto a grounded cylindrical mandrel rotating with a surface velocity of 10 m/s, with the mandrel positioned 15 cm from the spinneret. Aluminum shields charged to\u00a0+5 kV were used to focus the fiber jet onto the collecting mandrel.

This change results in differential responses to load in the magnitude of calcium signaling. This is an interesting idea and is supported by several interesting results in the article. However, the article draws additional conclusions that are less well supported, in part because it is difficult to dissect the effects of chromatin condensation on differentiation from those on nuclear mechanics \u2013 as well as the effects on mechanosensitivity of mechanical (dynamic load) or soluble factors (TGF-\u03b2) factors.

They show that nuclear stiffening during differentiation dominates the response to subsequent external mechanical stimuli with respect to nuclear mechanics/deformation (even in presence of patent and contractile cytoskeleton). It transforms the nuclei from being a 'strain sink' to a 'stress concentrator', and increases mechano-sensitivity. Furthermore, their results indicate that nuclear stiffening is both a consequence and a mediator of differentiation, as it is manifested by soluble cues inducing differentiation, as well as mechanical stimulation by itself.

The first time scale, that of differentiation, occurs over the course of ~1 week, during which time we observed changes in nuclear structure, mechanics, and distribution of internal nucleoskeletal elements. The other time scale of interest was that which occurs in response to physical perturbation. These mechanotransductive events (i.e., calcium signaling) occur within a few seconds to minutes after load is initiated. As we show, changes in nuclear mechanics that occur over a longer term can alter how these cells interpret shorter term mechanical perturbations, altering their acute mechanotransduction response. Likewise, we show that the summation of these short time-scale mechanotransduction events will eventually change the cell phenotype, over the course of several days, as is evidenced by longer term loading resulting in the restructuring of chromatin and Lamin A/C that we observed. With respect to the impact of TSA on undifferentiated cells, and D-mannitol on differentiated cells, and in response the previous review, we have performed new studies to address these questions.

In other parallel work, focused on the very short term (3 hours to less than 10 minutes) response to loading of na\u00efve MSCs, we probed many of the potential mechanical signaling pathways that might be involved in this process. This work was published in Scientific Reports last year, with a follow up manuscript just published in the Biophysical Journal (Please see Heo et al., 2015, 2016). Those two studies examined chromatin condensation in response to loading, and defined some of the operative molecular pathways involved in this process. Summarizing that work, we found that purinergic signaling (i.e., ATP) is a central player in the initial events that result in chromatin condensation, and that this initial response is dependent on the cell having a sufficient level of baseline contractility so as to respond to the mechanical perturbation. Our conclusions from that set of studies was that loading applied to cells that had a minimal amount of tension in their cytoskeleton (due in part to basal activity in Smad signaling in the TGF/BMP pathway) resulted in the rapid release of ATP (from intracellular stores), which initiated calcium signaling in an autocrine and paracrine fashion (shown via conditioned media assays), ultimately changing the activity of chromatin modifying enzymes, such as EZH2, impacting the chromatin condensation state in the short term."

Our focus on f-actin in this study was motivated by several previous studies exploring the basic mechanisms of nuclear deformation in this cell type and in this 3D context. In a previously published work (Nathan et al., Acta Biomat, 2011), we measured nuclear deformation in na\u00efve MSCs on aligned scaffolds in the context of blockers of f-actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. Only blockers of f-actin polymerization altered nuclear deformation in this context, leading to our focus in the current study. More recently, we have established that the giant isoform of Nesprin 1 (a component of the LINC complex that mediates actin connectivity to the nucleus) is responsible for nuclear deformation in this cell type (and is also downstream YAP mechano-signaling) (Driscoll et al., Biophys J, 2015). Based on these two observations, it seems that f-actin is the dominant player mediating strain transfer to the nucleus in this cell type."

To address this, applied the minimum dose of TSA for the shortest period of time, so as to capture how mechano-response changed in response to changes in nuclear properties. To ensure that TSA was not altering differentiation to a great extent (over this short period of application), we evaluated two canonical markers of the fibrochondrogenic lineage, aggrecan and type II collagen. Baseline expression of these two important markers in differentiated cells did not change with this short term TSA treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D, E</a>). With respect to additional controls in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the experiments suggested have now been performed. When TSA was applied to undifferentiated cells, only a small decrease in chromatin condensation was observed, with a correspondingly slight increase in nuclear deformability (p&lt;0.05) in these undifferentiated cells. Conversely, when we applied D-mannitol to differentiated cells, no significant additional change in chromatin condensation was observed (p&gt;0.05). These data suggest that, over the time scale of D-mannitol action on the nucleus, it did not condense further in these differentiated cells. Likewise, addition of D-mannitol did not further attenuate nuclear deformation. Indeed, differentiation on its own had sufficiently stiffened the nucleus such that very little deformation was occurring to begin with.

We have carefully reviewed the manuscript to ensure that the timing of each study, and the intended outcome parameter measured are clearly defined in each section, and have specifically modified the last paragraph of the Introduction to make these time scales clear from the outset. In essence, when we were probing short term mechano-transductive events, we examined cells on the order of minutes to hours, the time course over which these pathways are generally active after mechanical perturbation. Similarly, for studies examining nuclear deformation, stretch was applied on the time scale of minutes, and the elastic deformation of the nucleus was visualized immediately at each deformation step, as an indirect measure of nuclear stiffness. When we were probing the consequence of the summation of repeated mechanical perturbations, these were applied over multiple days to provide sufficient time for the cell to respond and remodel in response the loading environment. These clarifications have been emphasized in the revised manuscript. Please see revised manuscript, Introduction, last paragraph."

The authors suggest that dynamic load is driving similar changes in nuclear architecture and cellular function as TGF-\u03b2 \u2013 but more quickly (i.e. at the end of subsection \u201cDynamic Loading Alters MSC Nuclear Mechanics and Mechano-perception\u201d). However, some data indicate that these are distinct processes or that they achieve similar results in lamin A or gene expression via different mechanisms. In addition to clarifying the discussion and interpretation of these results, it would be helpful to design an experiment that could more fully discriminate the extent to which these stimuli are operating in the same or in distinct pathways. In other words, can you uncouple the mechanical vs soluble mechanosensitivity or show causal epistasis more convincingly?</i> "

In recent unpublished data, we carried out microarray analysis comparing the response to TGFbeta at day 4 versus the response to 2 bouts of dynamic loading (each applied for three hours per day at 3% strain at 1Hz) over 4 days. As is shown in the PCA plot in <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a>, each loading event drives alterations in global gene expression, which accumulate and stabilizes after the second loading event. Notably, the loaded samples group in the PCA plot in a quite different location than do those samples treated with TGFbeta over this time course. Thus, it appears that while \u2018load-induced\u2019 and \u2018TGFbeta induced\u2019 nuclear reorganization have some pathways and outcomes in common, the overall state of the cell is quite different based on whether the input is mechanical or soluble factor in nature. While outside the scope of the current work, ongoing studies are focused on probing positional and methylation events across the genome using RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation to better understand these distinct cell states."

To the first point, we found that blockers of Smad2/3 (SB431542) or Smad1/5/8 (LDN193189), which mediate TGF and BMP signaling, respectively, eliminated the early (less than 3 hour) chromatin condensation we observed in response to mechanical loading. Interestingly, these blockers also dramatically decreased cell contractility (please see Heo et al. Biophys J, 2016). Of further note, when we added functional blocking antibodies to TGFbeta during and after loading, this treatment had no impact on early nuclear remodeling. This suggested to us that basal activity (in the absence of exogenous ligand) in the canonical TGF/BMP pathways is important for establishing tension in the cytoskeleton, and so influences the ability of cells to detect mechanical perturbation."
