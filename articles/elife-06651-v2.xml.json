In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, we subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). We found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change.

Kim et al. suggest that this difference may reflect the fact that for ground-based organisms, local gradients are generally reliable predictors of the location of an odor source. However, for flying insects, continually changing air currents mean that predictable local gradients are less common. Therefore, the ability to detect a hint of an odor before the wind changes is a more useful skill."

In one of the most sophisticated examples, <i>Drosophila</i> larvae with only a single functional olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) are capable of moving toward a droplet of an attractive odor by actively orienting themselves (<a href=\"#bib14\">Louis et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, adult fruit flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume (<a href=\"#bib4\">Budick and Dickinson, 2006</a>) and staying within a specific odor zone (<a href=\"#bib21\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). In order to enable such odor-guided tasks, it is essential for any olfactory system to process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers."

Most of these studies employed a simple odor delivery system that generated step-pulse-like odor stimuli without directly monitoring the actual odor concentration levels. For a rigorous understanding of sensory processing, however, it is essential to precisely measure the input stimuli and systematically explore the input space, as has been successfully done in the field of vision and audition (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, natural odor plumes are encountered in various spatiotemporal patterns, and their dynamics and statistics can influence the neural encoding mechanism (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brenner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Vickers et al., 2001</a>)."

Building on this recent advance, we asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments. We tested OSNs and PNs with short plume-like odor stimuli in a variety of settings and analyzed the correlation structure of input/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway. We also constructed a two-dimensional (2D) linear\u2013nonlinear (LN) model of the OSN-to-PN transformation by inducing an ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates via a systematic design of olfactory stimuli."

Various odor concentration profiles were designed and tested (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and the corresponding OSN and PN responses were measured in two separate assays sharing the same odor delivery system (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The observed odor concentrations were closely matched between the two assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). We used acetone as the primary odorant because its low ionization potential afforded a high signal-to-noise ratio in our odor concentration measurements. We tested a pair of directly connected OSNs and PNs innervating the DM4 glomerulus with five different acetone concentration waveforms. The dynamics of OSN and PN responses differed significantly from their respective feedforward inputs, and all responses initiated within a few tens of milliseconds of the odor onset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). PNs generally showed a bigger peak spike rate and exhibited more phasic spiking patterns than the presynaptic OSNs. However, the exact functional transformation between OSNs and PNs could not be readily assessed due to the complex dynamics of OSN and PN signals."

For the ramp and parabola odor signals, OSN responses were the exact rate-of-change function of their input: a step output to a ramp input (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a>) and a ramp output to a parabola input (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>). This pattern of encoding was preserved for different combinations of odorants and OSN-PN pairs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To look into this observation formally, we measured the similarity between three different input features\u2014concentration amplitude, rate of change, and acceleration\u2014and the output spike rate of OSNs by performing a set of cross-correlation analyses. The correlation was strong between the OSN output and both odor concentration and its rate of change, but weak between the OSN output and the acceleration of odor concentration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>)."

All PN responses transiently peaked at the time of the odor onset, and their peak times were on average advanced from the OSN peak times. Specifically, in response to ramp-shaped OSN signals, PNs exhibited a rapid step response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,I</a>). To step-like OSN signals, PN showed a phasic onset response, followed by a tonic spiking pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,H</a>). These input/output relationships are reminiscent of the rate-of-change encoding in the odor-to-OSN transformation, where the ramp and step odor signals were similarly transformed. Biophysically, this phenomenon suggests a rapid adaptation between OSNs and PNs, which is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating strong short-term depression in synapses between OSNs and PNs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Nagel et al., 2015</a>). From a modeling perspective, this observation predicted a strong correlation between the PN spike rate and the rate of change of the OSN spike rate. A correlation analysis between the PN output and three different input features\u2014OSN spike rate, rate of change, and acceleration\u2014confirmed this prediction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). Together, this supports the hypothesis that PN responses can be modeled as a function of the OSN spike rate and its rate of change, at least for the tested class of odor stimuli."

Given the hypothesized input blocks, the model can be fully identified by estimating the nonlinear block from experimental data. The validity of the model can be tested by assessing its ability to predict the PN response to new odor waveforms. In order to estimate the nonlinearity, we first designed OSN spike activity profiles that explore the hypothesized PN input space with an efficient sampling grid. An ensemble of triangle-shaped inputs was shown to be suitable for this purpose, since each up/down ramp stimulus tests the target system with a distinct pair of positive and negative gradients while also sweeping a wide range of input amplitudes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kim et al., 2011</a>)."

When the nonlinearity was estimated for samples with a fixed odor concentration value, the PN spike rate rose almost linearly with respect to the rate of change (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, the gain of the PN output with respect to the OSN rate of change decreased monotonically with concentration, suggesting that at least a 2D model is required to describe the OSN-to-PN transformation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We tested the model by comparing the simulated model output with the experimental PN spike activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). With step, ramp, and parabola odor inputs, the experimental outputs were closely matched by the model (root-mean-square error = 25 spike/s, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). While the odor-evoked responses were well matched by the model, including peak times and amplitudes, the model output often overestimated the actual PN spike rate before and after the stimulus interval. This is because the estimated nonlinearity exhibits a relatively high slope at low input amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which renders the system highly sensitive to the noisy fluctuations at low OSN spike rates (<a href=\"#bib19\">Pahlberg and Sampath, 2011</a>). This problem is thought to be mitigated in olfactory glomeruli by pooling input from a population of OSNs, thereby achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio than provided by a single OSN (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bhandawat et al., 2007</a>). In summary, the proposed simple 2D model provides a decent approximation of the OSN-to-PN transformation and corroborates the notion that PNs mainly encode OSN spike rate and its rate of change in a nonlinear fashion."

In signal processing theory, the time derivative, or rate-of-change operation, advances the phase of a time signal. For example, cos(<i>t</i>) is the time derivative of sin(<i>t</i>), and its phase is advanced by \u03c0/2. Similarly, the rate of change of a sample triangle-shaped signal shows an advancement of a peak time, and its acceleration exhibits a peak time that is further advanced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Therefore, we reasoned that the computation of the first and second time derivatives (rate of change and acceleration) of odor concentrations by OSN and PNs, respectively, acts to advance peak times of olfactory stimuli. To investigate this idea with a larger set of odor stimuli, we designed a set of triangle-shaped odor waveforms with peak times varying uniformly between 0.6 s and 1.7 s after the stimulus onset (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, \u2018odor\u2019 curve in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As shown in the previous experiments with triangle-shaped stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), OSNs responded in a pulse-shaped pattern (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), with the peak response advanced by 400\u20131000 ms relative to the stimulus peak (\u2018OSN\u2019 curve in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In response to the same panel of odor stimuli, PNs consistently produced peak output (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) at around 200 ms after the stimulus onset, regardless of the dynamics of the odor/OSN signals (\u2018PN\u2019 curve in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). For the parabola-shaped odor stimuli (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), the peak OSN and PN responses were similarly advanced in time relative to the odor and OSN peaks (right plot in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) but were more variable. The advancement of a peak time was previously reported for step-pulse odor stimuli (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bhandawat et al., 2007</a>), and our work confirms this result for a larger set of dynamically varying odor stimuli. Together, we hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli."

The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input. When combined with the dynamic sensory encoding by OSNs\u2014encoding of odor concentration and its rate of change\u2014PNs signal the rate of change and, most strongly, the acceleration of odor concentration signals to higher brain centers. One remarkable example of the \u2018acceleration encoding\u2019 by PNs is found in the OSN/PN responses to the parabolically rising odor input, where the onset is enormously amplified to create step-like responses in PNs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,I</a>)."

This sensory encoding mechanism is distinguished from other chemosensory systems. For example, in bacterial chemotaxis, the rate of change of a stimulus is computed and fed directly into its motor system that controls the flagellar rotation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bourret et al., 1991</a>). The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> also exhibits a local-gradient-based chemotaxis behavior, and neurons in its sensorimotor pathway are shown to compute the rate of change of concentration gradients (<a href=\"#bib23\">Suzuki et al., 2008</a>)."

An efficient chemotaxis strategy should depend on the distribution of odor molecules in the behaviorally relevant range, which can be quantified using a Reynolds number (<a href=\"#bib27\">Weissburg, 2000</a>). Habitats of both nematodes and bacteria have low Reynolds numbers (Re &lt; 1), and thus the odor distribution is primarily determined by a diffusion process. In this environment, the steepest local odor gradient can be directly linked to the location of the odor source, and therefore animals in such environments are expected to encode the rate of change of odor concentrations in order to detect the steepest gradient. In contrast, flying insects experience fluid mechanics that have relatively high Reynolds numbers (Re &gt; 10), with turbulence dictating the distribution of odor molecules over the diffusion process. In this regime, the local odor gradient within an odor plume would be less informative in determining the location of the odor source than the distribution of odor plumes over a macroscopic scale. In fact, it has been well established that insects, including fruit flies, use a strategy of turning upwind during odor plume encounters, a strategy that does not require interpreting local concentration gradients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Budick and Dickinson, 2006</a>)."

It is therefore crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes. We showed that <i>Drosophila</i>'s early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the acceleration encoding has evolved in <i>Drosophila</i> to maximize its chance to locate the odor source in a turbulent environment."

However, even with the lack of spatial sampling ability, fruit fly larvae can locate an odor source, based on the temporal sampling of odor gradients (<a href=\"#bib14\">Louis et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, adult fruit flies may rely on both spatial and temporal sampling methods to locate an odor source, although their relative importance may vary depending on the locomotive state, as Reynolds numbers are different between walking and flight."

An odorant was diluted in dipropylene glycol, and 20 ml of the resulting mixture was put into a glass vial (30 ml) and subsequently sealed by a screw cap with a silicone septa. Inlet and outlet needles were inserted into the vial headspace. The saturated vapor in this headspace was puffed by directing a low-flow air stream (\u2264100 ml/min) from an air cylinder (UN1002; TechAir, White Plains, NY) into the odor vial by opening inlet and outlet solenoid valves (Series 10; Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Cleveland, OH). Subsequently, the outlet needle carried the saturated vapor from inside the vial to a custom laminar mixer where the odor flow was combined with a strong carrier flow (800 ml/min). The mixer was carefully designed so as to minimize the turbulence that could be formed when the low-flow odor stream is added to a high-flow-rate carrier stream. The output of the mixer was then directed to the antennae and maxillary palps of a prepared animal through a glass capillary (1 mm inner diameter). The interval between two consecutive puffs was between 45 s and 70 s depending on the amount of vapor consumed in each puff, and the mixture was replenished about every 10 trials. All flows were electronically controlled by a miniature pressure controller (VSO-EP; Parker-Hannifin, OH) and measured using a digital flow meter (PV9000; Key Instruments, Trevose, PA) in real time. After hitting the animal, the odor flow was immediately sucked into a probe and measured by a photoionization detector (PID; Aurora Scientific, Canada) with 1 l/min flow rate. The output of the PID was digitally sampled at 10 kHz and later advanced by 2 ms in order to compensate for the latency caused by the suction probe. In order to convert the PID output voltage into the odor concentration in parts per million (ppm), we regularly (every 10 trials) measured the output of the PID with a calibration odor (3% propylene) and estimated the general sensitivity of the PID, which gradually decays over time. The PID sensitivity ratio of actual odor to standard odor was measured in a separate experiment with a fully saturated odor vapor and used to calculate a scaling factor between the PID output (in Volts) and the absolute odor concentration (in ppm) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kim et al., 2011</a>)."

They design clever and precise olfactory stimuli to dissect the dynamics of the responses of OSNs and PNs and develop a 2D model for the OSN to PN transformation. They conclude that OSNs respond to stimulus amplitude and rate of change while PNs respond to OSN spike rate and rate of change. Thus PN respond mainly to odor rate of change and acceleration. These results indicate that PNs enable flies to reliably respond to onsets of slowly rising odorant gradients."

Furthermore, by employing precisely designed and measured time-varying olfactory stimuli, our study identifies specific patterns of dynamic olfactory information received by higher brain centers and provides a framework for predicting olfactory information representation in response to a given odorant concentration profile. Based on the comment, we have revised the Discussion section to place more emphasis on PNs and how their response may facilitate anemotaxis behavior in fruit flies."

We added this explanation to the revised caption of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>.
