Here we provide direct evidence that under inflammatory conditions, brain endothelial cells (BECs) stimulate the migration of myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells by acting as non-professional antigen presenting cells through the processing and presentation of myelin-derived antigens in MHC-II. Inflamed BECs internalized myelin, which was routed to endo-lysosomal compartment for processing in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, myelin/MHC-II complexes on inflamed BECs stimulated the trans-endothelial migration of myelin-reactive Th1 and Th17 2D2 cells, while control antigen loaded BECs did not stimulate T-cell migration. Furthermore, blocking the interaction between myelin/MHC-II complexes and myelin-reactive T-cells prevented T-cell transmigration. These results demonstrate that endothelial cells derived from the brain are capable of enhancing antigen-specific T cell recruitment."

Here we provide direct evidence that under inflammatory conditions, brain endothelial cells (BECs) stimulate the migration of myelin-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells by acting as non-professional antigen presenting cells through the processing and presentation of myelin-derived antigens in MHC-II. Inflamed BECs internalized myelin, which was routed to endo-lysosomal compartment for processing in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, myelin/MHC-II complexes on inflamed BECs stimulated the trans-endothelial migration of myelin-reactive Th1 and Th17 2D2 cells, while control antigen loaded BECs did not stimulate T-cell migration. Furthermore, blocking the interaction between myelin/MHC-II complexes and myelin-reactive T-cells prevented T-cell transmigration. These results demonstrate that endothelial cells derived from the brain are capable of enhancing antigen-specific T cell recruitment."

In doing so, they create a protective barrier between the blood and the brain known as the blood-brain barrier. However, this barrier loses its protective function in individuals with multiple sclerosis or other disorders that affect the brain. Multiple sclerosis patients develop inflammation and their immune cells become able to enter the brain. These immune cells may then attack layers of insulation called myelin that surround nerve cells. Myelin helps nerve cells to work properly so the loss of this insulation can lead to tissue damage and cognitive problems. When immune cells called T cells enter the brain they can become primed to recognize myelin and attack it in the same way that they would attack viruses or bacteria. However, it is not clear precisely how these T cells develop the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and attack myelin."

First, the blood-brain barrier cells absorb and break down proteins in the myelin, and then they present fragments of these proteins on their surfaces with the help of protein clusters called major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Other protein fragments that can also activate T cells in other parts of the body did not affect the blood-brain barrier when they were presented by MHCs, which suggests that the effect could be specific to myelin proteins."

Once within the central nervous system (CNS), myelin-reactive T-cells induce severe neuronal and tissue damage and degeneration (<a href=\"#bib29\">Trapp et al., 1998</a>). During the initiation of the disease, myelin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are differentiated into effector T helper (Th) 1 or Th17 cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bailey et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib4\">Bielekova et al., 2000</a>).

Lymphocyte migration into the CNS parenchyma is a multi-step process that requires close contact between lymphocytes and BECs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ransohoff et al., 2003</a>). These cell-cell contacts are mediated by cell surface molecules on both the lymphocytes and BECs. During inflammation BECs upregulate the expression of the adhesion molecules Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)\u22121, Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)\u22121 and Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), which are necessary for the firm adhesion of lymphocytes to the endothelium as well as for the trans-migration process (<a href=\"#bib18\">Larochelle et al., 2011</a>). Although these adhesion molecules expressed by BECs have been shown important for the transendothelial migration of leukocytes, the complexity of this interaction and the molecules involved remain poorly understood."

Using an adoptive transfer model of murine MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, EAE) it was demonstrated that only activated myelin-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells accumulated in the CNS parenchyma, while non-CNS-specific T-cells failed to infiltrate (<a href=\"#bib1\">Archambault et al., 2005</a>). Furthermore, expression of MHC-II on the recipient cells appeared to be required for CNS infiltration, as the myelin-specific T-cells did not transmigrate over CNS vascular endothelium when adoptively transferred in MHC-II deficient mice. However, whether the antigen-specific signal was provided by APCs or BECs was not elucidated. Also infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells into the brain was shown to be an antigen-specific process: haemagglutinin-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were only detected in the CNS upon intra-cerebral injection of cognate, but not control, peptides in an haemagglutinin T-cell receptor transgenic mouse (<a href=\"#bib10\">Galea et al., 2007</a>). A role for BECs in providing the antigen signal to T-cells was claimed by showing luminal expression of MHC-I on BECs and the fact that intra-venous injection of a blocking MHC-I antibody significantly reduced the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration. However, since a soluble, nominal MHC-I epitope was used as antigen, exogenous binding of these peptides to MHC-I molecules on other cells in the CNS, or even in CNS-draining lymph nodes cannot be excluded (<a href=\"#bib33\">Weller et al., 1996</a>). Thus, so far no direct evidence is provided for a role of BECs in processing and presenting CNS-derived antigens during inflammatory conditions."

We here demonstrate that inflamed BECs take up and process myelin via the endo-lysosomal degradation pathway in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, these myelin-derived antigens are presented in <i>de-novo</i> expressed MHC-II molecules and facilitate the migration of antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 pathogenic T-cells through the brain endothelium. Better insight into the events that trigger T-cell migration into the brain is crucial for our understanding of MS pathogenesis and will aid the development of new treatments to prevent T-cell infiltrating the CNS."

Resting, non-inflamed, human BECs express MHC-I and PD-L1 while MHC-II, CD40 and VCAM\u22121 are expressed at low levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Upon inflammatory activation, BECs express high levels of VCAM\u22121, and significantly increased the expression levels of MHC-II (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Similarly, CD40 expression was increased upon activation. Both MHC-I and PD-L1 were highly expressed on resting as well as on activated BECs. Expression of the classical co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were undetectable on resting and activated BECs (data not shown). Comparable changes in phenotype were observed when BECs were activated using IFN-\u03b3 instead of TNF\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) Together, these results confirm and extend previous findings (<a href=\"#bib17\">Wheway et al., 2013</a>) and indicate that BECs are equipped to present antigens under inflammatory conditions. Up-regulation of MHC class II molecules via inflammation induced CIITA activity has been associated with increased susceptibility of EAE, yet how increased MHC-II expression contributes to actual disease has so far not been described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Reith et al., 2005</a>)."

We therefore incubated BECs with fluorescent labeled myelin for different time-points under resting and inflammatory conditions and determined myelin uptake by flow cytometry. As depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>\u00a0a time-dependent increase in the proportion of myelin<sup>+</sup> BECs was observed. Moreover, this process is not significantly affected by treatment with inflammatory stimuli as activated BECs showed a similar amount of internalized myelin as resting BECs. Using imaging flow cytometry, we assessed that BECs that were able to capture myelin increased the number of myelin particles over time to a maximum of three myelin particles/cell after a 24\u2009hr incubation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Moreover, the average amount of myelin particles per cell was the same in both resting and inflammatory conditions, again, demonstrating that this process is not significantly affected by treatment with inflammatory stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>).

This intracellular route allows optimal processing of exogenous protein antigens and transfer of antigen-derived peptides to the MHC-II compartment for loading and subsequent presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. To determine whether internalized myelin is shuttled to these compartments in BECs, myelin-treated BECs were stained with antibodies against EEA1 (a marker of early endosomes) and LAMP1 (a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes) to measure co-staining with myelin using imaging flow cytometry. We observed that myelin co-localized with both EEA1 and LAMP1 as shown by a high co-localization score (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The co-localization with both markers was higher at 24\u00a0hr of exposure to myelin compared to 4\u00a0hr. Since the increase of the co-localization score for myelin-EEA1 was not as strong as shown for myelin-LAMP1 at 24\u00a0hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), this suggests that at that time point the majority of myelin was present in lysosomes. However, non-internalized myelin fragments that are attached to the cell membrane, could potentially be 'internalized' as a consequence of trypsinization of adherent BECs. To demonstrate that myelin is actively taken up by BECs, we analyzed myelin uptake and intracellular routing in adherent BECs using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Similar to our experiments using imaging flow cytometry, we observe that 24\u00a0hr after loading of adherent BECs a proportion of cells show internalized myelin. Furthermore, it is clear that internalized myelin is present within LAMP1 positive vesicles and not with EEA1 positive organelles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013I</a>)."

Notably, an increased expression of MHC-II was observed on cerebral blood vessels of mice in the active phase of EAE when compared to control adjuvant injected mice (CFA; not shown), demonstrating that mBECs, similar to the human counterparts, are properly equipped to present antigens to pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Since in the brain of MS patients and of EAE mice mainly Th1 and Th17 effector cells have been found (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carbajal et al., 2015</a>), we generated MOG-specific Th1 and Th17 in-vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and used them in a trans-well setting with myelin-loaded activated mBECs. To allow sufficient antigen processing, mBECs were loaded with myelin in the presence of TNF\u03b1 24\u00a0hr prior the co-culture with T-cells. To control for antigen-specificity, mBECs were loaded with the non-CNS antigen ovalbumin (OVA). Loading of mBECs with OVA did not significantly induce the migration of any of the MOG-specific T-cell subsets, similar to medium-control mBECs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). However, when mBECs were loaded with myelin, a significant increase in migrated Th1 and Th17 cells was observed, demonstrating that processing and presentation of myelin-derived peptides by mBECs specifically leads to migration of antigen-specific T-cells. Addition of an MHC-II-blocking antibody during the migration period significantly reduced the trans-migration of both Th1 and Th17 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>), further providing evidence that presentation of myelin-derived antigens in MHC-II by mBECs facilitates T-cell migration. Using the nominal epitope for 2D2\u2009T-cells (<i>i.e.</i> MOG<sub>35\u201355</sub>) to load mBECs with, similar results were obtained as with myelin-loaded mBECs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Moreover, our observation that OVA-specific Th1 and Th17 only trans-migrated when encountering OVA-loaded BECs and not when co-cultured with MOG<sub>35\u201355</sub>-loaded or medium control BECs substantiates the finding that T-cell migration over the BEC monolayer occurs in an antigen-specific manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). These data demonstrate that brain endothelial cells can internalize antigen and promote antigen-specific T cell transmigration in vitro."

Although these results could be due to the lack of activation of auto-reactive T-cells by peripheral APCs, the failure to induce disease by adoptive transfer of activated T-cells in this study could also be explained by the lack of a functional antigen processing machinery in BECs since trafficking of injected, ex-vivo activated, T-cells into the brain is impaired. Thus, together with our novel data, it seems likely that antigen-presentation by the brain endothelium facilitates the entry of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells into the brain. This phenomenon has also been proposed, but was never demonstrated, in other diseases suffering from the infiltration and destruction of tissue by auto-reactive T-cells. In Type 1 Diabetes, pancreatic islet antigen expression was shown to be a key factor in governing the ability of the autoantigen-specific T-cells to accumulate in the pancreatic islets (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hamilton-Williams et al., 2003</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Van Halteren et al., 2005</a>). Importantly, using human T-cell clones and humanized mice, it was demonstrated that only beta cell-specific T-cells reached the pancreatic islets where they destroyed the insulin-producing beta cells. By contrast, diabetes unrelated T-cells retained at the peri-vascular sites (<a href=\"#bib30\">Unger et al., 2012</a>), demonstrating that beta-cell-specific T-cells, present in the circulation, need to cross the endothelium to access the pancreatic islets. Whether antigen-specific T-cell entry favors the entry of non-tissue specific T-cells is still a matter of debate. The entry of encephalitogenic T-cells into the brain has been shown to pave the way for non-CNS-specific T-cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lees et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib21\">Ludowyk et al., 1992</a>) yet the latter subset remained in an inactive state."

This observation is also different to findings on professional APCs such as dendritic cells, which mainly internalize antigens being in an immature state. The fact that BECs maintain to internalize and process exogenous antigens in an activated state is advantageous during infection-induced inflammation in the brain (<i>e.g.</i> meningitis) as it will facilitate the presence of antigen-specific effector T-cells to resolve the unwanted infection. However, this continuous facilitation of immune cell entry into the CNS is destructive in case of MS."

                                "text": "Overall, our results demonstrate that BECs can take up and process myelin particles in a time-dependent manner. Although the focus of the present study was to examine whether antigen-presentation by BECs contributes to transmigration of myelin-reactive T cells, it can be speculated that uptake of myelin, consisting of large particles, by brain endothelial cells predominantly occurs via phagocytosis. BECs have been shown to use different endocytosis mechanisms to internalize particles, which is dependent on the size and composition of the particle (<a href=\"#bib8\">Faille et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Falcone et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Georgieva et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the upregulation of MHC-II expression under inflammatory conditions reinforces the idea of a non-professional antigen presenting cell role. Although we do not provide direct evidence for processing and presentation of internalized myelin, our data strongly suggest that myelin-derived antigens can be presented by brain endothelial cells in MHC-II to antigen-specific T cell subsets, aiding in the diapedesis of these cells in an MHC-II dependent fashion. These results demonstrate that the brain endothelium is an active contributor to disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, these findings have major implications in neuro-inflammatory disorders such as MS, since increased immune cell trafficking has a detrimental effect in disease progression. Therapies directed at antigen processing and presentation by BECs could be effective to dampen unwanted immune cell infiltration in MS."

They study myelin antigens and EC derived from the CNS in a series of mostly in vitro studies. The authors present data to show that EC from the CNS pulsed with myelin, but not ovalbumin, stimulate the transmigration of myelin-specific 2D2 T cells in Transwell assays. The stimulated transmigration is blocked by antibodies against MHCII. The interpretation is that EC internalize antigen and present it on MHCII to stimulate the antigen-specific T cells. This is an interesting idea, although the concept of antigen presentation by MHCII-expressing endothelial cells has been studied in the setting of transplantation for decades by Jordan Pober's group, and the idea of antigen presentation by BBB EC has been studied, as well, although most of the authors concluded that confluent BBB EC could not successfully present antigen by themselves. (See below). As the data in this manuscript stand, they are consistent with the premise that BBB EC take up myelin, process it in lysosomes, present it to cognate T cells, and stimulate antigen-specific T cell migration. However, the data fall short of direct proof. I do not ask for more experiments. However, I believe better versions of the experiments they have performed are required to prove their point."

The BBB endothelium is supposed to show very low levels of endocytic activity. How are the antigens taken up and processed? Indeed, several reports show that stimulation of T cells by MHCII expressing BBB EC is far more efficient when the EC are subconfluent than when they are confluent (e.g. J Neuroimmunol. 1995 Sep;61(2):231-9) and that expression of high levels of MHCII by IFNgamma are required for optimum stimulation (J Neuroimmunol. 1999 Jan 1;93(1-2):81-91 and J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2000 Feb;59(2):129-36). In contrast, uptake of myelin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and delivery to lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) is said to be independent of cytokine activation in this study. The authors should discuss this."

Moreover, either the authors have not explained their FRET assay correctly or are not using FRET correctly. In any case, what would be required to show that the EC are processing antigen correctly would be to show that the proper peptides are expressed on MHCII on the surface of these EC in a functional manner. This would ideally require demonstrating that the peptides are expressed on the MHC. This is difficult. I would settle for showing that they can stimulate the antigen-specific proliferation of antigen-specific T cells, not just stimulate migration in a transwell."

This does show some biological relevance and is blocked by anti-MHCII antibody. However, the assumption is that the increased migration is due to presentation of cognate antigen by the EC, and this is never demonstrated (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Moreover, the proper control would be to show that either OVA is processed and presented to the same extent by these EC as is myelin and/or to show that OVA-specific T cells would transmigrate the EC pulsed with OVA, but not those pulsed with myelin. The T cells added to the assay have been activated by dendritic cells and expanded with IL-2. They are highly activated. My understanding is that the antigen-specific T cells that would come into the CNS in response to myelin antigens presented by the BBB EC in multiple sclerosis or EAE would be memory cells but not activated at the time but become activated upon presentation of their cognate antigen by the endothelial cells. What happens if the T cells are allowed to rest before being added to the Transwells?"

Specifically, the authors examine the underlying basis for auto-reactive myelin-specific inflammatory T cell migration into the brain, a critical event in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Vascular endothelial cells have long been recognized as a type of non-professional antigen presenting cell that may be able to present peptide antigens via MHCII to influence antigen-specific responses in effector/memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Studies in MS, and murine models of MS, have suggested that the brain endothelial cells (BEC), which T cells must migrate across in order to enter the brain, may act to selectively recruit myelin-reactive T cells through their ability to present processed myelin peptide via MHCII. However, existing studies have yet to provide direct evidence for such functions. In the current studies the authors demonstrate in vitro, through flow cytometric methods, that BEC are able to constitutively uptake myelin protein where they are targeted to classical MHCII peptide processing compartments (i.e., endosomes and lysosomes). They further show that BEC upregulated MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 in response to the inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. The authors go on to demonstrate for the first time that such intact myelin is processes and functionally presented to Th1 and Th17 cells in order to promote their migration across the endothelium in an MHCII-dependent manner. These studies provide new unambiguous evidence that endothelial cells play active roles as non-professional APC in MS pathogenesis and point toward new therapeutic strategies for this disease. This study is generally well performed and presented. However, a couple of important issues/questions remain to be addressed."

These all use flow cytometric methods (including imaging-based Amnis imaging cytometry). There is some concern that the transition from highly flattened adherent cells to trypsinized cells in suspension (i.e., in order to perform flow cytometry) will almost certainly drive some degree of surface membrane internalization to accommodate the massive reduction in the cell-surface area to volume ratio, that may influence the degree of observed myelin internalization. Thus, this analysis would be strengthened if it also included complementary imaging studies of adherent endothelial cells (e.g., including myelin, EEA1 and/or LAMP1 with Pearson's co-localization analysis)."

If these portions of plasma membrane had myelin fragments attached, they would appear as \"internalized\" even though they were only internalized as part of the procedure.

The results indicate that the myelin fluorescence signal was intracellular, demonstrating that BECs are able to efficiently internalize myelin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 4</a>). Using Imaging flow cytometry we could clearly see that myelin was internalized and not located on the membrane. However, the reviewer is correct that if there was myelin attached to the membrane but not internalized at the moment of trypsinization, this signal would be gone and would be undetectable as not-internalized material. We therefore performed, as suggested, experiments on adherent BECs. Using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CSLM) we ascertained that myelin is indeed internalized by the BECs and does not remain on the membrane. Furthermore, it is clear that 24 hours after loading, internalized myelin is contained within LAMP1 positive vesicles and not with EEA1 positive organelles (Author response image B-G), which corroborate our observations made with Imaging flow cytometry."

However, it has been reported that the size of a lysosome differs depending on cell type, and in most cells lysosomes can be up to 1.5 \u03bcm in diameter (L\u00fcllmann-Rauch R. History and morphology of the lysosome. In: Saftig P., editor.Lysosomes. New York: Springer; 2005). It has also been reported that lysosomes increase in size as a result of accumulation of undigested material (Appelqvist et al., J Mol Cell Biol. 2013). To support this statement, we measured the size of myelin containing (LAMP1-positive) lysosomes as well as none myelin containing lysosomes. The average size of myelin containing lysosomes is 1.4 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b5m while the size of none myelin containing lysosomes is around 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m (<i>P</i>=0.004; N=10; please see <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 7</a>)."
