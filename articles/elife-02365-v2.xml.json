Upon plant tissue disruption, these glucosides are hydrolyzed to a reactive hydroxynitrile that releases toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Yet many mite and lepidopteran species can thrive on plants defended by cyanogenic glucosides. The nature of the enzyme known to detoxify HCN to \u03b2-cyanoalanine in arthropods has remained enigmatic. Here we identify this enzyme by transcriptome analysis and functional expression. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene is a member of the cysteine synthase family horizontally transferred from bacteria to phytophagous mites and Lepidoptera. The recombinant mite enzyme had both \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthase and cysteine synthase activity but enzyme kinetics showed that cyanide detoxification activity was strongly favored. Our results therefore suggest that an ancient horizontal transfer of a gene originally involved in sulfur amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria was co-opted by herbivorous arthropods to detoxify plant produced cyanide."

Upon plant tissue disruption, these glucosides are hydrolyzed to a reactive hydroxynitrile that releases toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Yet many mite and lepidopteran species can thrive on plants defended by cyanogenic glucosides. The nature of the enzyme known to detoxify HCN to \u03b2-cyanoalanine in arthropods has remained enigmatic. Here we identify this enzyme by transcriptome analysis and functional expression. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene is a member of the cysteine synthase family horizontally transferred from bacteria to phytophagous mites and Lepidoptera. The recombinant mite enzyme had both \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthase and cysteine synthase activity but enzyme kinetics showed that cyanide detoxification activity was strongly favored. Our results therefore suggest that an ancient horizontal transfer of a gene originally involved in sulfur amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria was co-opted by herbivorous arthropods to detoxify plant produced cyanide."

Cyanogenesis is one of the most ancient and widespread of these defenses, and more than 2500 plant species are known to synthesize cyanogenic glucosides and cyanolipids as phytoanticipins (constitutive defense compounds present in the plant prior to herbivore attack). Upon tissue disruption by herbivore feeding, cyanogenic glucosides are degraded by the plant \u03b2-glucosidases and \u03b1-hydroxynitrile lyases, which results in the release of toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and other toxic products such as their aglycones (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gleadow and Woodrow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Poulton, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Spencer, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zagrobelny et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The released cyanide is a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and has a disruptive effect on various metabolic pathways (<a href=\"#bib39\">Solomonson, 1981</a>), thus providing a broad defense against generalist herbivores."

A well-documented case of co-evolution is found in insect lepidopteran specialists that sequester the ingested cyanogenic glucosides in their own defense against predators. Remarkably, cyanogenic compounds have become so crucial for some species such as burnet moths (Zygaenidae) that they not only sequester, but also synthesize these compounds de novo by convergent evolution of the biosynthetic pathways (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jensen et al., 2011</a>). Next to sequestration, other mechanisms have evolved to cope with the toxic effects of HCN, such as avoiding the ingestion of cyanogenic compounds or detoxifying HCN upon plant release (<a href=\"#bib11\">Despres et al., 2007</a>). In animals, HCN is thought to be detoxified by two main pathways. The enzyme rhodanese converts cyanide into thiocyanate, but this biochemical reaction is not very common and thought to be inefficient (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beesley et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis and Nahrstedt, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Long and Brattsten, 1982</a>). Alternatively, the conversion of HCN and cysteine into \u03b2-cyanoalanine and sulfide has been suggested as the main detoxification pathway in arthropods (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This is supported by several biochemical surveys showing a correlation between \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthesis and HCN exposure in lepidopteran species tolerant to HCN (<a href=\"#bib33\">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stauber et al., 2012</a>). However, the enzyme that catalyzes this crucial reaction in arthropods has not been identified to date. The conversion of HCN into \u03b2-cyanoalanine by an enzyme called \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthase (CAS) has been best studied in bacteria and plants that need to protect themselves from HCN during the synthesis of cyanogenic glucosides or ethylene. The enzymes responsible for CAS activity also have cysteine synthase activity (CYS) and are referred to as CYS or CAS depending on their substrate specificity. CYS catalyzes the conversion of <i>O</i>-acetylserine into cysteine, an essential final step in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway unique for plants and bacteria (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonner et al., 2005</a>). Animals synthesize cysteine by a different pathway and use related enzymes such as cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CGL), which form together with CAS and CYS a group of pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate dependent enzymes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Finkelstein et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Here we identify the enzyme responsible for detoxification of cyanide to \u03b2-cyanoalanine in a spider mite and show that this enzyme is horizontally acquired from bacteria and is also widely distributed in Lepidoptera."

They were embedded with high node support within bacterial cysteine synthase sequences, indicative of a horizontal gene transfer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The most closely related sequences are from bacteria that belong to the \u03b1- and \u03b2-Proteobacteria, two of which are <i>Methylobacterium</i> species, free-living epiphytic bacteria known to establish endophytic colonies. These species are reported to be transferred from the plant to phytophagous insects and to survive inside arthropod hosts (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kutschera, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rampelotti-Ferreira et al., 2010</a>), facilitating a potential horizontal gene transfer. Alternatively, Proteobacteria are known endosymbionts of arthropods and often reside in the reproductive organs for vertical transmission to following generations (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wernegreen, 2002</a>). Because of this intimate relationship, successful horizontal gene transfer is more likely to occur (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hotopp, 2011</a>).

Both genes contain introns with splice sites confirmed by EST or RNA-seq data (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grbic et al., 2011</a>, GenBank: LIBEST_025606, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). <i>Tetur10g01580</i> encodes a nudix hydrolase (CDD: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid=cl00447\">cl00447</a>) highly similar to other arthropod nudix hydrolases (BLASTp hits with E-value &lt;1e<sup>\u221245</sup>). To rule out that the linkage of <i>Tu-CAS</i> to these spliced genes is a genome assembly artefact, we took several independent genomic approaches. First, we remapped the <i>T. urticae</i> Sanger reads used for the genome assembly of the London strain of <i>T. urticae</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grbic et al., 2011</a>) and examined the Illumina read coverage of the <i>Tu-CAS</i> region in two re-sequenced strains (EtoxR and Montpellier) that are geographically distinct from the London strain (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grbic et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Van Leeuwen et al., 2012</a>). Neither Sanger nor Illumina-reads revealed any inconsistencies in the <i>Tu-CAS</i> region in any of these strains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Second, using a PCR approach, we amplified a 6 kb genomic region bracketing <i>Tu-CAS</i> with the surrounding spliced genes (<i>tetur10g01550</i> and <i>tetur10g01580</i>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using a similar strategy we also amplified a 6 kb region in the closely related spider mite <i>T. evansi</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and a nucleotide dot plot between the amplified region of these two species showed clear synteny and the absence of discontinuity around the <i>CAS</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This would not be expected by bacterial contamination of either genome. Last, gene compositions of <i>T. urticae</i> and bacteria were analyzed by determining both the GC-content at the synonymous third codon position (GC3) and the overall GC-content (GC) of the genes to look if amelioration occurred. Amelioration is the process by which the DNA composition of the newly acquired gene becomes homogenized to match the composition of the recipient genome (all genes in the recipient genome are subject to the same mutational processes) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lawrence and Ochman, 1997</a>). Indeed, the GC/GC3 content of <i>Tu-CAS</i> was most similar to the GC/GC3 content of genes from the <i>T. urticae</i> genome, and quite distinct from the GC/GC3 content of genes (including the <i>CYS/CAS</i> genes) from the three annotated bacterial genomes in the closest sister clade to the apparent monophyletic arthropod clade (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that <i>Tu-CAS</i> is a sequence integrated in the genome of <i>T. urticae</i> and does not represent bacterial contamination. Sequence data is available at Genbank (accession numbers: KF981736 and KF981737)."

Subsequent biochemical assays confirmed that Tu-CAS catalyzes both reactions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In order to determine which of the two reactions (cysteine synthesis, CYS and \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthesis, CAS) was favored by the Tu-CAS enzyme, we calculated the ratio of the specificity constants for each reaction. The specificity constant k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> defines, at any concentration, the specificity of an enzyme for a particular substrate. The CAS/CYS ratio of the specificity constants was 33.7, showing that CAS activity was strongly favored over CYS activity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). (The ratio was calculated from the respective values of V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>, as k<sub>cat</sub> = V<sub>max</sub>/[E] and as the reactions were measured with the same enzyme preparation.) This preferred CAS activity is typical of known plant CAS enzymes and clearly different from CYS enzymes (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yamaguchi et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wada et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bogicevic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yi et al., 2012</a>). Enzymatic activity was dependent on pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate as a cofactor, and the substrate-dependent formation of \u03b2-cyanoalanine was further confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and LC-MS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

                        "text": "In arthropods, the ability to detoxify HCN plays a crucial ecological role and is thought to have allowed the exploitation of cyanogenic plants by circumventing the toxic effects of HCN. We have shown here that the two-spotted spider mite increases transcript levels of a horizontally transferred \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthase upon adaptation on cyanogenic bean. Phylogenetic evidence alone does not constitute strong evidence for horizontal gene transfer (HGT), because in the absence of introns in the sequence, a contamination of the mite genome sequence with a sequence from a bacterial symbiont or commensal cannot be excluded. However, the results of mite genomic analysis, codon amelioration, synteny and genomic PCR, combined with the phylogenetic evidence, unambiguously prove that <i>T. urticae CAS</i> has a bacterial origin and was laterally transferred and incorporated into the mite genome prior to the divergence in the Tetranychidae. A homologous lateral gene transfer has also occurred in Lepidoptera (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) raising the question of the time and number of HGT events needed to explain the phylogenetic pattern of distribution of the <i>CYS/CAS</i> genes. Several hypotheses can be discussed. (a) A single HGT to a common ancestor of mites and insects, followed by selective losses resulting in the present phylogenetic distribution. The broad sampling of arthropod species that revealed the absence of any <i>CYS/CAS</i>-like sequence (even as a distant recognizable trace) argues against the origin of the gene in the common ancestor of tetranychid mites and Lepidoptera, followed by multiple independent losses. These losses would have to be numerous: seven in the hexapods (Trichoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera/Strepsiptera, Hemiptera/Heteroptera/Thysanoptera/Phthiraptera, Orthoptera, Odonata/Ephemeroptera) and six further in other arthropods (Copepoda/Branchiopoda, Myriapoda, Aranea, Scorpiones, Metastigmata and Mesostigmata). This figure of 13 losses is an absolute minimum that implies that the loss occurred each time at the origin of the lineage, that is before any speciation beyond the point of coalescence. A loss later in the history of each lineage would rapidly increase the total number of losses. We strongly believe that this hypothesis is not parsimonious, and therefore that there was no <i>CYS/CAS</i> gene in the common ancestor of mites and Lepidoptera. (b) Alternatively, two HGT events might have occurred (one to a mite ancestor, one to a lepidopteran ancestor) or (c) a single HGT from a donor bacterial species, followed by a transfer between a mite and a lepidopteran. These two hypotheses are impossible to distinguish based on the topology of the tree (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The sampling of bacterial species phylogenetically close to the presumed donor species is too shallow at present. The apparent monophyly of the arthropod <i>CAS</i> gene may be due to the fact that both the mite and the insect gene came from very closely related bacteria, but these bacteria are not represented in the tree. A future survey of Proteobacteria likely to be associated with arthropods (directly or through a plant host) may resolve this question by finding several potential bacterial donor species that would invalidate the apparent monophyly (i.e., split the tree at the point of arthropod coalescence). The transfer from a lepidopteran to mite is improbable, because the mite sequence would branch with the closest relative to the lepidopteran donor, rather than being basal. Conversely, we cannot exclude the transfer from a mite to a lepidopteran, as sampling within the Prostigmata is extremely limited. We therefore favor hypothesis (b), with a very old transfer to an ancestral lepidopteran, and a second transfer to an ancestral mite. Current sampling of mite species is insufficient to give a good estimate of time, but we note the absence of a CAS enzyme in Mesostigmata (typically parasitic and predatory mites) and Metastigmata (ticks), and transfer is likely to have occurred after the split of Prostigmata in the Lower Devonian about 400 MYA (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dabert et al., 2010</a>). The hypothesis of multiple transfers is also compatible with the presence of a <i>CYS</i>-like sequence in the mealybug <i>Planococcus citri</i>, apparently derived from its endosymbiont (<a href=\"#bib21\">Husnik et al., 2013</a>). In that case, the phylogenetic tree clearly distinguishes the HGT event from that under study here."

The importance of the laterally acquired gene for HCN detoxification in those species was not previously apparent. These species of Papilionoidea, like burnet moths, not only thrive on cyanogenic plants, but have themselves evolved the ability to synthesize cyanogenic compounds de novo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jensen et al., 2011</a>) that now have crucial functions in their life history. Cyanogenesis serves in predator defense by releasing HCN, but also stores reduced nitrogen that can be mobilized for chitin synthesis, and plays a role in mate choice by determining the attractiveness of nuptial gifts from male to female partners (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zagrobelny et al., 2007</a>). Our results support the early idea that CAS activity is needed for the exploitation of cyanogenic glucosides in insects (<a href=\"#bib33\">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Witthohn and Naumann, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zagrobelny et al., 2008</a>) whether they are sequestered from the plant, or synthesized de novo. Higher \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthase activity in <i>Spodoptera eridania</i> than in <i>Trichoplusia ni</i> is related to higher cyanide tolerance (<a href=\"#bib33\">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</a>), and this enzyme activity is widespread in Lepidoptera (<a href=\"#bib48\">Witthohn and Naumann, 1987</a>)."

When <i>Pieris rapae</i> feeds on a cyanogenic (dhurrin-containing) plant that this species does not normally consume, an increased production of \u03b2-cyanoalanine and thiocyanate is observed, thus implicating both a CAS and a rhodanese activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stauber et al., 2012</a>). It was therefore proposed that the ability of <i>P. rapae</i> to metabolize HCN allowed the primary host transfer from Fabales to Brassicales (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stauber et al., 2012</a>). The gene for either CAS or rhodanese has not been identified in arthropods before, and their respective role in detoxification of HCN is not formally demonstrated. There is no close homologue of the known rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase) gene in <i>T. urticae</i> or in Lepidoptera. However, we identified <i>Tu-CAS</i> and functionally demonstrated that the enzyme it encodes converts HCN to \u03b2-cyanoalanine in vitro. Such evidence is difficult to obtain in vivo with mites, as it would be difficult to exclude the possibility that a plant or a bacterial enzyme rather than the mite enzyme catalyzes the reaction in vivo. We argue that the presence of the same gene in lepidopteran species that display this activity in vivo (<a href=\"#bib33\">Meyers and Ahmad, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stauber et al., 2012</a>) is strong evidence for the function of the laterally transferred <i>CAS</i> gene. It will be of great interest to confirm that the homologous <i>CAS</i> genes of Lepidoptera that we identified indeed encode a \u03b2-cyanoalanine synthase, and to provide evidence of its protective role against HCN poisoning."

To date, nematodes were the only animal species thought to synthesize cysteine independently from methionine by CYS activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Budde and Roth, 2011</a>). However, nematode CYS sequences grouped with plants and oomycetes, clearly outside the arthropod-bacterial clade, suggestive of a different origin of CYS between metazoan subgroups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Duplications of <i>cys</i> genes were observed in nematodes, and indeed genetic evidence suggests that in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> cyanide resistance is conferred by the <i>cysl-2</i> gene, probably encoding an enzyme with CAS activity while <i>cysl-1</i> is a classical cysteine synthase gene (<a href=\"#bib7\">Budde and Roth, 2011</a>). The acquisition of an alternative cysteine biosynthesis route fits into previously documented horizontal gene transfers in <i>T. urticae</i> that include a cobalamin-independent methionine synthase gene, genes for carotenoid biosynthesis, as well as laterally acquired genes that likewise respond to host plant change such as intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases and a cyanase gene (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grbic et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wybouw et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dermauw et al., 2013</a>). The latter encodes an enzyme that decomposes cyanate (CNO<sup>\u2212</sup>), a bacterial or photochemical decomposition product of cyanide, to carbon dioxide and ammonia (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wybouw et al., 2012</a>). This enzyme may serve as a second line of spider mite defense against cyanogenic plants, or alternatively may have a regulatory function in the amino acid and pyrimidine metabolism as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wybouw et al., 2012</a>). For a polyphagous herbivore, horizontal gene transfer might play an important role in gaining independence from the varying plant nutrients and defense compounds. It remains unclear which reaction (CAS/CYS) of Tu-CAS provides the strongest adaptive advantage, but the CYS activity might be one of the reasons why these horizontally transferred genes have been retained in organisms that are at present not living on cyanogenic plants."

The CAS activity assay was a modification of the method of Hendrickson (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hendrickson and Conn, 1969</a>). The standard reaction was started with 0.5 ml of 0.01 M cysteine, 0.5 ml of 0.01 M sodium cyanide and 1.5 \u00b5g recombinant Tu-CAS. All CAS assays were performed at 37\u00b0C on a mechanical shaker. CAS activity was quantified by spectrophotometrically measuring the H<sub>2</sub>S formed at 650 nm (PowerWavex340, BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) by the method of Siegel (<a href=\"#bib38\">Siegel, 1965</a>). The CYS activity assay was based on <a href=\"#bib31\">Lunn et al., 1990</a> using 0.5 \u00b5g recombinant Tu-CAS per reaction. Standard substrate concentrations were 10 mM and 2 mM for <i>O</i>-acetylserine and sodium sulfide, respectively. The reaction product cysteine was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm by the method of Gaitonde (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gaitonde, 1967</a>). For both activity assays, the spontaneous formation of the measured reaction product and its potential presence in protein preparations was corrected by respectively non-enzyme controls and zero time point controls. Each experimental assay condition was analyzed using three independent and three technical replicates. Kinetic data was fitted to the Hill equation, from which the K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> values for <i>O</i>-acetylserine and cysteine were calculated for respectively the CYS and CAS reaction."

The standard reaction was executed in a 320 \u00b5l reaction volume at 37\u00b0C on a mechanical shaker in 1 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.5, with 80 \u00b5l of 7.5 mM cysteine and 80 \u00b5l of 15 mM sodium cyanide. Each reaction was started by adding 3.75 \u00b5g of recombinant protein and was terminated by snap freezing at different time points. No-substrate and no-enzyme controls were included in the analysis. Reaction mixtures were defrosted at 4\u00b0C and a 20 \u00b5l aliquot was spotted on a thin-layer chromatograph (HPTLC Silica gel 60 F<sub>254</sub>, Merck, Darmstadt Germany) and run with a mobile phase of (ethanol/28% ammonium hydroxide/water) with a (18/1/4) ratio. Five \u00b5g of \u03b2-cyanoalanine and cysteine were spotted as standards. After drying, the TLC plate was treated with a ninhydrin solution (20 g ninhydrin in 600 ml ethanol) for amino-acid visualization. In this validated TLC set-up (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yoshikawa et al., 2000</a>), cysteine and \u03b2-cyanoalanine can be identified both by color and relative mobility (Rf-value). \u03b2-cyanoalanine consistently displayed a blue-green color with a Rf value of around 0.8. In contrast, cysteine colored red and exhibited a consistent different Rf value."

A gradient elution program driven by a quarternary pump was used at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (injection volume: 20 \u00b5l).

The horizontally transferred gene has a proposed role in <i>T. uritcae's</i> detoxification of cyanide exposure from host plants. In general the external reviewers and the Reviewing editor found much that they liked about this work and recognized its novelty and relevance for a broad scientific audience. The paper appears to be important for our general understanding of the evolution of certain arthropods to colonize host plants that contain cyanogenic glucosides, and might lead to new genomics-enabled discoveries in other systems of plant-arthropod interactions. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The reviewers and the Reviewing editor found the paper convincing in its documentation of a CAS/CYS gene of likely bacterial origin integrated into the <i>T. urticae</i> genome. The biochemical characterization of the encoded <i>T. urticae</i> CAS/CYS enzyme also appears to be solid, although some additional data are requested to substantiate conclusions of product formation and enzyme kinetic properties (please see below). The reviewers and the Reviewing editor commented on a lack of discussion (or lack of data) to explain the phylogenetic pattern of a limited appearance of the CYS/CAS gene in <i>T. urticae</i> and only a relatively small number of Lepidoptera as presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. At the least, the Discussion of the paper needs to be substantially revised with a plausible explanation for this observation (please see below). However, if this important question regarding the phylogeny cannot be resolved with a new Discussion, additional data mining or generation of additional supporting data would be required to fill this critical gap in an otherwise interesting story."

Are there any? If not, does this suggest two separate horizontal gene transfer events?

For this, a comparison of the specificity constants (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) (a.k.a. second order rate constant) for each reaction was needed. The ratio of specificity constants (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> of CAS activity over k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> of CYS activity) strongly favored CAS activity over CYS activity. As k<sub>cat</sub> is directly proportional to V<sub>max</sub> (k<sub>cat</sub> = V<sub>max</sub>/[E]), the ratio is the same whether V<sub>max</sub> or k<sub>cat</sub> is used. The values given for the ratio of specificity constants are therefore identical and correct whether they are calculated from V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> or k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M.</sub> As the enzyme purity is not known precisely and this would introduce a systematic error, we calculated the V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> ratio for the mite enzyme, as it cancels out the enzyme concentration in the equation.

These indirect methods are based on the colorimetric determination of sulfide (<a href=\"#bib38\">Siegel 1965</a>). More directly, we have also shown the enzyme- and time-dependent formation of \u03b2-cyanoalanine after separation of reaction mixtures on TLC. This is especially powerful, as it allows the identification of \u03b2-cyanoalanine both by Rf value, and by a specific and strong color shift after treatment with a ninhydrin solution. The cyano group of \u03b2-cyanoalanine is responsible for a unique deep blue color (as also clear from the standard, see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, panel A, BCA standard). Finally, we scrapped the enzymatically produced \u03b2-cyanoalanine after separation of reaction mixtures from silica plates, and analyzed it by LC-MS. We showed that the elution time on LC and the characteristic ion of m/z = 113 which is [M-H]<sup>-</sup> of the \u03b2-cyanoalanine standard are also found in the enzymatic product. We have added figure panels to illustrate the LC-MS data as requested (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> panel B1 and B2)."
