However, complete circuit reconstruction is prohibitively slow and may not be necessary for many purposes such as comparing neuronal structure and connectivity among multiple animals. Here, we present an alternative strategy, targeted reconstruction of specific neuronal types. We used viral vectors to deliver peroxidase derivatives, which catalyze production of an electron-dense tracer, to genetically identify neurons, and developed a protocol that enhances the electron-density of the labeled cells while retaining the quality of the ultrastructure. The high contrast of the marked neurons enabled two innovations that speed data acquisition: targeted high-resolution reimaging of regions selected from rapidly-acquired lower resolution reconstruction, and an unsupervised segmentation algorithm. This pipeline reduces imaging and reconstruction times by two orders of magnitude, facilitating directed inquiry of circuit motifs."

However, complete circuit reconstruction is prohibitively slow and may not be necessary for many purposes such as comparing neuronal structure and connectivity among multiple animals. Here, we present an alternative strategy, targeted reconstruction of specific neuronal types. We used viral vectors to deliver peroxidase derivatives, which catalyze production of an electron-dense tracer, to genetically identify neurons, and developed a protocol that enhances the electron-density of the labeled cells while retaining the quality of the ultrastructure. The high contrast of the marked neurons enabled two innovations that speed data acquisition: targeted high-resolution reimaging of regions selected from rapidly-acquired lower resolution reconstruction, and an unsupervised segmentation algorithm. This pipeline reduces imaging and reconstruction times by two orders of magnitude, facilitating directed inquiry of circuit motifs."

ARTEMIS makes use of genetic engineering, serial-scanning electron microscopy, an enhanced chemical staining procedure and a new image processing approach. First, gene technology is used to selectively stain specific types of neurons in mice and flies. Then, a tissue sample is collected and treated with a chemical that enhances the electron density of the stained neurons, without disrupting the tissue\u2019s structure. Next, a labeled target neuron is imaged at relatively low resolution to reveal its overall structure. Small areas of that neuron are then re-imaged at higher resolution to map the connections between neurons. Lastly, an algorithm pieces together the individual images to produce a reconstruction of the cell."

Innovative light microscopic methods such as GRASP, trans-synaptic viral tracing and super-resolution imaging\u00a0enable visualization of synapses made on or by identified neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wickersham and Feinberg, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">T\u00f8nnesen and N\u00e4gerl, 2013</a>). At present, however, only electron microscopy (EM) provides sufficient resolution to visualize the complete complement of synapses that neurons form and receive. Indeed, large-scale reconstructions from serial sections have provided deep insights into neuronal circuit principles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bock et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Morgan et al., 2016</a>) . The optimal strategy is to collect serial sections containing all circuit elements and image them at nanometer resolution. Processes in the imaged volumes are then segmented to reconstruct the neurons (or parts of neurons) they contain. Advances in sectioning, imaging and segmentation methods make so-called 'saturated' reconstruction of volumes around 1000 \u03bcm<sup>3</sup> feasible (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kasthuri et al., 2015</a>). Even these modest volumes remain challenging, however, and when multiple samples must be compared -e.g., controls vs. mutant or treated vs. untreated animals - this approach is currently out of reach\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Plaza et al., 2014</a>)."

For example, neuronal activity can be monitored using calcium indicators, then neurons with particular patterns of activity can be relocated in thin sections and reconstructed\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bock et al., 2011</a>). This method is, however, technically demanding and infeasible in many tissues. We therefore devised an alternative approach to sparse reconstruction that relies on marking specific cells with an electron-dense tracer. We then exploit the high contrast provided by the tracer to speed up imaging and reconstruction, which are currently the rate-limiting steps in connectomic analysis. Our pipeline includes the following series of steps: (a) tagging a specific cell type with a genetically encoded EM tracer, (b) enhancing the electron-density of the stain without compromising ultrastructure of the surrounding tissue, (c) imaging the cell rapidly at relatively low resolution, (d) re-imaging selected small volumes at higher resolution to map connectivity and (e) segmenting the cell using a novel algorithm that is reliable, fast and does not require computationally intense pre-training. Together, the gains from targeted reimaging and unsupervised segmentation decrease the time required for reconstruction by over two orders of magnitude. We call the method ARTEMIS for Assisted Reconstruction Technique for Electron Microscopic Interrogation of Structure."

Two to four weeks after infection, retinas were reacted with DAB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and examined light-microscopically, revealing intense labeling of RGCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c,d</a>). Retinas were then processed for EM (see Methods). Unexpectedly, levels of electron-dense precipitate were so low that stained processes could not be traced reliably (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). Numerous alterations to balance peroxidase activity and ultrastructural quality failed to improve matters: when ultrastructure was adequately preserved, staining for peroxidase was poor, and when reaction product was adequate, synaptic structures were poorly preserved. This difficulty may have been less apparent in previous studies using injected native HRP, which has substantially higher activity than the recombinant proteins we use."

We reasoned that radicals produced during the long peroxidase reaction might oxidize the relevant functional groups in the polymer, leaving it photon-absorbent but inert to osmium. If this were true, reduction of functional groups on the polymer could restore reactivity to osmium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). We tested this hypothesis in transfected HEK cells. When cells were treated with the protocol we had used for retina, the\u00a0precipitate was clearly visible by light but not electron microscopy. However, when the HEK cells were treated with a mild reducing agent (5\u2009mM sodium hydrosulfite) between the peroxidase reaction and osmication, they were highly electron-dense (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f,g</a>). This was the case using either conventional osmium staining or an enhanced 'double osmium' staining protocol (rOTO), although the latter showed a slight improvement probably due to the change in the\u00a0redox state of osmium tetroxide (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1c\u2013f</a>; see Methods). A similar effect was observed in erythrocytes, in which endogenous heme catalyzes the DAB reaction (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g\u2013j</a>)."

As expected, APX and APEX2NES labeled the cytoplasm diffusely (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1j</a>) while erHRP labeled membrane-bound intracellular compartments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1n</a>). Thus they could be used as orthogonal labels, although we have not yet pursued this application. The strength of the signal allowed us to identify small stained dendritic profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1k,o</a>) and to view the terminals of RGCs in the superior colliculus, approximately 1 cm from the somata (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1l</a>). Remarkably, the reduction protocol actually improved the visualization of the ultrastructure irrespective of peroxidase expression or DAB treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h</a>). Part of the improvement resulted from an increase in the reactivity of membranes to osmium, thereby enhancing membrane-cytoplasm contrast (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This improvement is also visible in the staining strength of synaptic densities (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement\u00a04a,b</a>). When we asked blind-to-condition observers to judge the quality of synapses between both conditions, the reduced tissue was selected ~3 times more frequently than unreduced tissue (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4e</a>).

Rapidly imaging every 10<sup>th</sup> section (270 nm separation), at 30 nm resolution was sufficient for mapping a J-RGC dendrite (144 sections covering &gt;\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup>, imaged in 22\u2009hr; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>).

However, sections generated using ATUM are collected on wafers, and can be re-imaged; a program, Wafer-Mapper (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hayworth et al., 2014</a>), facilitates returning to the same place on a given section with micron-level precision. This feature allows targeted imaging at high resolution of areas chosen from the rapidly acquired, lower resolution reconstruction, thereby substantially reducing imaging time. To test this multi-scale approach, we focused on the SACs, whose dendrites can be less than 100 nm in diameter. We selected a heavily-labeled ~5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> volume from the overview-resolution reconstruction of ~2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> and acquired a high-resolution (4 nm/pixel) data set in 250\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3i</a>). Compared to a completely high-resolution approach, this amounts to a 40-fold reduction in imaging time. More importantly, it expedited reconstruction, the current time-limiting step in connectomics (<a href=\"#bib24\">Plaza et al., 2014</a>), by constraining efforts to defined regions of interest. We manually traced and reconstructed the SAC plexus in this volume, observing multiple SAC-SAC interactions, dendritic fasciculation in the SAC plexus and dendritic branching (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3j,k</a> and data not shown)."

Our algorithm is fast, parameterized and does not rely on the supervised machine learning training regimes currently required for lower contrast material (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kasthuri et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, Materials and methods). We tested the algorithm using 401 sections from the high-resolution dataset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3i</a>). We hand-segmented a set of 444 APEX2 positive segments, and then compared these results to those obtained computationally. We calculated a recall statistic of 91.8% for the 2D segmentation portion of the algorithm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,c</a>). All missed segments were small (on average 45\u00a0\u00d7\u00a042 pixels), and were seldom necessary to establish connectivity. Consistent with human inferred segmentation, the analysis of segment adjacency in local neighborhoods can make connections in regions with small gaps. To test the accuracy of the algorithm for longer (&gt;50\u2009\u03bcm) processes, we segmented and reconstructed a dendritic branch of a starburst amacrine cell. Our algorithm could reconstruct the main characteristics of the dendritic processes and recapitulated most of the manually segmented details (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d,e</a>). The primary advantage of this approach is processing time, being two orders of magnitude faster than approaches based on convolutional neural networks for membrane classification (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kasthuri et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kaynig et al., 2015</a>). Training regimes in the neural network approaches require adjusting at least thousands of parameters separately for each new tissue; in contrast, our algorithm incorporates unsupervised components with a small fixed set of tunable parameters (see Methods and Supplementary Code). Importantly, the high contrast-to-noise ratio of the peroxidase-labeled cells is the enabling factor for the efficacy of this algorithm, which means that it could be used for reconstruction of DAB-stained structures in any tissue. Thus, although detailed synaptic properties may be obscured by the electron-dense stain, our methods are well-suited for rapid reconstruction of targeted neuron morphology and connectivity."

To this end, the alignment was performed on the Odyssey cluster supported by the FAS Division of Science, Research Computing Group at Harvard University.

For each normalized image, a global threshold <i>\u03c4</i> was computed via clustering-based image analysis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bankman, 2008</a>), modulated by the known contrast-enhanced pixel ranges of the ARTEMIS markers for a data set (e.g., for Suppl. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>: if <i>\u03c4 &lt;</i> 0.6, <i>\u03c4 = \u03c4 *</i> 0.82, else <i>\u03c4 = \u03c4 *</i> 0.86). The normalized images were then converted to a binary representation, and clustering-based image thresholding was applied again, assuming two classes (positive and negative), to gather 2D candidate segments. To remove artifacts such as speckle noise, and holes in the tissue, only segments that satisfy the following constraints were stored: 3 pixels &lt; area &lt; 130,000 pixels and major axis length &lt; 900 pixels. The remaining segments were assigned a unique label, and stored in a MySQL database, along with their coordinates and other geometric properties Based on the expected morphological progression of each process, irregularly large imaging artifacts that appear between adjacent segments in the volume were pruned. Graph-based segment search over the database entries established the connectivity between segments, including those with gaps between them, by finding the minimum distance between centroid points from all pairs of segments in a local neighborhood using a k-Nearest Neighbors-like\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Hastie et al., 2009</a>) algorithm (<i>k</i> = 2). Using the graph as a guide, 2D segments were merged into the final 3D reconstruction. We included the source code in the supplementary information, packaged as a Matlab live script, with example images and an animation."

Viral vectors are used that required Cre-dependent recombination and express erHRP, APX or APEX2. These were tested in mouse retinas, in which certain retinal ganglion cells expressed Cre-recombinase, or tamoxifen activated Cre, and also in <i>Drosophila</i> that expressed APEX fused to GFP in direction selective tangential cells. Listing the specimen preparation methods that led to the success or failure of APEX and HRP-dependent staining will benefit the field. Likewise, the combined application of rapid low resolution with selected high-resolution analysis will facilitate the time-consuming, but much-needed large volume reconstructions of genetically specified neurons by serial electron microscopy. The paper also describes other aspects of a workflow to reconstruct the labeled cells. These approaches are described as being quicker than other current methods. The entire method has considerable potential and will be of interest to the neuroscience community. Despite this overall favorable assessment of the study, several points should be addressed."
