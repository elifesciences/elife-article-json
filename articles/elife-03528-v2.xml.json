However, the number of smORFs actually translated, and their molecular and functional roles are still unclear. In this study, we present a genome-wide assessment of smORF translation by ribosomal profiling of polysomal fractions in <i>Drosophila</i>. We detect two types of smORFs bound by multiple ribosomes and thus undergoing productive translation. The \u2018longer\u2019 smORFs of around 80 amino acids resemble canonical proteins in translational metrics and conservation, and display a propensity to contain transmembrane motifs. The \u2018dwarf\u2019 smORFs are in general shorter (around 20 amino-acid long), are mostly found in 5\u2032-UTRs and non-coding RNAs, are less well conserved, and have no bioinformatic indicators of peptide function. Our findings indicate that thousands of smORFs are translated in metazoan genomes, reinforcing the idea that smORFs are an abundant and fundamental genome component."

However, the number of smORFs actually translated, and their molecular and functional roles are still unclear. In this study, we present a genome-wide assessment of smORF translation by ribosomal profiling of polysomal fractions in <i>Drosophila</i>. We detect two types of smORFs bound by multiple ribosomes and thus undergoing productive translation. The \u2018longer\u2019 smORFs of around 80 amino acids resemble canonical proteins in translational metrics and conservation, and display a propensity to contain transmembrane motifs. The \u2018dwarf\u2019 smORFs are in general shorter (around 20 amino-acid long), are mostly found in 5\u2032-UTRs and non-coding RNAs, are less well conserved, and have no bioinformatic indicators of peptide function. Our findings indicate that thousands of smORFs are translated in metazoan genomes, reinforcing the idea that smORFs are an abundant and fundamental genome component."

This handicap, coupled with the limited numbers of experimentally proven functional smORFs in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kastenmayer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Galindo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kondo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hanada et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Magny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pauli et al., 2014</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Andrews and Rothnagel, 2014</a>), has so far precluded the reliable annotation of smORFs as coding sequences. Targeted bioinformatic approaches predict that hundreds of smORFs could be translated and functional in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hemm et al., 2008</a>), yeast (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basrai et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kastenmayer et al., 2006</a>), plants (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hanada et al., 2012</a>) and metazoans including <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ladoukakis et al., 2011</a>), mouse (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frith et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Crappe et al., 2013</a>), and humans (<a href=\"#bib42\">Slavoff et al., 2013</a>), but this is in contrast to their low rate of detection in biochemical (proteomic) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Falth et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Slavoff et al., 2013</a>) and functional (genetic) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kumar et al., 2002</a>) screens.

Thousands of new translated sequences have been described in each case, whether novel exons of annotated genes, alternative initiation sites, or entire ORFs. However, the application of ribosome profiling outside canonical translated sequences can lead to differing conclusions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chew et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Guttman et al., 2013</a>). The problem remains that a ribosomal footprint cannot always be equated with translation; non-productive binding of single ribosomes to mRNAs and scanning 40S ribosomal subunits can result in footprints, yet do not constitute translation. It has been suggested that some smORFs associate with ribosomes in such a non-productive manner and do not undergo productive translation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wilson and Masel, 2011</a>). Moreover, smORF mRNAs are short and present a small target for ribosomal binding and generation of footprints, potentially making traditional ribosome profiling less suitable for the study of smORFs. To distinguish genuine translation events from background, a number of metrics, statistical treatments, and bioinfomatic analyses have been proposed (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chew et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Guttman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bazzini et al., 2014</a>). We have taken an alternative approach by enhancing the biochemical foundation of ribosome profiling and developed \u2018Poly-Ribo-Seq\u2019, an improvement to ribosome profiling that should be of use for the study of smORFs and canonical, longer ORFs alike. Instead of profiling all ribosomal-bound mRNAs, we perform ribosome footprinting on polysomal fractions. In this way, mRNAs bound by multiple ribosomes and hence actively translated can be isolated and distinguished from mRNAs bound by sporadic, putatively non-productive single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits. Although this method may overlook very short smORFs that cannot fit multiple ribosomes, this loss should be offset by the increased stringency of discarding false positive footprints."

We nearly double the number of these smORFs shown to be translated, and show that these smORF peptides further resemble canonical proteins in that they are conserved across species, show specific subcellular localisations, and display a specific amino acid composition with the potential to form transmembrane alpha-helices. \u2018Dwarf\u2019 smORFs encode peptides in 5\u2032-UTRs and non-coding RNAs, are not detected by gene prediction programs, and are around 20-aa-long.

However, closer scrutiny reveals that although these genes have well-corroborated transcriptional data (modENCODE), less than a quarter of these have corroborated translation and peptide function. Only 164 annotated smORFs have at least two out of three markers indicating translation or peptide function: (1) molecular GO term indicating protein function (based on direct assays or presence of protein domains); (2) matches with peptides from proteomic experiments; and (3) conservation of the coding sequence beyond insects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These \u2018corroborated\u2019 smORFs have in most cases a gene name (e.g., <i>Defensin</i>) and associated literature. The translation of the remaining 665 putative smORFs is thus not yet fully proven, and in most cases (494 smORFs) no evidence of translation is recorded. The majority of these \u2018uncorroborated\u2019 smORFs only have a cognate identifier (e.g., CG34200) and their \u2018coding\u2019 status varies between genome releases (unpublished observation). Thus, the <i>Drosophila</i> annotated smORFs offer an ideal framework to test for translation of smORFs and their biological importance."

That is to say they are engaged by polysomes rather than just bound by sporadic, putatively non-productive single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits. We therefore developed an approach for performing ribosome profiling on polysome complexes, using a modified ribosome footprinting method. Polysomal fractionation was used to separate RNAs, depending on the number and type of ribosomes bound to them (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In this way, mRNAs bound by multiple ribosomes and hence actively translated can be isolated and distinguished from mRNAs bound by non-productive 80S ribosomes. This biochemically purified material was then subjected to ribosome profiling, in which the footprinting reaction was optimized for profiling purified polysomal fractions rather than all ribosome-mRNA complexes."

Ribosomes have been reported to reach densities of 1 ribosome every 80 nt (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arava et al., 2003</a>), therefore on a smORF the maximum number of ribosomes associated would be five ribosomes (one at the start codon and one every 80 nt). Although RT-PCR of polysome sucrose gradient fractions confirmed that smORF mRNAs were enriched in small polysomes compared to large polysomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), it suggested that <i>Drosophila</i> smORFs can be bound by up to six ribosomes, perhaps reflecting a tighter packing of ribosomes. We therefore chose to isolate polysomal fractions containing 2\u20136 ribosomes/mRNA to enrich for smORFs. These small polysomes can also contain mRNAs for canonical longer ORFs, which would be not fully covered by ribosomes and hence translated at less than maximum level (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Our \u2018Poly-Ribo-Seq\u2019 captured regions of active translation as \u223c80% of reads mapped to coding sequences of canonical protein-coding genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) with read densities dropping off before the start and after stop codons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To quantify the translation of individual coding sequences we considered two metrics: (1) the ribosomal density in the ORF (expressed as RPKM) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>) and (2) coverage of the ORF by ribosome footprints (0\u20131). This metric indicates whether ribosomes bind across the ORF or just in a small fragment of it, which could be due to overlapping or internal ORFs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To be considered translated, we required ribosome densities to be at least 11.8 RPKM and footprint coverage of the ORF to be at least 0.57, which are above the 90th percentile of the values we obtained for the 3\u2032-UTRs from canonical coding mRNAs (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for a full explanation of filters and cut-offs). These cut-offs are more stringent than previous ribosomal profiling experiments and standard RNAseq practice, and their combination should provide robust identification of transcripts that undergo active translation. To overcome the possible dependence of ribosome density on RNAseq efficiency or transcript abundance (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guttman et al., 2013</a>), we also used the relative metric known as translational efficiency (TE), which is the RPKM of ribosome footprints/RPKM of total mRNA control reads (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>). We observed that the median TE of all annotated protein-coding transcripts was significantly higher in CDSs compared to 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) indicating that \u2018Poly-Ribo-Seq\u2019 defines regions of active translation. As previously reported for ribosomal profiling, we observe triplet phasing in the mapping of our Poly-Ribo-Seq reads (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), reflecting the positioning of ribosomes on codons, which is not globally seen in UTRs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

As intended, Poly-Ribo-Seq detected smORFs with translation signatures, and these were enriched in small polysomes, which contained double the number and all of the smORFs detected in large polysomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The low smORF TE values in large polysomes are similarly consistent with low levels of smORF mRNAs being present in large polysomal complexes.

To ensure that initial Poly-Ribo-Seq experiments sequenced to an adequate depth and to potentially extend the catalogue of translated smORFs, we repeated the experiment but exclusively sequenced small polysomes. This extensive small polysome profiling yielded nearly four times the number ORF-mapping reads obtained in the previous small polysome profiling (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) and detected translation of 224 smORFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) expanding the number from both experiments to 227, which is 83% of smORFs we observed transcribed in S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

This reduces the depth of profiling and could preclude the detection of further smORFs. Therefore, we designed rRNA-depletion beads for use during footprint extraction (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), which produced a marked improvement in the ratio of reads mapping to mRNAs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) and increased the total number of ORFs detected (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, \u2212rRNA) but only expanded our overall catalogue of putatively translated smORFs by one (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The results of the three independent experiments are highly overlapping as 80% of putative translated smORFs were detected in all three data sets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). By combining the three experiments, we provide evidence that 228 smORFs are translated out of 274 transcribed in S2 cells (83%), which is very similar to the proportion of standard length protein-coding ORFs translated (81%) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These similar proportions may indicate the extent of translational regulation in S2 cells. Altogether this data almost doubles the previous repertoire of translated smORFs in <i>Drosophila</i> from 164 to 285 (164 previously corroborated [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>] and 121 new translated smORFs)."

To confirm this and independently validate our data, we compared our results with peptidomics data (Peptide Atlas, <a href=\"#bib6\">Brunner et al., 2007</a>). Poly-Ribo-Seq increases nearly fourfold the number of smORFs with evidence of translation in S2 cells from 59 (Peptide Atlas) to 228 (Poly-Ribo-Seq). Poly-Ribo-Seq detects 86% of smORFs with Peptide Atlas evidence in S2 cells (51 out of 59 smORFs; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), whilst only 8 smORFs, which have Peptide Atlas evidence are not shown to be translated by Poly-Ribo-Seq."

Therefore, we specifically searched for smORF peptides by performing mass spectrometry on two biological replicates of S2 cells after gel purifying small proteins 5 to 15 KDa in size, which corresponds to peptides predicted to be 45 to 130 aa in length. We detected a total of 60 annotated smORF peptides, of which 40 are not detected in Peptide Atlas S2 data sets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), thus bringing the combined pool of smORFs peptides detected by proteomics in S2 cells to 99 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Despite this increase, Poly-Ribo-Seq was still more extensive. Poly-Ribo-Seq revealed 228 smORFs as translated, including 90 of the 99 in the combined proteomics pool (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and 59 of the 60 peptides detected by us (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The Poly-Ribo-Seq RPKM values of smORFs detected by peptidomics are over three times as high as those that are not (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that mass spectrometry detects peptides arising from the most highly translated smORFs, as also observed by other authors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brunner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bazzini et al., 2014</a>)."

The resulting construct was transfected into S2 cells, where any FLAG signal would therefore be the result of smORF translation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Transfection and staining of S2 cells with these FLAG-tagged smORFs confirmed the translation of all 12 smORFs tested, which exhibit a range of translational indicators (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) and peptidomics evidence, indicating that even lower levels of translation can give rise to smORF peptides detectable by this tagging method. Immunoblotting confirmed the expected sizes of the tagged peptides (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Tagged peptides exhibit distinct subcellular localisations, which are suggestive of different peptide functions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>).

Many putative ncRNAs have been annotated as such because no long ORFs have been detected, but they can still contain smORFs. We looked for evidence of translation in 6438 ORFs that initiate with an AUG start codon within ncRNAs. Our total cytoplasmic mRNA data indicate that 125 ncRNA transcripts (containing 918 different ORFs) are transcribed and present in the cytoplasm of S2 cells. 313 smORFs in these transcripts appear translated by Poly-Ribo-Seq (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), but ncRNA smORFs behaved differently from protein-coding and smORF genes. The median translation efficiency of these putative smORFs within ncRNA genes is lower than for canonical genes and annotated smORFs, and in fact is similar to UTRs (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In addition, we could not observe nor obtain peptidomics corroboration for the encoded peptides, and the FLAG signal is limited for the majority of such smORFs tested in the transfection assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Yet a sizeable fraction (34%) of non-coding RNA smORFs displayed Poly-Ribo-Seq metrics above our cut-off values indicating translation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>) and some can display FLAG and Western blot signal similar to annotated smORFs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>; <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Further, these positive-testing smORFs from non-coding RNAs show codon read-phasing (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). These translation events do not necessarily represent \u2018background\u2019 translation of non-coding RNAs associated with polysomes. The comparison of ribosomal footprinting reads with reads resulting from the sequencing of RNA from polysomal fractions before footprinting (as in polysomal profiling) shows a high correlation for canonical coding sequences as expected (<a href=\"#bib43\">Smith et al., 2014</a>), but not for non-coding RNAs, where high RNASeq polysomal counts do not necessarily result in significant footprinting (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Altogether, our results suggest that a proportion of these so-called non-coding RNA genes actually contain smORFs that are actively translated in S2 cells."

However, they also display differential usage of several amino acids, which are characteristic of alpha-helices in canonical proteins, being enriched for lysine and phenylalanine, and depleted of serine (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chou and Fasman, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Consistent with this prediction the translation of 190 smORFs has been detected in one such experiment in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bazzini et al., 2014</a>). Extrapolation of these two sets of results in flies and zebrafish strongly suggests that hundreds of smORFs are translated in higher organisms, including in humans and other mammals. While bioinformatics can be useful in unearthing smORF candidates, ultimately experimental evidence and full functional characterisation is the only way to ascertain the translation and function of each individual smORF."

However, we notice that if extrapolated to other animals, such as mammals including humans, even a low number of translated ncRNAs would be significant. The human genome contains some 32,000 transcripts currently annotated as long non-coding RNAs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Volders et al., 2013</a>), and a fraction around 44% of long-non-coding RNAs have been detected in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib11\">Derrien et al., 2012</a>). If these cytoplasmic lncRNAs were corroborated and translated in the same proportion as we find here in <i>Drosophila</i> (some 34%), there could be thousands of human peptides awaiting detection and characterisation. The number swells to many thousands when adding uORFs. The small size of both uORF and ncORF peptides may hinder their detection by mass spectrometry, as in the case of peptides translated by the <i>Drosophila</i> genes <i>tal</i> and <i>scl</i> (unpublished observation), and so absence of proteomic detection (or absence of functional data, see below) should not be used to disprove their translation."

Their bioinformatic indicators (conservation, size, aa usage, and transmembrane motifs) appear similar in the 505 uncorroborated smORFs not transcribed in S2 cells, suggesting that, if translated, some 700 smORFs might encode peptides with similar functional potential. The corroborated smORFs display a variety of functions as antibacterial peptides (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>), cell signals (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pueyo and Couso, 2008</a>), cytoskeletal regulators (<a href=\"#bib12\">Djakovic et al., 2006</a>), and other regulators of canonical proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hanyu-Nakamura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Magny et al., 2013</a>). GO term enrichment analysis shows that the most abundant terms amongst previously corroborated smORFs are ribosome constituents, oxidoreductase activity, and transporter activity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The last two imply an association with biological membranes, and it is thus interesting that amongst uncorroborated smORFs, the frequency of predicted transmembrane alpha-helix motifs is the highest. Furthermore, the observed tagged smORF peptide localization to mitochondria is also compatible with these findings. We surmise that hundreds of small, membrane-associated peptides are awaiting characterisation, and they may alter our understanding of many cellular and organismal processes of biological and medical relevance. We expect that these peptides would interact with canonical proteins as their regulators (<a href=\"#bib36\">Magny et al., 2013</a>), as their size limits their structural capabilities; though, such capabilities could be expanded by oligomerization."

The entire argument for their translatability rests on the association of the lncRNas with the polysomal riboseq. This raises the issue of whether the detection of RNAs in this fraction is truly indicative of translatability. In the absence of the other criteria mentioned by the authors (mass spec and conservation) the co-fractionation of the RNA with polysomes can be also attributable to the non-specific affinity of the ribosome proteins to RNA. For example, can the authors show that a metagene of the lncRNAs translated show phasing of the ribosome in the ORFs undergoing translation?"

They do not present RNASeq controls for their S2 experiment, therefore certain comparisons are not possible. Nonetheless, if we apply our filters and cut-offs to their data, we observe that more smORFs would appear as translated in their data (264 theirs vs. 228 ours). Therefore our method is either a) less extensive, or b) more astringent than standard ribosomal profiling (for the detection of smORFs). We favour b) since these 36 Weissman-specific smORFs have low RPKMs and only 2 are detected by proteomics. We surmise that these Weisman-specific smORFs may represent either smORFs lowly expressed in our S2 cells, or non-productive ribosomal binding (40S and 80S binding). In fact 14 of them don\u2019t pass our transcription cut-off of 1 RPKM in S2 cells. This is not a criticism of their work, but in our opinion (and others) an unavoidable feature of the standard ribosomal profiling method, and the very reason and justification for our modification."

As expected, in general there is a good correlation for putative coding transcripts (annotated smORFs and canonical proteins) such that, if an RNA is present in a polysomal fraction, it is bound by ribosomes and translated. However, for non-coding RNAs, this correlation is much weaker and in fact, below our footprint RPKM cut-off for accepting translation, a number of lncRNAs can be present in the polysomal fraction in high amounts, yet do not give rise to ribosomal footprints.

A bona-fide ribosomal binding site could be as long as 32 nucleotides; hence, a uORF containing a single ribosomal binding \u2018site\u2019 could still be 0.56 covered (32nt/57nt). But in addition, the referees identify here another important technical point. The RPKM metric inflates artificially the number of reads in very short sequences, and for example, an 11.8 RPKM cut-off could still leave some dwarf smORFs of around 20aa being considered translated with as little as 2 reads. We have therefore added a further filter for these \u2018dwarf\u2019 smORFs (uORFs and non-coding smORFs) of needing a minimum of 5 reads in a single experiment to be considered translated, in addition to the RPKM and coverage filters we apply to all cds. For reference, the lowest number of reads obtained with an annotated smORF is 8. Since these annotated smORFs are on average longer (hence able to generate more reads) and have higher translational efficiencies than dwarf smORFs, a cut-off filter of 5 reads for the latter (the midpoint between 2 and 8) seems reasonable."
