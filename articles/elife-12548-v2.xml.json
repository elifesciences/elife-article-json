Although ESCRT-III subunits polymerize into spirals, how individual ESCRT-III subunits are activated and assembled together into a membrane-deforming filament remains unknown. Here, we determine X-ray crystal structures of the most abundant ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 in its active conformation. Using pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy (PDS), we show that Snf7 activation requires a prominent conformational rearrangement to expose protein-membrane and protein-protein interfaces. This promotes the assembly of Snf7 arrays with ~30 \u00c5 periodicity into a membrane-sculpting filament. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, we demonstrate that mutations on these protein interfaces halt Snf7 assembly and block ESCRT function. The architecture of the activated and membrane-bound Snf7 polymer provides crucial insights into the spatially unique ESCRT-III-mediated membrane remodeling."

Although ESCRT-III subunits polymerize into spirals, how individual ESCRT-III subunits are activated and assembled together into a membrane-deforming filament remains unknown. Here, we determine X-ray crystal structures of the most abundant ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 in its active conformation. Using pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy (PDS), we show that Snf7 activation requires a prominent conformational rearrangement to expose protein-membrane and protein-protein interfaces. This promotes the assembly of Snf7 arrays with ~30 \u00c5 periodicity into a membrane-sculpting filament. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, we demonstrate that mutations on these protein interfaces halt Snf7 assembly and block ESCRT function. The architecture of the activated and membrane-bound Snf7 polymer provides crucial insights into the spatially unique ESCRT-III-mediated membrane remodeling."

Distinct ESCRT complexes remodel the endosomal membrane to form vesicle packages that encapsulate the receptor proteins. These vesicles bud off into the endosome, which is then targeted to another organelle called the lysosome where the receptor proteins are degraded."

Originally identified using yeast genetics, ESCRTs package ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that bud into the interior of the late endosome, creating a MVB that ultimately delivers cargos into the yeast lysosome (vacuole). The ESCRT pathway achieves receptor sorting through an elaborate division of labor. Upstream ESCRT components, ESCRTs-0, I, and II, assemble into stable hetero-multimers to sort ubiquitinated cargo on the endosomal surface by binding ubiquitin and endosomal lipid, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P). In addition, ESCRT-II sets the architecture and initiates the assembly of the ESCRT-III complex, which together with Vps4 is responsible for remodeling endosomal membranes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Henne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hurley and Hanson, 2010</a>)."

Surprisingly, rather than adopting a rigid four-helix coiled-coil, the core domain undergoes a large-scale conformational rearrangement to extend into a highly elongated structure. This conformational change not only extends a cationic membrane-binding surface, but also exposes hydrophobic and electrostatic protein interacting surfaces for polymerization. <i>In vitro</i> reconstitution and pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy (PDS) demonstrate that full-length Snf7 adopts the same active conformation and assembles into ~30\u00a0\u00c5 periodic protofilaments on a near-native lipid environment. Using negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and quantitative flow cytometry, we further demonstrate that mutations on key protein interfaces halt Snf7 assembly and block ESCRT function <i>in vivo</i>.

Although the \u03b11/2 hairpin is relatively unchanged, \u03b13 and \u03b14 undergo large-scale structural rearrangements from the proposed autoinhibited ESCRT-III fold. \u03b12 extends into a ~90\u00a0\u00c5 long \u03b1-helix combining the \u03b12 and \u03b13 segments that were distinct \u03b1-helices in previously defined ESCRT-III structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A\u2013B</a>). The angle of the flexible loop between \u03b13 and \u03b14 also changes, which enables \u03b14 to position in different orientations relative to the \u03b11-3 hairpin. Despite the conformational change, we designated this elongated \u03b1-helix as \u03b12/3 to maintain a consistent numbering scheme for conserved ESCRT-III helices."

Western blotting analysis showed that Snf7<sup>Q90C M130C</sup> migrated to ~37\u00a0kDa, comparable to cysteineless Snf7. We then oxidized both fractions using copper(II) 1,10-phenanthroline. Strikingly, in the S13 fraction, ~50% of Snf7<sup>Q90C M130C</sup> migrated faster, indicating a conformationally closed Snf7 species. Notably, in the P13 fraction, the migration shift did not occur (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D\u2013E</a>). This is indicative of distinct conformations between the cytoplasmic and the endosome-bound states, and suggests that Snf7 on endosomal membranes adopts an open conformation in which \u03b14 is displaced away from \u03b12."

We also observed a significant population of distances at 40\u201350\u00a0\u00c5, but diminished signal at ~20\u00a0\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). We postulated that both the inter- and intra-subunit interspin distances contribute these signals. To isolate the intra-subunit interspin distance, we next produced magnetically diluted samples (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borbat and Freed, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dzikovski et al., 2011</a>) by mixing double-labeled Snf7<sup>R52E E88C H118C</sup> with unlabeled Snf7<sup>R52E</sup> in ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:8. We observed that the signal changed significantly up to 1:2 dilution, then less for the maximal 1:8 dilution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), showing approach to the infinite dilution limit. The data for the 1:8 dilution is characteristic of a single long distance of 45\u00a0\u00c5 with a moderate distance distribution, as expected for spin labels on an \u03b1-helix separated by 29 residues."

As we did not observe short distances corresponding to the closed conformation, we conclude that only the open conformation is present in Snf7 polymers assembled on membranes. Therefore, the large-scale conformational rearrangement observed in the crystal structures is fully consistent with the PDS data of the full-length Snf7 conformations on the membranes."

This assay monitors the efficiency of fluorescence quenching after internalization and MVB sorting of Mup1-pH (the plasma membrane methionine transporter, Mup1, fused to the pH-sensitive GFP-derivative, pHluorin) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As a result, mutants M104E, L101E, A97K, I94E, Q90K, M87E and T83E showed severe sorting defects, with sorting efficiencies from 12% to 76%, and mutants L121D, I117E, M114E, M107E, T103E and L99K from 7% to 34% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Correspondingly, we previously demonstrated that the L121D mutant blocks Snf7 polymerization <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, and missorts the MVB cargo carboxypeptidase S, Cps1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Saksena et al., 2009</a>).

This interaction is also dependent upon the extension of \u03b12/3, and appears to be important for the positioning of \u03b11 in the protofilament.

The electrostatic membrane-binding regions of all Snf7 protomers face the same direction in the polymer, allowing for a continuous membrane-binding interface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Although both structures exhibit an open conformation, we noted two different orientations of \u03b14 with respect to the \u03b11/2 hairpin. In open conformation A, \u03b14 extends in the protofilament plane, whereas in open conformation B, \u03b14 is positioned perpendicular to the protofilament plane. Superimposing the two conformations revealed that \u03b14 can rotate by at least ~90<sup>\u00b0</sup> along the axis of the \u03b12/3 helix (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6A\u2013B</a>). Despite the large differences in \u03b14 positioning, \u03b14 makes a similar interaction with the \u03b11/2 hairpin of a Snf7 protomer in a neighboring protofilament in both structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This supports a model in which the assembly of the extended \u03b12/3 helix upon Snf7 activation results in two key events: (1) \u03b14 can no longer bind <i>in cis</i> to its own protomer; (2) \u03b15 is displaced from the \u03b11/2 hairpin. Together, this enables \u03b14 to contact the \u03b11/2 hairpin of another protomer <i>in trans</i> on a neighboring protofilament."

Due to the heterogeneity of a Snf7 double filament, we utilized a single linear Snf7 filament to determine a plausible curved Snf7 filament using normal mode analysis (NMA), a simple non-detailed simulation technique used to probe large-scale macromolecular motions by assessing flexibility intrinsic to the structure of a protein (<a href=\"#bib52\">Suhre and Sanejouand, 2004</a>). Remarkably, without any dramatic structural rearrangement within each protomer or alterations of the protein-protein interface, a linear two-dimensional Snf7 filament can bend into a ~70\u00a0nm diameter three-dimensional superhelix with turn length of ~62\u00a0nm, reminiscent of the structure of the Snf7/Vps24/Vps2 co-assembly previously observed (<a href=\"#bib25\">Henne et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

The importance of understanding this mechanism is bolstered by the fact that this is so distinct from all other well characterized membrane budding processes (<i>e.g.</i> clathrin and COP-I/-II), which invariantly bud into the cytoplasm. Although the membrane-bound ESCRT-III polymers have been reconstituted <i>in vitro</i>, the mechanisms governing the polymer assembly and how ESCRT-III coordinates membrane remodeling, remain poorly understood. Here, we focused on Snf7, the predominant ESCRT-III component, in order to fundamentally understand how it achieves membrane remodeling. Using a multi-disciplinary approach that combined X-ray crystallography, PDS, genetics, biochemistry and TEM, we reveal key structural features of Snf7 that allow its dynamic conversion from a soluble monomer to a membrane-bound polymer."

In the present study, we provide surprising structural evidence that this activation requires further rearrangement within the core domain itself. Consistent with the available CHMP4B<sup>\u03b11/2</sup> structure (<a href=\"#bib37\">Martinelli et al., 2012</a>), \u03b11/2 folds into a rigid ~70\u00a0\u00c5 \u03b1-helical hairpin, which forms intramolecular contacts with at least three short \u03b1-helices, \u03b13, \u03b14, and \u03b15 in the closed state. Notably, upon activation, all of these interactions are reorganized to extend the hairpin to a ~90\u00a0\u00c5 structure available for intermolecular contacts.

The propagation of conformational changes in the FtsZ polymer is thus coupled with the architectural changes that promote membrane fission. In contrast, ESCRT-III does not bind nor hydrolyze nucleotides to regulate its conformation, but it recruits the AAA-ATPase Vps4 for its disassembly. Although Snf7 can be activated by specific point mutations <i>in vitro</i>, the conformational switching <i>in vivo</i> appears to be tightly regulated by other ESCRT components to prevent pre-mature polymer assembly."

However, in enveloped viral budding and cytokinetic abscission, Bro1/Alix directly bridges ESCRT-I to ESCRT-III, by binding to the C-terminal \u03b16 of Snf7 (<a href=\"#bib38\">McCullough et al., 2008</a>). We speculate that this interaction may directly dissociate the C-terminal autoinhibitory region to trigger Snf7 polymer assembly. Furthermore, CHMP7 was recently shown to trigger Snf7 assembly during nuclear envelope reformation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vietri et al., 2015</a>), highlighting the distinct spatial and temporal regulation of Snf7 activation between different ESCRT-dependent processes."

Somewhat paradoxically, ESCRT-III cannot shape the vesicle exterior because it is segregated in the cytoplasm by the limiting membrane of the endosome. Instead, the ESCRT-III filament appears to predominantly drive membrane deformation by sculpting the neck interior of a growing vesicle. This membrane sculpting requires an intricate balance of competing curvatures. Snf7 has been shown to localize to both the curved necks of invaginations and along highly curved edges of membranes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buchkovich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fyfe et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Our collective studies on Snf7 address the balance of membrane curvatures associated with ILV formation. The ANCHR motif of Snf7 acts to sense and stabilize the positively curved rim of the invagination (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Coinciding with this positive curvature stabilization, the helical Snf7 polymer acts as a circular scaffold that triggers and stabilizes the negatively curved circumference of the neck of the invagination (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). We propose that as a two-dimensional ESCRT-III spiral elongates into a three-dimensional superhelix, the tight membrane binding of the 'corkscrew' concentrates transmembrane cargoes ahead of the leading edge of the forming and narrowing filament, packaging them into the nascent ILV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

Additional structural studies together with new assays are necessary for further addressing these challenging but exciting questions."

In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>, the reconstructed distance distributions have a large component of ~30\u00a0\u00c5 originating from distances to immediate neighbors similar to the benchmark case, the magnetically diluted samples have a single peak at ~45\u00a0\u00c5 that is dominant with only a small fraction at 30\u00a0\u00c5 that could still be noticed at 1:8 dilution. A dilution factor in excess of 15 would be necessary to fully reveal the expected signal shape, however the 1:8 dilution sample already has ~5\u00a0\u03bcM protein concentration, making larger ratios problematic to study."

Whereas the most pronounced distance is expected to be determined by the proximal neighbors, the widths of distance distributions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B\u2013E</a>) obtained in these scans are likely to have contributions from the couplings to more distant neighbors and in addition by the complex nature of the Snf7 polymer in a liposome-reconstituted system where Snf7 spiraling double- protofilaments are observed, and the orientation relative to each other is heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cashikar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Henne et al., 2012</a>). Notably, while searching for 'tip-to-tip' contacts possible in double protofilaments, we did not identify any spin labeled position with a distinct short proximity that is expected to occur at the contacting edge of the single filament, thus ruling out this scenario. We also did not discern any significant distance variation as the spin labeled position is moved from one end of the \u03b11-3 hairpin to the other, thus ruling out any alternating protomer packing in the protofilaments. So far, only parallel protomer packing in a single-layer filament is consistent with the data (see also Result)."

Two crystal structures of the Snf7 core reveal that a loop that connects two helices in the inactive form becomes helical to produce a single long <math id=\"inf2\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math>-helix. The crystal packing suggests a model for the polymer structure that is elegantly confirmed on membranes using site-directed spin labeling and DEER spectroscopy, as well as mutational analysis of inter-filament interfaces. The authors have carefully tested hypotheses generated from the crystal structure to come to a plausible model for the nature of the filament assembly on membrane surfaces. Combined with previous work from the Emr group and others, the manuscript provides an unprecedented detailed insight into the assembly of ESCRTs in the process of MVB generation. The study is likely to be a landmark in the field."

But Snf7 co-assembles with Vps20 and ESCRT-II into a 2-dimensional ring structure. As included in the Discussion, as Vps20 adopts a 94A\u030a extended open conformation (Schuh et al., 2015) and anchors to the endosomes by myristoylation, we propose that an open Vps20 would stabilize a Snf7 in its open conformation on the membrane and thus trigger a chain reaction of Snf7 recruitment and polymerization. Following this, the recruitment of Vps24/2 alters the architectural geometry into a membrane-bending spiral."

Despite this, we have noted that a similar ~30\u00c5 inter-subunit distance has been previously observed by Shen et al. Moreover, Glu95 (\u03b12), which has been suggested as a key residue for inter-subunit contact by Shen et al., is further confirmed by our crystal structures.
