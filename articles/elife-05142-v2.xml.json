The molecular details of AFP adsorption-inhibition is uncertain but is proposed to involve the Gibbs\u2013Thomson effect. Here we show by using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations a protein structure-function mechanism for the spruce budworm <i>Choristoneura fumiferana</i> AFP, including stereo-specific binding and consequential melting and freezing inhibition. The protein binds indirectly to the prism ice face through a linear array of ordered water molecules that are structurally distinct from the ice. Mutation of the ice binding surface disrupts water-ordering and abolishes activity. The adsorption is virtually irreversible, and we confirm the ice growth inhibition is consistent with the Gibbs\u2013Thomson law."

The molecular details of AFP adsorption-inhibition is uncertain but is proposed to involve the Gibbs\u2013Thomson effect. Here we show by using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations a protein structure-function mechanism for the spruce budworm <i>Choristoneura fumiferana</i> AFP, including stereo-specific binding and consequential melting and freezing inhibition. The protein binds indirectly to the prism ice face through a linear array of ordered water molecules that are structurally distinct from the ice. Mutation of the ice binding surface disrupts water-ordering and abolishes activity. The adsorption is virtually irreversible, and we confirm the ice growth inhibition is consistent with the Gibbs\u2013Thomson law."

By binding to ice, AFPs are thought to both lower the freezing point and raise the melting point of ice through the Gibbs\u2013Thomson effect whereby adsorbed AFPs cause increased micro-curvature of the ice front (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yeh and Feeney, 1996</a>). The resulting difference between the melting and freezing points, known as the thermal hysteresis gap (TH), can range from a few tenths to over 6\u00b0, depending on the specific AFP (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2011</a>)."

The ice basal plane lies perpendicular to the <i>c</i>-axis. Remarkably AFPs have evolved independently numerous times to bind stereo-selectively to ice in various orientations, resulting in a structurally diverse protein family (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hew et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ko et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pentelute et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hakim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Middleton et al., 2013</a>). The potency of different AFPs reflects their adsorption characteristics and environmental adaptation. Polar fish, for example, do not normally experience temperatures much lower than the freezing point of sea water (\u22121.9\u00b0C), and have AFPs that provide protection to just a few tenths of a degree below this. Fish AFPs often bind oblique to ice prism planes, typically forming hexagonal bipyramid crystals at temperatures within the TH gap which rapidly grow as elongated spicules along the <i>c</i>-axis below the TH gap (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davies and Hew, 1990</a>). In contrast insects which are exposed to much lower terrestrial temperatures, (often below \u221230\u00b0C), require AFPs with higher activity, possibly by selecting more effective prism and basal plane binding (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2011</a>). Despite a wide selection of available structural and experimental data, a complete molecular description of how an AFP binds to its respective ice planes and inhibits crystal growth remains elusive."

Slowly freezing solutions of dilute AFP will incorporate AFPs into the growing ice phase at roughly their original concentration, while non-AFPs and solutes are largely excluded (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marshall et al., 2004</a>). Many structural studies have shown a correlation between the periodicity of the ice-binding surface elements of AFPs and their respective ice-binding planes, though it has not been entirely clear whether AFPs bind directly to ice or through some ordered water intermediate (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sharp, 2011</a>). Observation of the molecular arrangements of AFPs and surrounding water as they bind and modify the surface curvature of ice is currently technically unattainable. Given these experimental limitations, computer simulations have played a crucial role in expanding our understanding of the AFP phenomena."

This was in agreement with previous experimental work of Knight et al which showed the preferential binding orientation of wfAFP on single crystal ice hemisphere (<a href=\"#bib23\">Knight et al., 1991</a>) and also the later work of Sicheri and Yang who determined the wfAFP crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sicheri and Yang, 1995</a>). Cheng and Merz further expanded this work using molecular dynamics simulations of solvated wfAFP in the bound conformation to the {2021} pyramidal plane to propose key hydrogen bond interactions between polar residues and the ice surface, suggesting that hydrogen bonds were the primary driving force of ice adsorption (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cheng and Merz, 1997</a>).

Even though a number of AFP studies have simulated ice-water interactions (<a href=\"#bib34\">McDonald et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Dalal et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wierzbicki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nada and Furukawa, 2008</a>), Nada and Furukawa also point out the need for simulations to target a growing ice-water interface. Ideally, simulations would allow unconstrained AFPs to migrate from the water phase to interact freely the growing ice-water interface without introducing prior binding orientation bias. The computational requirements to do so are significant, and only recently became relatively accessible for researchers."

SbwAFP has a \u03b2-helix structure with a triangular cross-section forming three parallel \u03b2-sheet faces and a hydrophobic core as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. The ice binding face has a regular array of repeating threonine-x-threonine (T-X-T) motifs whereby the spacing between threonine residues match the repeat spacing parallel to the <i>c</i>-axis of ice of approximately 7.4 \u00c5 and motifs on adjacent \u03b2-strands closely match the <i>a</i>-axis repeating dimensions of the prism face of ice of 4.5 \u00c5. The second row of threonine residues of the ice-binding surface is particularly sensitive to mutation, with replacement of the threonines drastically reducing sbwAFP's potency as an AFP (<a href=\"#bib12\">Graether et al., 2000</a>). In addition to inducing a non-colligative freezing point depression of ice by up to 6\u00b0C, sbwAFP also demonstrates a significant melting inhibition (super-heating) of ice of up to 0.44\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib1\">Celik et al., 2010</a>).

Although the melting point (T<sub>m</sub>) of the TIP4P water model is known to be 230.5 K, (<a href=\"#bib8\">Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2006</a>) it is highly unlikely such a water model will spontaneously freeze or remain frozen in simulation, particularly in the few degrees temperature range below T<sub>m</sub> where AFPs exhibit their biological activity, due to the equilibrium radius <i>R</i> of the critical ice nucleus governed by the Gibbs\u2013Thomson effect. This effect is a well known phenomenon whereby the chemical potential across an interface varies with curvature. For positive interfacial energies smaller crystals, with their higher curvature, are only able to be in equilibrium with their melt at lower temperatures than larger crystals. AFPs are thought to exploit this property by effectively subdividing a large ice surface of relatively low curvature into smaller surfaces with greater curvature thus giving rise to lower freezing temperatures, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. The critical radius at a given temperature <i>T</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> can be approximated with the following expression adapted from <a href=\"#bib43\">Pereyra et al. (2011)</a>:"

This relationship implies large ice crystals are required to maintain growth. For example, assuming spherical geometry, for a single degree of supercooling the critical radius of an ice embryo is about 518 \u00c5 containing approximately 18 million water molecules, which is currently computationally prohibitive to model (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for calculation). To simulate AFP-ice interactions more efficiently a specially arranged model of an ice-water interface was developed to provide a continual ice growth mechanism while mimicking an infinite ice plane by taking advantage of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). The ice/water system employed here consisted of 17,434 water molecules in a 51.5 \u00d7 126.6 \u00d7 83.9 \u00c5 box with PBCs, of which 1692 water molecules were harmonically constrained to an ideal prism ice lattice. This served as the seed crystal while an additional 1049 water molecules below the seed were constrained in a 5 \u00c5 thick disordered layer to act as an ice barrier preventing downward ice growth, leaving a small wedge of mobile water between constrained layers as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. A perspective view of the model is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The seed ice crystal included an additional small prism step to initiate step layer growth and the entire seed was angled such that the primary prism face was approximately 4.3\u00b0 with respect to the long axis. The angle of the seed is such that step layer growth across the prism face reappears, due to PBCs, one layer higher to where it started, thus providing a continual ice growth mechanism. Unimpeded, this mechanism will freeze the area above the seed crystal at any temperature below T<sub>m</sub>. This arrangement mimics step growth as might be produced by screw dislocations, as originally proposed by <a href=\"#bib9\">Frank (1949)</a> and later observed on ice surfaces by <a href=\"#bib22\">Ketcham and Hobbs (1968)</a>."

Within this ice/water box the unconstrained sbwAFP model was initially placed 20 \u00c5 above the seed, with its ice binding face directed towards the seed approximately aligned in the expected binding orientation. In our preliminary work the seed ice crystal was arranged with the prism face parallel with the axis of the simulation boundaries. Crystals from these arrangements did not grow well, extending the ice front very slowly if at all. We realized that this was because one had to effectively wait for a two-dimensional nucleation event to occur on the prism plane and reach a critical size before the next layer of ice would grow."

Definitive ice binding was observed 26 times with each binding event occurring with equivalent orientation with respect to the ice lattice, though adsorbing at a number of different step heights. The remaining 6 simulations either diffused away from the growing ice front (3 times), or had partial engagement at alternate angles (3 times). Of the partial engagements, the AFP still had significant rotational and translational movement with respect to the ice lattice so was not considered truly bound. Each of the definitive ice binding events incorporated a linear array of 6 water molecules bridging between the prism face and a row of conserved threonine residues (Thr 7, 23, 39, 54, 69, 84 and 101) as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. These water molecules had the same periodicity of the prism face, spaced approximately 4.5 \u00c5 apart. Interestingly they were distinct from the bulk ice crystal, bridging between two prism face water molecules parallel along the <i>c</i>-axis which would normally be bridged by two water molecules in regular ice as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. The sbwAFP-bound water molecules had fully satisfied tetrahedral hydrogen bonding arrangements; two hydrogen bonds to the prism face ice water molecules and two hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl groups of adjacent threonine residues of the sbwAFP ice binding face."

No ice binding events were observed with all mutant AFPs diffusing ahead of the growing ice surface in distinct contrast to the wild type protein. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> shows the relative height coordinates of both wild type and mutant sbwAFP throughout the docking simulations clearly demonstrating the former AFP adsorbing and fixing to the ice surface while the latter, unable to bind, diffuses ahead of the growing ice front. The Thr to Leu substitutions disrupt the binding of the ordered water to sbwAFP by removing the stabilizing hydroxyl side chain hydrogen bond interactions of the threonine residues. These results indicate ordered waters are crucial in initiating sbwAFP recognition and binding to ice and are suggestive of longer range protein-water interactions consistent with recent experimental findings by Meinster et al, of a similar beetle AFP from <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>, measured with terahertz spectroscopy (<a href=\"#bib35\">Meister et al., 2013</a>).

Representative cross-section snapshots of the simulation at the three temperatures is shown in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Though the Gibbs\u2013Thomson phenomena is widely accepted as the basis of AFP activity, to the best of our knowledge it has not been observed directly at the ice-water interface. In the first simulation the sbwAFP adsorbed from the solvent phase to the advancing ice front at 225 K (5 K below the model system T<sub>m</sub>). The sbwAFP adsorbed to the ice front within 40 ns and within 150 ns the ice front displayed marked convex curvature creating cylindrical ice fronts as shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. By 250 ns the ice front had reached equilibrium with an averaged cylindrical radius of approximately 50 \u00c5. The extent of the inhibited ice front fluctuated, advancing and retreating in the range of 5\u20138 \u00c5 showing the reversible arrangement of water molecules to the crystal ice lattice, (this is an important indication of reaching equilibration and adequate sampling given the reduced water diffusion at these low temperatures). The ice fraction (defined as a proportion of total ice-like water molecules above the ice seed crystal), was measured over the 280 to 1000 ns time frame and found to equilibrate at 0.46 \u00b1 0.01 (SD). In contrast AFP-free simulations froze almost completely within 150 ns. The vacillating nature of the ice front in simulation makes quantitative measurement of the curvature difficult, however we find good qualitative agreement between theoretical Gibbs\u2013Thomson curvature and the averaged ice front as shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> where the theoretical radius is overlaid on to the averaged simulation ice cross-section. This is good indication that the simulation ice curvature is due to the expected Gibbs\u2013Thomson phenomena."

The sbwAFP remained attached to the ice protrusion approximately 8.5 \u00c5 above the main ice plane which developed slight concave curvature with respect to the adsorbed protein (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). A continuation of the simulation at 235 K resulted in the detachment of the sbwAFP from the ice surface within 10 ns allowing further melting of the ice to a residual fraction of 0.08 \u00b1 0.01. Steady-state representations of the equilibrated ice fronts for each temperature were generated averaging water density over each simulation segment, by mapping water occupancy of greater than 85% using the \u2018volmap\u2019 module of the visualization software VMD (<a href=\"#bib17\">Humphrey et al., 1996</a>). Extended simulations showing the induced curvature of the ice surface are shown in <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3, 4, 5</a>. These simulations clearly demonstrate the Gibbs\u2013Thomson effect showing how adsorbed protein induces ice-surface curvature and subsequent melting and freezing inhibition of ice. An important aspect of AFP activity that remains to be resolved involves the question of the strength of binding of AFP to ice. Previous estimations of the binding energy of AFPs to ice have varied greatly in the literature. Initial calculations from <a href=\"#bib3\">Cheng and Merz (1997)</a> put the wfAFP binding energy of \u2212157 kcal/mol while <a href=\"#bib6\">Dalal and S\u00f6nnichsen (2000)</a> put the figure at \u221267 kcal/mol. Later estimates by <a href=\"#bib21\">Jorov et al. (2004)</a> and <a href=\"#bib51\">Wierzbicki et al. (2007)</a> both put the figure for wfAFP much lower at below \u22125 kcal/mol. Such low values of binding, however, imply an equilibrium with appreciable amounts of exchange of the AFP from the ice surface and its surroundings. Contrary to this, experimental evidence suggests that the binding energy must be relatively high and virtually irreversible. Microfluidic experiments by <a href=\"#bib2\">Celik et al. (2013)</a> show that ice growth remains inhibited despite the exchange of the solution surrounding AFP-inhibited ice crystals with AFP-free buffer, suggesting there is little or no exchange of AFPs from the ice surface once bound. This finding is further strengthened by recent field observations of Cziko et al. where it was found Antarctic notethenoid fishes internally accumulated ice does not melt as expected over summer warming periods (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cziko et al., 2014</a>). Our own observations in this study suggest relatively strong binding of a magnitude similar to that proposed by <a href=\"#bib6\">Dalal and S\u00f6nnichsen (2000)</a>, with the sbwAFP never detaching once bound to ice, (apart from deliberate melting events), even over the course of the extended millisecond range simulations at above melting temperatures. We intend to address the magnitude of the binding energy in our future work."

This conclusion is supported by previous work by <a href=\"#bib41\">Nutt and Smith (2008)</a> whose molecular dynamics simulations of sbwAFP in solution indicated water was more ice-like on its binding face at low temperatures and speculated that this preconfigured water was important for initial recognition and binding events. Recent work by <a href=\"#bib37\">Midya and Bandyopadhyay (2014)</a> simulating insect AFP from <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> with a similar ice binding surface to sbwAFP in water have also found equivalent arrangements of bound water molecules emphasizing the importance of the hydroxyl groups of the ice-binding threonine residues. Contrary to this, as mentioned previously, it is noteworthy that the putative ice-binding threonine residues of the alpha helical wfAFP can be substituted to structurally similar but hydrophobic valine residue with little effect on activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haymet et al., 1999</a>). This shows wfAFP ice binding does not depend on the threonine hydroxyl group, even suggesting a hydrophobic mode of interaction. Though tempting to make comparisons with sbwAFP threonine residues, we should be reminded that these proteins are completely different structures with significantly different ice-binding properties. It will be important to characterize both the wfAFP/ice interaction as well as analogous sbwAFP threonine to valine mutations before valid interpretations can be made."

Interestingly, unlike most AFPs, mpAFP appears to bind to all ice plane orientations, rather than specific ones. This may result from extended ice-like ordering of water from the ice binding surfaces interacting with ice in non-specific orientations, perhaps in a process similar to ice sintering (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kuroiwa, 1961</a>)."

Our freely diffusing MD simulations of AFP spontaneously adsorbing and inhibiting an active ice surface model have demonstrated that simulations can be used to provide detailed insight into molecular processes like crystal inhibition and modification."

The sbwAFP model was based on the pdb structure 1M8N (<a href=\"#bib26\">Leinala et al., 2002</a>). Simulations were run with PBCs using the NPT ensemble at various temperatures (225, 228, 230, 232 and 235 K) and 1 bar pressure employing Langevin dynamics. The PBCs were constant in the XY dimensions. Long-range Coulomb forces were computed with the Particle Mesh Ewald method with a grid spacing of 1 \u00c5. 2 fs timesteps were used with non-bonded interactions calculated every 2 fs and full electrostatics every 4 fs while hydrogens were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm. The cut-off distance was 12 \u00c5 with a switching distance of 10 \u00c5 and a pair-list distance of 14 \u00c5. Pressure was controlled to 1 atmosphere using the Nos\u00e9-Hoover Langevin piston method employing a piston period of 100 fs and a piston decay of 50 fs. Trajectory frames were captured every 100 picoseconds. Ice fractions were determined by measuring the ratio of mobile to immobile water molecules. Water molecules were determined to be immobile, (i.e., ice), if the average oxygen position of water had moved less than 0.8 \u00c5 over three successive trajectory frames (i.e., 200 ps). The initial pdb model of the sbwAFP at the ice/water interface is included in the supplementary data (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

The simulations show that spruce budworm antifreeze protein (sbwAFP) stalls ice growth at the ice prismatic plane in a manner consistent with the Gibbs-Thomson effect. While the study is clearly interesting, a number of serious criticisms have been raised, in particular concerning novelty (in light of earlier simulation studies of ice-growth inhibition by the same protein), the choice of the water model (with a TIP4P having a very low freezing point), the assumed ice growth mode, and the calculation of binding free energies. The points listed below would have to be convincingly addressed for the paper to be publishable in <i>eLife</i>."

In Nada, 2001, the same protein was studied, and very similar conclusions were reached. In particular, the ice melting point depression due to the Gibbs-Thomson effect has already been reported by Nada and Furukawa (Nada, 2008 and Nada, 2001). Specific questions to address are: What distinguishes the present study from these earlier simulations? Is the claim that \u201cto the best of our knowledge [the Gibbs-Thomson phenomena] has not been observed directly\u201d justified? What are the differences to these earlier studies? Does the broader temperature range, the consideration of mutant proteins, and the longer simulations lead to substantially different conclusions or a deeper understanding? It has to be clear that the present paper constitutes a major scientific advance."
