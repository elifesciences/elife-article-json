To understand intrinsic and acquired resistance to inhibition of MAPK signaling, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion screens in the setting of BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition. Loss of <i>KEAP1</i>, a negative regulator of NFE2L2/NRF2, modulated the response to BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition in BRAF-, NRAS-, KRAS-, EGFR-, and ALK-mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with inhibitors targeting the RTK/MAPK pathway increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells with intact KEAP1, and loss of KEAP1 abrogated this increase. In addition, loss of KEAP1 altered cell metabolism to allow cells to proliferate in the absence of MAPK signaling. These observations suggest that alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway may promote survival in the presence of multiple inhibitors targeting the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway."

To understand intrinsic and acquired resistance to inhibition of MAPK signaling, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion screens in the setting of BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition. Loss of <i>KEAP1</i>, a negative regulator of NFE2L2/NRF2, modulated the response to BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition in BRAF-, NRAS-, KRAS-, EGFR-, and ALK-mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with inhibitors targeting the RTK/MAPK pathway increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells with intact KEAP1, and loss of KEAP1 abrogated this increase. In addition, loss of KEAP1 altered cell metabolism to allow cells to proliferate in the absence of MAPK signaling. These observations suggest that alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway may promote survival in the presence of multiple inhibitors targeting the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway."

However, single-agent therapy targeting this pathway has had limited clinical success. While BRAF and EGFR inhibitors can produce dramatic responses temporarily, acquired resistance inevitably occurs in lung and other cancers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Balak et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kosaka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rudin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wagle et al., 2011</a>). In addition to this acquired resistance, many tumors also exhibit intrinsic resistance to these inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corcoran et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Prahallad et al., 2012</a>), as well as to MEK inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sun et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "Several studies have now shown that a general theme of resistance to these targeted therapies is activation of the RTK/MAPK pathway by alternative mechanisms. For example feedback activation of EGFR has been shown to cause intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition in colon cancer (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corcoran et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Prahallad et al., 2012</a>), and resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma can be caused by reactivation of the MAPK pathway by RTKs, NRAS, or COT (<a href=\"#bib26\">Johannessen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nazarian et al., 2010</a>). In lung cancer, transcriptional induction of ERBB3 causes intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibition in KRAS-mutant cancers (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sun et al., 2014</a>), and acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors was found to result from amplification of MET (<a href=\"#bib19\">Engelman et al., 2007</a>). These findings highlight the importance of maintaining RTK/MAPK signaling in lung and other cancers and also suggest redundancy among different genetic alterations in this pathway. Due to the many ways that cancers can acquire resistance to single therapies targeting the RTK/MAPK pathway, combination therapy may hold more promise for treating tumors with alterations in this pathway."

                        "text": "While patients with EGFR- and ALK-mutant lung cancer do often respond to EGFR and ALK inhibitors, these responses are temporary, as acquired resistance inevitably develops (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wilson et al., 2015</a>). Likewise, in on-going clinical trials testing MEK and BRAF inhibitors in KRAS- and BRAF-mutant lung cancer, responses have been reported in some patients (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blumenschein et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hyman et al., 2015</a>). However, it is clear that both intrinsic and acquired resistance limits efficacy of these inhibitors. To prospectively identify mechanisms of resistance to EGFR, ALK, BRAF, and MEK inhibition in lung cancer, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 drug resistance screens in five cancer cell lines with different alterations in the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway. We identified a number of genes whose deletion confers cell survival in these contexts, and focused on KEAP1, as loss of this gene modulated the response to targeted therapies in multiple contexts."

In the first set (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we performed three genome scale screens with the MEK inhibitor trametinib, in the NRAS-mutant lung cancer cell line H1299 (NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup>), the BRAF-mutant lung cancer cell line HCC364 (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>), and the KRAS-mutant lung cancer cell line CALU1 (KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>). One additional screen was performed in HCC364 cells treated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. To perform genome scale screens, we introduced the GeCKO v2 library (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shalem et al., 2014</a>) into Cas9-expressing cells, selected cells that incorporated the sgRNAs and allowed genome editing to occur over one week. Cells were then harvested for the Day 0 time point or passaged in the presence of trametinib or vemurafenib (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We used the lowest concentration of drug that inhibited ERK phosphorylation and resulted in proliferative arrest or death (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Genomic DNA was isolated on Days 14 and 21, and sgRNAs were quantified by sequencing. sgRNAs that were enriched in the Day 14 and Day 21 samples compared to the Day 0 samples were then identified, using two methods: (1) a cutoff of log2 fold change of at least 2, or (2) a STARS score (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doench et al., 2016</a>) of at least 5 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Several of the genes that scored in these screens also scored in a previous vemurafenib resistance screen in BRAF-mutant melanoma (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shalem et al., 2014</a>)."

As expected, several genes in the MAPK pathway scored, including NF1, a negative regulator of Ras/MAPK signaling, and DUSP1, a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits ERK. We also found several positive regulators of p38/JNK MAPK signaling, suggesting that these other MAPK pathways may play a pro-apoptotic or anti-proliferative role in these cells. PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling, and TSC1 and TSC2, negative regulators of mTOR signaling, also scored, suggesting that increased signaling through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway compensates for loss of Ras/MAPK signaling. In addition to these expected pathways, several of the genes that scored are components of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes or of the Mediator complex. There were also several genes whose products are components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Multiple transcription factors scored, as well as general transcription machinery genes. Other functional categories for which multiple genes scored include Rho signaling and histidine post-translational modifications. We noted that KEAP1, a substrate adaptor protein that targets NFE2L2/NRF2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, was the only gene that scored highly in all four genome scale screens (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

To determine if increased NRF2 levels were necessary for KEAP1 loss to modulate drug sensitivity, we knocked out both KEAP1 and NRF2 in HCC827 cells. KEAP1 loss no longer promoted survival when NRF2 was also lost (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). To determine if increased NRF2 levels were sufficient to promote survival, we overexpressed wildtype NRF2 or two different NRF2 mutants (G31R or D29H), which contain mutations in the KEAP1 binding domain. Overexpression of wildtype NRF2 led to an increase in cell survival in the presence of multiple drugs. Overexpression of NRF2<sup>G31R</sup> or NRF2<sup>D29H</sup> resulted in higher NRF2 protein levels and increased resistance to trametinib, vemurafenib, and erlotinib (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), suggesting that elevated NRF2 levels in KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells mediates resistance. Although CALU1 cells harbor a KEAP1<sup>P128L</sup> mutation, this mutation has not been reported in the cBioPortal or COSMIC (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cerami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Forbes et al., 2015</a>), and NRF2 levels increased upon KEAP1 knockout (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the regulation of NRF2 by KEAP1 is intact in these cells. We also found that restoring wildtype KEAP1 expression in A549 cells, which are KRAS-mutant and KEAP1-null, increased their sensitivity to trametinib. In contrast, expression of the KEAP1<sup>G333C</sup> mutant, which does not regulate NRF2, failed to alter trametinib sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>).

To further explore the mechanism by which KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> promotes survival in the presence of RTK/MAPK inhibitors, we investigated whether drug treatment affected KEAP1/NRF2 signaling. A prior report demonstrated that Ras/MAPK/Jun signaling increased expression of NRF2 mRNA and NRF2 target genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">DeNicola et al., 2011</a>), so we hypothesized that drug treatment would decrease expression of NRF2 mRNA and NRF2-regulated target genes. Surprisingly, we found that trametinib, erlotinib, and LDK-378 treatment increased rather than decreased expression of NRF2 mRNA and NRF2 target genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) in HCC364, CALU1, MGH-065, and HCC827 cells. As expected, KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> also increased NRF2 target gene expression. Trametinib treatment also increased NRF2 protein levels and induced a shift in the migration of NRF2 protein on SDS-PAGE, whereas KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> maintained the expression of the higher molecular weight form of NRF2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although trametinib treatment decreased KEAP1 expression and increased NRF2 expression, the combination of KEAP1 knockout with trametinib treatment caused a greater effect on KEAP1 levels, NRF2 levels, and NRF2 target gene expression. These observations suggest that treatment with these inhibitors partially activates NRF2, and that loss of KEAP1 leads to further NRF2 activation, which decreases drug sensitivity."

We investigated whether each of these functions was involved in modulating sensitivity to RTK/MAPK inhibition. Since MAPK pathway inhibition is maintained in KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), drug efflux likely does not explain resistance. To determine if loss of KEAP1 promotes survival through modulation of ROS, we treated control or KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells with DMSO or drug and measured ROS. We found that treatment with trametinib, erlotinib, or LDK-378 induced ROS in KEAP1-intact cells and that ROS was dramatically decreased in KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells or NRF2 overexpressing cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> may promote survival by reducing ROS levels. The ability of RTK/MAPK inhibitors to induce ROS in control cells may explain their ability to increase NRF2 levels, as increased ROS would lead to release of NRF2 from KEAP1 regulation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kobayashi et al., 2004</a>). Further activation of NRF2 through deletion of KEAP1 may then reduce ROS levels, leading to increased survival in the presence of drug."

We also found that cystine, the oxidized form of cysteine, was among the most decreased metabolites in KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), suggesting that KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> contributes to a change in oxidative state in which cystine is converted to cysteine, which is then used to make glutathione."

Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis, and both subunits of this enzyme (GCLC and GCLM) are NRF2 target genes. As described above, expression of both of these genes was higher in drug-treated KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells compared to drug-treated control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Glycine is also a precursor to glutathione, and NRF2 has previously been shown to regulate expression of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1,2) (<a href=\"#bib15\">DeNicola et al., 2015</a>), which catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine. We found that expression of SHMT1 and SHMT2 decreased upon trametinib treatment in CALU1 and HCC364 control cells but was partially maintained in KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells, although this was not observed in MGH-065 and HCC827 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In addition, we found that expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX1), which converts GSH to GSSG, increased with drug treatment in control cells, but this increase was abrogated in KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Conversely, expression of glutathione reductase (GSR), which converts GSSG to GSH, was higher in KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> cells than in control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These observations suggest that the conversion of oxidized to reduced glutathione may be involved in the modulation of drug sensitivity meditated by loss of KEAP1."

NAC reduced ROS and decreased sensitivity to trametinib (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), indicating that ROS reduction through increased glutathione synthesis is important for KEAP1<sup>KO</sup>-mediated survival. To further investigate whether glutathione synthesis and ROS reduction was important for survival, we treated cells with trametinib and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which inhibits GCL. The combination of BSO and trametinib increased ROS and greatly decreased viability in control cells expressing sgGFP, while KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> prevented the BSO-induced decrease in viability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, combined treatment with BSO and trametinib dramatically increased ROS levels in A549 cells in which wildtype KEAP1 expression had been restored, but not in the parental cells or cells expressing KEAP1<sup>G333C</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These observations indicate that KEAP1<sup>KO</sup> can decrease ROS even when GCL is inhibited, suggesting that the conversion of oxidized to reduced glutathione may be more important for promoting survival in the presence of drug. Together, these observations suggest that trametinib treatment induces ROS, which activates NRF2 to low levels. Loss of KEAP1 leads to further activation of NRF2, which decreases drug sensitivity in part by increasing glutathione and decreasing ROS."

Here we have expanded this approach to identify mechanisms of resistance that are shared across multiple targeted therapeutics in several genetic contexts. We have found that KEAP1 loss modulates sensitivity to inhibition of EGFR, ALK, BRAF, or MEK in lung cancer cell lines with EGFR, ALK, BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS mutations. In multiple independent CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we found that sgRNAs targeting KEAP1 were more highly enriched than sgRNAs targeting NF1, DUSP1, PTEN, or TSC1/2, known negative regulators of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Previous studies using shRNA screens to identify potential combination therapies for Ras-mutant cancers found that RTK/MAPK pathway reactivation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Manchado et al., 2016</a>) or induction of anti-apoptotic proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Corcoran et al., 2013</a>) limits therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, loss of KEAP1 does not lead to reactivation of the MAPK pathway or decreased levels of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, and instead reduces drug-induced ROS and alters cell metabolism."

It has previously been shown that ROS detoxification and modulation of redox state by NRF2 contributes to tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib14\">DeNicola et al., 2011</a>), and NRF2 has recently been found to be an oncogene (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2016</a>). In addition to its role in regulating redox state, NRF2 has also previously been shown to regulate expression of many metabolic enzymes, redirecting glucose and glutamine into anabolic pathways that support proliferation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mitsuishi et al., 2012</a>) and controlling serine and glycine biosynthesis to support glutathione and nucleotide production (<a href=\"#bib15\">DeNicola et al., 2015</a>). Thus, increased expression of NRF2 upon KEAP1 loss can confer resistance to RTK/MAPK pathway inhibition by reducing ROS and regulating metabolic pathways. Chio <i>et al.</i> recently reported that NRF2 supports pancreatic tumor maintenance, and that combined targeting of AKT and glutathione synthesis inhibits pancreatic cancer (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chio et al., 2016</a>). While their study focused on the role of NRF2 in regulating mRNA translation in pancreatic cancer, their findings regarding glutathione synthesis being a key function of NRF2 are in concordance with our observations."

This effect confounds the use of CRISPR/Cas9 negative selection screening to identify essential genes in amplified regions. We do not believe that this effect is relevant to this study, in which we have performed positive selection screens to identify genes whose loss promotes proliferation under drug treatment. Moreover, we directly compare the same cells under two conditions; thus, any genes that are affected by the gene-independent effect will score in both conditions."

As seen with vemurafenib treatment in melanoma or with EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer, acquired resistance will likely arise. Furthermore, while MEK inhibitors only elicit responses in a small number of lung cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blumenschein et al., 2015</a>), these responders are also likely to develop resistance. Predicting how resistance may arise in these patients will be important for developing more effective combination therapies. In addition, for those patients that do not initially respond, intrinsic resistance in a subset of these patients may be explained by the mechanisms we describe here. The KEAP1/NRF2 pathway is genetically altered in approximately 30% of lung squamous cell carcinomas and approximately 20% of lung adenocarcinomas. Alterations in this pathway can co-occur with alterations in the RTK/Ras pathway (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cerami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</a>), although KEAP1/NRF2 alterations are enriched in the \u2018oncogene negative\u2019 subset of lung cancers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</a>). BRAF and MEK inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for RAS- and BRAF-mutant lung cancer. However, for most of these trials matched pre-treatment and post-relapse biopsy specimens are not available for molecular analysis of resistance mechanisms. Gainor <i>et al.</i> recently identified a NRF2 mutation in a patient with acquired resistance to an ALK inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gainor et al., 2016</a>). This mutation (E79Q) is in a mutational hotspot and has previously been shown to impair recognition of NRF2 by KEAP1, thus activating the pathway (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shibata et al., 2008b</a>). This tumor also harbored a secondary ALK mutation of unknown function and became resistant to a second generation ALK inhibitor. Thus it is possible that the NRF2 mutation contributed to survival in the presence of crizotinib treatment and allowed the cells to acquire additional resistance mutations over time."

As more patients are treated with RTK/MAPK inhibitors, analyzing KEAP1 and NRF2 status in pre-treatment and post-resistance tumor samples will determine if loss of KEAP1 or gain of NRF2 are clinically relevant mechanisms of acquired and intrinsic resistance to these therapies in lung cancer. Stratifying patients based on these findings will be important for evaluating the efficacy of these inhibitors in clinical trials and for choosing the appropriate treatment for patients."

Four hours before metabolite extraction, cells were re-fed with fresh media containing drug or DMSO. Cells were then washed with PBS at 37\u00b0C, followed by metabolite extraction by scraping in 80% methanol (on dry ice), insoluble materials collected, two sequential extractions combined and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Prior to mass spectrometry, the metabolite extracts were lyophilized, resolubilized in 20 \u00b5L of LC/MS grade water, and then analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using positive ion/negative ion polarity switching via selected reaction monitoring (SRM) on a 5500 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB/SCIEX), as previously described (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>).

The authors identify loss of KEAP1 as a mechanism of this resistance. Mechanistically, they link KEAP1 loss to the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the de-repression of the KEAP1 target, the transcription factor NRF2, which promotes expression of certain anti-oxidant genes. The authors contend that the induction of ROS is essential for the anti-proliferative effects of EGFR, BRAF or MEK inhibitors. The authors conclude that loss of KEAP1 therefore uncouples MEK inhibition and ROS induction to promote drug resistance. Conceptually, the findings are interesting, novel and potentially provide an important advance in the field, particularly as it pertains to understanding the mechanism and effectiveness of MEK inhibitors in KRAS or BRAF mutated lung cancer. However, there are several important issues that must to be experimentally addressed and/or clarified in the manuscript before this manuscript would be suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

However, it is not clear whether loss of KEAP1 actually promotes drug resistance, (i.e. the capacity of KEAP(Null) cells to proliferate continuously in the presence of drug in vitro or to sustain tumor growth when transplanted into drug treated mice), or whether KEAP1 silencing simply attenuates the effects of the various inhibitors over the 14-21 day assay period without promoting long-term growth and tumorigenesis per se. For example, the authors' measure of drug resistance documents the effects of either KEAP1 silencing or ectopic NRF2 expression on \"Relative Cell Number\". CRISPR/CAS9 silencing of KEAP1 leads to a 1.5 to ~4 fold increase in \"Relative Cell Number\" but it is not clear that this reflects true drug resistance. The authors fail to provide any clonogenicity assays or to provide dose response curves of cell proliferation vs. drug concentration such that GI50 and/or GI90 values may be calculated. Moreover, the authors have not tested whether KEAP1 silencing can promote the growth of xenotransplanted tumors in appropriately drug treated mice, a point that all three reviewers agreed was a key piece of missing data. Hence, because effects of the various manipulations on \"Relative Cell Number\" were often very modest (from 50% \u2013 ~4 fold), there was substantial concern raised by all three reviewers that the authors are potentially overstating their observations with regard to long-term drug resistance vs. short-term attenuation of drug anti-proliferative effects, which substantially undermined enthusiasm for the research as presented and which would have to be addressed directly in any revised manuscript."

Indeed, in the trametinib-treated HCC-364 cells there is clearly residual pERK1/2 present in lanes 4-6 of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. Hence there is concern that the sub-maximal inhibition of BRAF(V600E)-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK signaling may allow sufficient signal through this pathway to continue to promote cell proliferation. To that end, to what extent are the sgKEAP1 cells sensitive to an ERK1/2 inhibitor such as SCH772984? An additional concern is that the authors assessed the effects of the various pathway-targeted agents 48 hours post-addition, but their assay for drug resistance was at 14-21 days post drug treatment. Since many cancer cells display adaptive responses leading to ERK1/2 reactivation at late times after drug addition, how did the levels of pERK1/2 compare at 48 hours vs. 14 days post drug-addition? Finally, the authors use A549 cells, which developed as a KRAS mutated, KEAP1-Null cell line. To what extent are A549 cells resistant to trametinib and why is a concentration of 25 nM used in A549 cell experiments but 1.5 microM trametinib was used in KEAP1 proficient H1299 cells?"

Do the authors believe that different cells have different sensitivity thresholds for trametinib? Moreover, it is not clear that this is the relevant concentration for selection for drug resistance. Indeed, in the trametinib-treated HCC-364 cells there is clearly residual pERK1/2 present in lanes 4-6 of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. Hence there is concern that the sub-maximal inhibition of BRAF(V600E)-&gt;MEK-&gt;ERK signaling may allow sufficient signal through this pathway to continue to promote cell proliferation. To that end, to what extent are the sgKEAP1 cells sensitive to an ERK1/2 inhibitor such as SCH772984? An additional concern is that the authors assessed the effects of the various pathway-targeted agents 48 hours post-addition, but their assay for drug resistance was at 14-21 days post drug treatment. Since many cancer cells display adaptive responses leading to ERK1/2 reactivation at late times after drug addition, how did the levels of pERK1/2 compare at 48 hours vs. 14 days post drug-addition? Finally, the authors use A549 cells, which developed as a KRAS mutated, KEAP1-Null cell line. To what extent are A549 cells resistant to trametinib and why is a concentration of 25 nM used in A549 cell experiments but 1.5 microM trametinib was used in KEAP1 proficient H1299 cells?</i>"

This is likely due to the many other genetic and epigenetic differences between these cell lines.

Do these represent nonspecific bands, residual expression, degradation products or a sub-population of cells without KEAP1 KO? Is the mRNA expression of KEAP1 undetectable in KO cells? If indeed there is residual KEAP1 expression rather than complete KO, this needs to be addressed in the text. Related to this, the authors demonstrate that trametinib treatment of HCC364 cells leads to decreased KEAP1 and increased NRF2 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Indeed, the magnitude of the effects of trametinib on KEAP1 and NRF2 expression appear equivalent to the effects of CRISPR/CAS9-mediated silencing of KEAP1 (compare KEAP1 and NRF2 expression in sgGFP vs. sgKEAP1-1 vs. sgKEAP1-2 in trametinib treated HCC364 cells in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, lanes 16-18).

This reduction in mRNA levels may reflect nonsense mediated decay of transcripts encoding premature stop codons as a consequence of CRISPR-Cas9 cutting.

This tumor also had a secondary ALK mutation of unknown function and eventually became resistant to a second generation ALK inhibitor. We believe that the NRF2 mutation may have provided a means for such tumor cells to survive the initial crizotinib treatment and acquire additional resistance mutations over time.
