Here, we study the regulatory potential of MYST1-(MOF)-containing MSL and NSL complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitors. We find that both complexes influence transcription by targeting promoters and TSS-distal enhancers. In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not exclusively enriched on the X chromosome, yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it specifically regulates <i>Tsix</i>, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion leads to decreased <i>Tsix</i> expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently, enhanced accumulation of <i>Xist</i> and variable numbers of inactivated X chromosomes during early differentiation. The NSL complex provides additional, <i>Tsix</i>-independent repression of <i>Xist</i> by maintaining pluripotency. MSL and NSL complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs."

Here, we study the regulatory potential of MYST1-(MOF)-containing MSL and NSL complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neuronal progenitors. We find that both complexes influence transcription by targeting promoters and TSS-distal enhancers. In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not exclusively enriched on the X chromosome, yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it specifically regulates <i>Tsix</i>, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion leads to decreased <i>Tsix</i> expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently, enhanced accumulation of <i>Xist</i> and variable numbers of inactivated X chromosomes during early differentiation. The NSL complex provides additional, <i>Tsix</i>-independent repression of <i>Xist</i> by maintaining pluripotency. MSL and NSL complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs."

Many of these mechanisms are identical in males and females, but some are not. Female mammals, for example, carry two X chromosomes, whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome. Since the two X chromosomes in females contain essentially the same set of genes, one of them undergoes silencing to prevent the overproduction of certain proteins. This process, which is called X-inactivation, occurs during different stages of development and it must be tightly controlled."

                        "text": "Histone acetyl transferases (HATs) are among the key architects of the cellular epigenetic landscape as the acetylation of histones is unanimously associated with transcriptionally active domains. Many HATs also have the ability to acetylate non-histone proteins extending their influence to diverse cellular pathways inside and outside of the nucleus (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib62\">Sapountzi and Cote, 2011</a>). Based on their catalytic domains, the HATs are classified into two major families, GCN5 N-acetyl <span class=\"underline\">t</span>ransferases (GNATs) and MYST HATs (named after the founding members MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60), that encompass diverse sets of protein complexes. The individual complex members enhance and modulate the enzymes' activities, guiding the versatile HATs towards specific functions. GCN5, for example, is part of SAGA, ATAC, and SLIK complexes that are associated with distinct histone tail modifications and differential gene regulation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee and Workman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nagy et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, one of the well-known members of the MYST family, MOF (also known as: KAT8, MYST1), is rather substrate-specific for lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhtar and Becker, 2000</a>) and its interaction partners are thought to mainly alter the specificity and extent of MOF's H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac). As part of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MOF, MLE, roX1 and roX2 lncRNAs) in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, MOF is recruited to the single X chromosome of male flies. The subsequent spreading of H4K16 acetylation results in transcriptional upregulation of the male X chromosome, the major means of <i>D. melanogaster</i> dosage compensation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Conrad and Akhtar, 2011</a>). In addition to the highly specialized MSL-associated role, MOF is also involved in the more universal and sex-independent regulation of housekeeping genes within the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex (NSL1, NSL2, NSL3, MBD-R2, MCRS2, MOF, WDS) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mendjan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Raja et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Feller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lam et al., 2012</a>)."

MOF is essential for mammalian embryonic development and unlike the male-specific lethality in <i>Drosophila</i>, deletion of <i>Mof</i> in mice is lethal for both sexes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gupta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>). More specifically, mammalian MOF is critical for physiological nuclear architecture (<a href=\"#bib72\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>), DNA damage repair (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gupta et al., 2008</a>), maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2012</a>), differentiation of T cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta et al., 2013</a>), and survival of post-mitotic Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kumar et al., 2011</a>). Compared to MOF, mammalian MSL and NSL complex members are poorly understood. Nevertheless, the individual complex members appear to have important functions in vivo as mutations of the NSL complex member KANSL1 cause the core phenotype of the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome (<a href=\"#bib33\">Koolen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zollino et al., 2012</a>) and are common amongst patients with both Down syndrome and myeloid leukemia (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yoshida et al., 2013</a>). Another NSL-associated protein, PHF20 has been shown to associate with methylated Lys370 and Lys382 of p53 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cui et al., 2012</a>) and to be required for somatic cell reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zhao et al., 2013a</a>). WDR5 was shown to be an essential regulator of the core transcription network in embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ang et al., 2011</a>).

We found that the MSL and NSL members possess concurrent, as well as independent functions and that effects generally attributed to MOF are frequently accompanied by the NSL complex. The NSL complex abundantly binds to promoters of broadly expressed genes in ESCs and NPCs. These genes are predominantly downregulated upon depletion of either MOF or KANSL3. In contrast, the MSL complex shows more restricted binding in ESCs, which expands after differentiation, particularly at NPC-specific genes. In addition to promoter-proximal binding, we discover several thousand binding sites of KANSL3 and MSL2 at promoter-distal loci with enhancer-specific epigenetic signatures. The majority of these distal regulatory sites are bound in ESCs, but not in differentiated cells, and genes that are predicted to be targeted by TSS-distal binding of MSL2 are frequently downregulated in sh<i>Msl2</i>-treated cells. The distinct, yet synergistic actions of both complexes become very apparent at the X inactivation center (XIC) that encodes numerous non-coding RNAs involved in the silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in differentiating female cells. We show that the MSL but not the NSL complex directly promotes expression of <i>Tsix</i>, the inverse transcript and the key murine repressor of <i>Xist</i> during early differentiation. Depletion of MSL proteins results in attenuation of <i>Tsix</i> transcription, enhanced <i>Xist</i> RNA accumulation and \u2018chaotic\u2019 inactivation of variable numbers of X chromosomes during early differentiation. In addition to the very specific effect of MSL1/MSL2-depletion on the XIC genes, we show that MOF together with the NSL complex also influences <i>Xist</i> levels, but instead of affecting <i>Tsix</i>, MOF and KANSL3 depletion diminish key pluripotency factors involved in repressing <i>Xist</i>. Our study provides novel insights into the intricate interplay between MSL and NSL complexes in orchestrating gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate how MSLs and NSLs ensure the active state of two X chromosomes in mouse embryonic stem cells via distinct mechanisms."

To gain a better understanding of how MOF-associated complexes behave throughout the differentiation process, in parallel to cell type-specific markers, we also monitored the RNA and protein levels of MOF, MSL (MSL1, MSL2), and NSL (KANSL1, KANSL3, MCRS1) complex members (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, MSL and NSL complex members showed distinct RNA and protein dynamics during the process of differentiation: KANSL1 and KANSL3 protein levels remained unchanged, whereas MSL1, MSL2 and MOF became more abundant in NPCs accompanied by increased H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results were confirmed using another ES cell line and its NPC derivative (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

This unbiased approach allowed us to determine five main groups of binding distinguished by different combinations of the proteins and cell-type-specific dynamics. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, three large clusters of binding sites encompassed regions, where at least 1 of the investigated proteins was present both in ESCs and NPCs (clusters A, B and C). The binding sites of clusters A and B predominantly overlapped with annotated transcription start sites (TSS) in contrast to the regions that were bound exclusively in ESCs, which tended to contain inter- and intragenic regions (clusters D and E, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The width of the enrichments did not differ profoundly between the groups (cluster E: 836 bp median width, cluster A: 1782 bp median width). We found surprisingly few regions where MOF associated primarily with MSL complex members. Instead, approximately 80% of all MOF peaks displayed strong KANSL3 and MCRS1 signals (cluster B, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting a predominant role of the NSL complex among MOF-associated complexes and a more specific role for the MSL complex at subsets of promoters and numerous intergenic and intronic regions. As the different clusters showed distinct enrichment patterns and diverse genomic localization, we set out to analyze the individual groups of binding in more detail."

We identified 8947 TSSs overlapping with ChIP-seq peaks of KANSL3 and/or MCRS1 in ESCs that encompassed virtually all MOF- and MSL-bound TSSs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This pattern did not change substantially in NPCs where TSSs overlapping with MOF peaks almost always (99%) showed significant enrichments of KANSL3 and in 35% of the cases additionally contained a peak of MSL2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, middle panel). Genes that were TSS-bound in ESCs tended to be bound in NPCs as well (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, middle panel and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We next generated RNA-seq data for ESCs and NPCs, determined genes that were expressed in both cell types (FPKM &gt;4) and found that all ChIPed proteins preferably bound to the promoters of active genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Interestingly, in ESCs, genes whose TSSs were bound by members of both complexes showed higher median expression values than genes bound by only one complex (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast to the differing expression values, analysis of gene ontology (GO) using DAVID (<a href=\"#bib28\">Huang da et al., 2009</a>) revealed basic housekeeping functions for both gene groups, regardless of whether they were bound by the NSL complex only or by both MOF-complexes together (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Consistently, the promoters of all target gene groups were enriched for motifs associated with broad, non-cell-type-specific expression such as ELK1, YY1, CREB, and E2F (<a href=\"#bib82\">Xie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Farre et al., 2007</a>) and showed profound enrichments of CpG islands (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), which is indicative of housekeeping genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Landolin et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, when we analyzed the subset of genes that gained binding of either KANSL3 or MSL2 in NPCs, we found strong enrichments of GO terms related to embryonic development for KANSL3 targets and cell migration and neuronal development for MSL2 targets."

Interestingly, MOF- or KANSL3-depleted cells showed more severe proliferation defects than MSL1- and MSL2-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). We subsequently performed RNA-seq experiments from shRNA-treated cells and determined their differential expression against the scrambled control to dissect transcriptional outcomes of the depletions at a global level. We found a striking overlap between the differential expression of MSL1 and MSL2 knockdowns and a higher resemblance of MOF-dependent differential expression to that of KANSL3-depletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). When we specifically focused on genes that we had identified as TSS-bound in our ChIP-seq samples, we found that their transcripts tended to be downregulated in all four knockdowns in comparison to untargeted genes which showed higher fractions of upregulation.

Instead, both complexes narrowly bind to TSSs where their co-occurrence is associated with significantly higher median expression values than those solely bound by the NSL complex. Moreover, we found that MOF is dispensable for the TSS recruitment of its interaction partners and that depletions of the individual proteins predominantly result in the downregulation of TSS-bound genes, further supporting the fact that the promoter-binding of the MSL and the NSL complex is associated with active transcription."

In contrast to the binding mode represented by clusters A and B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), here MSL2, MCRS1, and KANSL3 were predominantly enriched within introns and intergenic regions that underwent significant CpG methylation upon differentiation (e.g., from median 50% CpG methylation in ESCs to more than 80% in NPCs for cluster D; bisulfite sequencing data from <a href=\"#bib66\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, CpG methylation in NPCs was particularly pronounced around the center of the regions with significant ChIP enrichments in ESCs, indicating a correlation between the loss of ChIP-seq signal for MOF, MSL1, MSL2, KANSL3 and MCRS1, and DNA methylation upon differentiation. In addition, the regions of cluster D and, to a lesser extent the MSL1-rich cluster E (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), showed highly localized enrichments of DNase hypersensitivity sites (DNase HS), RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), p300, methylation of histone 3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and acetylation of histone 3 on lysine 27 (H3K27ac) in ESCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which are characteristic features of enhancer regions.

Since a recent report showed H4K16 acetylation to be present at p300- and H3K27-acetylation-independent enhancer regions (<a href=\"#bib71\">Taylor et al., 2013</a>), we analyzed the moderate TSS-distal enrichments of MOF in more detail and observed a slight preference for TSS-distal regions that were not overlapping with previously published ESC enhancer regions (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

Approximately, 81% of these cluster C regions had solitary MSL2 enrichments without significant signals of any of the other ChIPed proteins.

In contrast to the previously described binding sites that were characterized by the prevalence of open, active chromatin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a>), here MSL2 was excluded from hypo-methylated DNA regions (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>; note the different behavior of KANSL3).

We show that MOF and its associated proteins are involved in gene expression regulation via different means: first, they all target the promoters of housekeeping genes in a cell-type-independent manner and second, members of both complexes occupy different sets of ESC-specific enhancers that are essential for the maintenance of stem cell identity. We demonstrate the distinct and novel functions carried out by the MOF-associated complex members by revealing that both complexes contribute to the repression of X inactivation in ESCs via different means: While we establish the MSL complex as a direct regulator of <i>Tsix</i>, MOF and the NSL complex play an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency factors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

We find that all complexes bind to promoters of housekeeping genes in ESCs and NPCs with NSL complex members occupying the majority of the target genes, while MOF and MSL proteins bind NSL-bound genes in a more restricted manner. Furthermore, we observe that upon differentiation, KANSL3 and MSL2 additionally occupy TSSs of different sets of cell-type-specific genes in the absence of MOF. (<b>B</b>) When we studied the functions of MSL and NSL complexes at the murine X inactivation center, we determined two basic mechanisms by which the different proteins affect the maintenance of two active X chromosomes in ESCs. (1) MSLs bind to the promoter and enhancer of <i>Tsix</i> whose transcription represses <i>Xist</i> expression. Upon depletion of MSLs, <i>Tsix</i> expression is compromised, so is REX1 recruitment to the <i>Tsix</i> locus. Consequently, <i>Xist</i> is increasingly transcribed and can occasionally accumulate. (2) In addition, MOF, MSLs, and NSLs bind to typical enhancers (TE) and super enhancers (SE) in ESCs, and notably those of pluripotency factors. In WT ESCs, the high expression of pluripotency factors is another layer of <i>Xist</i> repression. The depletions of MOF or KANSL3, but not of MSL1 or MSL2 reduce the expression of pluripotency factors involved in <i>Xist</i> repression causing a <i>Tsix</i>-independent increase of <i>Xist</i> expression."

Despite the fact that the depletion of KANSL3 does not strongly reduce global H4K16 acetylation levels, we observed strikingly similar protein and transcriptome changes in KANSL3- or MOF-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). On the other hand, MSL1- and MSL2-depletion caused marked decreases of H4K16 acetylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). This is consistent with previous reports that established MSL proteins as the main enhancers of MOF's H4K16 acetylation activity, while the NSL complex was shown to possess broader substrate specificity and can crosstalk with histone methylases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kadlec et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhao et al., 2013b</a>). Unexpectedly, we observed remarkably different phenotypic changes in MSL1- or MSL2-depleted cells compared to MOF- and KANSL3-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). A striking example was the strong reduction of key pluripotency factors in KANSL3- and MOF-depleted cells that remain unaffected in MSL1- and MSL2-knockdowns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results support the recent finding that MOF is vital for the maintenance of pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2012</a>), but we furthermore show that this is an NSL- and not MSL-related function of MOF independent of H4K16 acetylation deposition."

This notion was further supported by the finding that MOF predominantly binds to promoters of broadly expressed genes as part of the NSL complex and subsequently supports their transcription (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>). MSL1 and MSL2, on the other hand, bound to a relatively small subset of broadly expressed MOF-NSL-targeted genes that were significantly stronger expressed than those where MOF was exclusively present with NSL complex members (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The additive effects of the complexes on gene expression were intriguing, and whether they influence each other's activity or exert their functions separately should be studied in the future. We propose that the MSL complex fine-tunes MOF's activity and ensures precise regulation of more specific targets\u2014after all, their presence is essential for the recruitment of MOF to NSL-independent targets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Our model is surprisingly similar to the picture that is emerging from <i>Drosophila</i> research where the NSL complex regulates housekeeping genes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Feller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lam et al., 2012</a>) while the MSL complex fulfills a highly specialized role on the male X chromosome (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Conrad and Akhtar, 2011</a>)."

On a global scale, MOF did not yield strong enrichments for canonical enhancers; however, both MSL2 and KANSL3 showed robust signals for TSS-distal regions in ESCs, but not in NPCs, which reflected the transcriptional activity of these regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This apparent MOF-independent binding of the individual proteins (that tended to prefer different sets of enhancers; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) suggests that KANSL3 and MSL2 stimulate transcription even in the absence of the histone acetyltransferase. Both proteins are in principle capable of supporting transcription: the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of KANSL3 can directly activate transcription in vitro (<a href=\"#bib59\">Raja et al., 2010</a>) and human MSL2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase at lysine 34 of H2B (H2BK34ub) (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wu et al., 2011</a>), which has been suggested to promote methylation of H3K4, and thus gene expression (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, we observed several hundred genes that had been predicted to be regulated by TSS-distal binding sites of MSL2 or KANSL3 to be downregulated in the respective knockdowns with particularly high frequencies in MSL2-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). It is important to note that the subset of ESC enhancers for key pluripotency factors (e.g., <i>Klf4</i>, <i>Sox2</i>) were bound concomitantly by KANSL3 and MSL2 and only the depletion of KANSL3, but not of MSL1 or MSL2 diminished protein and transcript levels of these key ESC molecules (see above). It is possible that KANSL3 could rescue loss of MSL2 at certain loci, but the exact mechanisms through which KANSL3 affects transcription via enhancer-binding need to be studied further. Furthermore, the pluripotency network and/or Mediator-related functions at super enhancers may be sufficient and dominant over MSL2 to maintain the expression of the pluripotency factors in the absence of MSL2, but may well be dependent on the function of KANSL3 at these regions."

In contrast, MOF-depleted cells showed downregulation of pluripotency factors and much higher <i>Xist</i> levels. Previous studies demonstrated that in undifferentiated ESCs, where pluripotency factors are highly abundant, even severe downregulation of <i>Tsix</i>, or <i>Tsix</i>-deletion has almost no effect on <i>Xist</i> transcription (<a href=\"#bib48\">Morey et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Navarro et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nesterova et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the pronounced <i>Xist</i> upregulation seen in MOF-depleted cells seems to be an indirect effect due to the downregulation of pluripotency factors, while the reduction of <i>Tsix</i> transcripts in MSL1- and MSL2-depleted cells, where pluripotency factors remain unaffected, has milder consequences on <i>Xist</i> levels."
