Improvements in the technique that have made this breakthrough possible \u2013 a technique known as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM; <a href=\"#bib7\">Doerr, 2016</a>) \u2013 are a very welcome addition to the other structural tools used in biochemistry and cell biology."

This means that fragile structures are less likely to undergo modifications before imaging. Unfortunately, if the image of an unstained sample is completely in focus, its features are practically invisible. Microscopists traditionally get around this problem by defocusing the image enough to see the transparent details (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adrian et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Taylor and Glaeser, 1976</a>). While out-of-focus images of transparent objects are, paradoxically, far better than in-focus ones, the contrast in such images (that is, the relative difference between the light and dark areas) provides only a ghostly representation of the object being studied. Now, in eLife, Radostin Danev and Wolfgang Baumeister of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry show that it is possible to generate highly detailed maps of large protein complexes using images that are in focus (<a href=\"#bib6\">Danev and Baumeister, 2016</a>)."

While phase plates are easy to produce for light microscopes, making phase plates for electron microscopes has proved to be very difficult. Designs for such\u00a0phase plates were proposed as early as 1947 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boersch, 1947</a>), but progress has been slow. 15 years ago, for example, Danev and Kuniaki Nagayama made a phase plate by using a focused-ion beam to drill a tiny hole in a thin carbon film (<a href=\"#bib3\">Danev and Nagayama, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Danev and Nagayama, 2008</a>). However, prolonged use led to a phenomenon known as \u201ccharging\u201d, which introduced unwanted phase shifts into the electron beams."

(<b>C</b>) Zernike realized that changing the phase of the unscattered portion of the transmitted wave (that is, the part that was not deflected when the wave passed through the object) by 90 degrees greatly improved the quality of the image.

To reconstruct the structure of a protein complex, many cryo-EM images need to be merged together using image processing software. Correcting for each image being out-of-focus by a (slightly) different amount is currently a standard part of image processing in cryo-EM, but this is much trickier to do when images are taken as close as possible to being in focus. Although Danev and Baumeister took steps to collect each image as carefully as possible, I worry that some remaining uncertainty might limit the level of detail achieved when the images are processed."

One could then estimate the focus from looking at the support film in the images, although the support film would also increase the amount of noise in the images. This is a step that many researchers who use cryo-EM are unwilling to take. I thus imagine a door of opportunity will open to anyone who comes up with a better alternative."
