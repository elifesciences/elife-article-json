We have generated a murine model with conditional deletion of WT1 in the lateral plate mesoderm, using the G2 enhancer of the <i>Gata4</i> gene as a driver. 80% of G2-<i>Gata4</i><sup>Cre</sup>;<i>Wt1</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> embryos developed typical Bochdalek-type CDH. We show that the posthepatic mesenchymal plate coelomic epithelium gives rise to a mesenchyme that populates the pleuroperitoneal folds isolating the pleural cavities before the migration of the somitic myoblasts. This process fails when Wt1 is deleted from this area. Mutant embryos show Raldh2 downregulation in the lateral mesoderm, but not in the intermediate mesoderm. The mutant phenotype was partially rescued by retinoic acid treatment of the pregnant females. Replacement of intermediate by lateral mesoderm recapitulates the evolutionary origin of the diaphragm in mammals. CDH might thus be viewed as an evolutionary atavism."

We have generated a murine model with conditional deletion of WT1 in the lateral plate mesoderm, using the G2 enhancer of the <i>Gata4</i> gene as a driver. 80% of G2-<i>Gata4</i><sup>Cre</sup>;<i>Wt1</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> embryos developed typical Bochdalek-type CDH. We show that the posthepatic mesenchymal plate coelomic epithelium gives rise to a mesenchyme that populates the pleuroperitoneal folds isolating the pleural cavities before the migration of the somitic myoblasts. This process fails when Wt1 is deleted from this area. Mutant embryos show Raldh2 downregulation in the lateral mesoderm, but not in the intermediate mesoderm. The mutant phenotype was partially rescued by retinoic acid treatment of the pregnant females. Replacement of intermediate by lateral mesoderm recapitulates the evolutionary origin of the diaphragm in mammals. CDH might thus be viewed as an evolutionary atavism."

CDH occurs approximately in 1 out of 3000 births, accounting for about 8% of all severe congenital anomalies. 80\u201390% of all the cases are posterolateral hernias, also known as Bochdalek-type CDH, characterized by a defect in the postero (dorsal in mice) lateral area of the diaphragm. In most cases (&gt;85%), this defect is located at the left side (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pober et al., 2010</a>). The classical hypothesis is that Bochdalek CDH is due to a failure of the fusion of pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs) with the septum transversum (ST). PPFs are lateral rims of tissue connecting caudally with the nephric ridges and anteriorly with the ST (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mayer et al., 2011</a>). Some authors describe that this fusion rather occurs with the posthepatic mesenchymal plate (PHMP), an accumulation of mesenchymal cells derived from the ST and located in the posterodorsal margin of the liver lobes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iritani et al., 1984</a>). Although all these tissues form an anatomical continuum, we will refer to the posterior, dorsolateral areas of the liver as PHMP, and PPFs to the tissue folds located in the dorsal part of the coelomic cavity, marking the limit between the peritoneal and the pleural cavities."

Animal models are therefore very valuable in order to investigate the cellular and molecular processes leading to CDH in humans. Recently, it has been described in mice that deletion of GATA4 in the PPFs mesenchyme using a <i>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup></i> driver leads to the development of amuscular, weak areas in the diaphragm and CDH (<a href=\"#bib28\">Merrell et al., 2015</a>). This paper assumes that Prrx1 is expressed in the mesenchyme of the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs) but not in the ST, and in fact, it suggests that the ST contributes minimally to the definitive diaphragm. However, this report does not distinguish between PPFs and PHMP and the phenotype does not display diaphragmatic discontinuities, neither does it show a prevalence on the left side, which are common features in human CDH."

We used a driver based on the G2 enhancer of the <i>Gata4</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rojas et al., 2005</a>). This enhancer drives expression of <i>Gata4</i> in the lateral plate mesoderm from the stage E7.5, and by the stage E9.5 is active in the septum transversum and proepicardium, ceasing its activity by E12.5 The activity of this enhancer is completely absent in the intermediate mesoderm. Our findings indicate that WT1 is involved in the generation of the mesenchyme of the ST/PHMP/PPFs continuum through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and they provide a novel perspective on the genesis of the Bochdalek hernia and the evolutionary origin of the diaphragm."

However, the nephric ridges and the mesonephros derived from them show no YFP+ cells in this model, indicating that the progenitors of these tissues derived from a different cell lineage. Thus, G2-<i>Gata4</i> lineage tracing allows to establishing a well-defined limit between two lateral mesodermal territories that we will call herein the G2<sup>+</sup> and the G2<sup>-</sup> domains (see <a href=\"#fig3\">figure 3B,C</a>). Interestingly, the gonad and the adrenal stroma were YFP+ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), and this can be related with the early expression of GATA4 in the coelomic epithelium, which will cover the genital but not the renal ridges (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Incidentally, the GATA4 positive cells from the central part of the ST do not express YFP in G2-<i>Gata4<sup>Cre</sup>;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></i>embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), an observation consistent with the lack of reporter activity in the G2- <i>Gata4<sup>LacZ</sup></i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Later, the liver partially detaches from this ST/PPF membrane, which becomes muscularized by migration of myoblasts from the somite. Thus, in the classical scenario CDH can arise either by a defect in the ST/PPF fusion process or by a failure of myoblasts migration. However, very few descriptions take into account that PPFs and ST are not anatomically independent structures. Along the dorsal body cavity of the mammalian embryo a pair of long crests are located at both sides of the dorsal mesentery. In the posterior part, these crests form the nephric ridges. In the anterior end of the peritoneal cavity they form the PPFs, which descend to a more lateral level and directly merge with the ST (where the liver is expanding) through the so called PHMP (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iritani, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hayashi et al., 2011</a>). This continuity between PHMP, PPFs and nephric ridges is beautifully shown by <a href=\"#bib27\">Mayer et al. (2011)</a> through scanning electron microscopy. The boundary between PPFs and PHMP is diffuse although the trajectory of the phrenic nerve has been proposed as a limit between these territories (<a href=\"#bib4\">Babiuk, 2003</a>). However, our study of the distribution of the YFP+ cells reveals a novel and well-defined boundary between the lateral plate (G2<sup>+</sup>) and the intermediate (G2<sup>\u2212</sup>) mesodermal domains. The lateral mesoderm domain would be characterized by the expression of <i>Gata4</i> driven by the enhancer G2 while the intermediate mesoderm domain would lack <i>Gata4</i> expression. The limit between G2<sup>+</sup> and G2<sup>\u2212</sup> domains is established as early as E10.5 in the coelomic epithelium lateral to the mesentery (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), between the genital and the nephric ridges. A second boundary appears between the PHMP and the central area of the posterior ST, which shows strong GATA4 expression not driven by the G2 enhancer. This heterogeneity between ST mesenchymal populations is relevant since the central mesenchyme of the ST will not be involved in diaphragm development, as demonstrated by <a href=\"#bib28\">Merrell et al. (2015)</a> and discussed below."

Asymmetry has already been described in the gut mesenchymal compartment, where cells are more densely packed on the left than on the right (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kurpios et al., 2008</a>). However, differences in the amount of mesenchymal cells in the PHMP or ST had not been reported, although <a href=\"#bib27\">Mayer et al. (2011)</a> pointed to a larger surface contact between PPFs and PHMP at the right side. We have shown that the right part of the PHMP shows more mesenchymal cells than the left part by the time in which the pleuroperitoneal septa develop, and we believe that this fact is relevant for the left predominance (&gt;85%) of the Bochdalek CDH."

A process of migration of liver mesenchymal cells into the PPFs relevant for the closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal had been suggested in human embryos (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayashi et al., 2011</a>). Since this closure should be dependent on the amount of cells, the smaller amount of mesenchyme observed in the left side would make it more difficult to complete the process. Thus, we think that left predominance of Bochdalek hernia can be connected with primary mechanisms of left-right visceral asymmetry, and particularly with an asymmetrical generation of mesenchyme."

The immediate consequence of its deletion in this territory is a lesser number of mesenchymal cells in the PHMP. Furthermore, WT1-null embryos completely lack of PHMP. WT1 is critically involved for EMT of the epicardium (<a href=\"#bib26\">Martinez-Estrada et al., 2010</a>). Thus, a hypothetical function of WT1 in the PHMP/PPF could be to promote EMT and generation of mesenchyme. The upregulation of E-cadherin concomitant with the lack of mesenchymal cells in the PHMP of the mutant embryos supports this suggestion. Furthermore, WT1 plays the same role in the liver mesothelium (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ijpenberg et al., 2007</a>), and a recent report on the conditional deletion of \u03b2-catenin in the WT1 lineage leading to CHD (<a href=\"#bib33\">Paris et al., 2015</a>) stresses again the relationship between WT1 and EMT. Significantly, the loss of function of \u03b2-catenin phenocopies the loss of function of WT1 when its deletion is induced between E10.5 and E11.5, the time window in which we suggest that WT1 is promoting EMT in the coelomic epithelium of the PHMP."

This is relevant since <i>Hoxb4</i> is a key gene to determine the nephric fate of the intermediate mesoderm. In fact, ectopic expression of <i>Hoxb4</i> in anterior non-kidney mesoderm, either by retinoic acid (RA) administration or plasmid-mediated overexpression, resulted in ectopic kidney gene expression (<a href=\"#bib35\">Preger-Ben Noon et al., 2009</a>). This is paradoxical, since nitrofen is reducing RA signaling, and <i>HoxB4</i> is induced by this morphogen.

Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a common birth defect, affecting 1 in 3000 children.

Carmona and colleagues have investigated the role of the Wilms tumor transcription factor in septum transversum mesenchyme and identified a role in diaphragm development, with implications for both ontogeny and evolution of the diaphragm. They now provide the first animal model that appears to mimic the most common form of CDH. The authors trace the origins of the CDH to a deficiency of the posthepatic mesenchyme plate (PHMP) that arises from the coelomic epithelium. Importantly the authors show for the first time that the right part of the PHMP has more mesenchyme cells than the left at the time of septa development and this may explain the asymmetry. It has been shown previously by the authors that WT1 transcriptionally activates Raldh2 in the developing liver mesothelial derived cells. Raldh2 is essential for synthesis of retinoic acid (RA). In another study it was shown that maternally introduced RA can partially rescue CDH in a chemically induced model. Interestingly this chemical model also mimicked Bochdalek-type CDH, showing left side predominance. Carmona et al. show here that Raldh2 levels are much reduced in the mutant PHMP mesenchyme."

Thus, we performed an analysis of E-cadherin expression in the left PHMP of four mutant and four control E11.5 embryos. E-cadherin is a good surrogate marker of EMT, since different factors (Snail, Twist, Zeb) can trigger EMT, but E-cadherin is always a target of them.

The results are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. We have shown a significant difference in the size of the left pleuroperitoneal discontinuity found in RA-treated and non RA-treated mutant embryos. This difference can be related with the lower prevalence of CDH in older embryos treated with RA. On the other hand, we have shown that the 5/8 proportion of normal diaphragm among the E15.5 embryos treated with RA in our first experiment is significantly different from the 4/23 proportion of normal diaphragms among all the non- treated mutant embryos (Z test=2,09, two tailed p-value= 0.037).

(2011). Since proliferation seems not to be a main role in the growth of the pleuroperitoneal septa, migration is the most probable explanation of this growth.

Alternatively, it is possible that the genesis of the CDH depends on a critical amount of cells in the PHMP, and small variations in this number of cells can lead to different outcomes. We also think that the levels of RA are critical, and this would explain the partial rescue of the phenotype just increasing the exposure of the embryos to this morphogen.
