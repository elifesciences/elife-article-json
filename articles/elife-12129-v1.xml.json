The lack of internal characters and soft-tissue preservation in many arthropod fossils, however, impedes comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and species descriptions according to taxonomic standards for Recent organisms. We found well-preserved three-dimensional anatomy in mineralized arthropods from Paleogene fissure fillings and demonstrate the value of these fossils by utilizing digitally reconstructed anatomical structure of a hister beetle. The new anatomical data facilitate a refinement of the species diagnosis and allowed us to reject a previous hypothesis of close phylogenetic relationship to an extant congeneric species. Our findings suggest that mineralized fossils, even those of macroscopically poor preservation, constitute a rich but yet largely unexploited source of anatomical data for fossil arthropods."

The lack of internal characters and soft-tissue preservation in many arthropod fossils, however, impedes comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and species descriptions according to taxonomic standards for Recent organisms. We found well-preserved three-dimensional anatomy in mineralized arthropods from Paleogene fissure fillings and demonstrate the value of these fossils by utilizing digitally reconstructed anatomical structure of a hister beetle. The new anatomical data facilitate a refinement of the species diagnosis and allowed us to reject a previous hypothesis of close phylogenetic relationship to an extant congeneric species. Our findings suggest that mineralized fossils, even those of macroscopically poor preservation, constitute a rich but yet largely unexploited source of anatomical data for fossil arthropods."

The most highly prized fossils are those that retain their original three-dimensional shape and provide details needed to identify what species it represents, and what its closest living relatives might be. However, even fossils with the most beautifully preserved external anatomy can lack the internal structures that also help to identify its evolutionary history. \u201cMineralized\u201d fossils are particularly useful for researchers as they form in a process that helps to preserve the internal anatomy of the organism. This type of fossil forms when mineral-laden water surrounds an organism\u2019s body so that the minerals are deposited in its cells and turn soft tissues to stone."

Inferring a comprehensive evolutionary history of a lineage requires consideration of a wide range of morphological features, and how they may have been shaped by selection, drift, and developmental constraints. While external characters predominate in ecomorphological and systematic studies, internal characters also play critical roles (<a href=\"#bib42\">Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011</a>). In fossil specimens, however, these characters are usually not preserved or difficult to access (<a href=\"#bib52\">Siveter et al., 2007</a>). While combined phylogenetic analyses of extant species frequently utilize internal anatomy, analyses including fossil taxa are generally limited to external characters. Moreover, it is often difficult to distinguish whether unobserved morphological characters were originally absent or lost due to taphonomic processes, potentially leading to misinterpretations of character evolution and erroneous phylogenetic placements (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sansom, 2015</a>)."

Amber inclusions are famous for exquisitely preserving three-dimensional external shape and sometimes internal characters (<a href=\"#bib42\">Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011</a>). Three-dimensional arthropods may also be preserved within concretions (e.g. in siderite nodules [<a href=\"#bib38\">Nitecki, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garwood et al., 2009</a>]), calcareous incrustations (e.g. in travertine [<a href=\"#bib48\">Rosendahl et al., 2013</a>]), encapsulations in minerals (e.g. in onyx-marble [<a href=\"#bib43\">Pierce, 1951</a>], chert [<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Trewin, 2003</a>], or gypsum crystals [<a href=\"#bib51\">Schl\u00fcter et al., 2003</a>]), and mineral replications (e.g. as calcite [<a href=\"#bib36\">McCobb et al., 1998</a>], silica [<a href=\"#bib37\">Miller and Lubkin, 2001</a>], goethite [<a href=\"#bib21\">Grimaldi, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barling et al., 2014</a>], pyrite [<a href=\"#bib20\">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</a>], or phosphate [<a href=\"#bib12\">Duncan and Briggs, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hellmund and Hellmund, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Waloszek, 2003</a>]). Some of these preservation types have revealed surprisingly detailed insights into the internal and soft tissue anatomy of several arthropods, for instance from several Paleozoic marine deposits (e.g. <a href=\"#bib52\">Siveter et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cong et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Edgecombe et al., 2015</a>).

While some fractions of the cuticle appear to be mineralized, the latter is mostly represented by air-filled spaces in the fossil (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D,G</a>). The surface of the exoskeleton is preserved as a three-dimensional imprint of remarkable detail; the body sclerites show characteristic punctuation of the genus. The right foreleg is not preserved; the left one is truncated from the trochanter; distal parts of the leg were lost prior to fossilization. The right mid and hind legs are eroded at the edge of the matrix, but their encrusted left counterparts appear complete except for the most distal part of the metafemur of the hind leg that would protrude from the matrix. Moreover, many anatomical characters can be recognized inside the fossil (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Apart from internal invaginations of the exoskeleton (e.g. tentorium, furcal arms and metendosternite), large parts of the alimentary canal and tracheal system are visible. The oesophagus appears to be shrunken and is connected to the crop, which is truncated posteriorly. The anterior part of the hindgut is hollow, while the middle part is apparently filled with mineral matrix but well-defined. Conspicuous spherical particles may constitute remnants of gut content (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The hindmost part of the gut can be roughly retraced by aggregations of tiny holes inside the mineral matrix. Like in the alimentary canal, some large tracheae appear to be filled with matrix, while others are hollow. Except for the musculature connecting the right pro- and mesofurcal arms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), most muscles can only be recognized by remnants at the insertion areas (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The genitals are extraordinary well-preserved (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). While testes and Ductus ejaculatorius could not be recognized, other soft tissues such as the spiral accessory glands and parts of the gland ducts are conspicuous. The genital sclerites, including aedeagus, median lobe, gonopore, tergites 8-10 and sternites 8 &amp; 9 are almost perfectly preserved as imprints."

An accurate three-dimensional conservation of soft tissues does not occur if the specimens are dried in air (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F,I</a>). Therefore, the fixation process must have occurred fast, possibly due to the animal being immediately penetrated and enclosed by phosphate rich water. In arthropods, this type of fossilization is only known from a handful of localities, which are better known for a rich vertebrate fauna (Riversleigh: <a href=\"#bib12\">Duncan and Briggs, 1996</a>; Ronheim: <a href=\"#bib25\">Hellmund and Hellmund, 1996</a>; Quercy: <a href=\"#bib22\">Handschin, 1944</a>). Replication of soft tissues by phosphatization may be accomplished over a period of weeks (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delcl\u00f2s et al., 2004</a>). Possible sources for high phosphorous concentrations in water circulating through the fissure fill are rocks or abundant phosphate-rich vertebrate bones, which may have been deposited along with them (<a href=\"#bib22\">Handschin, 1944;</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Hellmund and Hellmund, 1996</a>). After encrustation and internal mineralization, the cuticle largely decayed, leaving air-filled spaces. Erosion processes probably removed the outer stony matrix of most specimens, including fragile appendages and the imprint of the outer surface of the exoskeleton, leaving a mineralized endocast. Thus, the exterior of the fossils merely represents the inner surface of the exoskeleton \u2013 the deep grooves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) actually being inner folds or apophyses. While the smooth dorsal part of F1994 resembles the other fossils in appearance, its ventral surface covered by the mineral matrix shows a distinct surface sculpturing as present in extant species of the genus. In contrast, an artificial \u2018digital endocast\u2019 created from the tomographic data of F1994 (Material and methods) bears a striking resemblance to the other fossils (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), on which Handschin based his original description. Summing up, the Quercy hister beetles represent three-dimensional \u2018hybrid\u2019 fossils, comprising cuticle imprints and mineralized soft tissue, combining to preserve both exoskeletal fine structure and internal anatomical characters."

To date, fossilized insect internal character information has mainly been obtained from well-preserved amber inclusions (e.g. <a href=\"#bib44\">Pohl, et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011</a>). However, the origination of amber as tree resin causes a representational bias toward generally arboreal taxa (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delcl\u00f2s et al., 2004</a>). The fossil arthropods of Quercy represent an assemblage of taxa more typically associated with forest floor communities (<a href=\"#bib22\">Handschin, 1944</a>), as exemplified by <i>Onthophilus</i>, typically a predator in various decaying organic materials (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kovarik and Caterino, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bajerlein et al., 2011</a>). Such communities are less commonly preserved than those of many other environments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kidwell and Flessa, 1996</a>). Beyond anatomical data on these species, clearer interpretations of evolutionary relationships of these fossils will improve inferences about the evolution of these ecological communities. Thus, reexamination of the Quercy fossils, and likely also of similar mineralized fossils from other localities (which may represent different ecosystems and/or time periods), may provide a highly complementary source of information on the evolutionary history of arthropods."

Reevaluation of relationships with modern taxa in this extended morphological context will substantially improve estimates of rates and modes of arthropod evolution. This exceptionally detailed preservation may be aided by the presence of a surrounding stony matrix, hinting that encrusted specimens, which therefore were originally considered to be of poor quality, could contain particularly well-preserved external and internal characters. Our findings may trigger the reinvestigation of numerous similar fossils from various localities."

The measurements consisted of the acquisition of 2500 equiangularly spaced radiographic projections of the sample in a range of 180\u00b0. The frame rate was set to 150 images per second, resulting in an overall scan duration of 16.67 seconds per sample. The parallel polychromatic X-ray beam produced by a 1.5 T bending magnet was spectrally filtered by 0.2 mm aluminum to obtain a peak at about 15 keV. The sample was placed 20 cm upstream of the detector, which in turn was located about 33 m from the source. The detector consists of a thin, plan-parallel lutetium aluminum garnet single crystal scintillator doped with cerium (LuAG:Ce), optically coupled via a Nikon Nikkor 85/1.4 photo-lens to a pco.dimax camera with a pixel matrix of 2008x2008 pixels. The lens was stopped down to F/4 to remove optical aberrations and to increase its depth of focus, permitting the use of a thicker scintillator to collect a higher fraction of the incident X-ray photons. The magnification of the optical system was adjusted to 3X, yielding an effective X-ray pixel size of 3.66 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib11\">dos Santos Rolo et al., 2014</a>).

This would be revealed in a cladistic analysis as a sister group relationship between them.

The level of preservation is incredible for a non-amber fossil. The preservation of soft anatomy such as an insect's tracheal system makes the study just the kind of thing that should have a large impact in palaeontology. Further, there is actually more behind this manuscript than a technical/techniques paper, and in fact the phylogenetic finding that the Quercy fossil histerid species is most closely related to a North American species is interesting (should mention this in the Abstract). Surely, this biogeographic finding would not have been possible without such remarkable preservation. Regarding the mode of preservation, it is also quite likely that internal decomposition of the original insect was quickly halted because of the relatively antiseptic nature of the phosphate-saturated water that infiltrated the body."

I strongly recommend that the authors reword this statement to reflect our current understanding of the impact missing data can have on phylogenetic inference \u2013 and indeed put a relevant reference at the end.

The level of preservation is incredible for a non-amber fossil. The preservation of soft anatomy such as an insect's tracheal system makes the study just the kind of thing that should have a large impact in palaeontology. Further, there is actually more behind this manuscript than a technical/techniques paper, and in fact the phylogenetic finding that the Quercy fossil histerid species is most closely related to a North American species is interesting (should mention this in the Abstract). Surely, this biogeographic finding would not have been possible without such remarkable preservation. Regarding the mode of preservation, it is also quite likely that internal decomposition of the original insect was quickly halted because of the relatively antiseptic nature of the phosphate-saturated water that infiltrated the body.</i> "
