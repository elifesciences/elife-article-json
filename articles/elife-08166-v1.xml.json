In addition to tracking time, biological clocks must stay synchronized (or entrained) with the world around them. To achieve this, circadian clocks can be influenced or reset by environmental factors called \u2018zeitgebers\u2019 (from the German for \u2018time-giver\u2019). The daily cycle of light and dark is a dominant zeitgeber for most organisms, while periodic food availability represents another powerful zeitgeber. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Henrik Oster and colleagues\u2014including Dominic Landgraf and Anthony Tsang as joint first authors\u2014report how a hormone released from the gut after eating can help the body to track changes in mealtimes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Landgraf et al., 2015</a>)."

In mammals, it is well established that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (or SCN) contains the body's master clock. Located in the brain, just above the optic nerves, the SCN clock receives information about environmental light levels directly from the eyes, which keeps it in sync with the external world."

The expression of specific \u2018clock genes\u2019, such as <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i>, within neurons of the SCN is increased in response to light. This means that the SCN clock can be advanced or delayed to ensure it remains in time with the prevailing light\u2013dark cycle. However, it has also become clear that there are other circadian clocks in most of the cells and tissues in the body (<a href=\"#bib4\">Guilding and Piggins, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Mohawk et al., 2012</a>)."

These food-entrained rhythms are not affected by the light\u2013dark cycle, and they can persist in animals that have had their SCN destroyed. A set mealtime is now known to be a dominant zeitgeber for these peripheral tissue clocks (such as the clock in the liver), with the expression of the clock genes in these tissues become aligned to feeding time (<a href=\"#bib2\">Damiola et al., 2000</a>). In contrast, the SCN clock remains locked to the light\u2013dark cycle. It makes sense for tissue-specific clocks to be sensitive to food instead of light because the availability of food in nature may not always coincide with other environmental factors."

Oxyntomodulin is a peptide hormone that is released from the gut in response to food intake, and has been suggested to be a potential drug target to combat obesity in humans (<a href=\"#bib3\">Druce and Bloom, 2006</a>)."

This in vitro screen identified two molecules: oxyntomodulin and glucagon. In particular, treatment with oxyntomodulin could shift the liver clock by several hours, either forward or back, depending on the time it was administered. Both of these characteristics suggest that oxyntomodulin serves to set the liver clock to feeding rhythms in living organisms."

Somewhat unusually, this hormone can bind to two different types of receptor protein (namely GLP-1 receptors and glucagon receptors; <a href=\"#bib7\">Pocai, 2013</a>). Further experiments confirmed that oxyntomodulin's liver resetting activity depends on it stimulating glucagon receptors (and not GLP-1 receptors). This stimulation leads to a transient increase in the expression of the <i>Per1</i> clock gene in the liver cells, which involves a signalling cascade that is reminiscent of the light-induced responses of the SCN (<a href=\"#bib8\">Tischkau et al., 2003</a>)."

Treatment with oxyntomodulin also delayed and/or reduced the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. However, treating the mice with oxyntomodulin during the period when they were normally active had no effect on the liver. Thus, oxyntomodulin's effects on the liver clock only occur at times of the daily cycle when the mice do not typically eat. Furthermore, oxyntomodulin had no effect the SCN master clock."

When fasted animals were then given the opportunity to eat, oxyntomodulin levels in the blood increased within 20 minutes, and remained high for one hour. This signal was enough to alter clock gene activity in the liver. Landgraf, Tsang et al. then treated mice with antibodies that bind to oxyntomodulin. This treatment neutralized the hormone circulating in the body, and prevented its action, which weakened the resetting of the liver clock following food intake."

When food intake occurs at the expected times of day, the liver clock is relatively blind to this signal. However, when a meal occurs outside of a normal feeding time, the induced rise in oxyntomodulin serves to adjust the clock to a new feeding schedule. In this way, oxyntomodulin may function as an important signal that translates feeding time into the timing of an internal clock."
