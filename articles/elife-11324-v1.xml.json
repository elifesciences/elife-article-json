In this study, we demonstrate that microRNA (miR)-128 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs by repressing pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1). Specifically, overexpression of miR-128 reduced NPC proliferation but promoted NPC differentiation into neurons both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, the reduction of endogenous miR-128 elicited the opposite effects. Overexpression of miR-128 suppressed the translation of PCM1, and knockdown of endogenous PCM1 phenocopied the observed effects of miR-128 overexpression. Furthermore, concomitant overexpression of PCM1 and miR-128 in NPCs rescued the phenotype associated with miR-128 overexpression, enhancing neurogenesis but inhibiting proliferation, both in vitro and in utero. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which miR-128 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs in the developing neocortex."

In this study, we demonstrate that microRNA (miR)-128 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs by repressing pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1). Specifically, overexpression of miR-128 reduced NPC proliferation but promoted NPC differentiation into neurons both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, the reduction of endogenous miR-128 elicited the opposite effects. Overexpression of miR-128 suppressed the translation of PCM1, and knockdown of endogenous PCM1 phenocopied the observed effects of miR-128 overexpression. Furthermore, concomitant overexpression of PCM1 and miR-128 in NPCs rescued the phenotype associated with miR-128 overexpression, enhancing neurogenesis but inhibiting proliferation, both in vitro and in utero. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which miR-128 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs in the developing neocortex."

Conversely, removing miR-128 from the progenitor cells caused them to divide more and resulted in fewer neurons forming."

Given its importance in the development of the nervous system, neurogenesis is tightly regulated at many levels by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heng et al., 2010</a>), and its disruption has been associated with various pathologies, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), Treacher Collins syndrome, and various neural tube defects (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun and Hevner, 2014</a>). Therefore, uncovering the molecular mechanisms that underlie neurogenesis is crucial to understand the functions and plasticity of brain development and to prevent such pathologies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sun and Hevner, 2014</a>)."

Specifically, ectopic overexpression of miR-128 reduces the proliferation of NPCs but promotes the differentiation of NPCs into neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, knockdown of miR-128 enhances proliferation but inhibits neuronal differentiation. Knockdown of endogenous PCM1 mimics the cellular phenotype of miR-128-overexpressing NPCs. Furthermore, the concomitant overexpression of both PCM1 and miR-128 in NPCs rescues the cellular phenotype associated with the overexpression of miR-128 in NPCs, indicating that PCM1 lies downstream of miR-128 and regulates the proliferation and neural fate specification of NPCs in vitro\u00a0and in utero."

As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tan et al., 2013</a>), miR-128 was found to be predominantly expressed in the brains and spinal cords of E14.5 mice, and no signal was detected with a scrambled miRNA probe (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). As an alternative method, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and found spatial expression patterns of miR-128 that were similar to those observed using ISH (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Within the E14.5 forebrain, miR-128 was clearly detectable in the cortical layers, and high-magnification images of cortical slices at E14.5 revealed the expression of miR-128 in cells within the ventricular/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To further confirm this, we performed fluorescence ISH in combination with immunostaining using the NPC marker NESTIN in cortical slices at E14.5 and found that NPCs within the VZ/SVZ expressed miR-128 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, NPCs isolated from the E14.5 forebrain co-expressed miR-128 and NESTIN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), indicating the potential functional role of miR-128 in regulating the proliferation and/or differentiation of NPCs."

First, we analyzed the number of BPs that exited the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Yang et al., 2012</a>) upon miR-128 manipulation. Following in utero electroporation, dividing cells were labeled with EdU for 24\u2009hr and subsequently immunostained for Ki67. Compared to the control treatment, miR-128 overexpression increased the number of cells that were positive for both GFP and EdU but negative for Ki67 cells (by ~40%), indicating an increase the number of BPs that had exited the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P and Q</a>). Conversely, miR-128 knockdown had the opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3R and S</a>). To further examine whether the observed changes in cell cycle exit ultimately led to a difference in neurogenesis, we analyzed brains at E17.5, four days after electroporation, and assayed neuronal differentiation by immunostaining with a specific antibody against the neuronal marker NEUN (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). miR-128 overexpression significantly increased (by ~25%) the number of NEUN-positive neurons in the CP zone compared with the number in the control condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3T and U</a>). Moreover, miR-128 knockdown had the opposite effect on neurogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3V and W</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that miR-128 may act on two different stages of NPC development: first, by regulating symmetric/asymmetric division of APs, miR-128 promotes BP production; and second, by enhancing the exit of BPs from the cell cycle, miR-128 promotes overall neurogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, downregulation of miR-128 in early neuronal precursors impeded their developmental progression by causing them to be retained in a more primitive, proliferative stage, resulting in the expansion of a pool of the NPC pool. Intriguingly, this early expansion of NPC pools upon miR-128 knockdown did not result in a net increase in neuronal numbers at E17.5, suggesting that further investigation is necessary to delineate whether the observed phenomena is due to compromised neurogenic capability of NPCs or simply due to a delay in neurogenesis which could eventually be overcome at a later postnatal stage (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We observed that miR-128 overexpression significantly reduced PCM1 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Conversely, miR-128 knockdown using a specific inhibitor of miR-128 (anti-miR-128) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Smrt et al., 2010</a>), in comparison to using a scrambled anti-miR (anti-miR-control) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) in NPCs produced the opposite effect on the expression of PCM1 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that miR-128 targets PCM1 expression in NPCs, which in turn controls NPC proliferation and differentiation in vitro. In addition, qPCR analyses of tissue samples that were isolated from the VZ/SVZ, IZ, and CP using laser capture microdissection (LCM) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2009</a>) revealed an inverse relationship between miR-128 and PCM1 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G and H</a>). An inverse relationship between miR-128 and PCM1 mRNA levels was also evident temporally, given that the expression of miR-128 gradually increased starting from E12.5 through P0, whereas PCM1 protein expression was found to gradually decrease over this time period (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>), suggesting that miR-128 might regulate PCM1 levels to control NPC proliferation and differentiation in the developing cortex."

Consistent with these findings, allelic loss of chromosome 3p, where miRNA-128-2 is encoded, has also been associated with the most aggressive forms of neuroblastoma, indicating that miR-128 may play an important role in the cell cycle as well as growth and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adlakha and Saini, 2014</a>)."

Among them, <i>Foxo4,</i> which encodes for an insulin/IGF-1 responsive transcription factor that regulates cell cycles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Furukawa-Hibi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Schmidt et al., 2002</a>), was ruled out as a probable functional target of miR-128 based on a recent study that reported the loss of FOXO4 reduces the potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to differentiate into neural lineages (<a href=\"#bib38\">Vilchez et al., 2013</a>), which is opposite from miR-128 overexpression effects that we observed. <i>Nfia</i> (Nuclear Factor I/A) encodes for a protein that functions as a transcription and replication factor for adenovirus DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib29\">Qian et al., 1995</a>), while <i>Fbx120</i>, encodes for a F-box protein which is involved in synaptic plasticity of neuronal networks (<a href=\"#bib35\">Takagi et al., 2012</a>). As such, both genes were ruled out since their known biological functions were not relevant to the neurogenesis phenotype observed in miR-128 manipulation. Based on these rationales, we sought to focus on PCM1 as our primary gene of interest and investigate the functional relationship between PCM1 and miR-128 in early neurogenesis. Furthermore, based on our expression analysis, miR-128 expression is specific to neural stem cells and gradually increases during cortical development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In contrast, the expression level of its target protein PCM1 is higher during early developmental stages and lower during late developmental stages (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The inverse expression patterns of PCM1 and miR-128 indicate that miR-128 may function by turning off PCM1 expression, indicating that PCM1 may be the primary regulator by which miR-128 governs NPC proliferation and differentiation."

Importantly, we observed a dramatic change in the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs. The observed effects of miR-128 are consistent with a previous study by Ge et al. that demonstrated that the loss of PCM1 triggered NPCs to exit the cell cycle early and promoted the premature differentiation of NPCs to neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ge et al., 2010</a>). In this study, knockdown of PCM1 resulted in impaired interkinetic nuclear migration of NPCs, which leads to the overproduction of neurons and to premature depletion of the NPC pool in the developing neocortex. Consistent with this description, our results showed that miR-128 overexpression produced a phenotype similar to that previously reported for PCM1 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). More importantly, we found that this phenotype could be rescued by the co-expression of a miR-128-resistant PCM1 variant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). In contrast, knockdown of miR-128 resulted in increased levels of PCM1 in NPCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>) and showed the opposite phenotype of miR-128 overexpression in terms of NPC proliferation and differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Our results suggest that miR-128 regulates NPC proliferation and differentiation by fine-tuning endogenous PCM1 levels, which serve as a primary regulator that is required for proper neurogenesis to occur."

Other recent studies using miR-128-2 knockout mice indicate that miR-128 levels regulate the excitability of adult neurons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tan et al., 2013</a>). By selectively inactivating miR-128-2 in forebrain neurons using Camk2a-Cre and floxed miR-128-2, Tan et al. found that reduced miR-128 expression triggered the early onset of hyperactivity, seizures, and death (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tan et al., 2013</a>). Based on their bioinformatics network and pathway analyses of miR-128 target genes, those authors found that miR-128 may regulate the expression of numerous ion channels and transporters as well as genes that contribute to neurotransmitter-driven neuronal excitability and motor activity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tan et al., 2013</a>). Because NPCs are not excitable due to a lack of active sodium channels (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2008</a>), it is unlikely that the cellular effects of miR-128 observed here resulted from changes in the expression of ion channels or transporters. However, it will be interesting to follow neurons derived from NPCs with misregulated miR-128 to characterize how these neurons integrate into and function in cortical circuits. Moreover, it will be interesting to generate miR-128-1 and miR-128-2 double knockout mice and inducible miR-128-overexpressing transgenic mice to monitor the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs and their effects on behavior."

Approximately 2\u00a0\u03bcl of DNA and dye solution was delivered using a pressure injector (Picospritzer III; General Valve, Pine Brook, NJ). For electroporation, five electrical pulses (amplitude, 35 V; duration, 50 ms; intervals, 950 ms) were delivered with a BTX square-wave electroporation generator (Harvard Apparatus, Holiston, MA). The uterine horns were placed back into the abdominal cavity after electroporation, and the embryos were allowed to continue their normal development. Electroporated mouse brains were harvested at E14.5 and E17.5 for the proliferation and differentiation analyses, respectively."

The sections were blocked with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% normal goat serum (NGS), and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and were incubated with an AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (1:1000) in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. The NBT+CIP substrate was then added (#K2191020, BioChain Institute, Newark, CA). For simultaneous miR-128 ISH and immunostaining, the brain slices were incubated with primary antibodies (peroxidase-conjugated anti-DIG, 1:200 [Roche]; mouse anti-NESTIN, 1:1000 [Sigma]) in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20, 20% NGS and 0.1% BSA.

The present work analyses the function of miR-128 during cerebral cortex development, which is a microRNA misregulated in autism spectrum disorder. The findings suggest that miR-128 is expressed by cortical progenitors where it controls their proliferation and differentiation by repressing the expression of PCM1, a protein previously described as critical for cell-cycle regulation. Ectopic expression of miR-128 promotes cell cycle exit and neurogenesis in vitro as well as in the cortex in vivo. This phenotype is rescued by PCM1 gain of function and mimicked by its loss expression, suggesting that PCM1 is a downstream target of miR-128 critical for cortical neurogenesis. Thus miR128 may belong to the machinery that coordinate cell cycle exit with neuronal differentiation."

Indeed, conversely to its fast clearance from brain tissue in vivo, the BrdU remains pretty stable (for several hours) in the culture medium and it is necessary to replace it after a short time to properly assess a single cohort of cells undergoing S-phase. This is an issue when it comes to monitor cell cycle exit rate of such cohort (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2G</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">2J; 5C</a>). In these bioassays, the cell cycle rate exit is totally biased by the continuous labelling (during 24 hours or so) of proliferative cells undergoing S-phase (which is indeed different between conditions). Same comments stand when assessing S-phase in proliferation assays with 6hours of incubation in BrdU-containing medium."

It is not possible to conclude that default of mitotic spindle orientation leads to impaired APs division (symmetric vs asymmetric). This has been discussed in several recent publications. A clonal analysis would be required to follow the fate of the AP progenies after miR-128 modulation. One complementary set of experiments to decipher the functional impact of mitotic spindle orientation modification would be to focally electroporate APs (with miR-128 or miR-Zip-128) and identify the fate of the progenies 24 hours later (Tbr1 for neuron, Pax6 for APs and Tbr2 for IPs)."

We further strengthened this evidence by performing experiments suggested by the reviewers. For example: 1) We have included new qPCR data using tissue samples from laser capture microdissection of E14.5 mouse brain, showing the levels of miR-128 expression in distinct tissue regions; 2) We have included new data showing the effect of knocking down miR-128 using an anti-sense short hairpin targeted at miR-128 both in vitro NPC culture, and in vivo, following in utero electroporation; 3) We have included new data demonstrating spindle orientation changes following miR-128 overexpression and knockdown in vivo.

The present work analyses the function of miR-128 during cerebral cortex development, which is a microRNA misregulated in autism spectrum disorder. The findings suggest that miR-128 is expressed by cortical progenitors where it controls their proliferation and differentiation by repressing the expression of PCM1, a protein previously described as critical for cell-cycle regulation. Ectopic expression of miR-128 promotes cell cycle exit and neurogenesis in vitro as well as in the cortex in vivo. This phenotype is rescued by PCM1 gain of function and mimicked by its loss expression, suggesting that PCM1 is a downstream target of miR-128 critical for cortical neurogenesis.

According to their clarified BrdU experiment procedure. I noticed a misinterpretation of the data. Indeed, conversely to its fast clearance from brain tissue in vivo, the BrdU remains pretty stable (for several hours) in the culture medium and it is necessary to replace it after a short time to properly assess a single cohort of cells undergoing S-phase. This is an issue when it comes to monitor cell cycle exit rate of such cohort (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2G</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">2J; 5C</a>). In these bioassays, the cell cycle rate exit is totally biased by the continuous labelling (during 24 hours or so) of proliferative cells undergoing S-phase (which is indeed different between conditions). Same comments stand when assessing S-phase in proliferation assays with 6hours of incubation in BrdU-containing medium.</i> "
