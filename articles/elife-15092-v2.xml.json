However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain <i>Bdnf</i> gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on <i>Bdnf</i> gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the <i>Mus musculus Bdnf</i> gene. The metabolite \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of <i>Bdnf</i> promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective <i>Bdnf</i> promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal <i>Bdnf</i> expression were observed after direct ventricular application of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF."

However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain <i>Bdnf</i> gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on <i>Bdnf</i> gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the <i>Mus musculus Bdnf</i> gene. The metabolite \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of <i>Bdnf</i> promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective <i>Bdnf</i> promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal <i>Bdnf</i> expression were observed after direct ventricular application of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF."

BDNF has already been shown to enhance mental abilities at the same time as acting against anxiety and depression in mice, and might act in similar way in humans.

However, from an evolutionary perspective, these processes needed to be tightly intertwined to ensure the survival of animal species. Indeed, physical effort usually occurred in response to an imminent danger. Responding to that danger not only required running, but also necessitated better functioning of the brain through increased plasticity in order to adapt to new sources of stress, to learn to avoid dangers or better respond to them, and to map surroundings and learn the locations of hazards (<a href=\"#bib34\">Noakes and Spedding, 2012</a>) All of these responses require improved memory."

One mechanism to account for the changes in brain plasticity is through the action of growth factors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cotman et al 2007</a>). A major contributor to the processes of learning and memory formation involves brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathways. It has been known for over two decades that physical activity or neuronal activity markedly enhances <i>Bdnf</i> gene expression in the brain (<a href=\"#bib16\">Isackson et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Neeper et al., 1995</a>) and that this increase in BDNF protein leads to activation of signaling pathways that result in exercise-dependent enhanced learning and memory formation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vaynman et al., 2004</a>). Though these results are widely recognized, it is important to note that very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that link exercise and <i>Bdnf</i> expression. Regulation of <i>Bdnf</i> expression occurs by many means, but how exercise influences the expression of trophic factors is not understood. In this paper, we are interested in understanding how physical exercise induces <i>Bdnf</i> gene expression. This is a significant question, since cognitive ability and synaptic plasticity are influenced by the levels of BDNF (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Park and Poo, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vaynman et al., 2004</a>) and BDNF signaling is reduced in many neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases (<a href=\"#bib4\">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2009</a>)."

Moreover, exercise frequently leads to an increase in BDNF in the central nervous system to promote improvement in cognitive ability and depressive-like behavior (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marais et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Russo-Neustadt et al., 2000</a>). Indeed, physical activity has been shown to have anti-depressant effects and to improve outcomes in animal models and for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frazzitta et al., 2014</a>) or Alzheimer\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib11\">Smith et al., 2014</a>).

This hypothesis proposes that the FNDC5 protein is cleaved into a small circulating protein called irisin, which has been associated with the browning of fat (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bostrom et al., 2012</a>).

Because exercise induces metabolic changes and because epigenetics lies at the interfaces between the environment and changes in gene expression, it is conceivable that an endogenous molecule is produced after exercise, which can serve as a metabolite as well as a regulator of <i>Bdnf</i> transcription. In this paper, we provide a mechanism demonstrating that exercise induces the accumulation of a ketone body (D-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate or DBHB) in the hippocampus, where it serves both as an energy source and an inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) to specifically induce BDNF expression."

Mice were individually housed in cages and divided into two groups: control and exercise. Each mouse in the exercise group was provided with a running wheel, whereas the control group mice were not. Mice were not forced to run on the wheels, but rather were allowed to run voluntarily. Long term running for up to 30 days was monitored (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) for distance and time. We chose this exercise model because of its voluntary aspect. Stress has been reported to decrease BDNF levels (<a href=\"#bib31\">Murakami et al., 2005</a>). For that reason, we avoided any handling or stress induction in the mice. Animals were sacrificed and tissues were collected for analysis. To determine the effects of voluntary running in the hippocampus, we initially focused our study on selective promoters from the <i>Bdnf</i> gene, which has a complex structure containing multiple promoters that generate many transcripts with a common coding exon (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pruunsild et al., 2011</a>). Promoter I (pI), a neuronal activity dependent promoter (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tabuchi et al., 2002</a>) and other nearby promoters (pIIA, pIIB, pIV) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pruunsild et al., 2011</a>), were also assessed for mRNA expression. Our results showed that voluntary exercise for 4 weeks significantly induced BDNF promoter I and II expression in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and data not shown). Western blot analysis of the hippocampus of animals after voluntary running showed a significant increase of mature BDNF protein levels, as compared to control mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>)."

More specific HDAC inhibitors, such as CI-994 and MS-275, that target class I HDAC members were also capable of elevating <i>Bdnf</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), whereas a non-active analog of CI-994, BRD4097 (manuscript submitted), did not give a response. While these results implicate class I HDAC inhibition in the regulation of synaptic plasticity genes, such as <i>Bdnf</i>, it is not clear how exercise is translated into increases in BDNF. Interestingly, we found that exercise reduces <i>Hdac2</i> and <i>Hdac3</i> mRNA levels, but not <i>Hdac1</i> levels in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This is consistent with the observation that HDAC2, but not HDAC1, is more important in binding to promoters of activity-related genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guan et al., 2009</a>). These results suggest that exercise may modulate <i>Bdnf</i> gene expression in the hippocampus by inducing changes to the epigenetic landscape of its promoter. To test this possibility, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and showed that the binding of both HDAC2 and HDAC3 to the <i>Bdnf</i> promoter in hippocampi of exercise animals was decreased, in comparison to sedentary animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and data not shown). Even though some variation was detected in the basal binding of HDAC3 to the <i>Bdnf</i> pI promoter, the overall data is consistent with exercise inducing a significant decrease in HDAC3 binding to the <i>Bdnf</i> promoter. As a result, these results focused our search for endogenous metabolites that are produced in response to physical activity and that may also act as an epigenetic modulator."

For example, exercise is often associated with increases in ketone body production. The ketone body D-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) is a major energy metabolite that is increased in the liver after prolonged exercise. DBHB levels are frequently increased after caloric restriction, fasting and ketogenic diets and DBHB is believed to serve as a signaling molecule in response to metabolic changes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Newman and Verdin, 2014</a>). DBHB is synthesized from acetyl-CoA generated from the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. As DBHB production is sensitive to environmental factors, nutritional states and energy levels, it has been hypothesized that ketone bodies may serve as an intermediary to regulate gene expression and chromatin structure. Interestingly, DBHB is transported in the blood stream to the brain where it can serve as an energy source. In addition, DBHB also has been shown to act as a class I HDAC inhibitor in non-neuronal tissues (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shimazu et al., 2013</a>). To assess the effects of voluntary running, we measured DBHB levels in the hippocampus following exercise. We found that an increase in DBHB levels occurred in mice after exercise, compared to mice not subjected to voluntary running (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

To determine whether DBHB induction of <i>Bdnf</i> represents an HDAC-dependent mechanism, we tested whether DBHB treatment affected HDAC2 and HDAC3 occupancy at the <i>Bdnf</i> promoters. We find that treatment of primary neurons with DBHB led to decreased HDAC2 and HDAC3 binding to the <i>Bdnf</i> promoters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This was consistent with an increase in levels of acetylated histone H3 after DBHB treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Because DBHB is a potent inhibitor of HDAC3 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shimazu et al., 2013</a>) and HDAC2 has been previously shown to repress BDNF gene expression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guan et al., 2009</a>), we focused our attention on HDAC3.

In order to mimic the increases in DBHB in the brain observed after exercise, we injected mice with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a structural analog of glucose that inhibits glycolysis and increases the brain\u2019s capacity to utilize ketone bodies as fuel. 2-DG is transported by glucose transporters into the cell where it binds to, but cannot be phosphorylated by hexokinase, resulting in the inhibition of the first step of glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ralser et al., 2008</a>). This inhibition leads to the activation of a compensatory mechanism resulting in the production of ketone bodies by the liver. By activating this alternative energy pathway, 2-DG treatment induces DBHB levels in the brain. Interestingly, we found that 2-DG injection, like exercise, also induces both DBHB levels and <i>Bdnf</i> expression in the hippocampus to a similar extent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). Interestingly, co treatments of a DBHB transporter inhibitor (AR-C155858) with 2-DG attenuated the 2-DG-induced DBHB levels and <i>Bdnf</i> expression. Hence, these findings are consistent with a model in which exercise induces DBHB accumulation in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). DBHB stimulates histone acetylation at the <i>Bdnf</i> promoters through reduced HDAC2 and HDAC3 occupancy.

Consistent with these results, DBHB decreased paired pulse ratio in a K252a-dependent manner suggesting a pre-synaptic modulation mediated by TrKB signaling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). The actions of BDNF upon synaptic transmission are known to result in an increase in the frequency of synaptic currents, indicating a presynaptic role of BDNF (<a href=\"#bib35\">Park and Poo, 2013</a>). In fact, BDNF rapidly increases spontaneous neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jovanovic et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 1998b</a>), which require TrkB receptors localized at pre-synaptic sites (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 1998</a>). These measurements indicated that DBHB treatment enhanced glutamatergic transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) and that this DBHB-induced effect was blocked by K252a, a frequently used inhibitor of TrkB receptors in synaptic transmission experiments (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Takei et al., 1998</a>). K-252a at 200\u2009mM concentration specifically inhibits Trk receptors and not other tyrosine kinase receptors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berg et al., 1992</a>). Hence the presynaptic enhancement by DBHB is dependent upon the BDNF TrkB receptors. These findings are consistent with an increase of BDNF by DBHB in the hippocampus and furthermore indicate there are additional physiological outcomes mediated by DBHB that involve an increase in neurotransmitter release."

Previous work with DBHB showed it was an effective neuroprotective agent in Huntington\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lim et al., 2011</a>) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kashiwaya et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tieu et al., 2003</a>), affecting striatal and dopaminergic neurons, respectively. It is highly conceivable that DBHB might act to increase the levels of BDNF, which can rescue neurons that are vulnerable in Huntington\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disorders (<a href=\"#bib4\">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</a>). Indeed, treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease 3xTgAD mice with 2-DG to induce ketone bodies delayed the progression of bioenergetic deficits in the brain and the associated \u03b2-amyloid burden. Similar to our experiments, 2-DG was capable of inducing BDNF in 3xTgAD mice (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yao et al., 2011</a>). Brain is a major source of the secretion of BDNF after exercise (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rasmussen et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, changes in the levels of BNDF have been suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, addiction and eating disorders (<a href=\"#bib4\">Autry and Monteggia, 2012</a>). A number of studies have shown that exercise can also improve depressive-like behavior through increased levels of hippocampal BDNF, which can enhance plasticity and synaptogenesis and reduce neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aguiar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cotman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Duman and Monteggia, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Marais et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Martinowich et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Russo-Neustadt et al., 2000</a>). Given that histone acetylation in the hippocampus and cortex is associated with effects on learning and memory, the ketone body DBHB serves as a metabolic signal to link environment changes to epigenetic effects on the transcription of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF."

When glucose levels are reduced, ketone bodies, produced in the liver from fatty acids in the form of DBHB and acetoacetate, serve as an energy source.

For example, it has been reported that exercise induces <i>Bdnf</i> expression through the induction of hippocampal expression of Fndc5 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wrann et al., 2013</a>), a PGC-1\u03b1 and ERR\u03b1 -dependent myokine. Once BDNF protein levels increase, TrkB signaling in turn inhibits <i>Fndc5</i> expression in a negative feedback mechanism. We found prolonged exercise decreased <i>Fndc5</i> expression levels consistent with elevated BDNF protein in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wrann et al., 2013</a>). However, DBHB did not induce <i>Pgc-1\u03b1, Fndc5</i>, or <i>Erra</i> mRNA in primary neurons (data not shown), suggesting that there are alternative ways of affecting BDNF levels. The complexity of the BDNF gene and its alternative promoters and splicing events (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haberland et al., 2009</a>) indicates that several regulatory mechanisms must exist to explain its many functions in synaptic transmission and neuronal survival (<a href=\"#bib35\">Park and Poo, 2013</a>). Interestingly, exercise induces <i>Bdnf</i> expression in the hippocampus and not in all the other regions of the brain. How this specificity is achieved is not clear. One possible explanation suggests that exercise may regulate the levels or functions of ketone body transporters in different regions of the brain. Indeed, acute exercise induces <i>Mct2</i> transporter expression in the hippocampus immediately after and up to 10\u2009hr post-exercise. This exercise-induced upregulation of <i>Mct2</i> was associated with increases in BDNF and TrkB levels (<a href=\"#bib45\">Takimoto and Hamada, 2014</a>)."

There are multiple links between metabolic changes resulting from exercise and epigenetic modulation. For example, it has been reported that the blood levels of some Kreb\u2019s cycle intermediates such as \u03b1-ketoglutarate are increased after exercise (<a href=\"#bib21\">Leibowitz et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, \u03b1-ketoglutarate is an essential co-substrate for jumanji histone demethylases as well as for the tet proteins (DNA demethylases). Another molecule that may play a critical role in linking metabolic changes induced by exercise to epigenetic modulation is acetyl CoA which serves as the source of the acetyl group for all acetylation reactions catalyzed in the body including those catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases. Finally, coenzymes such as NAD+, or FAD produced during metabolic reactions are also required by sirtuins and the histone demethylase LSD1, respectively."

Further studies aiming at identifying molecules that can also serve the dual purpose of an energy fuel and epigenetic modulator will help us accumulate additional members of the \u201cexercise pill\u201d. The identification of these molecules is of great interest as many people afflicted with depression or with neurodegenerative diseases are likely to benefit from the ability of exercise to stimulate BDNF through small metabolites, such as DBHB. The involvement of ketone bodies in many other syndromes, such as glucose utilization, diabetes and epilepsy, suggests they represent vital molecules with broad metabolic effects upon chromatin and gene expression."

In particular, they demonstrate that \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) rise in their exercise paradigm and this leads to increased BDNF. They mimic this rise in vitro by treating hippocampal slices and report an increase in BDNF. Finally, they used ICV injections of BHB to demonstrate that this also could activate BDNF transcription. The proposed mechanism suggests an exercise-induced elevation in circulating levels of BHB inhibits the repressing effects of HDAC2 and 3 on the Bdnf promoter 1. Collectively, the studies are well described and provide interesting results. Indeed, the results will likely be of wide interest in the fields of neuroscience, exercise physiology and metabolic research."

DBHB levels increase when there is a switch from glucose to fatty acid metabolism. We have found that glycolytic inhibition by 2-DG induces both BDNF promoter \u03c0 expression and DBHB levels in the hippocampus, whereas injecting 2-DG along with AR-C155858 attenuated both DBHB levels and the induction of BDNF \u03c0 expression in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). These results suggest that increased DBHB levels in the hippocampus by physiologically manipulating glucose metabolism can contribute to BDNF promoter 1 induction by HDAC2/3 inhibition. This is important because exercise mediates its positive effects on learning and memory through BDNF expression (Erickson et al., 2011). Our results showing that DBHB accumulation in the hippocampus can affect BDNF expression suggest a role for DBHB in mediating the learning and memory effects through BDNF expression."

Hippocampal slices were prepared and incubated with DBHB for 3 hr before measurements of CA1 field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) after stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Pair pulse facilitation (PPF) due to an accumulation of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presynaptic terminal was observed and is indicative of enhanced transmitter release. This DBHB induced response could be blocked by treatment with K252a, a frequently used inhibitor of TrkB receptors in synaptic transmission experiments (Chen et al., 2015; Li et al., 1998; Takei et al., 1998). These findings are consistent with an increase of BDNF by DBHB in the hippocampus and furthermore indicate that one physiological outcome of DBHB is an increase in neurotransmitter release through a TrkB dependent mechanism."

                    "text": "The DBHB levels are expressed in mmole/gram. The grams in the denominator refer to the normalization to the total amount of hippocampal protein and not the grams of hippocampal tissue. We have clarified this point in the graph in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. From here, the concentration extrapolations are not accurate. The concentrations obtained, if we consider the volume used for DBHB measurement per the manufacturers\u2019 instructions, have an average of 0.9mM (Control) and 1.3mM (Exercise). Therefore, considering our measurements and the observation that exercise modulates HDAC binding to the BDNF promoter, we chose the concentrations for ICV to be close to the measured levels and also close to the concentrations reported to have effects on HDAC inhibition (Shimazu et al., 2013)."
