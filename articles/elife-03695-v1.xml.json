Although water permeates readily across vesicular walls, passive permeation of solutes is hindered. In this study, we show that, when subject to a hypotonic bath, giant vesicles consisting of phase separating lipid mixtures undergo osmotic relaxation exhibiting damped oscillations in phase behavior, which is synchronized with swell\u2013burst lytic cycles: in the swelled state, osmotic pressure and elevated membrane tension due to the influx of water promote domain formation. During bursting, solute leakage through transient pores relaxes the pressure and tension, replacing the domain texture by a uniform one. This isothermal phase transition\u2014resulting from a well-coordinated sequence of mechanochemical events\u2014suggests a complex emergent behavior allowing synthetic vesicles produced from simple components, namely, water, osmolytes, and lipids to sense and regulate their micro-environment."

Although water permeates readily across vesicular walls, passive permeation of solutes is hindered. In this study, we show that, when subject to a hypotonic bath, giant vesicles consisting of phase separating lipid mixtures undergo osmotic relaxation exhibiting damped oscillations in phase behavior, which is synchronized with swell\u2013burst lytic cycles: in the swelled state, osmotic pressure and elevated membrane tension due to the influx of water promote domain formation. During bursting, solute leakage through transient pores relaxes the pressure and tension, replacing the domain texture by a uniform one. This isothermal phase transition\u2014resulting from a well-coordinated sequence of mechanochemical events\u2014suggests a complex emergent behavior allowing synthetic vesicles produced from simple components, namely, water, osmolytes, and lipids to sense and regulate their micro-environment."

However, water often contains other molecules called solutes, and many of these cannot pass through the cell membrane.

This process, which is called osmosis, strives to equalize the solute concentrations inside and outside the cell."

Single celled microbes use a variety of strategies to counter the movement of water by osmosis: strong cell walls prevent the cell from swelling too much, and channel proteins in the membrane can be opened to allow solutes to pass through.

Although water permeates readily across the vesicular walls (10<sup>\u22122</sup>\u201310<sup>\u22123</sup> cm/s) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fettiplace and Haydon, 1980</a>), passive permeation of solutes is significantly lower across the intact membrane (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deamer and Bramhall, 1986</a>). As a result, osmotic differentials are readily established between the compartmentalized volume and the surrounding free bath. This in turn triggers a relaxation process, which acts to reduce the osmotic pressure difference across the closed semi-permeable membrane by influx (or efflux) of water depending on the sign of the pressure differential. Thus, for osmolyte-loaded vesicles in a hypotonic environment, water permeates and vesicle swells, until the internal Laplace pressure compensates the osmotic pressure, increasing its volume to surface area ratio (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ertel et al., 1993</a>). In this same vein, efflux of compartmentalized water from vesicles embedded in hypertonic media, conversely, decreases the volume to surface area ratio (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boroske et al., 1981</a>). Furthermore, because of their large area expansion moduli (10<sup>2</sup>\u201310<sup>3</sup> mN m<sup>\u22121</sup>) and low bending rigidities (10<sup>\u221219</sup> Nm), vesicular shells bend readily but tolerate only a limited area of expansion (\u223c5%) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Needham and Nunn, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hallett et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Seifert, 1997</a>). Consequently, GUVs experiencing solute concentration difference across their vesicular boundary adjust their volume, deforming in hypertonic media and swelling in hypotonic ones (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boroske et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ertel et al., 1993</a>)."

Beyond a threshold tension, rupture and pore formation become energetically favorable, lysing the GUVs at lateral tensions corresponding to \u223c30\u201340 mNm<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Needham and Nunn, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ertel et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mui et al., 1993</a>). The lytic process, however, is not catastrophic; rather it follows a step-wise sequence of events (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ertel et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Peterlin et al., 2012</a>). During each membrane rupture event, only a fraction of the intravesicular solute (and water) is released before the bilayer reseals leaving the vesicle hyperosmotic with a lower osmotic differential. This then prompts subsequent events of water influx, vesicle swelling, and rupture until sufficient intravesicular solute has been lost, and the membrane is able to withstand the residual sub-lytic osmotic pressure without collapsing (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wood, 1999</a>). Thus, GUVs in hypotonic media exhibit oscillations in their sizes\u2014characterized by alternating modulations of vesicular volume, tension, and solute efflux\u2014prompted by repeated cycles of swelling and bursting (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sandre et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Karatekin et al., 2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Popescu and Popescu, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Peterlin et al., 2012</a>)."

This oscillatory phase separation occurs isothermally, and it is driven by a sequence of elementary biophysical processes involving cyclical changes in osmotic pressure, membrane tension, and poration, which attend swell\u2013burst cycles (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koslov and Markin, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mui et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Popescu and Popescu, 2008</a>): in the swelled state, osmotic pressure and elevated membrane tension due to the influx of water promote the appearance of microscopic domains (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akimov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ayuyan and Cohen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hamada et al., 2011</a>). During the burst phase, solute leakage through short-lived membrane poration (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sandre et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brochard-Wyart et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Karatekin et al., 2003b</a>) relaxes the osmotic pressure and membrane tension, breaking up the domains producing an optically uniform membrane. This cyclical pattern does not persist indefinitely: a step-wise diminution of the osmotic pressure differential, because of the solute leakage during burst events, gradually dampens the oscillations ultimately equilibrating the GUV to the residual osmotic differential."

Depending on precise composition and temperature, these mixtures are known to form a uniform single phase or exhibit microscopic phase separation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Veatch and Keller, 2005</a>), including one characterized by two co-existing liquid phases: a dense phase enriched in SM and Ch designated as the L<sub>o</sub> (liquid-ordered) phase and a second, less dense L<sub>d</sub> (liquid-disordered) phase consisting primarily of POPC. To discriminate between the L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub> phases by fluorescence microscopy, we doped our GUVs with a small concentration (0.5 mol%) of a phase sensitive probe, N-lissamine rhodamine palmitoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine (Rho-DPPE) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baumgart et al., 2007</a>). For an equimolar lipid (1:1:1) composition, the phase diagram predicts the absence of large microscopic domain formation at optical length scales (<a href=\"#bib52\">Veatch and Keller, 2005</a>). Consistent with this prediction, our GUVs encapsulating 200 mM sucrose appear optically homogeneous at room temperature in an osmotically balanced, isotonic medium also containing 200 mM sucrose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>).

Moreover, at any given instance, some vesicles appear homogeneous whereas others are microscopically phase-separated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) producing a heterogeneous landscape. The time-dependent process of the appearance and disappearance of large microscopic domains repeats itself multiple times (n &gt; 10) over several tens of minutes\u2014ultimately producing a steady-state characterized by a fixed microstructure and a rounded boundary.

                                "text": "A closer examination of the results above reveals that (1) the domains coarsen through collision and coalescence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) and (2) the appearance of phase-separated state invariably coincides with the swollen, tense state of the GUV during the cyclical swell\u2013burst processes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Although both lateral tension and pressure difference influence membrane phase behavior in our osmotically driven case, it is instructive to consider how each of the two factors individually affects membrane phase behavior. A recent thermodynamic analysis and experiments examining the effects of mechanically generated tension reveal a lowering of miscibility phase transition temperature between the L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub> phases with increase in tension (<i>dT</i>/<i>d\u03c3,</i> \u223c\u22121 K [mNm<sup>\u22121</sup>] <sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Portet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Uline et al., 2012</a>). However, how this shift in transition temperature affects membrane phase behavior and domain morphology is not obvious: a recent experimental study suggests that even tension alone can stabilize complex domain morphologies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Santore, 2014</a>). The current and earlier observations in which osmotic differentials induce phase separation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hamada et al., 2011</a>) are clearly at variance with these predictions. An alternate explanation involves separate theoretical arguments, which require pre-existing phase separated domains in the optically homogeneous state. It suggests that the lateral tension elevates line tension between co-existing phases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akimov et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, although membrane tension disfavors nucleation of a new phase (by raising the energy barrier that must be met for the formation of critical nuclei), it can promote coalescence of small pre-existing nanoscale domains driven by minimization of line tension between L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub> phase. Additional experiments using ternary lipid mixtures (DOPC, DPPC, and Chol), which have been thought not to produce nanodomains at temperatures above 20\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hamada et al., 2011</a>), also produces oscillatory phase behavior (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). This then suggests that the osmotically generated tension alone might be insufficient to explain the observed osmotically induced isothermal phase transition, and that the non-ideality in mixing is likely a consequence of a combined effect of the pressure and tension. Indeed, a theoretical model by Givli and Bhattacharya (<a href=\"#bib20\">Givli et al., 2012</a>), explicitly introducing osmotic pressure contributions within the generalized Helfrich energy treatment, suggests that pressure can perturb isothermal phase diagram, driving domain formation primarily by affecting the interaction between geometry and composition."

A closer look at the temporal dynamics reveals that the process does not persist indefinitely. The period of oscillation between optically uniform and phase-separated states increases with the passage of time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). The cycle period\u2014defined as the time elapsed between two consecutive instances of homogeneous fluorescence\u2014increases three to 10-fold, before reaching a non-oscillating quiescent state, 60\u2013120 min after the imposition of the osmotic differential. This \u2018fatigue\u2019 in the oscillatory phase separation process suggests that the driving force (i.e., the osmotic differential and accompanying tension) must weaken with each cycle, which requires a separate mechanism for solute efflux."

This strikingly regular, temporal cascade of pores is fully reproduced in our case (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>): during the swell segment of each oscillation cycle, a single microscopic pore, several micrometers across, becomes visible under conditions of maximum swelling and largest domain size, typically for a period not exceeding 1.0 s (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). According to classical nucleation theory, the cost (<i>E</i>) of creating a pore in a tense membrane is determined by the competition between membrane tensional energy (\u2212<i>\u03c0r</i><sup><i>2</i></sup><i>\u03c3</i>) and the line tension energy (+2<i>\u03c0r\u03b3)</i> at the edge of the pore. Thus, under conditions of sufficient membrane tension (<i>dE</i>/<i>dr</i> &gt; 0), pores nucleate and grow, enabling solute efflux (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sandre et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Peterlin and Arrigler, 2008</a>). Although domain formation is not required for pore-formation, the probability of pore-nucleation might be enhanced by surface defects, such as are present at the boundary between co-existing phases, since the energy required to open a pore (&gt;40 <i>K</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i>) is considerably higher than the thermal activation energy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Karatekin et al., 2003b</a>). The long life spans (\u223c1 s) of the pores are likely supported by two opposing processes, namely osmotic influx of water and the leakage rate of solute through the pore (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koslov and Markin, 1984</a>). Subsequent healing of the pore is promoted by the reduction in the net membrane area and partial loss of the encapsulated solutes, both of which reduce membrane tension, <i>\u03c3</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Karatekin et al., 2003b</a>). Thus, during each membrane rupture event, only a fraction of the intravesicular solute is released before the bilayer reseals, leaving the vesicle hyperosmotic, albeit with a reduced osmotic differential. This then prompts subsequent cycles of water influx, vesicle swelling, and rupture until sufficient intravesicular solute is lost and the Laplace tension in the membrane is able to compensate for the residual osmotic pressure (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ertel et al., 1993</a>)."

While large microscopic domains of co-existing liquid phases are thought to not exist in many living cells, a recent study reveals such domain texture in yeast vacuole membranes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Toulmay and Prinz, 2013</a>). In this study, under conditions of nutrient deprivation, pH changes, and changes in the growth medium have been shown to segregate into microscopic domains in what appears to be a sterol-dependent manner, reminiscent of synthetic giant vesicles. Since one of the functions of yeast vacuoles is to regulate osmotic pressure, it seems tempting to consider whether vacuolar domains also undergo large-scale domain reorganization under osmotic stimuli and contribute to the physiological function. The formation (and dissolution) of compositionally differentiated membrane domains (e.g., lipid rafts) is often associated with alterations in the conformations (and activity) of many signaling proteins (<a href=\"#bib47\">Simons and Toomre, 2000</a>), which partition within them. It appears plausible that the domain reorganization stimulated by the osmotic activity of water might provide the cell a generic mechanism to respond to the physical perturbation, such as by activating mechanosensitive ion-channels and serving as sensors for signaling and stress transmission (<a href=\"#bib14\">DuFort et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stamenovic and Wang, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wood, 2011</a>). <i>Fourth</i>, although fatty acid based prebiotic amphiphiles exhibit different mechanical properties (e.g., elastic properties and permeability characteristics) compared to phospholipids, it appears likely that amphiphilic osmoregulation, such as we witness, might have given a thermodynamic advantage to early protein-free protocells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hanczyc et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Oglecka et al., 2012</a>) to survive (and even utilize) drastic environmental osmotic shifts."

As a result, upon immersion in hypotonic solution, osmotic influx of water first transforms the initial non-spherical shapes into spherical ones (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hamada et al., 2011</a>). The drop in the osmolyte concentration during this transformation effectively reduces the osmotic pressure difference, which the vesicle experiences, compared to the applied one. Note also that this reduction in osmotic pressure during the initial shape transformation is different for different vesicles within single populations. Thus, although quantifying actual membrane tension in our experiments is difficult, the observations of tense membranes and subsequent poration indicate that the osmotic perturbation is sufficient for most GUVs to surpass their maximum volume limit, developing appreciable membrane tension and pressure differences."

Samples were imaged in 8-well chambers fitted with coverslip bottoms (Nunc, Rochester, USA). The 8-well chamber was fitted inside a custom made housing attached to a heating/cooling system, which also was designed to regulate the temperature of the objective. This assured that temperature differences between the sample and the lens would be kept to a minimum, and thus potential convective water flow inside the sample avoided. The temperature was monitored using a thermostat that was submerged into the sample volume. Briefly, 5 \u00b5l of sugar-encapsulating GUVs were placed inside a well and gently diluted in 200 \u00b5l of deionized water (18 megaohm cm). The osmolyte-loaded GUVs subsequently settled to the bottom of the coverslip. Osmotic differentials were generated in all experiments by diluting the extra-vesicular bath with deionized water."

The GUVs show periodic oscillations, which includes a swelling phase, formation of Ld and Lo domains, and transient pore formation. With time, the characteristic time period of the oscillations increases until the GUV reaches a quasi-equilibrated state, having gradually relaxed the osmotic stress through transient pore formation. The quality of the study is high: the authors show many controls and the movies and figures nicely support their conclusions. Furthermore, the text is well written and the authors are very careful at citing and discussing all previous studies on the same topics, making the overall study very solid and fair."

In this context, I think this work can be highly influential to a broad community of scientists interested in lipid and cell membranes. ii) In a more philosophical sense, this is a beautiful example of a simple chemical system in which multiple order parameters become coupled to produce highly complex (and unexpected to the non-expert) behavior.

As stated originally, \u201cIf one were to make a graph of pressure versus time</i> it would be monotonically decreasing <i>as the vesicle equilibrates. This equilibration is more readily achieved by water influx, diluting the interior contents, so tension increases, until high tension drives membrane pore formation. Then, contents leak out, tension drops, and the pressure difference between interior and exterior</i> further drops<i>. Then the pores seal, but since the pressure is nonzero, equilibration continues, again via water influx, and the cycle continues...\u201d The pressure is not stationary at any time. Of course, during the (very brief) leakage period, the rate of pressure drop may be greater than it is during the times between ruptures, but (1) the authors don't make any quantitative argument that this is the case, and (2) even if it were, the qualitative schematic that shows flat pressure lines is quite misleading. Put more simply: the tension is increasing in each cycle \u2019because\u2019 water flows in, lowering the osmotic pressure. A positive slope for tension occurs together with a negative slope for pressure, and the schematic should show this</i>."

The osmotic influx of water prior to pore formation, which renders the membrane tense, also acts to reduce the osmotic pressure by diluting the osmolyte concentration. Solute efflux during the short-lived poration event provides a second, separate mechanism by which pressure drops. Thus during the entire osmotic equilibration process pressure drops monotonically. Although we have not quantitatively compared the pressure drop due to dilution and that occurs during solute efflux, we surmise, based on a phenomenological analyses following Idiart and Levin (<a href=\"#bib26\">Idiart and Levin 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">Levin and Idiart 2004</a>), that pressure drop is more drastic during solute efflux."
