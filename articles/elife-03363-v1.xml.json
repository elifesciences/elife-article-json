Understanding how stem cells switch between these states is highly relevant for stem cell-based therapeutics. <i>Drosophila</i> neural progenitors (neuroblasts) have been an excellent model for studying self-renewal and differentiation, but quiescence remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus, followed by the establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking most progenitor and differentiation markers. The pulse of low level nuclear Prospero precedes entry into neuroblast quiescence even when the timing of quiescence is advanced or delayed by changing temporal identity factors. Furthermore, loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. We propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation."

During neuroblast asymmetric division, the scaffolding protein Miranda (Mira) is partitioned into the differentiating daughter cell, called a ganglion mother cell (GMC), and it carries at least three cargo proteins: the translational repressors Staufen and Brain tumor (Brat) and the transcriptional repressor Prospero (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hirata et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Broadus and Doe, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ikeshima-Kataoka et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Broadus et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schuldt et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bello et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Betschinger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). In the GMC, Mira appears to be degraded and its cargo is released into the cytoplasm (Staufen, Brat) or the nucleus (Prospero). Prospero is an atypical homeodomain protein that directly binds and represses progenitor and cell cycle genes to initiate GMC and neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li and Vaessin, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Choksi et al., 2006</a>); the mammalian ortholog Prox1 has a similar role in repressing cell cycle gene expression (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dyer, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Foskolou et al., 2013</a>).

We propose a model in which low levels of Prospero repress all cell cycle and progenitor genes except <i>deadpan</i>, whereas high levels of Prospero additionally repress <i>deadpan</i> to allow neural differentiation."

We hypothesized that loss of a progenitor marker or gain of a differentiation marker might induce neuroblast quiescence. As a model system we used the identified neuroblast 3\u20133 in the thoracic segments (NB3-3T) which reliably enters quiescence at embryonic stage 15 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tsuji et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, neuroblast 3\u20133 in abdominal segments (NB3-3A) remains proliferative until the end of embryogenesis and provides an excellent internal control (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tsuji et al., 2008</a>). Previous work showed that the quiescent NB3-3T can be recognized by Deadpan, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chell and Brand, 2010</a>). The coiled-coil Miranda protein is also reported to mark quiescent neuroblasts (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tsuji et al., 2008</a>), which we confirm here (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), but note that <i>mira</i> transcription is down-regulated in quiescent neuroblasts based lack of mRNA in the stage 17 CNS in the BDGP in situ database (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tomancak et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, we find that all other tested progenitor markers\u2014Worniu, Asense, and Cyclin E (CycE) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brand et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Caldwell and Datta, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ashraf et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lai et al., 2012</a>)\u2014are not expressed in the quiescent NB3-3T (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; data not shown), although they can be robustly detected in the proliferative NB3-3A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Similarly, larval quiescent neuroblasts lack expression of Worniu, Asense, CycE (and Miranda), while retaining Deadpan protein and active <i>deadpan</i> transcription (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, misexpression of Worniu (data not shown), Asense, or CycE (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) has no effect on the timing of NB3-3T quiescence."

In theory, this can be done by quantifying the number of EdU+ neuroblasts in <i>prospero</i> null mutant embryos. The problem is that <i>prospero</i> mutants show de-differentiation of GMCs into proliferating neuroblasts (<a href=\"#bib17\">Choksi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2006</a>), making it necessary to distinguish the parental neuroblasts from the de-differentiated GMCs. To resolve the issue, we used the Notch signaling reporter, m\u03b3-LacZ (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wech et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cooper et al., 2000</a>), to identify the parental neuroblasts. During neuroblast asymmetric cell division, Miranda-Prospero and Partner of numb (Pon)-Numb protein complexes are independently segregated into the GMC to promote differentiation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Doe, 2008</a>). In <i>prospero</i> mutants, Numb is still properly segregated to GMCs where it represses Notch activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Spana and Doe, 1995</a>) and consequently the Notch reporter m\u03b3-LacZ is restricted to parental neuroblasts. <i>m\u03b3-LacZ</i> is transcribed only in neuroblasts; in wild type the protein perdures into neuroblast progeny, whereas in <i>prospero</i> mutants the protein is restricted to neuroblasts because the progeny proliferate without expressing m\u03b3-LacZ and thus dilute out the protein (<a href=\"#bib17\">Choksi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Thus, we scored for EdU incorporation in the m\u03b3-LacZ+ parental neuroblasts. Whereas in wild type nearly all neuroblasts ceased EdU incorporation by stage 16 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), many m\u03b3-LacZ+ neuroblasts continued to incorporate EdU in <i>prospero</i> mutants at the same stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This strongly supports a model in which Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence. In addition, Prospero is unique among basal cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence: loss of function mutations in <i>numb</i> or <i>brat</i>, or the Prospero target gene <i>string</i>, showed no effect on the timing of neuroblast quiescence (data not shown)."

We used the TARGET method (<a href=\"#bib36\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>) to transiently induce Prospero expression for 2 hr, and then assayed for neuroblast quiescence 12 hr later (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Because high levels of Prospero can induce neuroblast differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Choksi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bayraktar et al., 2010</a>), we used Prospero levels low enough to minimize neuroblast differentiation, as shown by the persistence of most Deadpan+ neuroblasts after misexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We identified quiescent neuroblasts by their failure to incorporate EdU, lack of progenitor marker Worniu, and lack of the differentiation marker Elav\u2014together a robust signature for quiescent neuroblasts (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In wild-type larval brains, we found few or no quiescent neuroblasts, as expected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). In contrast, a pulse of Prospero resulted in the appearance of numerous quiescent neuroblasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>; 12 hr timepoint). To rule out the possibility that these \u2018quiescent neuroblasts\u2019 were early in the differentiation pathway, we reasoned that if they were quiescent they could reactivate proliferation in a nourishing environment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chell and Brand, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010</a>) whereas if they were differentiating they would never re-enter the cell cycle. Thus, we exposed larval neuroblasts to the same 2 hr pulse of Prospero, but waited 24 hr to assay neuroblasts. We found that nearly all of the neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hr after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>; 24 hr timepoint). In addition, precocious low level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of NB3-3T quiescence (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We conclude that transient, low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence. Interestingly, Prospero can also transiently arrest the cell cycle without inducing differentiation in embryonic longitudinal glial progenitors (<a href=\"#bib26a\">Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004</a>), although the relative levels of Prospero have not been explored in this system."

High levels of the vertebrate ortholog Prox1 can also trigger differentiation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dyer, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Takahashi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Foskolou et al., 2013</a>); thus it is interesting that low levels of nuclear Prospero promote neuroblast quiescence without triggering differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Prox1 activates some target genes at high levels but represses some target genes at low levels (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2008b</a>). We suggest a speculative model for Prospero function: low levels of Prospero are sufficient to repress most progenitor-specific genes in neuroblasts (<i>worniu</i>, <i>asense</i>, <i>miranda</i>, and <i>cycE</i>) but do not repress the expression of <i>deadpan</i> (perhaps due to lack of high affinity Prospero binding sites). In contrast, high levels of Prospero are sufficient to repress <i>deadpan</i> (perhaps via low affinity binding sites) and may even activate neuronal differentiation genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>)."

The protein Caliban is known to promote Prospero nuclear export in S2 cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bi et al., 2005</a>), but it is unknown whether Caliban has a similar role in neuroblasts or if down-regulation of Caliban levels or activity leads to increased nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts entering quiescence."

They find that the NB3-3T lineage displays a brief pulse of weak Pros nuclear expression just prior to entering quiescence. Mutant and mis-expression analysis lends support for the notion that this brief pulse in fact induces quiescence. They also address this notion in the postembryonic neuroblasts, and find support for a similar role for Pros in quiescence. Since we know very little about the fascinating, and even potentially medically important phenomena of stem cell quiescence, this study is of importance, and would likely be interesting for a broader audience.
