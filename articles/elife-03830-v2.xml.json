Here we detail a new paradigm in which a single compound directed against a \u2018dominant drug target\u2019 suppresses the emergence of naturally occurring drug-resistant variants in mice and cultured cells. All new drug-resistant viruses arise during intracellular replication and initially express their phenotypes in the presence of drug-susceptible genomes. For the targets of most anti-viral compounds, the presence of these drug-susceptible viral genomes does not prevent the selection of drug resistance. Here we show that, for an inhibitor of the function of oligomeric capsid proteins of poliovirus, the expression of drug-susceptible genomes causes chimeric oligomers to form, thus rendering the drug-susceptible genomes dominant. The use of dominant drug targets should suppress drug resistance whenever multiple genomes arise in the same cell and express products in a common milieu."

Here we detail a new paradigm in which a single compound directed against a \u2018dominant drug target\u2019 suppresses the emergence of naturally occurring drug-resistant variants in mice and cultured cells. All new drug-resistant viruses arise during intracellular replication and initially express their phenotypes in the presence of drug-susceptible genomes. For the targets of most anti-viral compounds, the presence of these drug-susceptible viral genomes does not prevent the selection of drug resistance. Here we show that, for an inhibitor of the function of oligomeric capsid proteins of poliovirus, the expression of drug-susceptible genomes causes chimeric oligomers to form, thus rendering the drug-susceptible genomes dominant. The use of dominant drug targets should suppress drug resistance whenever multiple genomes arise in the same cell and express products in a common milieu."

The most intuitive scenario for such dominance involves highly oligomeric assemblages such as viral capsids, because drug-resistant subunits will assemble with drug-susceptible ones, and the chimeric structure is likely to be inhibited by the drug (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom). This situation is akin to a dominant\u2013negative interaction and examples of such dominance by vector-mediated expression of mutant proteins are abundant. Expression of a non-functional version of the oligomeric Tat protein of HIV drastically reduces viral yield (<a href=\"#bib20\">Meredith et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, co-expression of non-functional NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus inhibits replication of genomes that encode functional NS5A (<a href=\"#bib8\">Graziani and Paonessa, 2004</a>). In poliovirus, viral genomes with mutations in several proteins, including capsid proteins and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, interfere with the amplification of co-transfected wild-type viral genomes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005</a>)."

Instead, the intracellular diversity arises from the error-prone replication of the viruses themselves, even if the infection in any individual cell is initiated by a single viral genome. Here, we show that V-073, an inhibitor of viral capsid function that is currently in development for use in the poliovirus eradication campaign (<a href=\"#bib1\">Buontempo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Collett et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Oberste et al., 2009</a>), fulfills the expectations of dominant drug targeting, dramatically suppressing the growth of drug resistant viruses in murine infections and in cell culture via the formation of mixed assemblages."

For poliovirus, one such target is 2C protein, a membrane-associated NTPase that is required for viral genome replication. The NTPase activity of protein 2C is inhibited by low concentrations of guanidine in cell culture and in solution (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pfister and Wimmer, 1999</a>). We investigated the effectiveness of guanidine in inhibiting viral growth in mice and whether treatment with guanidine caused the selection of compound-resistant viruses in a mouse model of poliovirus infection (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ren and Racaniello, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Crotty et al., 2002</a>). Transgenic mice that express the human poliovirus receptor (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mendelsohn et al., 1989</a>) under the control of the murine actin promoter (<a href=\"#bib3\">Crotty et al., 2002</a>) were bred to be homozygously deleted for TNF receptor 1 in order to delay poliomyelitis in infected mice (See results below). Subcutaneous delivery of guanidine began immediately after infection and muscle tissue was harvested at 4 or 5 days post infection. Virus stocks were made from tissue and titered. Guanidine treatment caused significant reductions in total viral yield in <i>Tnfr1</i><sup>+/+</sup> <i>PVR</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> mice after 4 days of viral infection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and in <i>Tnfr1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> <i>PVR</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> mice after 5 days of infection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These viral stocks were then titered in the presence of guanidine. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the viral population, even samples from untreated mice contain a measureable background frequency of guanidine-resistant variants. These variants naturally occur at a frequency of approximately two in one thousand. The frequency of guanidine resistance in each experimental sample is presented as the fold change from this average value. Large and significant increases in the frequency of guanidine resistance were observed in all treated mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). Therefore, newly arising guanidine-resistant virus could be readily selected during guanidine treatment in mice infected with poliovirus. This selection for drug resistance mimics the treatment-dependent emergence of drug resistance observed in patients infected with rapidly evolving viruses. Targeting the active sites of monomeric enzymes is likely to select for drug resistance."

To test the fitness of guanidine- and V-073-resistant viruses directly, we isolated such variants from the infected muscle tissue of mice inoculated with wild-type virus. The presence of drug-resistant viruses in the absence of any selective pressure results from the natural variation in the viral pools. Both guanidine- and V-073-resistant variants naturally occurred at a frequency of approximately one in ten thousand in samples from untreated mice. Pooled variants of both types were selected and amplified in cell culture. Drug-resistant variants grown in cell culture were propagated at low infectious doses, so that each cell was infected with no more than one virus. When these stocks were used to infect mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), the guanidine-resistant viruses were viable but displayed significantly reduced fitness compared to wild-type virus. On the other hand, only a slight and statistically insignificant difference in fitness between wild-type virus and the V-073-resistant virus stock was observed. Thus, guanidine-resistant viruses emerged readily under selection pressure even though their fitness is low. V-073-resistant variants did not emerge in spite of showing very little growth defect. Therefore, we conclude that fitness costs do not account for the lack of outgrowth of V-073-resistant virus. Furthermore, the fact that guanidine-resistant variants are readily selected during treatment despite their fitness cost suggest that, at least in this example, relying on high fitness cost to prevent the emergence of resistance is insufficient; additional factors must be at play to prevent the emergence of resistance from a single drug regimen."

On the other hand, when the few mice that developed paralysis during V-073-treatment were analyzed, no selection for V-073-resistant virus was seen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We conclude that, during viral growth under either extended periods of selection or conditions that led to disease, viruses resistant to guanidine were readily selected in mice while viruses resistant to V-073 were not. These data argue that treatment-dependent emergence of resistance is not an inevitable outcome of antiviral monotherapy. In this example, an increase in resistance was never observed despite the fact that drug-resistant variants with relatively high fitness arose throughout the course of infection. We propose that the poliovirus capsid constitutes the first confirmed case of a dominant drug target."

If drug-susceptible variants dominantly interfere with the growth of drug-resistant variants, the yield of the resistant variant should decrease when co-infected with drug-susceptible virus. For guanidine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), a known variant, 2C-N179G (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pincus and Wimmer, 1986</a>), was reconstructed and shown to confer complete resistance to 0.5 mM guanidine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To mimic the mix of genomes in which a new drug-resistant variant would first arise, HeLa cells were co-infected with 2C-N179G virus and increasing amounts of wild-type, drug-susceptible virus in the presence of guanidine. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the drug-resistant 2C-N179G variant was maintained at 10 plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell while that of the drug-susceptible virus ranged from 0 to 100 PFU/cell. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, the yield of guanidine-resistant virus in the presence of the drug was the same whether susceptible viruses were present or not. Even when the guanidine-resistant variant was outnumbered 100:1, its growth was unimpeded by the presence of wild-type, drug-susceptible virus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Therefore, targeting the viral NTPase with guanidine allows the growth of drug-resistant genomes even in the presence of an excess of drug-susceptible ones. This is consistent with the results in mice, in which guanidine-resistant variants were readily selected."

Although no rupintrivir-resistant viruses have been reported previously, we could select such a variant during multiple viral passages in the presence of the drug. The phenotype of the rupintrivir-resistant variant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a>) was caused by a single amino acid change, G128Q, in the 3C coding region.

To test explicitly whether capsid proteins encoded by V-073-susceptible and V-073-resistant genomes assemble into mixed capsid structures during co-infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which could be distinguished from separate, homogeneous structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), we constructed viruses whose capsid proteins could be independently identified by antibodies. To this end, a FLAG epitope was engineered into the VP3-A24V virus and an HA epitope was engineered into wild-type, drug-susceptible virus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Following a strategy employed in foot and mouth disease virus (<a href=\"#bib30\">Seago et al., 2012</a>), the tags were inserted into a flexible, antibody-accessible loop in the assembled capsid structure. These constructs enabled immunoprecipitation of intact, viable virions that could be assessed for their drug susceptibility by soaking the virus in the capsid inhibitor before titering. In single-cycle infections, the FLAG-tagged virus retained its V-073-resistant phenotype, and the HA-tagged virus its drug susceptibility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation of lysates obtained from these single infections retrieved, as expected, FLAG-tagged drug-resistant but not HA-tagged drug-susceptible virus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) or proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). When the two lysates were pooled, only FLAG-tagged, V-073-resistant virus was recovered (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>, lane 3), demonstrating that the immunoprecipitation was specific for capsids harboring proteins from the V-073-resistant genome. When the drug-resistant, FLAG-tagged virus and the drug-susceptible HA-tagged virus were co-infected into cells and the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed, the immunoprecipitated virions displayed reduced infectivity when soaked in the capsid inhibitor prior to titering (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Furthermore, the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate contained both FLAG- and HA-tagged VP1 proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, lane 4). Therefore, chimeric virions with reduced drug-resistance were formed in cells co-infected with V-073 susceptible and V-073-resistant viruses, even at the 1:1 ratio tested here. The formation of mixed capsids with reduced drug resistance is the most plausible explanation for the observed genetic dominance of V-073-susceptible variants and the blunted selection for drug-resistance during growth in mice."

Thus, it can be selected in the presence of drug, regardless of the drug target type. However, at high MOI, drug-resistant variants will occupy cells in concert with drug-susceptible variants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, middle). In cases of dominant drug targets, drug-susceptible viruses are genetically dominant and the inhibitor will prevent the outgrowth of drug-resistant variants. Consistent with this logic, when HeLa cells were infected at an MOI of 1 infectious virus per cell in the presence of either guanidine or V-073, the yields of guanidine-resistant and V-073-resistant viruses were similar (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). At higher MOIs, the yield of guanidine-resistant progeny increased, as would be expected because more virus was present in the inoculum and nothing interfered with the outgrowth of the drug-resistant variants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, green). However, the yield of V-073-resistant progeny decreased at high MOIs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, orange). To test whether the inhibition in growth of V-073-resistant virus was an intracellular event, as predicted if the formation of mixed capsids suppressed the drug-resistant phenotype, the virus stock was soaked in V-073 before the infections at different MOIs were performed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right panel). When entry of the drug-susceptible viruses was thus inhibited, a dose-dependent increase in the yield of V-073-resistant virus was observed even at high MOIs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, dotted orange). The virus stock used was deliberately prepared from cells infected at low MOI to ensure that drug-resistant genomes were packaged in drug-resistant capsids. Thus, failure to select V-073-resistant genomes at high MOIs could be overcome by preventing the entry of the drug-susceptible genomes."

Deliberate mixed infections performed in cell culture showed that the formation of chimeric capsids, which contained both drug-inhibitable and drug-resistant proteins, correlated with the suppression of drug resistance.

There are two potential sources of V-073-resistant viruses in infected mice. The first is the quaisispecies present in any inoculum. At an initial infectious dose of 10<sup>7</sup> viruses per mouse, there should have been as many as 10<sup>4</sup> pre-existing drug-resistant variants in the inoculum (<a href=\"#bib9\">Holland et al., 1989</a>). Why were they unable to emerge from the infection? Given the effectiveness of the innate immune response, there is often a minimum effective dose of inoculated microorganism. For poliovirus in this mouse model, more than 10<sup>4</sup> viruses are required to achieve any detectable viral growth in muscle tissue (data not shown). This threshold predicts correspondingly fewer pre-existing drug-resistant variants in the effective inoculum. The second source of V-073-resistant viruses is the quasispecies addressed in the present study and depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>: the newly arising variants formed within each individual cell by error-prone replication. Therefore, we conclude that V-073 was effective at suppressing resistance even as a monotherapy because V-073-susceptible variants suppress the growth of V-073-resistant variants as they arise intracellularly throughout the course of infection."

Such rapid treatment is unlikely to occur in patients, except in cases where drugs are delivered prophylactically. However, a delay in treatment will not alter the degree to which dominant drug target inhibitors suppress the selection of newly arising resistant viral genomes from drug-susceptible parents. Late treatment may be directed at a population that contains 0.2% drug-resistant genomes, but many of these will have been trans-encapsidated by the other viral variants present in their cells of origin. Thus, for a capsid inhibitor, trans-encapsidation of newly arising drug-resistant genomes by the intracellular excess of drug-susceptible capsids should provide an additional mechanism to reduce the reservoir of drug-resistant genomes packaged in drug-resistant capsids."

Other candidates also emerged, however, whose mechanisms are less straightforward and remain under investigation: intramolecularly cleaving protease 2A and an RNA structure required for protein priming were also identified as potential dominant drug targets (<a href=\"#bib4\">Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005</a>).

Small-molecule screens are often designed to detect loss of viral product function, rather than the deranged function required for the drug-bound, susceptible viral product to join and poison drug-resistant complexes. V-073, for example, hyper-stabilizes viral capsids. Thus, the drug-inhibited subunits can still insinuate themselves into capsid complexes. A theoretical capsid inhibitor that prevented assembly by binding at an intersubunit interface should display the characteristics of a non-dominant drug target inhibitor, because the drug-susceptible subunits would not have the opportunity to poison the drug-resistant subunits."

Again using the poliovirus capsid as an example, we can calculate the approximate number of susceptible subunits required to render the entire virion drug-susceptible. Assuming free mixing of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant capsids and relative abundances that reflect the ratio of their genomes, the data argue that about twenty subunits, or one third, of the capsid proteins must be drug-susceptible to poison the complex. For the abundance of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant proteins to mirror the representation of the RNA that encodes them, both genomes must both continue to amplify or must both be inhibited. This suggests another reason that inhibitors of structural proteins, which are predicted to be dominant drug targets, are often overlooked. V-073, for example, would not have been detected as a viable inhibitor in a screen that used a decrease in genome amplification, protein abundance or innate immune response activation during a single cycle of infection as a proxy for viral inhibition. Similarly, replicons, which cannot perform second rounds of infection, are useful tools for some kinds of screens but not for seeking inhibitors of many dominant drug targets."

Thus, capsids, cores and other oligomeric assemblages of rhinovirus, enterovirus 71, hepatitis C and dengue virus are likely to be dominant drug targets. This strategy may not apply to retroviruses, because the step with the least fidelity, reverse transcription, gives rise to a low copy number DNA intermediate. However, <i>bona fide</i> DNA viruses, present at a high copy number per cell, should also be amenable to this dominant drug targeting strategy. For other error-prone, intracellular genetic amplification events, such as the growth of bacterial and eukaryotic intracellular pathogens and the gene duplication associated with oncogenesis, the choice of oligomeric drug targets may also suppress the outgrowth of drug-resistant variants immediately after their inception. Deliberate targeting of oligomeric structures should reduce the numbers of inhibitors needed for effective treatment, but will require revision of decision-making processes during drug development."

From this stock, a purified plaque was isolated and RNA was extracted and the sequence was determined.

Viral RNA was made by linearizing 10 \u03bcg of the plasmid with EcoRI, phenol:chloroform extracting the DNA, and transcribing from the linearized DNA using the MEGAscript kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Viral RNA was transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the manufacturer's protocol and agar overlays containing rupintrivir were added 4 hr post transfection to confirm the rupintrivir-resistant phenotype.

Beads were incubated with virus stock for 2.5 hr at room temperature followed by three 15 min washes with TBS before releasing the capsid from the antibody by competitive elution with the 3\u00d7 FLAG peptide (Sigma Aldrich). Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE gel by boiling for 5 min in protein sample buffer (final concentration: 62.5 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mM DTT, 0.0005% bromophenol blue) and analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were visualized by immunoblot. For the anti-FLAG immunoblot, a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody was used (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) at a 1:1000 dilution in 2% BSA in TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween). For anti-HA immunoblot, the THE HA Tag Antibody (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol."

V-073 was delivered to mice by oral gavage in 100 \u03bcl corn oil. Control mice were given DMSO in corn oil. To titer virus in muscle samples taken, calf muscles were harvested, homogenized in 1 ml PBS<sup>+</sup>, subjected to one round of freeze-thaw, cleared by low-speed centrifugation and titered as described above. V-073-resistant virus was titered by infecting between three and twenty plates at an MOI of 0.02 PFU/cell and adding 24 \u03bcM V-073 in the overlay; low amounts of virus were used to minimize toxicity from wild-type virus. As many plates as needed were infected in order to observe at least ten V-073-resistant plaques. If fewer than ten plaques were observed, the observed value was assumed to be <i>k</i> and the Poisson distribution was used to determine the highest possible \u03bb value with a 5% likelihood (<a href=\"#bib28\">Poisson, 1837</a>). <i>Tnfr1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice that express the human poliovirus receptor were derived by crossing cPVR mice with <i>Tnfr1</i><sup><i>tm1Imx</i></sup>/J mice (JAXS, Bar Harbor, ME) and breeding both the transgenic PVR and the <i>Tnfr1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> allele to homozygosity."

By contrast, targeting viral proteins which do not form higher order oligomers, such as the 3C protease or the 2C RNA-dependent NTPase of poliovirus, failed to inhibit newly arising drug-resistant virus. The authors demonstrated that formation of chimeric virions containing a mixture of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant capsids was responsible for the observed genetic dominance of drug-susceptible viruses in the studies, and they propose targeting such a 'dominant drug target' would suppress the outgrowth of naturally occurring drug-resistant variants in general. They also examined how the dose of inoculating virus influences the isolation of drug resistant variants in cell culture; which might form a basis for a general methodology to identify dominant drug targets."
