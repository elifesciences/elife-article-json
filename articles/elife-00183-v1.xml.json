Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is aphid-transmitted, with the virus being taken up from specialized transmission bodies (TB) formed within infected plant cells. However, the precise events during TB-mediated virus acquisition by aphids are unknown. Here, we show that TBs react instantly to the presence of the vector by ultra-rapid and reversible redistribution of their key components onto microtubules throughout the cell. Enhancing or inhibiting this TB reaction pharmacologically or by using a mutant virus enhanced or inhibited transmission, respectively, confirming its requirement for efficient virus-acquisition. Our results suggest that CaMV can perceive aphid vectors, either directly or indirectly by sharing the host perception. This novel concept in virology, where viruses respond directly or via the host to the outside world, opens new research horizons, that is, investigating the impact of \u2018perceptive behaviors\u2019 on other steps of the infection cycle."

Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is aphid-transmitted, with the virus being taken up from specialized transmission bodies (TB) formed within infected plant cells. However, the precise events during TB-mediated virus acquisition by aphids are unknown. Here, we show that TBs react instantly to the presence of the vector by ultra-rapid and reversible redistribution of their key components onto microtubules throughout the cell. Enhancing or inhibiting this TB reaction pharmacologically or by using a mutant virus enhanced or inhibited transmission, respectively, confirming its requirement for efficient virus-acquisition. Our results suggest that CaMV can perceive aphid vectors, either directly or indirectly by sharing the host perception. This novel concept in virology, where viruses respond directly or via the host to the outside world, opens new research horizons, that is, investigating the impact of \u2018perceptive behaviors\u2019 on other steps of the infection cycle."

This step can represent a significant bottleneck for the infection cycle, since it is common for only a small proportion of the countless viral genomes produced to be passed on to a new host in a transmission event; for example, only one to three of the many transmissible genomes initiate a new infection after <i>Potato virus Y</i> transmission (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moury et al., 2007</a>). It is thus expected that viruses have adapted their life cycle and developed sophisticated strategies to optimize their transmission. Whereas non-viral pathogens are known to allocate resources for the production of transmission-specific morphs (discussed in <a href=\"#bib27\">Matthews, 2011</a>), surprisingly little is known for this mechanism regarding viruses (for review see <a href=\"#bib4\">Blanc et al., 2011</a>). Some viruses are transmitted vertically to host offspring and others are transmitted by contact between hosts (e.g., by wind, water or physical contact), but most viruses rely on vectors for rapid proliferation within host populations (for review see <a href=\"#bib19\">Kuno and Chang, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blanc et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bak et al., 2012</a>)."

Those with a piercing-sucking feeding behavior such as mosquitoes (or other blood-feeding dipterans) and ticks are especially significant for vertebrate viruses, and likewise aphids, white flies and other sap-feeding bugs are consequential for plant viruses. These vectors are ideal, as their variety of mouth parts can puncture cells, blood vessels, and plant sap vessels with great precision, thus enabling efficient uptake and injection of pathogens without killing the host. Vector transmission can be classified into two main transmission modes. In circulative transmission, the virus is taken up by the vector together with the nutrients (e.g., blood, plant sap, cell contents), where it actively crosses from the intestine into the vector interior. Then it cycles through the hemocoel (the internal body cavity awash in hemolymph) to the salivary glands, where the virus can be secreted together with the saliva into a new host. The second transmission mode is alternatively referred to as mechanical transmission (for human and animal viruses) or non-circulative transmission (for plant viruses). In this transmission mode, the arthropod vector only briefly comes into contact with the virus, in which it transiently attaches to the vector mouth parts and is subsequently released; an internalization step does not occur. The viral proteins involved in this seemingly simple process have been well-described in the literature, often down to the molecular level (for review see <a href=\"#bib29\">Ng and Falk, 2006</a>). On the other hand, their precise roles during virus-acquisition by the vector remains largely unexplored (for review see <a href=\"#bib4\">Blanc et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "<i>Cauliflower mosaic virus</i> (CaMV), the virus studied here, is a non-circulative virus transmitted by aphids. CaMV binds to a receptor protein located at the tip of the aphid's needle-like mouth parts, the stylets (<a href=\"#bib34\">Uzest et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2010</a>). The CaMV transmissible complex is composed of the icosahedral viral particle (containing the viral genome enclosed by a shell of capsid protein P4), the virus-associated protein P3, and finally the aphid-transmission factor or helper component, the viral protein P2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blanc et al., 1993a</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Leh et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Plisson et al., 2005</a>). P2 is central to the virus's transmission, as it links the virus particle to the aphid stylets through the interaction of its C-terminus with virus-associated P3, as well as the linking of its N-terminus with the stylet receptor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interestingly, although P2 deletion mutants of CaMV are not transmissible by aphids, they are perfectly infectious when inoculated artificially to host plants. This shows that the only role for P2 in the CaMV life cycle is virus\u2013vector interaction. P2 localizes exclusively to a specific cytoplasmic inclusion in infected plant cells, the transmission body (TB, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). There, P2 co-aggregates with the viral protein P3 to form a matrix in which some virus particles are embedded; the existence of any cellular components within this matrix remains elusive (<a href=\"#bib11\">Espinoza et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Drucker et al., 2002</a>). The TB-contained P3 is most likely dissimilar in conformation to the P3 associated with the virus particle, and has been suggested to play a role in TB structure and maintenance, but any details are yet unknown (<a href=\"#bib10\">Drucker et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hoh et al., 2010</a>). TBs are indispensable to this transmission, as it has previously been shown that aphids are unable to acquire the virus in their absence (i.e., P2 deletion mutants, <a href=\"#bib39\">Woolston et al., 1983</a>), as well as when TBs are malformed. The P2 mutant, P2<sub>G94R</sub> (described in <a href=\"#bib18\">Khelifa et al., 2007</a>), assists efficiently in the transmission of purified CaMV particles associated with P3, when aphids are allowed to acquire all three components in vitro from suspensions across Parafilm membranes. However, when the P2<sub>G94R</sub> mutant is expressed <i>in planta</i> in the context of CaMV infection, it induces the formation of a misshaped TB (for details see <a href=\"#bib18\">Khelifa et al., 2007</a>), preventing plant-to-plant transmission by the aphid vector."

Most plant cells survive the initial test punctures, during which only minute amounts of cytoplasm are ingested. CaMV and hundreds of other viral species can be acquired during this feeding behavior, but detailed events occurring within the punctured cell at the precise moment of stylet entry and how they result in virus acquisition are largely unknown. In the example of CaMV, it is known that microtubules are involved in the generation of TBs at the onset of infection (<a href=\"#bib23\">Martini\u00e8re et al., 2009</a>) and that the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin inhibits virus acquisition by aphids (<a href=\"#bib24\">Martini\u00e8re et al., 2011a</a>), but any details of the mode of action of oryzalin on TBs and how TBs function in virus transmission are still unclear."

Thus, typical TBs were detected, and these were rather large (2\u20135 \u03bcm in diameter) and mostly ovoid single cytoplasmic inclusions, having a cortex heavily labeled by P2 antibody and a less intensely labeled interior. Most importantly, little if any tubulin was detected in this regular form of the TB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interestingly, we also observed a second class of TBs that was phenotypically nearly identical, with the exception that tubulin had greatly accumulated in their centers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Even more surprisingly, we were unable to detect TBs in some cells; at best, small P2 foci without the typical TB structure were visible (hereafter referred to as fragmented TBs). Instead, most P2 decorated the microtubule network in these cells (a P2 distribution pattern hereafter designated as \u2018mixed-networks\u2019 and referring to mixed P2-tubulin networks; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). A common point among these three TB phenotypes was that their occurrence varied greatly from one experiment to the next. Depending on the tissue preparation, anywhere from almost none to practically all of the TBs contained tubulin; the proportion of cells containing mixed-networks also varied from one experiment to another. To account for these observations, we hypothesized that, among the different TB morphologies observed (hereafter referred to as \u2018morphs\u2019), the tubulin-loaded (Tub<sup>+</sup>|TB) and mixed-network phenotypes were induced by unidentified stresses during leaf handling, whereas the tubulin-less phenotype (Tub<sup>\u2212</sup>|TBs) corresponded to unstressed \u2018standby\u2019 TBs found under normal conditions. As the only known role for TBs is in transmission, this further raised the question of whether and how the presence of tubulin within TBs impacts transmission by aphids. To investigate this phenomenon, we first aimed to identify artificial stresses that could trigger specific transformation of standby TBs into Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs and mixed-networks. Heat-shock, wounding and CO<sub>2</sub> exposure all induced TB transformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Quantification of the various TB morphs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) established that all three treatments induced Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs. However, mixed-networks (co-existing with Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs and fragmented TBs) were significantly increased only in wounded or CO<sub>2</sub>-exposed leaves, and were rarely observed in heat-shocked or untreated leaves. This indicates that the different stresses had different and specific effects on TBs."

To estimate the speed of TB transformation, we first tested wounding stress by inflicting cuts with a razor blade on infected turnip leaves. The tissue was then fixed immediately (\u223c10 s) and the TB phenotype analyzed by immunofluorescence. Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs and mixed-networks were detected readily at the wounding sites; by contrast, the cells of control tissue, or tissue wounded after fixation, predominantly harbored standby TBs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We next evaluated the kinetics of tubulin entry into TBs. The surface of a CaMV-infected Arabidopsis leaf expressing genetically tagged GFP-tubulin (<i>GFP-TUA6</i>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ueda et al., 1999</a>) was touched with a microelectrode, and the response of TBs in epidermis cells was recorded using confocal time-lapse macroscopy. In the event of a fast entry of tubulin into TB, we should expect to observe a rapid appearance of fluorescent foci, corresponding to Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs within these cells. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Movie 1</a> reveal the detection of GFP-tubulin in TBs as early as \u223c5 s after microelectrode impact; fluorescence in these inclusions reached a maximum and stabilized within \u223c10 s. Similar results were obtained in \u223c50% of all infected cells tested (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Contrarily, GFP-tubulin formed a diffuse fluorescent cloud at the impact site in healthy control cells, in line with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hardham et al., 2008</a>); fast appearance of tubulin inclusions as in infected cells was never observed. Subsequently, we examined whether the tubulin within TBs is exchanged with that of the cytoplasm, by measuring GFP-tubulin turnover in Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments (FRAP). Photo-bleached GFP-tubulin in TBs was rapidly replaced by fresh cytoplasmic GFP-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>), suggesting that this protein circulates continuously between Tub<sup>+</sup>|TB and the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results indicate that the appearance of both Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs and mixed-networks is fast enough to occur during an aphid puncture, and that there is a dynamic equilibrium between cytosolic and TB-contained tubulin."

The epidermis of CaMV-infected Arabidopsis leaves expressing GFP-tagged \u03b1-tubulin (Arabidopsis <i>GFP-TUA6</i>) was touched with a microelectrode tip (yellow), and the effect of the impact recorded by time-lapse confocal macroscopy. GFP-tubulin fluorescence is shown in green, chloroplast fluorescence in orange/red. Negative and positive time points are before and after the microelectrode-epidermis contact, respectively. The red circle denotes the impact zone, and the three arrows point to newly formed GFP-tubulin inclusions. The blue asterisk indicates a reference epidermis cell that did not change its z-position during the time lapse recording and can be used as a landmark for orientation. (<b>B</b>\u2013<b>D</b>) Tubulin cycles between TBs and the cytoplasm. Arabidopsis <i>GFP-TUA6</i> plants were infected with CaMV and the epidermis was screened for rare spontaneously occurring Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs (no deliberate stress treatment was inflicted on the leaf); these were identified by the characteristic shape of the fluorescent tubulin-containing inclusions (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The GFP-tubulin in these Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs was photobleached, and the recovery of the GFP fluorescence (due to replacement by fresh cytoplasmic GFP-tubulin) was recorded by time lapse microscopy. (<b>B</b>) Microscopic images of a typical FRAP experiment. The first picture shows a GFP-tubulin-containing Tub<sup>+</sup>|TB before photobleaching. The dashed circle in the second picture indicates the photobleached zone at t = 0 s, and the following pictures show recovery of the GFP-fluorescence at indicated time points after photobleaching. (<b>C</b>\u2013<b>D</b>) The graphs show quantifications of fluorescence recovery: after photobleaching of TBs (<b>C</b>), and after photobleaching of a cytoplasmic zone as a control of free tubulin diffusion (<b>D</b>). The fluorescence levels were normalized (100% = fluorescence before bleaching, 0% = fluorescence just after bleaching). For the two quantification graphs, FRAP trend lines (red) were calculated from seven FRAP experiments on GFP-tubulin-containing TBs, or from 18 FRAP experiments on cytoplasmic zones. The difference in t<sub>(1/2)</sub> for fluorescence recovery between TBs and the cytoplasm was highly significant (p&lt;0.0001, t-test with n = 18 for TBs and n = 21 for cytoplasm). In contrast, the difference in the mobile fractions, that is, the percentage of exchangeable GFP-tubulin, the so-called mobile fraction, was not significant (p=0.504, t-test with n = 18 for TBs and n = 21 for cytoplasm). These results indicate that tubulin cycles between the cytoplasm and TBs, albeit at much slower rates than free diffusion in the cytoplasm.

To facilitate tracking, we used infected protoplasts to screen for various conditions that could induce TB transformation (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), including various physical, chemical and biological stresses. These wide-ranging cell treatments showed that of all the tested stresses, only heat, the chemical sodium azide, compacting of cells by sedimentation and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) induced TB transformation. As in leaves, heat treatment of protoplasts only induced Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs (data not shown), whereas CO<sub>2</sub> and azide stimulated Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs as well as mixed-networks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The kinetics of TB transformations followed a precise order: first, standby TBs are loaded with tubulin, and then mixed-networks and tubulin-containing TB fragments appear, at the expense of Tub<sup>\u2212</sup>|TBs. After 5 min (CO<sub>2</sub> treatment) or 40 min (azide treatment) most cells displayed mixed-networks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). A most remarkable property of the TBs was their rapid reversion from the mixed-network phenotype back to tubulin-less TBs; this was provoked either after substituting normal air for CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), or after removing azide from the culture medium (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Moreover, it was possible to induce several consecutive rounds of TB transformation in the mixed-networks, as well as reversion to the same cell suspension, by continually relieving and resubmitting cells to stress (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Are virus particles, the other major component of the CaMV transmissible complex, also distributed onto the mixed-networks? To answer this question, we carried out immunofluorescence of the mixed-networks using a CaMV capsid protein antibody. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows that capsid protein localizes to cytoplasmic inclusions (which are most likely virus factories) in unstressed cells. Under conditions that trigger the formation of the mixed-networks, that is, CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) or azide treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), P4 label colocalized with microtubules. Quantification of this observation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) indicates that almost all cells displayed P4 networks after stress treatment. Nearly the same proportion of cells contained P2 or P4 networks after treatment with CO<sub>2</sub> or azide (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), which suggested that mixed-networks are also associated with virus particles. We confirmed this by electron- and immunogold microscopy, which showed (in treated cells) that cortical microtubules displaying P2 were indeed also decorated heavily with CaMV particles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). Finally, we also examined the ultrastructure of standby and Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs. The latter were induced by heat shock and then the tissues prepared for electron microscopy. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013G</a> shows that TBs consist of an electron-lucent matrix in which some virus particles are embedded as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib11\">Espinoza et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Drucker et al., 2002</a>). In control TBs, the virus particles seemed either to be distributed evenly throughout the TB matrix (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) or to be more concentrated at their cortex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Heat-shocked TBs displayed similar TB phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,G</a>) and we could not observe any flagrant differences in TB phenotype between heat-shock-induced Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs and control TBs. This corresponded to the results obtained by fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>) where likewise no obvious differences between the two TB morphs were observed."

Protoplasts were either left unstressed (<b>A</b>), incubated with CO<sub>2</sub> for 15 min (<b>B</b>) or treated with azide for 40 min (<b>C</b>), and then fixed and labeled to detect capsid protein P4 (red) and \u03b1-tubulin (\u03b1TUA, green). The split channel representations and merges as well as the P4 and \u03b1-tubulin profiles obtained by scanning the lines indicated by the orange arrows show that the two stress treatments induced relocalization of capsid protein P4 from inclusions onto microtubules. As in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>, the intensity of the P4 and \u03b1-tubulin label is indicated in arbitrary units (AU) because different acquisition settings were used to record the images.

(<b>D</b>) Quantification of the effect of azide and CO<sub>2</sub> on the localization of P4. Cells were treated as indicated, processed for immunofluorescence against P4 and \u03b1-tubulin and scored for the presence of P4 in inclusions only, or in inclusions and on microtubules. The histogram shows that almost all cells display P4 networks that colocalize with microtubules after stress treatment. Data are from one of three independent experiments, in which a total of 524 cells were analyzed. Refer to <a href=\"#SD19-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 4</a> for details. Scale bars: 5 \u03bcm.

However, in all of the above cases, TB transformations were induced by artificial stresses and might not reflect a \u2018natural\u2019 induction of TB changes in aphid-infested plants. We therefore aimed to determine whether aphid feeding activity by itself triggers TB transformation. Accordingly, we developed a protocol that simultaneously allows observation of the TB phenotype in infected cells and the discrimination of cells, based on whether or not they had been in direct contact with aphid stylets. For this procedure, aphids were allowed to feed on infected leaves for 15 min, before the leaf was fixed and subsequently screened by confocal microscopy. We then identified, by their auto-fluorescence, the salivary sheaths that remain in the tissue after aphid removal, and which precisely document the path followed by the stylets (<a href=\"#bib26\">Miles, 1968</a>). In addition, we identified by immunofluorescence the different TB morphs in plant cells that were either in close contact or farther away from these sheaths. Standby TBs were predominantly detected in uninfested tissues, or in infested tissues greater than 15 \u03bcm from the stylet track (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). In contrast, cells of infested leaves within a 15 \u03bcm perimeter of salivary sheaths often displayed typical mixed-networks, fragmented TBs and Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Mixed-networks in cells close to the stylet track were also loaded with virus particles, as indicated by positive P4 capsid protein label of microtubules (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Quantification of the aphid-induced effect showed that 30\u201340% of TBs in cells in contact with a stylet track displayed a modified TB phenotype, whereas 99% of TBs in cells found more than one cell layer away from this track remained in the standby state (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). In parallel experiments, aphids were removed after the 15-min feeding period and the leaves were allowed to recover for 2 h before analysis. This intriguingly provoked the aphid-induced mixed-networks to revert back to standby TBs, as demonstrated by the strong decrease in the number of modified TBs close to the stylet tracks (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This resembled the reversion observed in protoplasts, upon relief from either azide or CO<sub>2</sub> treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Taken together, these results show that the probing activity of aphid stylets is a robust trigger of TB transformation, and that these aphid-induced TB changes are completely reversible."

We therefore investigated whether TB transformation is required for aphid-transmission of CaMV. Assessing the effect of TB transformation on transmission was however not straightforward, since aphids themselves provoke TB transformation. As a possible means to circumvent this problem, we observed while quantifying TB morphs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>) that only 30\u201340% of the TBs had transformed after contact with the stylets. We thus reasoned that a pre-treatment of infected cells that would substantially increase the proportion of modified TBs prior to aphid feeding should \u2018prime\u2019 these cells for virus acquisition and enhance the CaMV transmission rate. To investigate this, we first induced mixed-networks in protoplasts with azide, and then used the cells in aphid transmission experiments. We observed significantly elevated transmission rates compared to transmission from control cells that displayed mainly standby TBs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The effect was not caused by altered aphid behavior resulting from the presence of azide in the protoplast medium, because the chemical had no effect in transmission experiments in which aphids were allowed to acquire CaMV instead from cells from suspensions containing purified virus, recombinant P2 and P3 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Azide also had no effect on protoplast viability under the conditions used (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Taken together, these results rule out a possible confounding effect of azide, and clearly indicate that it was the presence of mixed-networks that lead to increased transmission rates. In order to compare this situation with that of intact plant tissues, we examined infected CO<sub>2</sub>-treated or heat-shocked leaves in transmission assays. Under heat shock treatment, TB transformation appeared incomplete and arrested at the Tub<sup>+</sup>|TB stage, as reported above (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The heat-shocked leaves did not perform any better than controls in aphid-transmission tests (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>), indicating that tubulin entry into TBs alone is not sufficient to enhance transmission. In contrast, CO<sub>2</sub> induced complete TB transformation into mixed-networks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Moreover, significantly enhanced transmission rates were recorded when CO<sub>2</sub>-treated leaves were used in aphid transmission experiments (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>)."

Furthermore, we hypothesize that the higher accessibility of CaMV to its aphid vector can be explained by microtubules serving as a scaffold for the rapid redistribution of P2 and virus particles over the entire cell. If this were true, then depolymerization of microtubules by oryzalin should both prevent the formation of mixed-networks, and significantly decrease the transmission rate. We have previously shown that oryzalin diminishes transmission from infected protoplasts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Martini\u00e8re et al., 2011a</a>). Consistent with these results, we show here that oryzalin induces Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs within 15 min, but prevents mixed-network formation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F,G</a>)."

                                "text": "To further confirm the role of TB changes in aphid-transmission of CaMV, we pursued an independent approach and examined a CaMV mutant impaired in transmission. This mutant, CaMV P2-TC, harbors a 7-amino acid insertion, including a tetracysteine tag (<a href=\"#bib14\">Griffin et al., 1998</a>) at position 100 of the P2 protein. The mutant virus was fully infectious as compared to wild type virus; furthermore, the P2-TC protein as well as viral proteins P3, P4 and P6 accumulated to similar levels in infected plants (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). However, in comparison to wild type TBs, this mutant induced TBs (TB-TCs) that seemed to be smaller, with a more regular rounded shape, and a more pronounced P2-rich cortex, as revealed by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Heat shock induced an influx of tubulin into TB-TCs, and photobleached GFP-tubulin contained in TB-TC was observed to be exchanged with cytoplasmic tubulin in FRAP experiments (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>), although the kinetics differed from tubulin replacement in wild type TBs (compare <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a> with <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus the TB of the P2-TC mutant bears some similarity to wild type TB. Nevertheless, CaMV P2-TC was completely non-transmissible in plant-to-plant transmission experiments (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). This could be due to a defect of TB-TC in undergoing correct transformation upon aphid puncture; an alternative is that this is due to a lack of interaction between the mutant P2-TC protein and either virus particles or aphid stylets. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first tested whether P2-TC protein can mediate the binding of virus particles to the aphid stylets. One way to test this is to allow aphids to feed on suspensions containing recombinant P2-TC, P3 and purified virus particles through membranes, before they are transferred to test plants for inoculation. Binding of transmissible complexes acquired by the aphids from the feeding solution is then scored by counting the number of successful transmission events, that is, the number of infected test plants. Although the transmission rates were significantly lower than that obtained with wild type P2, the P2-TC mutant protein was indeed active in such assays, retaining around 50% of the wild P2 activity (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). We thus reasoned that defects in P2-TC binding to virus particles or stylets can only partially explain the complete failure in plant-to-plant transmission of the P2-TC mutant, and that a failure in TB-TC transformation may also be involved. To investigate this possibility, we allowed aphids to infest CaMV-P2TC-infected leaves for 15 min. The leaves were then processed for immunofluorescence against P2 and \u03b1-tubulin, and scored for the TB phenotype in cells found close to and farther away from the salivary sheaths. <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F,G</a> demonstrates that only standby TBs were detected, and not Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs or mixed-networks. This result is further evidence for a strong positive correlation between the appearance of mixed-networks (i.e., TB transformation) and successful aphid transmission, and presents direct biological evidence in support of our transmission hypothesis."

Western blot analysis of total leaf extracts shows that virus factory protein P6, the three forms of capsid protein P4, as well as P2 and P3 accumulate to similar levels in plants infected with wild type CaMV (B-JI) or the P2-TC mutant (TC). Rub = Rubisco loading control stained with Ponceau Red. (<b>B</b>) CaMV P2-TC-infected plants display TBs. Confocal projection of infected leaf sections labeled for P2 (red) and \u03b1-tubulin (green) shows that the CaMV mutant P2-TC forms TBs (arrows) that are smaller and more regular than wild type TBs. Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI (blue). The optical single sections used for the projection are presented in <a href=\"#SD31-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 1</a>. (<b>C</b>) Tubulin turnover in P2-TC mutant TBs. Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing GFP-tubulin were infected with the CaMV P2-TC mutant. Leaf epidermis was screened by fluorescence microscopy for GFP-tubulin inclusions that were identified as TBs based on their typical shape. The GFP-tubulin was photobleached in these TBs, and the recovery of the GFP-fluorescence (due to replacement of the photobleached GFP-tubulin by fresh tubulin) was recorded in FRAP experiments. The graph shows recovery kinetics from t = 0 s (time point of photobleach) onwards. The fluorescence levels were normalized (100% = fluorescence before bleaching, 0% = fluorescence just after bleaching). The red trend line was calculated from nine experiments. Data points from the nine experiments are indicated as blue dots. These results indicate that tubulin cycles between the cytoplasm and mutant TBs, albeit with different kinetics than for wild type TBs (compare with <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Compared to wild type TBs, the t<sub>(1/2)</sub> for fluorescence recovery was significantly slower (p&lt;0.0001, t-test with n = 21 for wild type TBs and n = 23 for TC-TBs) and the proportion of the mobile fraction was significantly higher in P2-TC TBs (p=0.0001, t-test with n = 21 for wild type TBs and n = 23 for TC-TBs). Refer to <a href=\"#SD32-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> (wild type TBs) for data sets. (<b>D</b>) The mutant P2-TC does not support plant-to-plant transmission. Aphids were placed for 15 min on CaMV wild type-infected (B-JI) or P2-TC-infected (TC) leaves and then transferred to healthy test plants for inoculation. Infected plants were scored 3 weeks later. Pooled data are shown from two independent experiments using 12 different leaves for each condition. No statistical analysis was performed, as the effect of the P2-TC mutant on plant-to-plant transmission was total (no transmission from P2-TC-infected plants was observed). See <a href=\"#SD33-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 3</a> for the data sets. (<b>E</b>) The P2-TC protein itself is active in transmission. Recombinant wild type P2 (B-JI) or mutant P2-TC (TC) were mixed together with recombinant P3 protein and purified CaMV particles. Aphids were allowed to feed on the suspensions across membranes for 15 min and were then transferred to healthy test plants for inoculation. Infected plants were counted 3 weeks later. The histogram shows that P2-TC supported aphid transmission of CaMV under these conditions, although this was significantly reduced as compared to the wild type P2 (p=0.02, n = 8 from two independent experiments, Mann\u2013Whitney test). See <a href=\"#SD34-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 4</a> for data. (<b>F</b>) Aphid stylet activity does not trigger TB transformation in CaMV P2-TC-infected leaves. Aphids were allowed to feed on CaMV-P2-TC-infected leaves for 15 min. The tissue was then processed for immunofluorescence against P2 (red) and \u03b1-tubulin (green); nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The confocal projection in (<b>F</b>) indicates that cells in contact with a salivary sheath (Sheath) display tubulin-less TBs (arrows). Chloroplasts are displayed in magenta to better distinguish the cells. Please see <a href=\"#SD35-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 5</a> for the confocal single sections used to create the projection. (<b>G</b>) Quantitative analysis of the TB forms of CaMV-P2-TC in aphid-infested tissue reveals the absence of Tub<sup>+</sup>|TBs and mixed-networks, both close to salivary sheaths (0\u201315 \u03bcm) and farther away (15\u2013100 \u03bcm). Data shown are from three independent experiments where a total of 510 TBs were analyzed (see <a href=\"#SD36-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 6</a> for details). As the effect was total, no statistical analysis was performed. SD: standard deviation."

Transmission is controlled by the different TB morphs. The tubulin-less TB found in normal \u2018unstressed\u2019 cells has been well-described over the past several decades (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shalla et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rodriguez et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Espinoza et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Blanc et al., 1993b</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Drucker et al., 2002</a>), and here functions as a standby TB that \u2018anticipates\u2019 the vector arrival. Then, when aphids land on the plant and insert their stylets into tissues, CaMV uses the plant's response during stylet entry to its advantage at a very early stage of the plant\u2013aphid interaction. This results in TBs that undergo dramatic, short-lived changes leading to the temporary redistribution of P2 and virus onto microtubules. These hitherto overlooked TB alterations result in a reversible TB \u2018activation\u2019 that optimizes virus acquisition. The activation or increased transmission efficiency is probably due to the mixed-networks distributing P2 and virus homogeneously on microtubules throughout the cell periphery. This could in turn facilitate virus acquisition: in this new configuration, P2 and the virus are more accessible to the vector during its random punctures, as compared to the remote localization of P2 in isolated TBs. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that inhibition of mixed-network formation, either in the CaMV-P2TC mutant or pharmacologically by oryzalin, resulted in decreased transmission. The converse situation also applies, as artificial induction of mixed-networks by CO<sub>2</sub> and azide were correlated strongly with increased transmission rates. These results additionally indicate that the TB reaction is required for transmission."

(<b>A</b>) In an infected cell in the \u2018standby\u2019 state, there are numerous virus factories (VF) containing most of the replicated virus particles (yellow-blue circles), enclosed within a matrix of viral protein P6 (grey). This is accompanied in the cell by a mostly single transmission body (TB), composed of a matrix containing all of the cell's P2 (red), co-aggregated with P3 (blue) and some virus particles. Microtubules are represented in green. (<b>B</b>) An aphid landing on an infected plant inserts its stylets into a cell to test the plant. This causes a mechanical stress (stylet movement) and/or a chemical stress (e.g., elicited by saliva components). This stress, symbolized by the yellow flashes, is immediately perceived by the plant and can induce subsequent defense responses. The initial aphid recognition signal is transduced simultaneously in a TB response, characterized by an influx of tubulin (green) into the TB. (<b>C</b>) In a second step, the TB disintegrates rapidly (within seconds), and all the P2 as well as some virus particles relocalize on the cortical microtubules as mixed-networks. Whether or not the virus particles originate at the VFs, as presented here, is unknown. Transmissible P2-virus complexes are now homogeneously distributed throughout the cell periphery, which significantly increases the chances of successful binding of P2 and virus to the stylets and thus transmission. (<b>D</b>) After departure of the aphid vector (here loaded with P2 and virus), a new TB is reformed from the mixed-networks and is ready for another round of transmission."

Whereas the origin of microtubule-associated P2 is clearly the TB (since the TB is the only source of P2), the origin of the virus particles aligning on the microtubules is less clear. They could derive either from the TB, which contains some virus particles, or from the many virus factories dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib11\">Espinoza et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Drucker et al., 2002</a>). We were also intrigued to observe that only certain stresses\u2014notably aphid feeding activity, wounding, azide and CO<sub>2</sub>\u2014could trigger TB transformation. This reveals a certain level of specificity in TB activation, although it is more broad than the classical pattern recognition receptor-mediated defense responses of plants against pathogens (including insects) that are often species or even isolate-specific (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hogenhout and Bos, 2011</a>). This broad specificity is not surprising, since CaMV is transmitted by at least 30 different aphid species. Importantly, this suggests that the plant responses against aphids (that are probably exploited by CaMV for the TB reaction) are triggered by an elicitor common to all aphids. Whether this elicitor triggers an innate plant immunity pathway or a separate perception/reaction cascade remains an open question."

First, this opens up a fascinating new direction within virology, to explore whether other viruses form transmission morphs in response to vector-sensing by the host. Second, the transient accumulation of tubulin in TBs, followed by redistribution of TB contents on microtubules uncovers unforeseen capacities of tubulin/microtubule dynamics and raises further questions pertinent to cell biology. For example: How can apparently soluble tubulin concentrate in the TB and what is its function there? Does this serve as the source for the mixed-networks? Most strikingly, our work reveals that a virus can detect external stresses (probably by using its host's perception system) and respond in a way that is somewhat independent of the host's response. We propose naming this phenomenon: \u2018virus perceptive behavior\u2019. This concept is nicely illustrated by three compelling observations made in this study. First, TB transformation occurs while the host plant is still in the process of transducing the triggering signal. This shows that the virus appropriates the host's perception machinery itself, rather than relying upon downstream reactions that take tens of minutes (or hours) to manifest and establish local and systemic defense responses (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ku\u015bnierczyk et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">de Vos and Jander, 2010</a>). Second, after transformation of the TB into mixed-networks, the fate of CaMV appears disconnected from the final host response. Indeed, within the time frame required for the host plant to respond to an aphid attack, mixed-networks have already served as a robust virus source for aphids, and have long since reverted back to standby TBs. Third, the response mechanisms themselves are also entirely different from the reported plant physiological responses to aphid attack. These include callose deposition near the salivary sheaths and within sieve tubes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Villada et al., 2009</a>), changes in gene expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ku\u015bnierczyk et al., 2008</a>), altered emission of volatile compounds (<a href=\"#bib8\">de Vos and Jander, 2010</a>); and the initiation of salicylic, abscisic, and jasmonic acid systemic defense pathways (<a href=\"#bib13\">Giovanini et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ku\u015bnierczyk et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">de Vos and Jander, 2009</a>). In contrast, the TB response seems to be restricted to a CaMV-specific and immediate diversion of tubulin/microtubules (plus putative unknown associated partners) for virus transmission, in a manner unlike anything described before."

Viruses tightly regulate all the different steps of their life cycle, from intracellular replication and short- and long-distance intra-host movement, to inter-host spread. In this sense, the ability to specifically trigger the \u2018transmission-mode\u2019 at the right time and the right place seems like a valuable adaptation for avoiding the deleterious interference between these various functions."

Finally, aside from being an academic challenge, this phenomenon also represents a potential Achilles heel in viral transmission that could lead to novel virus control strategies."

(2011b)</a> on infected or healthy Arabidopsi<i>s GFP-TU6</i> leaves using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope with a 63\u00d7 NA 1.4 oil-immersion objective. Leaf samples were mounted in 1% low melting point agar to prevent focus shift. Twenty scans of the entire field of view were made at pre-bleach intensity, and then a circular 20 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> region of interest (ROI), which included a TB, was photobleached. Three iterations of the 488-nm laser at 100% intensity were used for the bleaching. For recovery of the fluorescence in TBs, images were recorded for 110 s, with a 512 \u00d7 512 px picture size, a scan speed of 167 ms/frame and a delay between frames of 0.2 s. For controls, to account for fast tubulin diffusion in the cytosol, recovery was recorded in identical ROIs for only 5.9 s, with a 100 \u00d7 50 px picture size, a scan speed of 16 ms/frame and a delay between frames of 23 ms. We verified that the energy of the 488-nm laser used for the post-bleach added no bleaching effect by recording a control region outside the bleaching ROI. The experiment was repeated 21 times for wild type TB bleaching, 23 times for TB-TC bleaching and 18 times in the case of cytoplasmic soluble tubulin.
