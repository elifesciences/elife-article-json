However, the understanding of their in vivo physiological action remains limited, partly due to the complexity in channel types and scarcity of genetic models. Here we report that <i>C. elegans</i> LGC-46, a member of the Cys-loop acetylcholine (ACh)-gated chloride (ACC) channel family, localizes to presynaptic terminals of cholinergic motor neurons and regulates synaptic vesicle (SV) release kinetics upon evoked release of acetylcholine. Loss of <i>lgc-46</i> prolongs evoked release, without altering spontaneous activity. Conversely, a gain-of-function mutation of <i>lgc-46</i> shortens evoked release to reduce synaptic transmission. This inhibition of presynaptic release requires the anion selectivity of LGC-46, and can ameliorate cholinergic over-excitation in a <i>C. elegans</i> model of excitation-inhibition imbalance. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of presynaptic negative feedback in which an anion-selective LGIC acts as an auto-receptor to inhibit SV release."

Loss of <i>lgc-46</i> prolongs evoked release, without altering spontaneous activity. Conversely, a gain-of-function mutation of <i>lgc-46</i> shortens evoked release to reduce synaptic transmission. This inhibition of presynaptic release requires the anion selectivity of LGC-46, and can ameliorate cholinergic over-excitation in a <i>C. elegans</i> model of excitation-inhibition imbalance. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of presynaptic negative feedback in which an anion-selective LGIC acts as an auto-receptor to inhibit SV release."

While LGICs at postsynaptic sites have been extensively studied in many neural circuits, our knowledge for LGICs acting at the presynaptic terminals remains fragmentary (<a href=\"#bib8\">Engelman and MacDermott, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</a>). For example, classical electrophysiological recordings from cat spinal cord showed that activation of flexor afferent neurons caused decreased excitatory transmission of extensor afferent neurons onto extensor motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eccles et al., 1961</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Frank and Fuortes, 1957</a>). This effect was blocked by picrotoxin, an antagonist of ionotropic GABA receptors, implying that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors may be involved in inhibition of presynaptic release (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eccles et al., 1963</a>). Ultrastructural studies later revealed that the extensor afferent neuron terminals receive axo-axonal connections from GABAergic interneurons that are activated by flexor afferent neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pierce and Mendell, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Destombes et al., 1996</a>), suggesting the presence of GABA-gated LGICs in presynaptic axons. Electrophysiological recordings from crayfish opener muscles, which are innervated by excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons, also provided some evidence for the\u00a0function of presynaptic LGICs. It was shown that stimulation of inhibitory motor neurons caused decreased neurotransmission from excitatory motor neurons, and that statistical analysis of excitatory transmitter quanta suggested a likely presynaptic effect (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dudel and Kuffler, 1961</a>). Addition of exogenous GABA at these neuromuscular junctions caused similar effects, which was relieved by picrotoxin (<a href=\"#bib46\">Takeuchi and Takeuchi, 1966</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">1969</a>), suggesting this presynaptic inhibition involves GABA-gated LGICs in the presynaptic axons. Studies in the past decades have subsequently identified several ionotropic glycine receptors and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors acting in the presynaptic cells to regulate synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kullmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Engelman and MacDermott, 2004</a>). However, despite substantial molecular characterizations, there remains a large gap in our knowledge concerning the type and the\u00a0subcellular specificity of presynaptic LGICs with respect to their physiological roles in tuning neuronal communication."

Studies of cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions have identified conserved molecules and elucidated mechanisms regulating fast neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rand and Nonet, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Richmond, 2005</a>). Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx under stimulation, docked synaptic vesicles fuse with the\u00a0plasma membrane through rapid action involving synaptotagmins, soluble N-ethylmaleimide\u2013sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins, and voltage-gated calcium channels. <i>C. elegans</i> genome encodes a large number of LGICs, many of which are known or predicted to be responsive to acetylcholine (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hobert, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jones and Sattelle, 2008</a>), but whether they regulate SV release at presynaptic terminals is not known. Here, we report in vivo evidence for the ligand-gated anion channel LGC-46 (Ligand Gated ion Channel -46) in regulating SV release kinetics as a presynaptic auto-receptor. LGC-46 localizes close to SV release sites in cholinergic motor neurons. Loss of <i>lgc-46</i> specifically affects the decay phase, but not the rise phase, of evoked release to cause prolonged neurotransmitter release, without altering endogenous neuronal activity. Gain-of-function of LGC-46, caused by a missense mutation in the pore-lining transmembrane domain, accelerates decay kinetics to dampen synaptic transmission. We further show that LGC-46-mediated presynaptic inhibition ameliorates the seizure phenotype of a <i>C. elegans</i> mutant that displays excitation-inhibition imbalance in the locomotor circuit. Our results reveal a mechanism by which a presynaptic terminal-localized anion LGIC acts in a rapid feedback inhibition of neural activity."

Co-expression of P<i>lgc-46-GFP</i> with markers for cholinergic (P<i>unc-17-mCherry</i>) and GABAergic (P<i>ttr-39-mCherry</i>) neurons revealed that <i>lgc-46</i> was strongly expressed in cholinergic motor neurons, and weakly expressed in GABAergic motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) represent depolarization-triggered simultaneous release of hundreds of SVs, and the kinetics of the rise and decay phase of eEPSC reflect the onset and duration of SV release, respectively. We found that the amplitude of eEPSCs in <i>lgc-46(0)</i> animals was comparable to that in wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). The rise phase of eEPSCs was similar to wild type, suggesting the onset of evoked cholinergic transmission is not affected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). However, the analysis of release kinetics revealed that eEPSCs in lgc<i>-46(0)</i> were prolonged and displayed a significantly slower decay than that of wild type. We calculated the cumulative charge transfer during SV release. In wild type, the cumulative charge transfer during evoked release of SVs showed a burst within 15 ms after stimulation, and a slower sustained increase afterwards. The slower decay of eEPSCs in <i>lgc-46(0)</i> mutants led to a significant increase in cumulative charge transfer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Specifically, <i>lgc-46(0)</i> mutants displayed a normal early phase of SV release (21.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.50 pC, compared to 18.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.68 pC in wild type), but exhibited a large increase in the late phase (18.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.19 pC, compared to 11.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.35 pC in wild type).

Similar studies of LGC-46 have not yet revealed ACh-gated channel activity (Joseph Dent, personal communication), or responsiveness to other neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ringstad et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that LGC-46 may require additional subunits or accessory factors to form a functional channel. To identify potential interacting partners, we took advantage of a behavioral phenotype of <i>lgc-46(gf).</i> These animals display a\u00a0curly body posture and slow locomotion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Expression of LGC-46(M314I) under its own promoter in <i>lgc-46(0)</i> background mimicked the locomotion phenotypes, indicating that LGC-46(M314I) is responsible for the phenotype. We systematically examined null mutations in seven other ACC genes (<i>acc-1</i> to <i>acc-4</i> and <i>lgc-47</i> to <i>lgc-49</i>) and observed that all single mutants showed grossly normal movement. We then made double mutants with <i>lgc-46(gf),</i> and found that <i>acc-4(0)</i> showed a specific suppression of the <i>lgc-46(gf)</i> phenotype such that double mutant animals regained normal locomotion (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>acc-4</i> was also required for the suppression of <i>acr-2(gf)</i> convulsion by <i>lgc-46(gf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

However, few previous studies have addressed subcellular localization of anionic LGICs in presynaptic release sites (<a href=\"#bib2\">Belenky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hruskova et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sur et al., 1995</a>), partly because of limitations in available reagents and in detection methodology to directly examine the function and localization of presynaptic LGICs. Here, using genetic, molecular, cell biological and physiological tools in <i>C. elegans</i> , we have provided multiple lines of evidence to demonstrate that a presynaptic anion-selective ion channel acts as an auto-receptor to ensure tight control of neurotransmitter release in the motor circuit. LGC-46 localizes to the presynaptic release sites in cholinergic motor neurons. Loss of <i>lgc-46</i> specifically affects evoked SV release in the late phase, without affecting endogenous SV release. A gain-of-function mutation LGC-46(M314I) affects both endogenous and evoked SV release. As both loss- and gain- of function <i>lgc-46</i> mutants specifically affect the decay phase, but not the rise phase, of eEPSC, our data support a model where upon a burst of ACh release, opening of LGC-46 channels limits further SV release in the sustained late phase. LGC-46(gf) also exhibits a\u00a0strong inhibitory effect on synaptic release under elevated neuronal activity, suggesting that the mutant channel could have increased sensitivity to ligands, higher channel conductance or prolonged open state, thereby affecting the\u00a0basal activity of the cholinergic motor neurons."

A tightly regulated sharp decay of evoked EPSCs can ensure transient and adequate release of neurotransmitter to match high-frequency stimuli, possibly without triggering desensitization of postsynaptic receptors. Sharpening of synaptic activities by presynaptic LGICs can minimize unwanted cross-talks between synapses and neurons, allowing accurate information encoding in high frequency. Such mode of neural control can contribute to the overall circuit performance and may be particularly suited for synapses with graded potential, such as the case in <i>C. elegans</i> and those in the retina of vertebrates."

However, classical electrophysiological studies from <i>Aplysia</i> have also shown that acetylcholine can induce inhibitory responses. Injection of acetylcholine to pleural ganglia caused rapid inhibitory postsynaptic potential in a chloride concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the presence of ACh-gated anion channels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kehoe, 1972a</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">1972b</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kehoe and McIntosh, 1998</a>). The identity of these channels in <i>Aplysia</i> remains unknown. The discovery of <i>C. elegans</i> ACC proteins has provided molecular evidence for ACh-gated chloride channels (<a href=\"#bib35\">Putrenko et al., 2005</a>). Our understanding of ACC channel properties and their in vivo functions is only beginning. Several ACC channels are recently shown to display the\u00a0differential expression in neurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pereira et al., 2015</a>). ACC-2 has been implicated in regulation of reversal behavior, presumably as a postsynaptic receptor (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Our data support a conclusion that ACC-4 acts as a functional partner of LGC-46 at the presynaptic release site. Increasing presynaptic inhibition using <i>lgc-46(gf)</i> dampens overexcitation in the <i>acr-2(gf)</i> seizure model. The molecular nature and functional properties of <i>acr-2(gf)</i> show similarities to gain of function mutations in human CHRNB2, the \u03b22 subunit of neuronal nicotinic receptors, which have been identified as causal in autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib33\">Phillips et al., 2001</a>). Studies using cell lines and transgenic mouse models show that these mutant CHRNB2 proteins result in hyperactive channels, and can alter the\u00a0local circuit activity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Manfredi et al., 2009</a>). Our observations that the hyper-excitation in <i>acr-2(gf)</i> animals can be suppressed by increasing presynaptic inhibition suggest alternative ideas to manage circuit dysfunction. Growing evidence highlights the importance of presynaptic anion LGICs. For example, malfunction of presynaptic glycine channel can partially contribute to startle disease (hyperekplexia) in a mouse model (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2014</a>). These findings suggest ionotropic anion channels should be considered potential targets for modulating neuronal circuit function and in treatments for neurological disorders."

Conventional whole-cell recordings from muscle cells were performed with 2.5\u20133.5 M\u03a9 pipettes. An EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier was used together with the Patchmaster software package (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany). Endogenous EPSCs were recorded at \u221260 mV. For recording evoked EPSCs, a second glass pipet filled with bath solutions was put on the ventral nerve cord as stimulating electrode. The stimulating electrode gently touched the anterior region of ventral nerve cord to form loose patch configuration, which is around 1 muscle distance from recording pipets. A 0.5 ms, 85 \u03bcA square current pulse was generated by the isolated stimulator (WPI A320RC) as stimulus. Series resistance was compensated to 70% for the evoked EPSC recording. All current traces were imported to IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) for further analysis. A single exponential equation was used to fit the rise phase or decay phase of eEPSCs. The traces for the\u00a0cumulative transferred charge were obtained by integration of eEPSCs."

                    "text": "This is a nice study using a combination of genetics and electrophysiology to explore the physiological role of a presynaptic ligand-gated ion channel using <i>C. elegans</i>. The authors investigate LGC-46, which is likely to be a chloride channel gated by ACh (the major neuromuscular junction transmitter) based on sequence homology. Based mainly on a gain of function mutation in the lgc-46 gene, the authors conclude that synapses are normally inhibited when high levels of activation elevate ACh and open a presynaptic chloride conductance (ie a negative feedback loop). Strengths of this work include nice imaging to demonstrate presynaptic localization, beautiful electrophysiology of the NMJ, and solid genetics. The weaknesses are mainly that there does not seem to be much impact on the animal when LGC-46 is removed (perhaps redundancy issues) and a basic characterization of the LGC-46 channel properties is lacking. Although the lack of a pronounced behavioral phenotype in the null mutant (and subtle electrophysiological phenotype) may be considered a serious drawback to this study, the gain-of-function experiments still provide compelling and interesting insights into the biology of <i>lgc-46</i>. In fact, if this is a redundant regulatory system at the synapse, the gain-of-function approach is a more informative one until all of the players are identified. Of perhaps more concern, there is no functional characterization of the <i>lgc-46</i> gene product. Much of the interpretation for the gain-of-function M314I mutation and the PAR motif mutations in LGC-46 would be stronger if we knew that LGC-46 is truly an ACh-gated chloride channel and that the point mutations do what we think they do. For example, this has been done for the worm ACC subunits (Dent lab) and other LGC subunits (Horwitz lab). Is it okay to rely on studies of homologous ionotropic receptors? It's probably not fair or reasonable to ask for everything in one study. That concern aside, I do not have any major concerns about the technical quality of the data and I think that the development of a genetic approach to understanding the role of inhibitory ionotropic receptors in the presynaptic terminal is a significant advance in the field. I support going forward with this manuscript."

Here, the authors demonstrate a novel role for ACh-gated chloride channels which act at the presynaptic site to negatively inhibit synaptic vesicle release. They record evoked and spontaneous EPSCs from in vivo muscle cells to show that LGC-46, an ACh-gated anion-selective channel, accelerates the decay phase of eEPSCs. LGC-46 colocalizes to presynaptic markers and loss-of-function mutations are hypersensitive to aldicarb but not levamisole, indicating presynaptic function. Gain-of-function mutations accelerate the decay phase of the EPSC and reduces severity of an ACh-related over-excitation behavioral phenotype. The authors also show that ACC-4 localizes to presynaptic terminals and fund that ACC-4 may form a heteromeric channel with LGC-46. ACC-4 is also shown to regulate the evoked release kinetics of synaptic vesicles at cholinergic motor neuron synapses. Overall, this is an interesting study and will significantly advance our understanding of how LGICs presynaptically modulate SV release at the molecular and cellular levels."

The simplest explanation is that they function as a heteromeric channel because they both are pore-forming subunits (not auxiliary subunit-like), but the authors did not provide any direct evidence supporting one way or the other. Instead, they simply avoid touching on this notion, but the readers will not. This leaves behind a series of unanswered questions. For example, do they physically interact? Do they form a functional channel when expressed in a heterologous system? I understand that the authors may not have the expertise to perform such experiments. If so, my suggestion is to remove ACC-4 data. The data on LGC-46 may stand on its own. This would not affect the integrity of the paper."
