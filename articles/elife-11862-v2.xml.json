                    "text": "Whether retrieval still depends on the hippocampus as memories age or relies then on cortical areas remains a major controversy. Despite evidence for a functional segregation between CA1, CA3 and parahippocampal areas, their specific role within this frame is unclear. Especially, the contribution of CA3 is questionable as very remote memories might be too degraded to be used for pattern completion. To identify the specific role of these areas, we imaged brain activity in mice during retrieval of recent, early remote and very remote fear memories by detecting the immediate-early gene <i>Arc</i>. Investigating correlates of the memory trace over an extended period allowed us to report that, in contrast to CA1, CA3 is no longer recruited in very remote retrieval. Conversely, we showed that parahippocampal areas are then maximally engaged. These results suggest a shift from a greater contribution of the trisynaptic loop to the temporoammonic pathway for retrieval."

Despite evidence for a functional segregation between CA1, CA3 and parahippocampal areas, their specific role within this frame is unclear. Especially, the contribution of CA3 is questionable as very remote memories might be too degraded to be used for pattern completion. To identify the specific role of these areas, we imaged brain activity in mice during retrieval of recent, early remote and very remote fear memories by detecting the immediate-early gene <i>Arc</i>. Investigating correlates of the memory trace over an extended period allowed us to report that, in contrast to CA1, CA3 is no longer recruited in very remote retrieval. Conversely, we showed that parahippocampal areas are then maximally engaged. These results suggest a shift from a greater contribution of the trisynaptic loop to the temporoammonic pathway for retrieval."

Some studies showing temporally-graded retrograde amnesia following hippocampal damage in humans have provided evidence that memory becomes hippocampal-independent as it ages and is ultimately \u2018stored\u2019 in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez and Squire, 1994</a>: \u201cthe system consolidation theory\u201d). An alternative theory posits that the hippocampus is not only engaged in retrieving recent memories but that it also supports cortical areas in retrieving more remote memories (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</a>: the \u2018multiple trace theory\u2019). The hippocampal subfields CA1\u2009and CA3\u2009are functionally segregated and quite a few studies have investigated their role in recent memory, for example in the retrieval of contextual fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tanaka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wheeler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Remaud et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Daumas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rampon et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">McHugh and Tonegawa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hunsaker et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goshen et al., 2011</a>; see for reviews: <a href=\"#bib25\">Nakazawa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kesner, 2007</a>). However, it is unclear whether they contribute to a similar extent to the retrieval of more remote memories. A recent lesion study in humans indicates that CA1\u2009participates to the retrieval of early and very remote memories (over 30\u2009years-old) in addition to its well-established role for recent memories (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartsch et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the role of CA3\u2009in the retrieval of remote memory has not been yet studied in humans and has rarely been investigated in animals for memories older than a month, a period of time roughly equivalent to four years in humans based on life expectancy. Hence, very little is known about the extent to which CA3\u2009contributes to the retrieval of remote and very remote memory. Nonetheless, computational studies suggest that CA3\u2009would contribute to retrieving memories, at least recent and early remote memory, via processes involving the completion of memory representations based on partial or degraded features of these representations (the \u2018pattern completion\u2019 theory: <a href=\"#bib33\">Rolls et al., 1997</a>). However, the memory for single features and/or details that could serve as retrieval cues degrades over time (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wiltgen et al., 2010</a>). Hence, it raises the question whether CA3\u2009would\u00a0also contribute to the retrieval of very remote memories or whether its contribution depends on the age of the memory trace."

In addition, we investigated the extent to which the PER, the POR, the LEC and the MEC differentially contribute to the retrieval of these memories. Because performing in-vivo electrophysiology recording simultaneously in six distant brain areas remains a major challenge and using a lesion/inactivation approach in adjacent brain areas in mice was unlikely to yield the spatial resolution necessary to tease apart the specific function of each area, a high-resolution molecular imaging technique (e.g. to the cellular level) was employed. This imaging technique is based on the detection of the expression of the immediate-early gene <i>Arc</i> which has been especially linked to plasticity processes and cognitive demands and has been recently used for mapping cognitive processes in the medial temporal lobe (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guzowski et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nakamura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sauvage et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013G</a>).\u00a0"

This analysis led to the same conclusion as the analysis of the normalized data: shocked animals display significantly higher freezing levels than the no-shock groups at all delays, reflecting a successful memory for the context-footshock association (two-way ANOVA with \u2018shock\u2019 and \u2018delay\u2019 as factors and \u2018% resting time at test\u2019 as dependent variable: shock effect: F(1,30)=275.9, p&lt;0.001; delay effect: F(4,30)=15.147, p&lt;0.001; interaction shock x delay effect: F(4,30)=1.21, p=0.328; all ts&gt;5.25, ps&lt;0.012)."

Statistical analysis of the task-induced <i>Arc</i> expression revealed that, the contribution of CA3\u2009to the retrieval of memory is restricted to that of recent and early remote memory traces (e.g. to up to 1\u2009month-old memories) while it was negligible for very remote memories (6\u2009months- and 1\u2009year-old memory traces; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Indeed, CA3\u2009was no longer engaged for memory retrieval at this time point (F(4,15)=26.73, p&lt;0.001; Tukey posthoc: recent or early remote traces vs very remote traces: all ps&lt;0.028; comparisons to 0: up to 1\u2009month-old traces: ps&lt;0.010, 6\u2009months and 1\u2009year old traces: n.s). Importantly, this was only the case for CA3\u2009as revealed by a significant region by delay interaction and further statistical analysis showing that, in contrast to CA3, CA1\u2009was engaged for all delays and overall more activated than CA3 (CA1\u2009and CA3\u2009comparisons to 0: all ps&lt;0.033; area effect: F(1,30)=62.74, p&lt;0.001; delay effect: F(4,30)=20.15, p&lt;0.001; region by delay interaction effect: F(4,30)=5.84, p=0.001; post-hoc analysis: CA1\u2009vs CA3: all ts&gt;3.89\u2009and ps&lt;0.030\u2009but for 6\u2009months t=2.36, p=0.099\u2009and 1\u2009week n.s; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In addition, within-area analysis showed that activation levels in CA1\u2009were higher one day after conditioning compared to all other delays but comparable between the remaining delays (F(4,15)\u00a0= 9.46, p=0.001; Tukey posthoc: one day higher than any other delay: all ps&lt;0.041\u2009but for 1\u2009month p=0.090; one week to one year: all ps&gt;0.083\u2009but 1\u2009month vs 6\u2009months: p=0.038). Of note, analysis of the task-induced <i>Arc</i> expression with or without normalization yields the same results. This new finding of a time-limited involvement of CA3\u2009for the retrieval of memory was further supported by significant correlations between memory performance and <i>Arc</i> levels in CA3\u2009for recent and early remote memories, which failed to reach significant for very remote memory traces (recent and early remote: R<sup>2</sup>=0.47, p&lt;0.001; very remote: R<sup>2</sup>=0.06, p=0.351; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>) while correlations were significant for CA1\u2009independently to the age of the memory trace (R<sup>2</sup>s.&gt;0.40, ps&lt;0.008; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). The lack of involvement of CA3\u2009in the retrieval of very remote memories was further strengthened by the fact that levels of activation in CA3\u2009did not differ between the memory-impaired and the memory-intact animals that were tested one year after conditioning (intact vs impaired: freezing index: t(6)\u00a0= 4.32, p=0.005, <i>Arc</i> expression: t(6)=1.08, p=0.321, comparison to 0: n.s; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). In a striking contrast and supporting a crucial role of CA1\u2009in the retrieval of very remote memories, CA1\u2009was not recruited in the memory-impaired group as opposed to the memory\u2013intact group (intact vs impaired: t(6)=3.38, p=0.015; comparisons to 0: memory impaired: t(3)=0.08, p=0.936; memory intact: t(3)=6.69, p=0.007; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Of note, these results are unlikely due to an age- related decline specific to CA3\u2009since baseline <i>Arc</i> expression was comparable between and within CA1\u2009and CA3\u2009over time as shown by the absence of significant \u2018area\u2019 x \u2018delay\u2019 interaction, main area effects and posthocs analysis over time failing to reach significance (area effect: (F(1,30)= 2.30; p=0.14), delay effect: F(4,30)=0.77;p=0.55, area by delay interaction effect: (F(4,30)=40;\u00a0p=0.81; posthocs: delay effects: CA1: F(4,20)=\u00a00.63, p=0.65; CA3: F(4,20)=0.52, p=0.72) and because <i>Arc</i> expression elicited by a maximal electroconvulsive shock, a standard positive control for this type of study, does not significantly differ between CA1\u2009and CA3 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nakamura et al., 2013</a>). Thus, these findings suggest that the decline of expression seen in CA3\u2009is specific to the task. These results show for the first time a clear functional segregation of CA3\u2009and CA1\u2009in the retrieval of memory over time, with CA3\u2009contributing only to the retrieval of recent and early remote memories and CA1\u2009being recruited independently of the age of the memory trace."

All parahippocampal areas participated qualitatively to a comparable extent to retrieving memory over time as they were all maximally engaged for the retrieval of the oldest traces. In addition, the PER and the LEC were more recruited than the POR and the MEC specifically for the oldest memory traces (PER vs LEC, PER vs POR, POR vs MEC and LEC vs MEC: delay effects: Fs(4,30)&gt;18.89, ps&lt;0.001; within-area analysis; LEC, PER and POR: all Fs(4,15)&gt;6.69, ps&lt;0.003; tukey posthocs: recent or early remote memories versus very remote memories: all ps&lt;0.006; MEC: all ps&lt;0.047\u2009but for 1\u2009month vs. 1\u2009year: n.s; area effects: PER vs POR and LEC vs MEC: Fs(1,30)&gt;10.91, ps&lt;0.002; comparisons for 6\u2009months and one year: ts(3)&gt;3.77; ps&lt;0.034\u2009while PER vs LEC and POR vs MEC: n.s; interactions effects: PER vs POR and LEC vs MEC: Fs(4,30)&gt;2.78, ps&lt;0.045\u2009while PER vs LEC and POR vs MEC: n.s). In addition, all areas were activated across all delays (comparisons to 0: all ts&gt;3.52, ps&lt;0.039; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A, B</a>) at the exception of the MEC and the POR for recent memories and the PER one week after conditioning (all ts&lt;2.22, ps&gt;0.113). However, this latter result might reflect a slightly larger SEMs for these time points rather than a true functional difference between brain areas since comparisons of activity levels between the LEC and the MEC and between the PER and the POR for the recent memory time points did not yield any significant differences (ts(3)&lt;1.98; ps&gt;0.142). Of note, analysis with or without normalization of the task-induced <i>Arc</i> expression yields the same results. Interestingly, parahippocampal areas of animals showing impaired memory when tested one year after conditioning were also significantly activated (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), albeit less than those of animals whose memory was intact (comparisons to 0: memory intact: ts(3)&gt;3.821, ps&lt;0.032; memory impaired: ts(3)&gt;3.929, ps&lt;0.029, except MEC: t(3)=2.65, p=0.077; intact vs. impaired: LEC and PER: ts(6)&gt;5.58, ps&lt;0.001; POR: t(6)= 2.27, p=0.063; MEC: t(6)=1.67, p=0.146). This result might suggest that, in the memory-impaired group, a partial memory representation had been consolidated and stored in the cortical areas, but that a weak activation of these areas alone does not suffice for successful retrieval. Thus, in summary, no qualitative differences were observed in the patterns of activation of the parahippocampal areas over time. However, the PER and LEC, which receive stronger connections from the amygdala than the MEC and the POR, were more activated than the MEC and the POR during the retrieval of the most remote memories (6\u2009months- and one-year old traces), a time point which coincides with the epoch at which cortical areas are thought to play a strong role in the retrieval of memories. This result suggests a segregation of the parahippocampal areas in terms of memory processes rather than in terms of spatial or non-spatial information processing at this time point. In addition, these results further underline the critical role of CA1\u2009in the retrieval of very remote memories as activation of the parahippocampal areas alone appeared not to be sufficient for a successful retrieval of the memory trace at this time point."

Activity in the hippocampus was higher than that of the parahippocampal region for the retrieval of recent and early remote memories while an inversed relationship emerged for the retrieval of very remote memories (area effect: F(1,30)=9.984; p=0.004; delay effect: F(4,30)=1.539; p=0.216; delay x area interaction effect: F(4,30)=61.629, p&lt;0.001; post-hoc analysis: recent and early remote memory: ts&gt;4.21, ps&lt;0.024; very remote memories: ts&gt;6.07\u2009ps&lt;0.009). Importantly, even under this condition, e.g. when the contribution of CA1\u2009was not dissociated from that of CA3, the hippocampus was significantly recruited independently of the age of the memory trace (comparisons to 0: all ts&gt;3.54\u2009ps&lt;0.038) in line with the multiple trace theory. Furthermore, in this case, the hippocampus appeared to contribute mainly to retrieving recent and early remote memories (F(4,19)=16.21, p&lt;0.001; Tukey posthocs: recent or early remote memories vs very remote memories: all ps&lt;0.024). Conversely, the parahippocampal region was maximally activated for retrieving very remote memories (F(4,19)=52.51, p&lt;0.001; recent or early remote memories vs very remote memories: all ps&lt;0.001) but was also recruited for recent and early remote memories (comparisons to 0: ts(3)&gt;3.79; ps&lt;0.032). In conclusion, this analysis underlines the fact that, if CA1\u2009and CA3\u2019s contribution are not dissociated, the hippocampal contribution to the retrieval of very remote memories might be largely underestimated. Nevertheless, even in this case, the over-time shift from an engagement of the hippocampus to that of an engagement of the parahippocampal region in retrieving memory is only relative and not absolute, given that the hippocampus is still significantly activated even for the retrieval of very remote memories."

In addition, parahippocampal areas were substantially more involved in retrieving very remote memory traces than more recent ones and their activity patterns appeared to reflect memory demands rather than information content."

Thus, the contribution of CA3\u2009to the retrieval of memory traces as old as what is considered to be a remote/very remote memory trace in humans (in the order of decades) is not known. For this reason, we studied 6\u2009months-and one year- old memories traces in mice, which roughly correspond to 20\u2009and 40\u2009year-old memory traces in humans. Doing so enabled us to report for the first time the lack of engagement of CA3\u2009in the retrieval of very remote memories. This time-limited role of CA3\u2009was supported by a lack of recruitment during the retrieval of the most remote memory traces (6\u2009months- and one year-old) while CA3\u2009was strongly activated for recent and early remote memories (up to 1\u2009month-old traces). This result was confirmed by a significant correlation between CA3\u2009activity levels and memory performance during the retrieval of the recent and early remote memories, which did not hold for very remote traces. The approach we have adopted does not allow for the characterization of the specific process by which CA3\u2009fails to aid in retrieving memory. However, since computational studies and studies that have limited their investigations to recent and early remote memory traces have speculated that CA3\u2019s contribution to memory retrieval would increase as memory ages because of an increasing demand on the completion of representations using partial or degraded features of these stored representations (the \u2018pattern completion theory\u2019: <a href=\"#bib33\">Rolls et al., 1997</a>), we speculate that the lack of engagement of CA3\u2009in retrieving very remote memories stems from a failure to \u2018pattern complete\u2019 memory representations. Indeed, by this time, these very old memory representations might have degraded to such an extent that it is impossible to use any specific features as an efficient retrieval cue. This hypothesis would go along with reports demonstrating that details of memory representations are lost as memory ages (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wiltgen and Silva, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wiltgen et al., 2010</a>) and will require further investigations to be tested."

This result is in agreement with the only two studies specifically investigating the role of CA1\u2009in remote memory retrieval. Indeed, transient inhibition of cell firing in CA1\u2009in mice using optogenetics drastically impaired fear memory retrieval, one or twenty eight days after conditioning (<a href=\"#bib13\">Goshen et al., 2011</a>). Likewise, a recent fMRI study in humans showed impairments in autobiographic and episodic memory for traces even older than 30\u2009years-old following focal CA1\u2009lesions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartsch et al., 2011</a>). Our result of a selective involvement of CA1\u2009in the retrieval of very remote memories at this time point is supported by the lack of a recruitment of this area in the memory-impaired group tested one year after conditioning as opposed to a strong activation in the memory intact group and the fact that CA3\u2009was not recruited in either group (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Importantly, using a high resolution molecular imaging technique, we bring the first evidence that the persistent engagement of the hippocampus in memory retrieval does not involve CA3. This result, in turn, suggest that hippocampal patterns of activation observed in previous human fMRI studies investigating the retrieval of very remote memory, might essentially be driven by CA1, but could not be specifically identified as such because of the limited spatial resolution of standard fMRI techniques (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ryan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rekkas and Constable, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bonnici et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, the fact that only CA1\u2009is activated for these late time points suggests a preferential involvement of the temporoammonic pathway over that of the trisynaptic loop for the retrieval of very remote memories. Robust evidence for this hypothesis is not yet available for very remote memories, but lesions of the temporoammonic pathway in rats specifically impaired early remote memory (28\u2009days-old) in rats tested in a Morris watermaze task, while recent memory (one day-old) was spared. This result suggests that direct entorhinal cortex inputs to CA1\u2009contribute to the retrieval of early remote memory, possibly by further consolidating memories that were not consolidated after 28\u2009days (<a href=\"#bib32\">Remondes and Schuman, 2004</a>). In the present study, because we investigated a much larger time-window and found that CA1\u2009was still activated in addition to the parahippocampal cortical areas, but not CA3, we speculate that the temporoammonic pathway is not only important for the consolidation of memories but also for the retrieval of already consolidated memories."

The hypothesis of a functional segregation of the parahippocampal region between a 'PER-LEC stream' and a 'POR-MEC stream' is essentially based on studies investigating the role of the PER during the retrieval of recent memory, while much fewer have addressed the specific role of the POR, the LEC and the MEC within this frame and during the retrieval of early remote memories. In addition, no study has yet investigated their contribution for very remote memories, despite the belief that the contribution of cortical areas to memory retrieval would be the largest for the most remote memories. Our results for recent and early remote time-points match published data according to which, for example, the PER and the POR are recruited to a similar extent for contextual fear conditioning and the LEC and MEC contribute to a similar extent to memory retrieval (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bucci et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burwell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Izquierdo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goshen et al., 2011</a>). In addition, we show for the first time that the contribution of the PER, the POR, the LEC and the MEC is indeed the largest for the retrieval of very remote memories. Patterns of activation were comparable between the LEC and the PER and between the MEC and the POR. Interestingly though, LEC and PER were more activated than the MEC and the POR during the retrieval of very remote memory traces. This result appears to rather reflect the type of memory process the areas were engaged into (fear conditioning) rather than the content of information processed (contextual information), supporting a view that has recently emerged from the literature (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eichenbaum et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beer et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, the amygdala which plays a crucial role in fear conditioning, sends stronger projections to the PER/LEC than to the MEC/POR (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pitk\u00e4nen et al., 2000</a>) and higher activity levels in the POR and MEC than in the PER and LEC would have been expected if information content was primarily reflected in the pattern of activation observed. Altogether, our data show a preferential role of the parahippocampal region for the retrieval of very remote memories as opposed to that of early remote and recent memories, matching the pattern commonly reported for the prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib11\">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</a>)."

These results are consistent with the view that at least the hippocampal subfield CA1\u2009is involved in retrieving memory independently of the age of memory trace, possibly by providing support to cortical areas that include the parahippocampal areas. Of note, averaging activity levels of the hippocampal areas on the one hand and those of the parahippocampal areas on the other hand revealed that both the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region were activated independently of the age of the memory trace (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Hence, the gradual \u201ctransfer\u201d of the memory trace from the hippocampus to the cortex is unlikely to be an all-or-nothing phenomenon, but seems to go along with a shift in the relative contribution of the two regions as the memory trace ages, and possibly a shift in the contribution of the networks they belong to. More specifically, our results suggest that the trisynaptic loop could play a preponderant role in retrieving early memories as reflected by an involvement of CA3, CA1\u2009and the parahippocampal areas at this stage, while the retrieval of very remote memories would require an heavier contribution of the temporoamonic pathway as indicated by the lack of recruitment of CA3\u2009and a strong activation of CA1\u2009and the parahippocampal areas."

To test whether the fear conditioned response observed in shocked animals was specific to the context in which they were conditioned, two additional groups of mice (n=4\u2009each; n=8\u2009total) were conditioned in the usual conditioning box and later tested in a completely novel context differing in olfactory, tactile and visual cues (lightening, texture of the floor and background noise) instead of the original conditioning arena.

Conditioned suppression of activity, e.g. relative resting time or freezing index, was taken as indicator of fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sauvage et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Rammes et al., 2000</a>). Because the baseline resting time of the \u2018shock\u2019 one-year group (one of the ten groups studied) was slightly lower (or trending to be) than that of the other shock groups (F(4,15)=3.37, p=0.037; post-hoc Tukey: 1\u2009year vs. 1\u2009day p=0.041; vs. 1\u2009month or 6\u2009months (p=0.079\u2009and 0.071, respectively) and because a similar pattern was found at test, focusing solely on the% resting time at test could have led to a misinterpretation of the test data since the lower freezing index at test is carried by a lower baseline at conditioning. Hence, freezing levels discussed in the manuscript have been normalized by the conditioning baseline for each group: the freezing index was calculated by normalizing the resting time during the first 2.5\u2009min of test by the baseline resting time during the first 2.5\u2009min of conditioning: freezing index= ([test resting time- baseline resting time]/baseline resting time)*100. Also, to focus as much as possible on the conditioning suppression activity related to the context-footshock association (and not that contributed by other parameters), differences in freezing indices between the \u2018shock\u2019 and \u2018no-shock\u2019 groups are represented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. These were calculated by subtracting the freezing indices of the \u2018no-shock\u2019 groups from that of their age-matched \u2018shock\u2019 controls. Importantly, statistical analysis of the data with or without baseline or \u2018no-shock\u2019 normalizations (e.g.% resting time at test) yield similar results. Finally, as predicted by pilot experiments and suggested by studies in humans (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lindenberger, 2014</a>), about half of the one-year \u2018shock\u2019 group showed poor memory performance: freezing levels of half of the one-year \u2018shock\u2019 group (n=4) were quite low (24.76 \u00b1 2.2% in average as opposed to 62.85 \u00b1 5.4% for the other half of the group). This group is referred to as \u2018memory-impaired\u2019 group in the manuscript and their performance underwent a separate analysis (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>)."

Animals were sacrificed by decapitation immediately after the test session. Brains were removed, flash frozen with iso-pentane and stored at -80\u00b0C. Frozen brains were sectioned into 8\u2009\u0265m thick sections with a cryostat (Leica CM 3050\u2009S) and mounted on Polylysine slides (Thermo Scientific), which were stored at -80\u00b0C. T. Kitsukawa (Osaka University, Japan) provided the plasmid for generating <i>Arc</i> antisense and sense RNA probes. The plasmid contained a ~1.2\u00a0kbp <i>Arc</i> transcript including intron regions. A digoxigenin-labeled UTP kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used to synthesize <i>Arc</i> pre mRNA probes. A FISH protocol adapted from <a href=\"#bib15\">Guzowski et al. (1999)</a> was used. Briefly, brain sections were fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and rinsed with 0.1\u00a0M PBS. After treatment with an acetic anhydride/triethanolamine/hydrochloric acid mix they were rinsed again and soaked with a prehybridization buffer. The slides were then hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled antisense <i>Arc</i> intron-enriched riboprobe overnight at +65\u00b0C. After rinses with SSC buffer solutions, the slides were treated with an anti-digoxigenin-horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The signal was amplified using a cyanine-5\u2009substrate kit (CY5, TSA-Plus system, Perkin Elmer). Nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2019, 6\u2019-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). As a control for probe specificity, extra slides were hybridized without probes or with <i>Arc</i> antisense probes. There was no <i>Arc</i> labeling detectable in those slides."

Six images from these nonadjacent sections were acquired for each area of interest and covered ~900\u00a0\u0265m. A Keyence Fluorescence Microscope (BZ-9000E; Japan) was used to capture images. The images had 1360x1024\u2009pixels (362\u2009x 272\u00a0\u0265m\u00b2) and were taken with a 40x objective (z-stacks of 0.7\u00a0\u0265m thick pictures). Images were taken with constant exposure time, light intensity and contrasts optimized for the appearance of intranuclear labeling as described in <a href=\"#bib39\">Vazdarjanova and Guzowski (2004)</a>. To account for stereological considerations, counting was performed on 8\u00a0\u0265m thick nonadjacent sections that contained one layer of cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">West, 1999</a>). Cells were counted in a double-blind manner with the experimenter being unaware of the hypothesis tested. Cells were counted as <i>Arc</i> positive when one or two characteristic red dots were visible in the DAPI labeled nucleus. Cells without these dots were counted as negative. The percentage of <i>Arc</i> positive cells was calculated as: number of <i>Arc</i> positive cells/(number of <i>Arc</i> positive cells + number of <i>Arc</i> negative cells) x\u00a0100. \u201cTask-induced <i>Arc</i> expression\u201d was calculated for each MTL area by subtracting <i>Arc</i> expression found in no-shock controls from the <i>Arc</i> expression found in animals that had received a shock during conditioning. Because all experimental conditions were kept identical and only the delay between conditioning and test differed, comparisons of task-induced <i>Arc</i> expression are thought to reflect differences in fear memory retrieval that dependent upon the age of the memory trace."

While this idea has reached textbook status, it is not without controversy/complexities. For example, in rodent studies, the hippocampal dependency at remote time points may depend upon memory quality (e.g., Wiltgen studies). Moreover, in some cases there is evidence that the hippocampus never really becomes 'unimportant' (e.g., Sutherland studies). Using a molecular imaging approach to examine patterns of activation following recall of a contextual fear memory (imaging for <i>Arc</i> mRNA as an indicator of recently activated neurons), the current paper addresses this now classic question, but with 2 important twists. First, the authors pay attention to hippocampal subdivisions (and do not consider the hippocampus as a whole) and, second, they use very remote time-points to probe memory organization (i.e., 6 months to a year instead of the standard one month 'remote' time-point). Both these novel aspects of the design, I believe, have the potential to offer new insights."

In order to support a claim of a dissociation here it would be necessary to show a significant interaction between regions (CA1 va CA3) and forgetting rate. As it is, it\u2019s just that at the longer delays CA3 activity is not significantly above threshold whereas CA1 activity is. Given CA1 was always showing a larger memory effect it is perhaps not too surprising. I think the other dissociation is very interesting, so the results will be of considerable interest to many researchers, however I think that the discussion of the CA1 \u2013 CA3 dissociation needs to be toned down (unless the interaction is significant)."

This way, on the one hand, activity levels in groups with comparable accuracy were compared over time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and on the other hand, activity levels in mice with impaired or intact memory after one year were compared (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Importantly, the latter comparison gave further support to our main finding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>): that CA1 is crucial for the retrieval of very remote memory but not CA3, since activity differed only in CA1 between memory-impaired and memory- intact mice. In other words, the interpretation of the 1-year time point would have been muddied only if the memory- intact and memory-impaired animals would not have been analyzed separately as the memory strength of the memory-impaired mice is significantly lower than that of the memory-intact mice (and that of the mice at all other delays)."

Also of importance, correlation analysis is rarely performed in this type of study principally due to the low statistical power linked to a low sample size because of the strenuous character of the studies (Guzowski et al., Nature Neuroscience, 1999; Vazdarjanova et al., J Neuroscience, 2000; Guzowski et al., PNAS, 2006). However, in a recent study of the leader in the field (C. Barnes), correlation analyses between imaging results and behavioral indices of controls and experimental animals were performed in a similar manner as we did ((Hartzell et al., J. of Neurosc., 2013).

However, the apparent dissociation between CA1 and CA3 is not nearly as compelling. It seems to me that both regions are involved in retrieval and they both decrease across delays, it\u2019s just that CA3 starts off lower and so it approaches nonsignificance earlier. In order to support a claim of a dissociation here it would be necessary to show a significant interaction between regions (CA1 va CA3) and forgetting rate. As it is, it\u2019s just that at the longer delays CA3 activity is not significantly above threshold whereas CA1 activity is. Given CA1 was always showing a larger memory effect it is perhaps not too surprising. I think the other dissociation is very interesting, so the results will be of considerable interest to many researchers, however I think that the discussion of the CA1</i> \u2013"
