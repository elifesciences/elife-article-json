Most of its inhibitory effects are mediated by signaling from GABAB receptor to the G protein-gated Inwardly-rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. Here, we show that RGS7, in cooperation with its binding partner R7BP, regulates GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Deletion of RGS7 in mice dramatically sensitizes GIRK responses to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation and markedly slows channel deactivation kinetics. Enhanced activity of this signaling pathway leads to decreased neuronal excitability and selective disruption of inhibitory forms of synaptic plasticity. As a result, mice lacking RGS7 exhibit deficits in learning and memory. We further report that RGS7 is selectively modulated by its membrane anchoring subunit R7BP, which sets the dynamic range of GIRK responses. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role of RGS7 in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation."

Most of its inhibitory effects are mediated by signaling from GABAB receptor to the G protein-gated Inwardly-rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels. Here, we show that RGS7, in cooperation with its binding partner R7BP, regulates GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Deletion of RGS7 in mice dramatically sensitizes GIRK responses to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor stimulation and markedly slows channel deactivation kinetics. Enhanced activity of this signaling pathway leads to decreased neuronal excitability and selective disruption of inhibitory forms of synaptic plasticity. As a result, mice lacking RGS7 exhibit deficits in learning and memory. We further report that RGS7 is selectively modulated by its membrane anchoring subunit R7BP, which sets the dynamic range of GIRK responses. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role of RGS7 in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory formation."

Some neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, activate cells when they bind to receptors, thus making it easier for the second neuron to \u2018fire\u2019 (i.e., to generate an action potential). By contrast, other neurotransmitters, such as GABA, usually make it harder for the second neuron to fire."

Furthermore, we previously reported that knockout of <i>R7bp</i> resulted in a reduction of the total membrane-bound RGS7 protein in hippocampal tissue (<a href=\"#bib46\">Panicker et al., 2010</a>). To analyze the effect of R7BP on RGS7 localization in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we performed high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. Consistent with the earlier findings, immunoparticles for RGS7 were abundant on the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of dendritic spines and dendritic shafts of pyramidal cells, as well as at intracellular sites (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fajardo-Serrano et al., 2013</a>). In the hippocampus of <i>R7bp</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> animals, immunoparticles for RGS7 were distributed similarly to the wild-type, but they were more frequently observed just beneath the plasma membrane and more broadly distributed in somata (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Indeed, quantitative analysis indicated that in <i>R7bp</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, RGS7 was less frequently detected in the plasma membrane and tended to accumulate within 100 nm of the plasma membrane.

Furthermore, there were no significant differences between wild-type mice and mutant mice in amygdala-dependent cue recognition."

In hippocampal neurons, RGS7 is closely co-localized with both GABA<sub>B</sub>R and GIRK2-containing channels (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fajardo-Serrano et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, in transfected cells, RGS7 can directly interact with GIRK channel subunits as demonstrated by both co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence energy transfer approaches (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>).

Knockout of G\u03b25 greatly slows GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK response deactivation rates and dramatically increases agonist sensitivity of the signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xie et al., 2010</a>). In addition to mediating interactions with the channel, G\u03b25 is essential for the expression of all four R7 RGS proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2003</a>). With several R7 RGS proteins expressed in hippocampus, the identity of the exact isoform that participates in GIRK channel regulation in the region, through complex formation with G\u03b25, remained unknown. The elimination of RGS7, reported in this study, largely phenocopies the loss of G\u03b25, both in terms of kinetics and agonist sensitivity. This argues that in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, GIRK signaling is regulated by RGS7 and not by other R7 RGS proteins. Indeed, while RGS6 regulates GIRK signaling in cerebellar neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Maity et al., 2012</a>) and sinoatrial pacemaking cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Posokhova et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yang et al., 2010</a>), RGS6 ablation had no effect on any GIRK response parameters in hippocampal pyramidal neurons."

Consistent with these observations, we show that knockout of R7BP reduces plasma membrane localization of RGS7 and slows GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK current deactivation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Our results also agree well with a recent study reporting similar deceleration of GIRK deactivation kinetics in <i>R7bp</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). However, the consequences of RGS7 and R7BP elimination are different in two important ways. First, relative to the loss of RGS7 or G\u03b25, elimination of R7BP had a very modest effect on GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK deactivation kinetics, and was seen only at high GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonist concentrations. This suggests that the RGS7/G\u03b25 complex can regulate GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling without R7BP. Secondly, loss of R7BP and RGS7 has different effects on GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK coupling sensitivity. While elimination of RGS7 (or G\u03b25) results in a parallel leftward shift in the concentration-response relationship, the concentration-response measured in <i>R7bp</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> neurons shows markedly greater cooperativity. Thus, at low levels of GABA<sub>B</sub>R stimulation, R7BP is dispensable and its elimination fails to affect response amplitude. As the response reaches saturation, R7BP becomes indispensable and its elimination has the same effect on response amplitude as loss of RGS7. These observations are inconsistent with the proposed role for R7BP as a critical factor in the assembly of RGS7-GIRK complexes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>), which postulates the equivalence of R7BP effects across agonist concentrations and a similar impact of R7BP and RGS7 elimination on GIRK channel kinetics, and certainly not an increase in cooperativity of GIRK channel activation."

In this model, at low levels of GIRK activation, when released G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits do not saturate the GIRK channel, deactivation kinetics are primarily mediated by RGS7/G\u03b25 directly associated with the GIRK subunits. Under these conditions, there are virtually no genotype-dependent differences in the lag time of GIRK deactivation upon agonist removal. With higher agonist concentrations, as GABA<sub>B</sub>R produces more G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits, the amount of available free G\u03b2\u03b3 exceeds that of activatable GIRK channels, evidenced by a delay that precedes GIRK current deactivation upon agonist removal. Under these conditions, R7BP elimination affects response sensitivity as much as elimination of RGS7. While response deactivation kinetics reflect G\u03b2\u03b3 inactivation after it had a chance to interact with the channel, response sensitivity likely relates to the efficiency of the G\u03b2\u03b3 reaching the GIRK channel. Considering that R7BP affects both of these parameters only when free G\u03b2\u03b3 is produced in excess, we think that the RGS7/G\u03b25 complex exists in two states: (1) anchored to the GIRK complex where it affects deactivation kinetics, and (2) anchored via R7BP to the plasma membrane outside of GIRK complex where it primarily determines response sensitivity."

On an intuitive level, this may reflect larger proportion of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits that reach GIRK while being deactivated in its vicinity by RGS7/G\u03b25. In contrast, complexes of RGS7/G\u03b25 with R7BP may predominantly act elsewhere on the plasma membrane, thereby decreasing the number of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits capable of reaching the channel. By physically binding to the GIRK channel, RGS7/G\u03b25 may further act to promote productive interactions of G\u03b2\u03b3 (and/or G\u03b1) with the channel, thus increasing cooperativity of its activation. This model is also consistent with the observed decrease in RGS7 on the plasma membrane but largely preserved localization at specific postsynaptic sites where it might be anchored via complex formation with GIRK channels. Thus, the main role of R7BP appears to be in tuning the sensitivity of the response by endowing RGS7/G\u03b25 complexes with an ability to deactivate G proteins before they reach the GIRK channel."

As a result, knockout of individual RGS genes in mice is frequently associated with augmented GPCR signaling. This makes the analysis of changes in sensitivity of behavioral or cellular reactions to neurotransmitter actions associated with elimination of individual RGS proteins a powerful strategy that allows for establishing physiological receptor-RGS pairings. Using this strategy, two RGS proteins have been previously implicated in controlling GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in vivo: RGS6 in cerebellar neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Maity et al., 2012</a>) and RGS2 in the ventral tegmental area (<a href=\"#bib31\">Labouebe et al., 2007</a>).

These observations complement earlier findings with RGS14, the only other RGS protein implicated in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial learning (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2010</a>).

Recent models propose that all three forms cooperate to affect distinct aspects of spatial information storage (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2007</a>). In relevance to this thinking, we found a selective disruption of LTD and depotentiation in <i>RGS7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, but normal LTP. There is a mounting evidence suggesting an active and selective role of LTD in object recognition and creation of spatial representation of memory (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2007</a>). For example, LTD but not LTP was found to be important for spatial memory consolidation and memory enhancement for novelty acquisition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with this, electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals show facilitation of LTD during novelty exploration (<a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Manahan-Vaughan and Braunewell, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2012</a>). Disruption of LTD via genetic mutations often results in memory deficits, particularly affecting behavioral flexibility (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nicholls et al., 2008</a>), while LTD enhancement can lead to improvement in spatial reversal learning (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duffy et al., 2008</a>). In particular, our findings resemble the phenotype of SRF<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice, which exhibited a selective disruption of LTD in hippocampal CA1 neurons paralleled by an inability to learn hippocampus-dependent tasks (<a href=\"#bib18\">Etkin et al., 2006</a>). While specific knowledge on how depotentiation contributes to memory is still lacking, it has been observed that exposure to novel environment and spatial exploration depotentiates previously-induced LTP (<a href=\"#bib57\">Xu et al., 1998</a>). Together, our observations in mice lacking RGS7 reinforce the idea that normal inhibitory synaptic plasticity (LTD and depotentiation) is required for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory."

However, in the case of <i>Rgs7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, this augmentation resulted in yet another distinct phenotype: selective deficits in LTD and depotentiation, with normal LTP. Several lines of evidence argue that these changes in synaptic plasticity are driven by a postsynaptic mechanism whereby RGS7 controls inhibitory GIRK-dependent signaling in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. First, CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking RGS7 are hyperpolarized and less excitable relative to wild-type neurons, a property that is significantly shaped by the GIRK channels. Second, basal excitatory transmission is unaltered in <i>Rgs7</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> slices. Third, direct measurements of events that reflect excitatory presynaptic function (e.g., FV and PPR) reveal no changes caused by the elimination of RGS7. Given these observations, we propose that GIRK signaling sets the general excitability of postsynaptic pyramidal neurons, which in turn determines a sliding scale window for the induction of different forms of synaptic plasticity. By adjusting signaling strength in the hippocampal GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK pathway, the RGS7/G\u03b25/R7BP complex influences the range of neuronal responses necessary for memory formation. While dysregulation of GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in hippocampus may be sufficient for explaining the effects of RGS7 on learning an memory, at this point we cannot rule out a contribution of other brain regions and/or signaling pathways in the process. In any event, we believe that the results of this study establish RGS7 complex as an important molecule for understanding and/or correcting the pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with disruptions in synaptic plasticity and imbalances in inhibitory signaling."

We estimated the quality of immunolabelling by always selecting areas with optimal gold labelling at approximately the same distance from the cutting surface. Randomly selected areas were then photographed from the selected ultrathin sections and printed with a final magnification of 45 000X. Quantification of immunogold labelling was carried out in reference areas totalling approx. 1,800 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> for each age. Immunoparticles identified in each reference area and present in different subcellular compartments (dendritic spines, dendritic shafts and somata) were counted.

Briefly, GABA<sub>B1</sub>R, GABA<sub>B2</sub>R, G\u03b1oA, Venus156-239-G\u03b21, and Venus1-155-G\u03b32 constructs were transfected into HEK293T/17 cells at a 1:1:2:1:1 ratio with increasing masGRK3ct-Nluc from 0.125 to 6 in ratio. 5 \u00b5g total DNA was delivered per 4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells in a 6-cm-dish. 16\u201324 hr post transfection cells were stimulated with 100 \u00b5M GABA followed by treatment with 100 \u00b5M CGP 54626. The BRET signal is determined by calculating the ration of the light emitted by the Venus-G\u03b21\u03b32 (535 nm) over the light emitted by the masGRKct-Rluc8 (475 nm). The average baseline value recorded prior to agonist stimulation was subtracted from BRET signal values, and the resulting difference (\u0394BRET) was obtained."

Deletion of <i>Rgs7</i> in mice sensitizes GIRK responses to GABAB receptor agonist and slows channel deactivation kinetics. CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking <i>Rgs7</i> are thus more hyperpolarized and less excitable. Interestingly, GIRK onset kinetics (but not deactivation rates) were affected by <i>Rgs7</i> ablation only at low agonist concentrations while <i>R7bp</i> ablation significantly affected deactivation kinetics only at higher agonist concentrations. Basal excitatory transmission and excitatory presynaptic function (inferred from FV and PPR) are not changed in <i>Rgs7</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice. Loss of R7bp results in ineffective targeting, and consequent decrease Rgs7 function. The authors propose that Rgs7/G\u03b25/R7bp adjusts signaling strength in the hippocampal GABAB-GIRK pathway. This disrupts LTD and depotentiation, and this somehow interferes with associative learning and formation of contextual memory."

To reach this conclusion, we examined the phenotype of mice lacking G\u03b25, a subunit of the complexes that could involve four different RGS proteins in the R7 RGS subfamily: RGS6, RGS7, RGS9 or RGS11. We performed analysis of GIRK kinetics in primary hippocampal cultures, recorded evoked sIPSCs in hippocampal slices, and examined the pharmacological sensitivity of mice lacking G\u03b25 to baclofen. The identity of the RGS protein within the G\u03b25 complex that mediates regulation of hippocampal GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling remained unknown. Further unknown was whether another subunit of the complex, R7BP, was involved in GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling regulation. Finally, the relevance of observed alterations in GIRK channel function to the physiology of the intact hippocampal circuit and synaptic plasticity has not been explored. The current study fills these gaps by identifying RGS7 to be the main RGS isoform in the G\u03b25-RGS complexes that regulate GABA<sub>B</sub>R-GIRK signaling in the hippocampus, by establishing the role of R7BP subunit in this regulation, and by demonstrating that these complexes play a key role in synaptic plasticity and memory. We have further clarified the distinction between our prior and this current study in the Introduction and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript."

In fact, slowing the activation phase has repeatedly been shown to be related to deceleration of GTP hydrolysis rates in the absence of RGS proteins. However, from the channel perspective, upon agonist application, the steady-state of the G protein cycle is shifted tremendously towards favoring channel opening with no appreciable channel inactivation, which becomes prominent only when the agonist is removed. Indeed, our additional analysis reveals no significant genotype differences in current inactivation during baclofen application (desensitization). In our mind, this allows a rather uncomplicated analysis of the rising phases that do not seem to be contaminated much by channel inactivation. We agree with the reviewers\u2019 point, however, that analysis of the activation kinetics may not allow us to conclude much and we further qualified this in the revised manuscript. We did not put much of an emphasis on analysis of activation kinetics. Instead, our model mostly relies on sensitivity (steady-state currents) and the response deactivation, which directly correlates with the GTPase activity of the G proteins, and as a result is much more interpretable."

To the best of our knowledge, the present study for the first time reports an analysis of changes in the lag time induced by the loss of RGS protein complex components. To obtain independent evidence that this lag is related to changes in G\u03b2\u03b3 stoichiometry relative to the effector (e.g., the GIRK channel), we modeled changes in G\u03b2\u03b3 to effector ratios in a reconstituted system using a BRET-based reporter assay. The results of these experiments are entirely consistent with electrophysiological recordings of GIRK channel kinetics in the native system and show increase in response deactivation lag time upon an increase in G\u03b2\u03b3 stoichiometry over an effector. These results are now reported in the revised version of the manuscript (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The \u201chook\u201d mentioned by the reviewer is a recording artifact that sometimes affects responses upon fast solution change in our perfusion setup. It randomly affects cells regardless of their genotype. In the revised manuscript, we substituted the traces that showed a prominent \u201chook\u201d with cleaner traces."

As already discussed in the paper, and entirely consistent with biochemical characterization, the total loss of RGS7 (that also leads to reduction of associated R7BP) results in the biggest EC<sub>50</sub> change \u2013 from 1.48-2.14 \u03bcM for wild-type to 0.35- 0.58 \u03bcM for <i>RGS7</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup>. However, knockout of R7BP, which affects RGS7 in subtler way (via membrane localization and activity regulation) also results in a significant EC<sub>50</sub> reduction (to 0.65-0.81 \u03bcM for <i>R7BP</i><sub><i>-/-</i></sub>; 95 % CI). We feel that the extent of the collected data and insufficient quantitative knowledge of the key parameters for protein/protein interactions in the GABA<sub>B</sub>R- GIRK signaling cascade significantly limits our ability to build an accurate model with a significant predictive value without doing substantially more work. On an intuitive level, however, we think that the observed increase in the cooperativity of GIRK channel activation upon R7BP loss may reflect larger proportion of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits that reach an effector (GIRK) while being deactivated in its vicinity by RGS7/G\u03b25 bound to the channel. By physically binding to GIRK channel RGS7 alone, but not its complex with R7BP, may further act to promote productive interactions of G\u03b2\u03b3 (and/or G\u03b1) with the GIRK channel, thus increasing cooperativity of its activation. We have discussed these possibilities in the revised manuscript."
