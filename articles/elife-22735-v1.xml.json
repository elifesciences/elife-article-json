If too many of the connections between the neurons are excitatory, the network becomes hyperactive, driven by feedback from neuron to neuron. But if too many of the connections are inhibitory, the network goes silent, save for a few blips of activity, mercilessly crushed by inhibition. So how do real neuronal networks stay in the Goldilocks zone between too quiet and too loud? How do they maintain stable activity yet remain sensitive to new inputs?"

Another clue comes from the balanced network model: according to this model the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to cortical neurons cancel on average, so the neurons can maintain stable, irregular activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Renart et al., 2010</a>; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>).

In this \"mean-driven\" model the membrane voltage spends much of its time at or near the spiking threshold (see histogram on right), and spiking is driven by the difference between the means of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs. However, most neurons do not spike as rapidly or regularly as predicted by the \"mean-driven\" model. (<b>B</b>) The theory of balanced networks proposes that the inhibitory and excitatory inputs to a neuron have approximately the same mean and the same variance. Consequently, spiking\u00a0is driven by random fluctuations in the inputs, when the excitatory input briefly exceeds the inhibitory input. A signature of this \u201cfluctuation-driven\u201d regime is that the distribution of the membrane voltage is approximately Gaussian (histogram). Fluctuation-driven neurons spike slowly and irregularly, similar to the majority of the neurons in the cortex. (<b>C</b>) The relationship between the input to a neuron (blue curve below the x-axis) and its spiking or firing rate (blue curve to the left of the y-axis) is described by a firing rate versus input (<i>f\u2013i</i>) curve. In 2011 Roxin et al. predicted that an expansive <i>f\u2013i</i> curve (see main text) would convert a Gaussian input into a long-tailed distribution of firing rates in the fluctuation-driven regime. Moreover, according to this theory, if each neuron has a Gaussian input, then the overall population of neurons will also have a Gaussian input, and if each neuron has an expansive <i>f\u2013i</i> curve in the fluctuation-driven regime, then the output of the population will be long-tailed."

They also identified neurons that existed in the \"mean-driven\" regime (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>): in these neurons the membrane voltages moved from low values to high values rapidly and directly following each spike.

And by working in the spinal cord networks of the turtle, they were able to show that all these properties exist during ongoing behaviour, and not just during spontaneous neuronal activity. Moreover, they remind us there is nothing privileged about the dynamics of cortical circuits, or the dynamics of neuronal circuits in mammals."

Like many behaviours, scratching is a rhythmic action, driven by repeated bursts of spikes. Petersen and Berg focused on the spikes within bursts, but there is silence between bursts. This silence means there must be two timescales for the control of neural activity in the spinal network. Spikes within the bursts arise from fast changes to a neuron's inputs, whether in the fluctuation-driven regime or the mean-driven regime. And the silence between bursts means that the network is able to slowly switch in and out of the driven regimes; that is, it can periodically turn its balanced state on and then off. Clearly we have just started to unpack how neuronal networks control their own activity."
