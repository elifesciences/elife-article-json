Here we examined how optogenetically-identified dopamine neurons in the lateral ventral tegmental area of mice respond to aversive events in different conditions. In low reward contexts, most dopamine neurons were exclusively inhibited by aversive events, and expectation reduced dopamine neurons\u2019 responses to reward and punishment. When a single odor predicted both reward and punishment, dopamine neurons\u2019 responses to that odor reflected the integrated value of both outcomes. Thus, in low reward contexts, dopamine neurons signal value prediction errors (VPEs) integrating information about both reward and aversion in a common currency. In contrast, in high reward contexts, dopamine neurons acquired a short-latency excitation to aversive events that masked their VPE signaling. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the contexts to examine the representation in dopamine neurons and uncover different modes of dopamine signaling, each of which may be adaptive for different environments."

Here we examined how optogenetically-identified dopamine neurons in the lateral ventral tegmental area of mice respond to aversive events in different conditions. In low reward contexts, most dopamine neurons were exclusively inhibited by aversive events, and expectation reduced dopamine neurons\u2019 responses to reward and punishment. When a single odor predicted both reward and punishment, dopamine neurons\u2019 responses to that odor reflected the integrated value of both outcomes. Thus, in low reward contexts, dopamine neurons signal value prediction errors (VPEs) integrating information about both reward and aversion in a common currency. In contrast, in high reward contexts, dopamine neurons acquired a short-latency excitation to aversive events that masked their VPE signaling. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the contexts to examine the representation in dopamine neurons and uncover different modes of dopamine signaling, each of which may be adaptive for different environments."

It has been proposed that dopamine neurons act as a teaching signal in the brain by signaling the discrepancy between the values of actual and predicted rewards, that is, reward prediction error (RPE) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hart et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Roesch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schultz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>).

This work demonstrated that dopamine neurons in the midbrain of monkeys exhibit a highly specific set of responses to reward (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1994</a>). When the animal receives reward unexpectedly, dopamine neurons fire a burst of action potentials. If a sensory cue reliably predicts reward, however, dopamine neurons decrease their response to reward, and instead burst to the cue. Finally, if an expected reward is omitted, dopamine neurons pause their firing at the time they usually receive reward (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>). Subsequently, the idea of RPE coding by dopamine neurons has been substantiated by further experiments in a variety of species including monkeys (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Waelti et al., 2001</a>), rats (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flagel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Roesch et al., 2007</a>), mice (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Eshel et al., 2015</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib10\">D'Ardenne et al., 2008</a>).

However, a number of electrophysiological recording studies have reported that dopamine neurons are activated by aversive stimuli both in anesthetized (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brischoux et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Coizet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schultz and Romo, 1987</a>) and awake animals (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guarraci and Kapp, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Joshua et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>), although the proportions and locations of aversion-activated neurons differed among these studies. The differences in the results between these studies could be due to the heterogeneity of dopamine neurons or to differences in experimental conditions (e.g. type of aversive stimuli; type of anesthesia). Furthermore, another study using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry found that dopamine neurons are excited during successful avoidance of aversive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oleson et al., 2012</a>), which could be 'rewarding'. Therefore, some of the excitatory responses to aversive stimuli may not be due to aversiveness alone."

(2008)</a> monitored dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens using cyclic voltammetry while the animal received intra-oral administrations of a sucrose or quinine solution (<a href=\"#bib45\">Roitman et al., 2008</a>). This study found that these stimuli caused opposite responses: dopamine release was increased by sucrose and decreased by quinine (<a href=\"#bib33\">McCutcheon et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that at least the majority of dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens are inhibited by aversive stimuli. <a href=\"#bib31\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka (2009)</a> examined the diversity of dopamine neurons in context of prediction error. They showed that dopamine neurons that are activated by the prediction of aversive stimuli are located in the lateral part of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), supporting the notion that dopamine subpopulations are spatially segregated (<a href=\"#bib31\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>). Consistent with this finding, <a href=\"#bib29\">Lerner et al. (2015)</a> showed, using calcium imaging with fiber photometry, that SNc neurons projecting to the dorsolateral striatum are activated by aversive stimuli (electric shock) whereas those projecting to the dorsomedial striatum are inhibited (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lerner et al., 2015</a>). <a href=\"#bib27\">Lammel et al. (2011)</a> provided further evidence for spatial heterogeneity by showing that dopamine neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex, located in the\u00a0medial ventral tegmental area (VTA) exhibited a form of synaptic plasticity (AMPA/NMDA ratio) in response to aversive stimuli (formalin injection) whereas dopamine neurons projecting to the dorsolateral striatum did not (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lammel et al., 2011</a>) although how these neurons change their firing patterns in response to aversive stimuli remains unknown."

One argument is that the\u00a0excitation of dopamine neurons caused by aversive stimuli may be due to a 'generalization' or 'spill-over' effect of rewarding stimuli. Specifically, <a href=\"#bib37\">Mirenowicz and Schultz (1996)</a> showed that when rewarding and aversive stimuli are predicted by similar cues (e.g. in a same sensory modality), aversion-predicting cues increase their tendency to activate dopamine neurons ('generalization') (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996</a>). <a href=\"#bib24\">Kobayashi and Schultz (2014)</a> showed that in a high-reward context, cues that predict a neutral outcome (e.g. a salient picture) increased their tendency to activate dopamine neurons compared to the neutral cues in a low reward context (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014</a>). Based on these and other observations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fiorillo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nomoto et al., 2010</a>), they proposed that the early response reflects attributes such as stimulus generalization and intensity, and the later response reflects the\u00a0subjective reward value and utility (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schultz, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Stauffer et al., 2016</a>)."

That is, dopamine neurons ignore aversive events. Recording from non-human primates, Fiorillo used three pieces of evidence to support this claim: First, dopamine neurons\u2019 responses to aversive outcomes (air puff) were indistinguishable from their responses to neutral outcomes. Second, although most dopamine neurons reduced their reward responses when the\u00a0reward was predicted, their response to aversive events was unaffected by prediction. Third, dopamine neurons did not integrate the value of aversive events when combined with rewarding events. From these results, the author proposed that the brain represents reward and aversiveness independently along two dimensions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fiorillo, 2013</a>). As a result, the author proposed that different molecules regulate different types of reinforcement learning: dopamine for reward and a different molecule for aversiveness. If proven true, these ideas are fundamental in understanding how the brain learns from reward and aversion. However, it remains to be clarified whether these observations can be generalized."

The ambiguity of cell-type identification criteria across studies makes it difficult to consolidate data on dopamine signaling.

In the present study, we monitored the activity of identified dopamine neurons using a series of behavioral tasks designed to determine how dopamine neurons encode prediction of aversive events in addition to reward. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to the proposal by <a href=\"#bib14\">Fiorillo (2013)</a>, dopamine neurons in VTA indeed are able to encode complete VPE, integrating information about both appetitive and aversive events in a common currency. Importantly, the ability of dopamine neurons to encode VPE depends on both reward contexts and the animal\u2019s trial-by-trial behavioral state."

However, this method may produce complex interactions between the two different outcomes. To test how reward and aversion interact and affect dopamine responses, we devised a 'mixed prediction' paradigm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) in which a single odor (Odor D in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, conditioned stimulus, CS) predicted both a rewarding and a mildly aversive event in a complementary and probabilistic manner: a reward (water) was delivered in 25% of the trials and an aversive event (air puff) was delivered in the remaining 75% of the trials. For comparison, we included the following trial types: Odor A predicted water in 25% of trials (nothing in 75%), Odor C predicted air puff in 75% of trials (nothing in 25%), and Odor B predicted no outcome. Each behavioral trial began with the odor CS (1\u2009s), followed by a 1-s delay and an unconditioned stimulus (US). We chose higher probability for air puff than water in order to balance the strength of positive and negative values in the task; we suspect that the magnitude of the negative value of mild air puff is much smaller than the magnitude of the positive value of water, which could cause us to overlook a small effect of predicted air puff on the CS response."

We replicated these findings here even in low reward probability conditions (20\u201325%, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>;\u00a0see Materials and methods). We next examined whether these dopamine neurons show prediction error coding for aversive events. To address this question, we occasionally delivered air puff during inter-trial intervals without any predicting cues. These responses to unpredicted air puff were compared to the responses to air puff in trials when air puff was predicted by an odor cue. We found that the inhibitory response to an air puff was significantly reduced when the air puff was predicted by an odor cue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). To further examine whether dopamine neurons showed prediction error coding for aversive events, we compared the firing rate during the outcome period in air puff omission trials with that in trials that predict nothing. We found that the omission of a predicted air puff slightly but significantly increased firing rates, compared to no change in nothing trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013H</a>) although we observed variability in air puff omission responses. Together, these results demonstrate that dopamine neurons signal prediction errors for aversive events in addition to rewarding events. These results indicate that dopamine neurons have the ability to signal VPEs for both appetitive and aversive events, supporting previous work by Matsumoto and Hikosaka (<a href=\"#bib31\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>) and contrasting with previous work by Fiorillo (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fiorillo, 2013</a>)."

We observed that the eye area became smaller after the onset of a CS predicting air puff and became larger after a CS predicting reward (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

We found that the firing rates of dopamine neurons to air puff CS in blink trials were significantly smaller than that in no-blink trials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

Rather, the results are consistent with the idea that dopamine neurons\u2019 inhibitory responses to aversive cues signal negative values of the outcome, but not the action itself.

This could be due to the fact that we used only a mildly aversive air puff (to prevent the animal from being discouraged to perform the task altogether), whereas water is highly rewarding. Although the number of trials in which the animal did not show anticipatory licking was small, we observed a similar relationship between dopamine responses and behavior: dopamine neurons were consistently excited by the 90% reward cue when they showed anticipatory licking, but not when they did not show anticipatory licking (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These results indicate the importance of both reward contexts and behavioral outcomes to understand how dopamine neurons represent reward and aversion. Without monitoring behaviors, investigators may easily miss weak inhibitory responses to mildly aversive stimuli in dopamine neurons."

In the present study, we aimed to specifically examine how dopamine neurons integrate aversiveness and reward by carefully controlling various experimental parameters. The following three points are particularly notable. First, we used an optogenetic tagging method to unambiguously identify dopamine neurons while recording spiking activity in behaving mice. Second, we used a series of behavioral paradigms with probabilistic outcomes that are designed to test specific hypotheses regarding the integration of different outcomes and the effect of reward contexts. Third, we monitored aversion-related behaviors (eye blinking) to examine the trial-by-trial relationship to dopamine responses. By harnessing these controlled experimental conditions, our results indicate that dopamine neurons have different modes of signaling. In low reward contexts (the mixed prediction task and the low reward probability task), dopamine neurons were inhibited by aversive events more strongly than by neutral events, tracking the aversiveness of stimuli on a trial-by-trial basis. Furthermore, dopamine neurons signaled VPEs by faithfully combining information about both appetitive and aversive events into a common currency of value. Thus, dopamine can function as a precise teaching signal for updating integrated values for both reward and aversion. However, in high reward contexts (the high reward probability task and the high reward probability task 2), dopamine neurons exhibited early excitations, which undermined their ability to produce negative responses for aversive events."

One dominant theory posits that dopamine acts as a teaching signal that broadcasts an RPE signal to the rest of the brain. Recent studies using optogenetics have established that activation of dopamine neurons alone is sufficient for appetitive conditioning (<a href=\"#bib53\">Steinberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Witten et al., 2011</a>) whereas suppression is sufficient for aversive conditioning (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Danjo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ilango et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">van Zessen et al., 2012</a>), although activation of dopamine neurons that project to the cortex or dopamine neurons in the dorsal raphe has potential to induce aversion and/or other functions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lammel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Matthews et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Popescu et al., 2016</a>).

However, whether dopamine neurons signal prediction errors with respect to aversive events remained controversial, and remained an obstacle towards establishing the role of dopamine as the teaching signal proposed in reinforcement learning theories."

This result contradicts some previous studies that showed consistent inhibition of dopamine neurons by aversive stimuli or the cues that predict them (<a href=\"#bib31\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McCutcheon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Roitman et al., 2008</a>). Our results suggest that there are different modes of dopamine signaling: in one mode, dopamine neurons indeed integrate the information about reward and aversion and signal VPE. This is an ideal teaching signal for reinforcement learning to maximize future values. Further, we found that the response function to aversive stimuli was preserved across dopamine neurons, suggesting that each dopamine neuron has the potential to contribute a prediction error of aversiveness, as well as of reward (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eshel et al., 2016</a>)."

This raises the possibility that one of the apparent differences observed between previous electrophysiological studies is due to different experimental parameters with respect to reward contexts. It should be noted that many physiological experiments tend to include highly rewarding training sessions in order to motivate animals. In natural environments in which wild animals forage, rewards might not be as abundant as in these experimental conditions.

Interestingly, dopamine responses to the cue predicting both rewarding and aversive outcomes in our mixed prediction tasks first showed excitation and then inhibition, different from the flatter responses to nothing cues. This clear temporal difference raises the possibility that information about values from rewarding and aversive outcomes are not yet integrated in presynaptic neurons and arise from different sources of inputs to dopamine neurons. A recent electrophysiological recording study from monosynaptic inputs to dopamine neurons also suggested that different presynaptic neurons may convey values for rewarding versus aversive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tian et al., 2016</a>). Consistent with this idea, we did not observe a correlation between the magnitude of single dopamine neurons\u2019 responses to reward and aversiveness (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), in contrast to correlations within reward-related responses (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eshel et al., 2016</a>) and within aversiveness-related responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Of note, a previous study (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eshel et al., 2016</a>) showed that, in high reward context, neurons that were highly responsive to unexpected rewards tended to also be highly responsive to aversive events: they showed greater levels of suppression below baseline. The results in the previous study are reminiscent of Fiorillo\u2019s study, which found that the inhibitory phase in biphasic responses of dopamine neurons did not encode negative values of aversive stimulus, but rather encode 'no reward' (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fiorillo, 2013</a>). The results in the previous study (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eshel et al., 2016</a>) could be consistent with the present results if the inhibition represents 'no reward' but not the negative value of aversive stimulus, and this no-reward response is correlated with other reward-related responses of dopamine neurons."

Our results are consistent with a previous study which proposed that dopamine neurons change their response patterns depending on reward context (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014</a>). The authors found that neutral stimuli excited dopamine neurons more strongly in high- compared to low-reward contexts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014</a>). The present study extends this finding to aversive stimuli. Short latency excitations of dopamine neurons have been observed in various experiments and have been attributed to generalization (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996</a>), stimulus intensities (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fiorillo et al., 2013</a>), motivational salience (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>), trial starts (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>) or stimulus detection (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nomoto et al., 2010</a>). Our data do not distinguish these possibilities and the short latency excitation in the high reward context is likely to comprise a combination of these. Importantly, however, our data in the high reward context showed that the short-latency excitations compromised the monotonic value coding of dopamine neurons, and the difference between responses to air puff-predicting CS and nothing-predicting CS was diminished. This means that dopamine neurons did not simply add a constant amount of spikes (the same amount of excitation) on top of the monotonic value coding. Thus, our observations suggest that the combination of these factors and/or additional factors distorted normal value coding in dopamine neurons in high reward context."

The methodology, including the DA neuron identification and recording, is similar to prior work from this group, and reflects a careful and sophisticated approach towards investigating the responses of individual identified neurons to outcomes and the cues that predict them. The authors' aim is to investigate the encoding by DA neurons of aversive stimuli, given the mixed findings in the literature. The approach taken here is to compare the neuronal responses to cues in a discrimination procedure in which reward-predictive and airpuff-predictive cues, as well as cues predicting both, or nothing, are presented pseudorandomly. The authors find that the encoding of aversive-predicting cues varies with the relative probability of other cues being reinforced by reward, such that DA response to airpuff-paired cues are decreases in spiking in low density reward sessions, and DA responses to airpuff-paired cues are increases in spiking in high density reward sessions (although decreases are also clearly visible in the neural response \u2013 see below). These are interesting findings. The results do add substantially to our understanding of DA neural responses by providing careful parametric comparisons in, very critically, <i>identified</i> DA neurons, using opto-tagging. Importantly, the notion that overall reward density may alter responses to cues \u2013 reward paired, or not \u2013 was shown previously by Schultz and colleagues, and this is acknowledged by the authors. The present data add to our understanding of the regulation of DA neuron responses to reward- and punishment-paired cues and will be of strong interest to scientists studying dopamine systems, as well as more generally, reward, addiction, and learning. The paper would benefit from more careful consideration of the specific attributes and limitations of these studies in forming their interpretations."

The authors show that mice tend to show anticipatory blinking for airpuff in response to the cue whether it is a low or high reward context, but the relationship between the suppression of firing in response to the airpuff-predictive cue only holds for the low reward context, because consistent suppression in the DA neuron response is not seen in response to this cue in the high reward context. Yet this does not take the biphasic nature of the neural response to the aversive stimulus in the high reward context into account. In light of this (as well as the comment that follows), the pupillary/blink response appears to occur on a timescale parallel to that of the late component of the neural response, which in the case of the aversive cue, is an inhibition. Thus, it appears to me that there may indeed by a correlation with behavior and the neural signal. Can the authors investigate this issue more deeply?"

Examination of the population histograms clearly show that this signal is dynamic, and that averaging the response over the full first second of cue presentation may obscure a multiphasic response to the aversive cues \u2013 there looks to be an excitation followed by an inhibition in the high reward context. Again, this is a response pattern described by Schultz and colleagues, who suggests that the early response reflects attributes such as stimulus generalization and intensity, and it is the later response that reflects the prediction error/value signal. This interpretation should receive deeper treatment in the current manuscript. Maybe the averaging across the full second is the most direct statistical approach, but the biphasic nature of the signal should be acknowledged."

This seems to be one possible explanation for the finding that increases in response to the airpuff cue are more often seen in a high reward context than a low reward context. In addition, the authors data further support this notion since the cue that predicts no reward also shows an initial excitation in the high reward, but not low reward, context. Have the authors thought to use cues of differing modalities to reduce the sensory similarity? If not, the authors should consider that their data do not contradict a generalization and/or salience notion, although they appear to say they do."

Indeed, it would be useful if the authors reported the extent to which the encoding observed during the cue is similar to encoding during the outcome, i.e., if a neuron is inhibited by an airpuff-predicting cue, is it also inhibited by unexpected air puff. This is especially interesting given the points above, that the high reward context increase in firing at the outset of the odor cues seems parsimoniously explained as generalization, while the neural responses to the respective outcomes could still be increases and decreases for sucrose and airpuffs, respectively. In other words, do DA neuron responses to presentation of airpuff itself change in different reward contexts, or is this strictly a feature of the conditioned stimuli."

Although dopamine is thought to be important for learning from both reward and punishment, there has been disagreement about how dopaminergic neurons integrate aversive and rewarding stimuli. The authors show that dopaminergic activity is inhibited by an air puff and an air puff-predicting odor in low reward contexts. The air puff response is modulated by expectation and individual dopaminergic neurons are able to integrate the value of reward and punishment. Finally, they show that manipulating reward context affects dopaminergic responses to punishment, such that in high reward contexts there is actually an excitatory response to punishments. The latter condition appears to replicate various previous studies. The data provides a valuable contribution to the debate over how dopaminergic neurons respond to aversive stimuli. The use of optogenetic tagging allows for compelling identification of dopaminergic neurons and the authors tested several task structures in order to reconcile discrepancies in the field."

The importance of reward context is a major conclusion of the paper but its complete disruption of aversive signaling is confusing (and not entirely convincing) as presented. Why not analyze the different temporal phases of the response separately? It appears that if the responses were compared during the late inhibitory phase of the response (evident in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), then there would indeed be a difference in the response to odor B and odor C in both the high reward and low reward contexts. In other words, the simplest explanation of the effect of \"high reward context\" is to create a short-latency excitatory response to the aversive stimulus. The authors argue this response is different from the short-latency 'generalization' response described by Schultz and colleagues, but not clear what that means. Specifically, in the Discussion it is noted that a high reward context \"compromised the monotonic value coding of dopamine neurons,\" but this was not clearly explained or analyzed. Additionally, the argument that the excitatory response to punishment in a high reward context is not due to generalization is unclear. The authors write that \"dopamine neurons did not simply add the same amount of excitation on top of the monotonic value coding.\" In fact, in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, it seems like there is an excitatory \"generalization\" response that is being added to the pause in firing to the CS-."

The authors show that mice tend to show anticipatory blinking for airpuff in response to the cue whether it is a low or high reward context, but the relationship between the suppression of firing in response to the airpuff-predictive cue only holds for the low reward context, because consistent suppression in the DA neuron response is not seen in response to this cue in the high reward context. Yet this does not take the biphasic nature of the neural response to the aversive stimulus in the high reward context into account. In light of this (as well as the comment that follows), the pupillary/blink response appears to occur on a timescale parallel to that of the late component of the neural response, which in the case of the aversive cue, is an inhibition. Thus, it appears to me that there may indeed by a correlation with behavior and the neural signal. Can the authors investigate this issue more deeply?</i> "

The question of \u201cwhat these different modes mean for learning and behavior\u201d is important. One possibility would be that dopamine directly controls or modifies some behaviors. In our task, however, temporal dynamics of dopamine activities and blinking are different: dopamine responses are tightly locked to salient events such as CS or US, while blinking occurs much later than dopamine responses. This appears to suggest that dopamine activities are not tightly time-locked with blinking behaviors. The suggested idea is that certain time window of inhibitory activities might cause blinking. We did not see this correlation between dopamine activities and blinking when we used a big time window. Now we have analyzed our data using only the later phase of responses in high reward contexts, and show that the results are very similar to those obtained using a big time window.

Although dopamine is thought to be important for learning from both reward and punishment, there has been disagreement about how dopaminergic neurons integrate aversive and rewarding stimuli. The authors show that dopaminergic activity is inhibited by an air puff and an air puff-predicting odor in low reward contexts. The air puff response is modulated by expectation and individual dopaminergic neurons are able to integrate the value of reward and punishment. Finally, they show that manipulating reward context affects dopaminergic responses to punishment, such that in high reward contexts there is actually an excitatory response to punishments. The latter condition appears to replicate various previous studies. The data provides a valuable contribution to the debate over how dopaminergic neurons respond to aversive stimuli. The use of optogenetic tagging allows for compelling identification of dopaminergic neurons and the authors tested several task structures in order to reconcile discrepancies in the field.</i>"

The importance of reward context is a major conclusion of the paper but its complete disruption of aversive signaling is confusing (and not entirely convincing) as presented. Why not analyze the different temporal phases of the response separately? It appears that if the responses were compared during the late inhibitory phase of the response (evident in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), then there would indeed be a difference in the response to odor B and odor C in both the high reward and low reward contexts. In other words, the simplest explanation of the effect of \"high reward context\" is to create a short-latency excitatory response to the aversive stimulus. The authors argue this response is different from the short-latency 'generalization' response described by Schultz and colleagues, but not clear what that means. Specifically, in the Discussion it is noted that a high reward context \"compromised the monotonic value coding of dopamine neurons,\" but this was not clearly explained or analyzed. Additionally, the argument that the excitatory response to punishment in a high reward context is not due to generalization is unclear. The authors write that \"dopamine neurons did not simply add the same amount of excitation on top of the monotonic value coding.\" In fact, in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, it seems like there is an excitatory \"generalization\" response that is being added to the pause in firing to the CS-.</i> "

Importantly, the previous study (Eshel et al., 2016, Nat Neurosci) was conducted using a high reward context. A previous study found that the inhibition phase after excitation in biphasic responses is not related to aversiveness but to \u201cno reward\u201d (Fiorillo, 2013, Science). Consistent with this idea, we observe that in high reward contexts, cues predicting nothing often caused inhibition in dopamine neurons instead of no responses. In the previous study (Eshel et al., 2016, Nat Neurosci), the authors used cues which signaled either water or air puff (no cue signaling nothing). In this sense, the cue signaling air puff actually signals \u201cno reward\u201d. We interpret that the correlation which authors observed in responses between unpredicted water and air puff CS was mainly due to this \u201cno reward\u201d responses.
