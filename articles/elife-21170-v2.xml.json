In the hippocampus, earlier electrophysiological recordings suggested that spontaneous and evoked glutamate release can activate separate groups of postsynaptic NMDA receptors with limited overlap. However, it is still unclear how this separation of NMDA receptors is distributed across individual synapses. In a previous paper (<a href=\"#bib14\">Reese and Kavalali, 2015</a>) we showed that NMDA receptor mediated spontaneous transmission signals to the postsynaptic protein translation machinery through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Here, we show that in rat hippocampal neurons although spontaneous and evoked glutamate release driven NMDA receptor mediated Ca2+ transients often occur at the same synapse, these two signals do not show significant correlation or cross talk."

Previous studies by our group and others have shown that spontaneous neurotransmission is critical in the homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength and this regulation may have implications for the efficacy of rapidly acting antidepressants (<a href=\"#bib12\">Nosyreva et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Gideons et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Sutton et al., 2006</a>). In particular, our recent work has shown that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of these effects is driven by NMDA receptor mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that are amplified via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release via ryanodine receptor mediated coupling to postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<a href=\"#bib14\">Reese and Kavalali, 2015</a>). These earlier results highlight a novel mechanism by which spontaneous release can trigger large Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients \u2014 and in turn activates postsynaptic signaling \u2014 but it remains unclear if these transients are generated at the same synapses that participate in evoked release."

However, these results lack the ability to distinguish quantal events at the single synapse level and do not show the extent to which evoked and spontaneous release processes are co-localized. More recent experiments in the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction have come to mixed conclusions about the propensity of a single active zone to participate in both evoked and spontaneous transmission; finding either considerable overlap, but with a population of spontaneous only active zones or limited overlap with a negative correlation between the two modes of transmission (<a href=\"#bib10\">Melom et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Peled et al., 2014</a>). To date, no such measurement has been made in mammalian synapses. Here, we utilize the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6f-PSD95 to image neurotransmission at individual synaptic regions to measure the amount of transmission mode overlap in hippocampal neurons."

The indicator was expressed in the postsynaptic compartment where its clustering produced punctate signals consistent with a postsynaptic localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). ROIs (regions of interest) were placed systematically over individual fluorescent puncta so as to minimize the chance of an ROI receiving signals from multiple postsynaptic fluorescence signals.

Example traces show current clamp recordings of two cultured pyramidal cells first in Mg<sup>2+</sup> free Tyrode\u2019s solution and then in Mg<sup>2+</sup> free Tyrode\u2019s solution containing 5 \u00b5M NBQX plus 5 \u00b5M muscimol (green bar). Upon perfusion of NBQX and muscimol, spontaneously arising action potentials are silenced and the voltage fluctuations of each cell driven by excitatory synaptic network activity are silenced.\u00a0(<b>B</b>) NBQX and muscimol allow reliable stimulation, and prevent reverberatory excitatory network activity by taking advantage of the predominant somatodendritic expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Example traces show Fluo-4 AM fluorescence (reporting bulk Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, rather than synapse specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> as monitored by GCaMP6f-PSD95) from 2.5 \u00b5m circular ROIs placed on the cell soma or a proximal, isolated dendritic process for two cells. Cells are first imaged in Mg<sup>2+</sup> free Tyrode\u2019s solution and stimulated 10 times with 30 mA from a 3 mm spaced parallel bipolar electrode at 0.1 Hz (red marks denote stimulus). During the first train of stimulations, network activity generates multi AP responses that are visible as complex, multi-peak signals in the dendrite which are consistent with network bursting activity (black traces). At the cell soma, a smoothed version of the same signal is visible where each stimulus generates a longer Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Cells are washed for 1 min with Mg<sup>2+</sup> free Tyrode\u2019s solution plus NBQX and muscimol and again stimulated 10 times at 0.1 Hz (green traces). During the second stimulation, each stimulus generates a unitary response with a single peak in the dendrite. At the cell soma, only small Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are visible in the presence of NBQX and muscimol which is consistent with GABA<sub>A</sub> currents shunting excitatory inputs from the dendrite. The lack of signal at the cell soma compared to the dendrite confirms that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals seen after NBQX and muscimol application are driven by synaptic activity elicited by the stimulus rather than a stimulus artifact which would be visible in both the somatic and dendritic compartments.\u00a0(<b>C</b>) Spontaneous event amplitude coefficient of variation does not show a population of ROIs with multiple synaptic inputs. Coefficient of variation was calculated for each ROI with two or more spontaneous events during the experiment in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Each mark represents a single ROI.

A fit line describes a trend towards lower spontaneous response rates in high evoked R<sub>p</sub> ROIs, but with very weak correlation. Interestingly, there is a large population of ROIs (~20%) that exhibit spontaneous but not evoked responses during the recording period. These ROIs may represent synapses that exclusively release vesicles spontaneously, or have a very low evoked R<sub>p</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, along y axis). The presence of these ROIs suggests that a population of synapses may exist which exclusively signal spontaneously rather than by action potential driven chemical neurotransmission. The distribution of observed frequencies for spontaneous responses shows clustering around a mean rate of 0.78 events / ROI / minute (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Evoked responses show a more even distribution with a mean R<sub>p</sub> of 0.34 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In addition, we found that neither evoked R<sub>p</sub> or spontaneous response rate vary with respect to their distance to the soma (data not shown). Further analysis of this data was performed in which the coefficient of variance was calculated for the event amplitudes recorded at each ROI. These calculations reveal no correlation between spontaneous or evoked response rate and the variance in amplitudes that would be indicative of multiple synaptic inputs per ROI (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplement\u00a01C,D</a>)."

In our data, neither the Poisson distribution matching the measured average (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a06.2, p&lt;&lt;0.001, excluding zeros, not shown) or the theoretical best fit Poisson distribution (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a04.3, p&lt;&lt;0.001, excluding zeros) adequately describe the measured distribution as compared by the \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

We expect that if MK-801 application at rest blocked a large number of both spontaneous and evoked release responding NMDA receptors, there would be a steep decrease in the number of synapses that respond to evoked stimulus after MK-801 treatment. However, the ability of ROIs to respond one or more times to evoked stimulus after MK-801 treatment is unaffected compared to control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, p=0.31 via one-way ANOVA). The application of MK-801 did not affect the number of spontaneously active ROIs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), though it did significantly decrease the rate of detected events at those ROIs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). While the vast majority of ROIs exhibit both spontaneous and evoked responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, spontaneous bars), the inability of MK-801 to halt evoked responses after spontaneous block suggests a separation of the two modes of transmission within the same ROI."

If NMDARs were equally likely to receive neurotransmitter from a spontaneous vesicle fusion as an evoked vesicle fusion, we would expect that the ROIs with the highest rate of spontaneous activity would exhibit the largest amount of MK-801 induced blockade when measuring evoked responses. However, we find that the rate of spontaneous activity is a poor predictor of the amount of MK-801-induced decrease in evoked responses. In contrast, comparing the initial R<sub>p</sub> against the MK-801 induced change reveals that ROIs with the highest initial R<sub>p</sub> see the largest decrease in R<sub>p</sub> after treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These findings are consistent with the blockade of NMDA receptors responding to stimulation during MK-801 treatment being due to evoked glutamate release alone, with little contribution from spontaneous neurotransmission. In other words, the plot shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> validates the classical assumption on the nature of MK-801 block at the single synapse level \u2018higher the Rp (a proxy for release probability), larger the percentage of block by MK-801\u2019. However, this increase in block \u2013 while proportional to initial Rp \u2013 is not correlated to the amount of spontaneous events seen prior to MK-801 application (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This result indicates that a classical measure of release probability does not show a correlation between spontaneous response rate and evoked response rate at the single synapse level. Taken together, these results indicate that the majority of hippocampal synapses participate in both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission while a small subpopulation (~20%) may only transmit spontaneous signals. The occurrence of spontaneous signals appears to be non-random which may indicate some form of presynaptic regulation (e.g. <a href=\"#bib3\">Bal et al., 2013</a>). Finally, the dynamics of NMDA receptor blockade with MK-801 illustrate that in synapses that release glutamate via both modes of transmission, the postsynaptic NMDA receptors activated are largely unique to one mode or the other with limited overlap within the synapse. This result implies a nanoscale segregation of sites for spontaneous versus evoked neurotransmission within individual synapses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atasoy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Tang et al., 2016</a>)."

From each segment, an average intensity projection was created and subtracted from a maximum intensity projection. This manipulation highlights puncta and eliminates background. Using this image, 2.5 \u00b5m diameter circular ROI\u2019s were placed manually over isolated puncta that did not overlap. 50 ROIs were selected in each experiment in the order that they appear, using as many segments as necessary. ROIs found to overlap multiple puncta in the following projections were relocated to measure only a single punctum. Fluorescence traces were obtained from each ROI and raw fluorescence values converted to a running \u2206F/F<sub>o</sub> using a 5 s baseline. A point was identified as a peak were identified if its \u2206F/F<sub>o</sub> was greater than 0.1, its slope calculated in 400 ms steps was greater than 687 units / sec and the peak value was greater than two standard deviations greater than the signal from the previous 2 s. Based on peak time, events that fell within a 1 s window after a stimulation were considered to be evoked and all other events were considered to be spontaneous. Relative to the presynaptic voltage deflection, the postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal has a longer rise time and the 1 s window safely includes all evoked events. As the average spontaneous event rate is less than one event per minute, the chance of incorrectly marking a spontaneous event as an evoked event remains relatively low."

Spatially resolving these calcium signals allowed the authors to examine the likelihood that a given synaptic site 'transmits' via spontaneous and/or AP-evoked release. This is an interesting question, and it was addressed by combining the use of the activity-dependent NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, to illustrate any overlap between NMDA receptor activity that was driven by spontaneous versus evoked release. From these experiments the authors conclude that while many synapses participate in both evoked and spontaneous release, some synapses seem to preferentially participate in one form of release or the other."

This concern is exacerbated by the use of a bipolar electrode which is typically used to provide focused stimulation, so there is a concern that APs are not be driven throughout field of view. In order to claim that some release sites only function spontaneously and not by evoked APs, it must be demonstrated that the stimulation protocol was sufficient to always cause APs. Correlations between spontaneous and evoked rates of release may be confounded by failures to evoke APs particularly if an 'AP failure rate' is unevenly distributed in space relative to the simulating electrode."

For example, the text for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> states that the spontaneous response rate was reduced by 87%. However, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> appears to contradict this claim, as no difference between MK801 and control conditions was apparent. Apparently, by using different methods of analysis for the same experiment, both a significant 87% reduction (vs. no change in controls) and a non-significant 25% reduction (vs 24% in controls) were observed regarding spontaneous response release in the presence of MK-801. This is particularly worrisome given a similar problem seems occur for evoked responses: <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows no difference in ROI responders between control and MK-801 treated neurons while <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> shows a nearly 50% reduction in the signal intensity for the first response after MK-801 treatment (compared to controls). This might suggest that a good portion of the individual NMDA receptors participating in evoked release, and not the entire post-synaptic NMDA pool, were indeed blocked by MK-801 during spontaneous release; these findings seem to directly contradict the primary conclusion for the figure. At the very least, a clear, persuasive argument needs to be made as to why different methods of analysis are appropriate; also, a clear, convincing explanation for their apparently different conclusions needs to be provided."

If the response probability of a given ROI is measured over the entire post-treatment stimulation protocol (as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), then stimulating in the presence of MK-801 would lower the 'Rp' causing it to decrease over the course of measuring it (and as stated, eventually lowering it to 0). Because the act of measuring significantly changes Rp, it is unclear what that number means or what it is actually measuring. The significant confound from these evoked effects (illustrated by <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) makes it hard to draw or justify conclusions from comparisons with spontaneous release (as attempted in 4A). If the goal here is to examine the ability of spontaneous release to reduce 'Rp', then the analysis should only compare the first stimulation,post-treatment, or somehow otherwise remove the confounding influence that stimulation in MK-801 would have on measuring Rp."

However, Fluo-4 AM was unsuitable to detect NMDA currents alone in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> as we tested in the previous <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>. Without the contribution of ER stores to the calcium transients, less than 5% of the total number of events were detectable compared to events in Mg<sup>2+</sup> free solution. This result suggests that while Fluo-4 AM can detect NMDA transients without ER store contribution, it is only feasible in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Under ER store block and Mg<sup>2+</sup> free conditions, Fluo-4 AM detects transients with amplitudes of 0.07 \u00b1 0.009 \u2206F/F\u2092 which is significantly smaller than GCaMP6F. We believe the lower amplitudes represents a lower detection fidelity especially given that it produces low spontaneous release estimates compared to GCaMP6f (0.20 \u00b1 0.06 events/ROI/min with Fluo-4 AM vs 0.79 \u00b1 0.04 events/ROI/min with GCaMP6f). Additionally, for the purposes of the current study, we required that only a single cell be labeled so as not to conflate presynaptic and postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during stimulation.

MK-801 blocks the NMDA receptor by binding to a site that is only accessible when the channel is open thereby making it a use-dependent blocker (Huettner and Bean 1988). As such, the presence of MK-801 shortens NMDAR mean open times, which results in a decrease in peak fluorescence amplitudes (Atasoy, Ertunc et al. 2008). Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions diffusion rate across the spine neck is limited which causes the fluorescence signal peak to more closely correlate with the integral of the NMDA EPSC rather than the EPSC amplitude (Sabatini, Oertner et al. 2002, Bloodgood and Sabatini 2005). We believe this effect to be the reason that <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> displays decreased first response amplitudes in the presence of MK-801. However, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> is only meant to illustrate that average event amplitudes decrease linearly with each successive response. While it is tempting to compare amplitudes before/after as a proxy for the number of NMDARs blocked, we chose not to directly compare event amplitudes for the purposes of this manuscript. This avoids conflating the MK-801 driven decrease in amplitude with photobleaching which becomes increasingly non-linear due to its uneven effects on fluorescent versus quenched fluorophores."

Because the act of measuring significantly changes Rp, it is unclear what that number means or what it is actually measuring. The significant confound from these evoked effects (illustrated by <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) makes it hard to draw or justify conclusions from comparisons with spontaneous release (as attempted in 4A).

With the assumption that the rate of NMDAR block is the same per each NMDA opening, we can ask if the amount of MK-801 blockade (here, the change in Rp between the first and second measurements or \u2206Rp) is strongly correlated with each ROIs spontaneous response rate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or its evoked response probability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Our finding that the amount of block does not correlate with the rate of spontaneous responses suggests that this is not a driving factor in our observed changes. Instead the conclusion of this experiment is that the amount of MK-801 block of evoked responses seems to only depend on the amount of evoked responses and thus the amount of opportunities that MK-801 has to block NMDARs responding to evoked release alone. Similarly, the number of chances that MK-801 has to block NMDARs responding to spontaneous release does not appear to affect evoked responses. We believe that this is functional evidence for separate populations of NMDARs being activated by evoked and spontaneous glutamate release in close spatial proximity."

In these experiments, the efficiency of MK-801 is static, but the availability of its binding site depends on how many times the channel is opened. The meaning of these panels is to illustrate that the amount of MK-801 induced block of NMDARs that respond to evoked glutamate does not correlate with the amount of spontaneous activity during MK-801 application (panel 4A). Channels that open during the spontaneous-only period of MK-801 treatment will be blocked and unavailable to participate in the second round of evoked responses if they were to be activated by evoked glutamate release. However, this does not mean that MK-801 is not blocking receptors that receive evoked glutamate in a use dependent manner, because the amount of block is strongly correlated with the number of responses to stimulation (panel 4B). In other words, we observe that within a single synapse it is possible to subdivide the populations of NMDARs that receive evoked glutamate or spontaneous glutamate by preferentially blocking one with MK-801 and not the other. This is contrary to the prevalent assumption that the postsynaptic population of NMDARs form a homogeneous pool of receptors that are equally likely to receive glutamate from a spontaneous vesicle fusion event or an evoked vesicle fusion event."

However, we find that the rate of spontaneous activity is a poor predictor of the amount of decrease in evoked responses. Comparing the initial R<sub>p</sub> against the MK-801 induced change reveals that ROIs with the highest initial R<sub>p</sub> see the largest decrease in R<sub>p</sub> after treatment.

Another reviewer suggests that this is actually the point: MK801 blocking efficiency may be constant at ~80% but the fact that it is predictable from evoked Rp but not spontaneous rate supports the separation of the groups.
