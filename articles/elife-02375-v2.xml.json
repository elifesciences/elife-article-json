                    "text": "Superelongation complexes (SECs) are essential for transcription elongation of many human genes, including the integrated HIV-1 genome. At the HIV-1 promoter, the viral Tat protein binds simultaneously to the nascent TAR RNA and the CycT1 subunit of the P-TEFb kinase in a SEC. To understand the preferential recruitment of SECs by Tat and TAR, we determined the crystal structure of a quaternary complex containing Tat, P-TEFb, and the SEC scaffold, AFF4. Tat and AFF4 fold on the surface of CycT1 and interact directly. Interface mutations in the AFF4 homolog AFF1 reduced Tat\u2013AFF1 affinity in vivo and Tat-dependent transcription from the HIV promoter. AFF4 binding in the presence of Tat partially orders the CycT1 Tat\u2013TAR recognition motif and increases the affinity of Tat-P-TEFb for TAR 30-fold. These studies indicate that AFF4 acts as a two-step filter to increase the selectivity of Tat and TAR for SECs over P-TEFb alone."

                    "text": "Superelongation complexes (SECs) are essential for transcription elongation of many human genes, including the integrated HIV-1 genome. At the HIV-1 promoter, the viral Tat protein binds simultaneously to the nascent TAR RNA and the CycT1 subunit of the P-TEFb kinase in a SEC. To understand the preferential recruitment of SECs by Tat and TAR, we determined the crystal structure of a quaternary complex containing Tat, P-TEFb, and the SEC scaffold, AFF4. Tat and AFF4 fold on the surface of CycT1 and interact directly. Interface mutations in the AFF4 homolog AFF1 reduced Tat\u2013AFF1 affinity in vivo and Tat-dependent transcription from the HIV promoter. AFF4 binding in the presence of Tat partially orders the CycT1 Tat\u2013TAR recognition motif and increases the affinity of Tat-P-TEFb for TAR 30-fold. These studies indicate that AFF4 acts as a two-step filter to increase the selectivity of Tat and TAR for SECs over P-TEFb alone."

To do this as efficiently as possible, the elongation factor needs to restart the transcription process as quickly as possible. To ensure that this happens the virus produces a protein called Tat that binds to the short region of RNA that has already been made. At the same time the Tat protein also combines with other proteins to form a multi-protein machine called the super elongation complex. Other proteins in the super elongation complex include a \u2018scaffold\u2019 protein called AFF4, a positive elongation factor called P-TEFb, and at least two additional transcription factors."

Pol II is recruited to the HIV promoter and initiates transcription, which stalls after a 30\u201350 nucleotide transcript containing the trans-activating response region (TAR) is formed. The HIV Tat protein bound to a host super elongation complex (SEC) recognizes TAR and releases the paused polymerase (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sobhian et al., 2010</a>).

Overexpression of an AFF1 fragment that binds to P-TEFb, but not the other components of SECs, has a strong inhibitory effect on HIV transcription, indicating that productive HIV transcription requires a complete SEC (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lu et al., 2013a</a>)."

The TRM wraps around Tat, exposing several basic residues, and contributing CycT1 C261 to coordinate a shared Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion. Remarkably, AFF4 fragments containing the CycT1- and Tat-interacting segments increased the affinity of Tat-P-TEFb for TAR by 30-fold. These results support the idea that AFF4 contributes to TAR binding through two distinct and sequential mechanisms. AFF4 interactions with Tat directly favor SEC recruitment and AFF4 interactions that constrain the CycT1 TRM indirectly promote TAR binding."

This recurrence of the same helical structure in different crystal environments suggests that AFF4 residues 4\u201321 prefer a helical conformation. The function of helix 0, however, remains in doubt because mutational effects on transcription do not match the AFF4 contacts in the interface, and stabilization of helix 0 depends on crystal packing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2013</a>).

In all three complexes in the a.u., P249 and N250 at the beginning of the TRM make multiple contacts with the main chain atoms at the C-terminal end of Tat helix 35\u201344. In addition, CycT1 L252 forms hydrophobic interactions with AFF4 M55 in all three complexes. The TRM structures start to diverge at this point. CycT1 residues 253\u2013259 loop over Tat helix 28\u201333 in two conformations that converge at CycT1 C261 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the dyad-related complexes, the CycT1 TRM makes crystal contacts that include W258, R259, and A260, but in the third complex, the crystal contacts are restricted to the side chain of R251. In all complexes, W256 makes buried contacts with AFF4. Basic residues such as K253, R254, R259, and the polar N257, on the other hand, show continuous main-chain electron density but the exposed side chains are disordered. C261 binds the shared Tat Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion in all three complexes. The presence of multiple conformations and relatively weak electron density for the TRM loop residues 253\u2013260 indicates that this region is conformationally restrained but still quite flexible after Tat and AFF4 binding. These results suggest that in the presence of Tat, AFF4 partially orders the TRM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

To test the contribution of the Tat\u2013AFF4 interface to Tat-dependent transcription, we measured the effect of alanine substitutions on SEC recruitment and Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription. These assays were performed with the AFF1 scaffold protein, because Tat has a stronger effect on HIV transcription with AFF1 than with AFF4 (<a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). AFF1 mutants V67A and F70A (corresponding to M62A and F65A in AFF4) were ectopically expressed in HeLa cells in the absence or presence of Tat(C22G), a mutation in the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination site required for WT Tat activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Garber et al., 1998</a>). The Tat(C22G) mutation increases the dependence on AFF1 for efficient transactivation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). Immunoprecipitation of tagged WT AFF1, as well as the V67A, F70A, and V67A/F70A variants, efficiently co-precipitated CDK9 and CycT1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, Tat(C22G) failed to co-precipitate P-TEFb (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lanes 1 &amp; 2). This lack of binding was rescued by co-expressing WT AFF1 but not the three AFF1 alanine variants, V67A, F70A, and V67A/F70A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results suggest that AFF1 V67 and F70 are important for interactions between the scaffold and Tat. In turn, this interface stabilizes the AFF1-CycT1 association, as suggested by the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb structure."

Since AFF4 binds close to the TRM in the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb structure, we investigated the effect of AFF4 on TAR binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) revealed unexpectedly that AFF4 fragments 32\u201367, 2\u201373, and 2\u201398 each increased the affinity of TAR for the Tat-P-TEFb complex by 30-fold (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). It is unlikely that AFF4 directly contributes to TAR binding, since the AFF4-P-TEFb complex does not show any binding to TAR by itself. Instead, the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb structure provides evidence that AFF4 binding in the presence of Tat restricts the conformational freedom of the CycT1 TRM region and positions this region for TAR interaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

Transcription remains stalled at the promoter in the absence of host elongation factors needed for Pol II to faithfully reach the distal end of the HIV genome. The X-ray structure of Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb reveals subunit interactions that mediate the preference of Tat for SECs over other P-TEFb complexes. As predicted (<a href=\"#bib30\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2013</a>), Tat and AFF4 bind adjacent to each other on the CycT1 surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The Tat\u2013AFF4 interaction surface is centered around Tat K28, which is acetylated in vivo to regulate HIV transcription (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kiernan et al., 1999</a>). Mutations in AFF1 corresponding to the Tat\u2013AFF4 interface in the crystal structure reduce scaffold binding and transcription stimulation functions. Compared to the AFF4-P-TEFb complex, AFF4 structural segments in the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb complex undergo unanticipated 1\u20132 \u00c5 backbone shifts to avoid unfavorable close contacts with Tat (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These shifts in AFF4 alter the dimensions of the Tat-binding pocket in AFF4-P-TEFb that may serve as a site for targeting HIV transcription inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2013</a>)."

Automatic refinement was alternated with manual rebuilding using Coot (<a href=\"#bib8\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>)."

The high-salt conditions of the crystallization probably dissociated the TAR RNA from the protein complex. In the final model, density was missing for residues 1\u20137 and 89\u201396 in CDK9 mol1 and mol2, and residues 1\u20137 and 92\u201395 in CDK9 mol3. Density was also absent for residues 1\u20136 and 262\u2013264 in all three CycT1 molecules, and residues 50\u201357 in all three Tat molecules. For AFF4 mol1 (mol3) density for residues 2, 22\u201332, 70\u201373 (2\u20133, 22\u201333, 70\u201373) was missing, while AFF4 mol2 was missing density for residues 2\u201333 and 70\u201373. The ATP binding pocket of CDK9 contained extra density although ATP was not included in the crystallization. The density was modeled as adenosine."

The structure reveals the molecular basis by which AFF4 contributes to Tat-dependent elongation of viral transcription. In broad terms, the new structure was anticipated by the 2013 <i>eLife</i> paper from the same group, but the data are generally of high quality and there are some important new insights that merit visibility. In particular, the new work indicates that AFF4 stabilizes HIV elongation complex formation by two coupled mechanisms: (i) AFF4 contacts Tat on the Cyclin T1 surface to stabilize protein complex formation. (ii) AFF4 indirectly promotes binding of the TAR RNA by stabilizing a Cyclin T1 TRM conformation that is competent for TAR binding. Important aspects of the structure are confirmed by mutagenesis and binding or Tat transactivation assays, and the positive influence of AFF4 on the affinity of Tat:P-TEFb complex for TAR RNA is confirmed by EMSA. The paper makes important contributions to the field and is appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

Analysis with the programs Pointless and Xtriage confirmed the presence of the expected symmetry operators and detected no characteristics of twinning. The Rsym for the P6522 data with I/sigI &gt;3 was 8.4%, which is a more acceptable value. A discussion of these calculations, which strengthen the manuscript by supporting the space group assignment, was added to the Materials and methods.

Several hypotheses are being tested in these studies. These models include the idea that SEC components other than P-TEFb influence the activity of complexes containing different AFF scaffolds. In addition, evidence suggests that different scaffolds are recruited with different efficiency to different gene promoters (e.g., Lin C et al. (2011) <i>Genes Dev</i> <b>25</b>: 1486; Liu P et al. (2014) <i>J Biol Chem</i> jbc.M113.539015). Posttranslational modifications or distinct allosteric transitions in partner proteins may also distinguish different scaffolds. These and other models must be tested to explain the higher activity of AFF1 compared to AFF4 at the HIV promoter. Due to the broad scope of this question and the limited insights into promoter selectivity provided by our data, we prefer not to speculate about this question in this manuscript."
