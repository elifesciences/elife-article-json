The neurotransmitter dopamine is an important modulator of LA activity and facilitates fear memory formation, but whether dopamine neurons aid in the establishment of discriminative fear coding by the LA is unknown. NMDA-type glutamate receptors in dopamine neurons are critical for the prevention of generalized fear following an aversive experience, suggesting a potential link between a cell autonomous function of NMDAR in dopamine neurons and fear coding by the LA. Here, we utilized mice with a selective genetic inactivation functional NMDARs in dopamine neurons (DAT-NR1 KO mice) combined with behavior, in vivo electrophysiology, and <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiology in LA neurons to demonstrate that plasticity underlying differential fear coding in the LA is regulated by NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons and alterations in this plasticity is associated non-discriminative cued-fear responses."

The neurotransmitter dopamine is an important modulator of LA activity and facilitates fear memory formation, but whether dopamine neurons aid in the establishment of discriminative fear coding by the LA is unknown. NMDA-type glutamate receptors in dopamine neurons are critical for the prevention of generalized fear following an aversive experience, suggesting a potential link between a cell autonomous function of NMDAR in dopamine neurons and fear coding by the LA. Here, we utilized mice with a selective genetic inactivation functional NMDARs in dopamine neurons (DAT-NR1 KO mice) combined with behavior, in vivo electrophysiology, and <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiology in LA neurons to demonstrate that plasticity underlying differential fear coding in the LA is regulated by NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons and alterations in this plasticity is associated non-discriminative cued-fear responses."

Optogenetic activation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Johansen et al., 2010</a>) or suppression (<a href=\"#bib25\">Johansen et al., 2014</a>) of principal neurons in the LA facilitates and impairs cued fear memory formation, respectively. Direct stimulation of principal neuron cell bodies in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) can also increase anxiety-like behavior (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tye et al., 2011</a>), thus activation of the LA/BLA is a key neural substrate of fear and anxiety. In addition to principal projection neurons, distinct interneuron populations within the BLA can also potently regulate fear memory formation and fear coding (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wolff et al., 2014</a>), indicating that both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission within this region regulates fear-related behavior and learning."

Thus, aberrant fear coding in the LA may be an early site of generalized fear manifestation. Consistent with this hypothesis, exposure to fear-inducing stimuli has been demonstrated to increase activity in the amygdala of human subjects (<a href=\"#bib8\">Breiter et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Morris et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rauch et al., 2000</a>), and hyper-amygdala activation is observed in numerous disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rauch et al., 2000</a>). In rodents, increasing the intensity of an unconditioned fear stimulus increases fear generalization that correlates with enhanced activation of LA neurons to both conditioned (CS+) and non-conditioned (CS\u2212) stimuli (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</a>). In addition, suppression of GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated signaling in the LA facilitates non-associative long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses that correlates with generalized fear responses (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shaban et al., 2006</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that aberrant plasticity in the LA that facilitates non-selective potentiation of excitatory drive or suppression of inhibitory tone is an important neural substrate of generalized fear."

Neurons were detected in both control and DAT-NR1 KO mice that responded to the CS+ and CS\u2212 stimuli. Average waveforms, firing rate, and the proportion of neurons responding to these stimuli did not differ between groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). In control mice we observed a progressive enhancement of the CS + response in neurons activated by the stimulus across days (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, DAT-NR1 KO mice did not show enhancement of CS + responses (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Neither control nor DAT-NR1 KO mice showed changes in CS\u2212 responses (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Enhanced responding to CS + across days of conditioning in control mice was not due to repeated presentations of the cue, as this effect was not observed in control mice that received three consecutive days of cue (CS+ and CS\u2212) presentation delivered without footshock (unpaired, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Increased CS + responses in control mice across days of conditioning resulted in significant cue discrimination that was absent in DAT-NR1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). This change was not associated with differences in the proportion of neurons responding to both CS+ and CS\u2212 stimuli (Control: Day 1, 84%; Day 2, 78%; Day 3, 87% vs DAT-NR1 KO: Day 1, 88%; Day 2, 80%; Day 3, 80%). To determine whether discriminative fear coding emerges early in conditioning, we analyzed the responses of neurons on day 1 of conditioning during the first and last cue presentation. Although there was a trend towards discrimination in both control and DAT-NR1 KO mice by the last conditioning trial this effect did not reach statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These findings indicate that early cue discrimination may occur in both groups of mice, but is only maintained in control mice."

Previous studies have demonstrated that failure of LA neurons to discriminate between fear predictive and non-predictive stimuli is highly correlated with fear generalization (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</a>). More specifically these authors demonstrate that increased intensity of the US results in non-selective enhancement of LA excitatory responses to a CS\u2212, thus impairing the discrimination between CS+ and CS\u2212 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</a>). Consistent with these findings it has also been shown that disruption of GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling in the LA results in non-associative plasticity, and mice lacking the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subtype GABA<sub>B(1a)</sub> develop generalized fear responses (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shaban et al., 2006</a>). In contrast to previous reports of generalized fear being associated with an over-exuberance of plasticity and activation of the LA (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shaban et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ghosh and Chattarji, 2015</a>), in DAT-NR1 KO mice with generalized fear the LA neurons appear as though no CS/US association has been made. More specifically, LA neurons in DAT-NR1 KO mice do not potentiate to the CS+, fail to reduce inhibition to the CS\u2212, and demonstrate longer response latencies to the CS+ and CS\u2212, similar to longer response latencies to the CS\u2212 in control mice. Although the manner in which discrimination occurs between activated and inhibited neurons differs, the end result is an acquired differential response that is dependent upon NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons. These results indicate that generalized freezing behavior to the CS\u2212 is not dependent upon excessive activation of the LA, but rather suggest that discriminative coding in the LA reflects the proper assignment of cue-outcome contingencies. Collectively, these findings suggest that disruption of plasticity underlying discriminative fear coding in the LA is associated with generalized fear responses. Our results extend previous findings and confirm that plasticity in the LA is associated with discriminative fear; however, it is not an over-exuberance of plasticity per se that underlies generalization but rather the lack of appropriate plasticity."

It is well established that the LA is an early site of convergent sensory information processing that is essential for fear memory acquisition and expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">LeDoux, 2000</a>); however, fear coding and plasticity are broadly distributed across multiple brain regions including the thalamus, cortex (sensory and prefrontal), and hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tovote et al., 2015</a>). In addition, plasticity also occurs within other subdivision of the amygdala including the BLA and lateral subdivision of the central nucleus (CeAl) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tovote et al., 2015</a>). More specifically, generalized defensive responses to threat have been correlated with non-specific coding of cue information in the CeAl (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ciocchi et al., 2010</a>), and activation of a specific population of CeAl neurons during discriminative fear conditioning results in response generalization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Botta et al., 2015</a>). Thus, it is possible that the generalized threat responses reported here are mediated by exaggerated responses in the CeA or other areas of the brain implicated in fear processing, many of which are innervated by midbrain dopamine neurons."

Examination of the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in response to stimulation of either thalamic or cortical input to LA neurons did not reveal a pathway-specific change in either excitatory or inhibitory drive. These findings indicate that either one or both pathways are enhanced with proportional increases in excitatory and inhibitory drive, or that neither pathway is altered specifically. Our observations of increased frequency of both mIPSCs and mEPSCs suggest a scenario in which one or both pathways are potentiated with proportional changes in excitatory and inhibitory inputs."

Our observed increase in the frequency of both mEPSCs and mIPSCs without a concomitant change in amplitude, is consistent with a presynaptic increase in synaptic transmission, similar to previous descriptions of facilitated synaptic transmission from cortical and thalamic inputs to LA neurons (<a href=\"#bib39\">McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tsvetkov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zinebi et al., 2002</a>). Although we did not observe an increase in mEPSC amplitude this does not exclude postsynaptic changes in glutamate receptors. It was previously demonstrated that trafficking of postsynaptic AMPA receptors in the LA is critical for associative memory formation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rumpel et al., 2005</a>). One potential explanation for these apparent discrepancies is the unmasking of previously silent synapses (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</a>). Indeed, silent synapses have been reported in the amygdala (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2013</a>) and stress has been shown to increase the formation of nascent silent synapses in the LA (<a href=\"#bib59\">Suvrathan et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively, it has been proposed that different synaptic sites of LTP in LA neurons (pre- vs postsynaptic) may occur depending on the strength the US, with low US intensities favoring presynaptic LTP and high US intensities favoring postsynaptic LTP (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). Because we used a low intensity footshock (0.3 mA) it is possible that our protocol favored the induction of a presynaptic form of synaptic strengthening."

We have previously demonstrated that NMDARs in dopamine neurons regulate phasic activation of these neurons in response to an aversive stimulus, thus suggesting that phasic dopamine release may facilitate plasticity at excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the LA. Consistent with this hypothesis, previous studies have demonstrated that dopamine signaling within the LA modulates local inhibitory networks (<a href=\"#bib32\">Loretan et al., 2004</a>) and gates LTP induction in LA neurons through a suppression of feedforward inhibition (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bissiere et al., 2003</a>). In addition to local inhibitory neurons, dopamine neurons innervate paracapsular intercalated cell clusters (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marcellino et al., 2012</a>) and potently modulate intercalated neurons through a D1 receptor dependent inhibitory mechanism (<a href=\"#bib38\">Marowsky et al., 2005</a>). More specifically, dopamine signaling in lateral paracapsular intercalated neurons suppresses feedforward inhibition from cortical inputs to the BLA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Marowsky et al., 2005</a>). Thus, phasic dopamine release facilitated by NMDARs in dopamine neurons is likely to regulate excitability and plasticity of LA neurons through both local inhibitory networks and feedforward inhibition from lateral paracapsular intercalated neurons."

We find that the activity of a significant proportion of LA neurons increases after the first presentation of the US in control mice that parallels our finding of increased Fos levels in the LA following the first conditioning session. Footshock has been demonstrated to increase firing of midbrain dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brischoux et al., 2009</a>), thus increased dopamine release facilitated by NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons could explain the observed increase in LA activity in control mice that is absent in DAT-NR1 KO mice.

In support of an interdependent plasticity between dopamine neurons and target structures, it has been demonstrated that NMDAR-dependent cocaine-evoked plasticity in dopamine neurons occurs prior to plasticity in dopaminergic targets of the nucleus accumbens and that plasticity within the accumbens is dependent on NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mameli et al., 2009</a>)."

Microdrive implantations in anesthetized mice were stereotaxically targeted at the LA (\u22121.65 mm A-P, \u00b12.85\u21923.25 mm M-L, \u22124.3 mm D-V; Paxinos); Bilateral targeting was achieved using coupled polyimide guide tubes (200 \u00b5m OD; source) spaced at 6.5 mm. One week after surgery, mice were connected to a 16-channel Medusa Preamplifier and filtered signals (300-5000 Hz) were acquired using a RZ5 Signal Processor (Tucker\u2013Davis Technologies). Tetrodes were lowered daily in \u223c40 \u03bcm increments until unit activity was observed, at which point the animals began the fear conditioning paradigm; tetrodes were not lowered on subsequent days unless cell activity was absent. For conditioning, mice were treated as above, except they were not exposed to the testing chamber (white corrugated plastic insert) and did not receive cue presentations prior to conditioning. Conditioning proceeded each day following a 10 min baseline period to establish basal neural activity. Tetrode placement was histologically confirmed postmortem using cresyl violet histochemical stain and the presence of implant-induced tissue damage. Neurons were isolated by cluster analysis using Offline Sorter (Plexon) and subsequently formatted and analyzed with MATLAB (Mathworks) and Prism (Graphpad Software). Data were acquired from 13 control and 12 DAT-NR1 KO mice. For unpaired recordings in control mice (N = 5), animals were treated exactly as above, except during the CS + presentation that normally co-terminated with footshock the shock was omitted."

The mice were treated the same way as animals that underwent fear conditioning for in vivo electrophysiology analysis except that in this assay mice were euthanized 90 min following conditioning. These animals would therefore be most representative of mice recorded during the first day of conditioning. All mice were handled for one week prior to conditioning. One major difference between mice that underwent conditioning for Fos and electrophysiology recordings (both in vitro and in vivo) vs mice that were analyzed for freezing is that mice for Fos and physiology did not receive any pre-exposure to the conditioning chamber. Mice used for Fos and physiology were also not exposed to the testing chamber and were only exposed to the conditioning chamber. Recording during conditioning allowed us to observe neural responses to both the CS and US presentations within the same session. We have included this additional information in our revised Methods section."

It is also possible that this difference contributes to the discrimination deficits in DAT-NR1 KO mice. However, we have previously demonstrated that DAT-NR1 KO mice develop non-specific fear responses in novel contexts and generalized anxiety using a different conditioning paradigm indicating that generalization in these mice is broader than the context used here. In addition, we now report the electrophysiological responses of neurons activated and inhibited by CS+ and CS- stimuli in both control and DAT-NR1 KO mice during the first and last trial of conditioning on the first day. These results reveal that there are no major differences in the response profiles of these neurons on the first day indicating that at least at the level of the LA sensory information is initially processed equivalently. In addition, we also now provide in vivo electrophysiology data from control mice that received the same cues used in conditioning, but were not paired with footshock. This data reveals that response profiles of activated neurons does not change across multiple days of repeated stimulus presentation. Thus our results demonstrating enhanced responding of LA neurons to the CS+ during conditioning reflects associative fear processing and is not related to differential responding to repeated presentation of the different cue stimuli."

We have removed this statement and provided a much more in-depth discussion of these findings. With regard to the quantification of the PSPs, we cannot provide an accurate individual average of the IPSP or EPSPs due to variability in stimulating electrode placement. Typically PSPs are normalized to baseline responses to allow for comparisons across slices and across animals. Because we are comparing two independent groups in which baseline responses cannot be established, an alternative method of normalization is required. To achieve this we compared the ratio of EPSPs to IPSPs, similar to what is done for the generation of AMPA/NMDA receptor ratios. Because we did not see selective effects on EPSPs or IPSPs in either pathway, we analyzed mEPSCs and mIPSCs which do allow for more accurate direct comparisons across groups. In the latter instance we observed and increase in the frequency of both mEPSCs and mIPSCs indicating that both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are changed in control mice, but not DAT-NR1 KO mice."
