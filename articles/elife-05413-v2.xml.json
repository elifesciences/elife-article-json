By following the motion of individual heads with interferometric scattering microscopy at nm spatial and ms temporal precision we found that the detached head occupies a loosely fixed position to one side of actin from which it rebinds in a controlled manner while executing a step. Improving the spatial precision to the sub-nm regime provided evidence for an \u00e5ngstrom-level structural transition in the motor domain associated with the power stroke. Simultaneous tracking of both heads revealed that consecutive steps follow identical paths to the same side of actin in a compass-like spinning motion demonstrating a symmetrical walking pattern. These results visualize many of the critical unknown aspects of the stepping mechanism of myosin 5 including head\u2013head coordination, the origin of lever-arm motion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the translocating head during individual steps."

By following the motion of individual heads with interferometric scattering microscopy at nm spatial and ms temporal precision we found that the detached head occupies a loosely fixed position to one side of actin from which it rebinds in a controlled manner while executing a step. Improving the spatial precision to the sub-nm regime provided evidence for an \u00e5ngstrom-level structural transition in the motor domain associated with the power stroke. Simultaneous tracking of both heads revealed that consecutive steps follow identical paths to the same side of actin in a compass-like spinning motion demonstrating a symmetrical walking pattern. These results visualize many of the critical unknown aspects of the stepping mechanism of myosin 5 including head\u2013head coordination, the origin of lever-arm motion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the translocating head during individual steps."

At the start of each step, both heads are attached to the actin with one in front of the other. The leading head remains attached while the rear head detaches from actin and moves in front of the leading head reattaching to actin. These movements are repeated many times to allow the motor to move along the filament, much like a tightrope walker walking along a wire. However, it is not known how the motor can move so efficiently along the actin while managing to avoid falling off its track."

From here, this detached head sways back and forth, until it takes a step forward and binds firmly to the next position on the filament. Both heads follow identical paths along the actin filament, and so the movement resembles the way that a drawing or dividing compass can be used to measure distances on a map."

A finely tuned kinetic sequence of ATP binding, hydrolysis, phosphate release and eventually ADP release by the enzymatic heads enables processive motion towards the \u2018+\u2019 end of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib12\">De La Cruz et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De La Cruz and Ostap, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rosenfeld and Sweeney, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Sakamoto et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Forgacs et al., 2008</a>). One of the most remarkable aspects of myosin 5a is the efficient conversion of chemical energy by the molecular-sized enzymatic heads into a translation of 74 nm along a 7 nm diameter actin filament in the presence of Brownian motion and a crowded cellular environment. Crystal structures of myosin 5a exist either with or without nucleotide, but only in the detached state (<a href=\"#bib55\">Coureux et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2004</a>). Although these structures served as a model for the structural changes potentially induced by binding to actin, (<a href=\"#bib65\">Volkmann et al., 2005</a>) the internally coupled rearrangement of the subdomains leading to ADP and phosphate release or dissociation from actin upon ATP binding could only be studied in silico (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cecchini et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Preller and Holmes, 2013</a>). The experimental challenge in revealing such structural dynamics has been largely of spatiotemporal origin, since they are likely on the \u00c5ngstrom scale and may be very transient."

Single molecule studies employing optical trapping (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mehta et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rief et al., 2000</a>) and fluorescence imaging (<a href=\"#bib17\">Forkey et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yildiz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Snyder et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Warshaw et al., 2005</a>) have either reported periods of increased flexibility, (<a href=\"#bib49\">Veigel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dunn and Spudich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beausang et al., 2013</a>) or partitioning of the step into sub-events (<a href=\"#bib49\">Veigel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Uemura et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Cappello et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sellers and Veigel, 2010</a>). All resulting models involve a forward aiming power stroke followed by a Brownian search mechanism (<a href=\"#bib49\">Veigel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Okada et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shiroguchi and Kinosita, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Karagiannis et al., 2014</a>). The power stroke of the attached head contributes only partially to the step by moving the pivot point that facilitates Brownian rotation of the unbound head. The bias towards the next binding site is believed to be provided by the recovery stroke and its stability, but how unidirectional stepping is achieved in the presence of such a large and mostly random motion remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shiroguchi et al., 2011</a>). The first passage time of the translocating head is expected to be on the order of 100 \u00b5s, (<a href=\"#bib49\">Veigel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hinczewski et al., 2013</a>) although the head spends tens of ms in the unbound state given the maximum rates of ATP hydrolysis and binding to actin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Veigel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dunn and Spudich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beausang et al., 2013</a>)."

Optical trapping operates in this spatiotemporal regime, but it is not possible to monitor the motion of the unattached head without significant perturbation. Smaller labels affixed to the myosin motor domain or to calmodulin molecules on the lever arm, as available in fluorescence imaging, do not suffer from this limitation, but cannot provide sufficient localization precision on the millisecond time scale. We therefore designed an assay based on interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kukura et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura, 2012</a>) a technique that has recently been shown to enable simultaneous high-speed and high-precision imaging of 20 nm diameter or smaller nanoscale scattering labels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrecka et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Ortega Arroyo et al., 2014</a>)."

Our effective lateral localization precision of 4 nm at 1000 frames/s, however, enabled us to visualize the motion of the unbound head precisely and revealed a transient state with a center of mass just over half way between the two binding sites and offset by 40 nm perpendicular to the actin filament (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). From this position, the myosin head repeatedly moved back and forth between the next actin binding site and the transient state position (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The same behavior sometimes occurred just before myosin detached from the filament at the end of a trajectory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), although detachment of myosin with the labeled head bound was equally likely. On the rare occasions that the labelled leading head of myosin detached and reattached, it occupied a similar position in space to a translocating head (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that the transient state represents a true potential minimum of the one head bound state of myosin."

This property arises from the interferometric nature of the technique, which scales the iSCAT signal as <i>sin\u03a6</i>, where <i>\u03a6</i> is the phase difference between scattered and reflected light fields. As the label moves perpendicular to the sample plane, the optical path length and with it the phase difference between the two fields changes by the following relation <i>\u03a6</i> = <i>4\u03c0\u03b7z</i>/<i>\u03bb</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, inset). A complete signal inversion occurs for a displacement of <i>z</i> = <i>\u03bb/4\u03b7</i> = <i>84</i> nm, where <i>\u03bb</i> is the illumination wavelength (445 nm) and <i>\u03b7</i> the refractive index of the medium (1.33). Thus, variations in the axial distance of the motor domain with respect to the filament bound to the sample surface lead to changes in the scattering contrast. We often observed these changes in contrast between the actin bound and unbound states (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and obtained an average change in iSCAT signal during the step (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The drop of 3.5% in iSCAT contrast (\u223c40% of the total signal) suggests that the myosin head lifts on average by 24 \u00b1 10 nm from its actin bound position. Although the precision of the measurement was in principle higher, we could not accurately determine the additional phase contributions to the interferometric signal on an individual label basis, which are required for a robust calibration."

The localization noise increased for a gold bead attached to an actin-bound myosin (\u03c3 = 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 nm in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), but remained small enough such that transitions on the order of 5 nm were clearly visible (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). The slightly larger positional fluctuations for gold bound to the actomyosin complex compared to immobilized gold were likely caused by a combination of a flexible protein-label connection and a limited ability in to completely immobilize actin. We observed a clear drop in the iSCAT contrast when the labeled trailing head detached and transitioned to the leading position (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

We reduced our frame rate to 20 frames/s in order to increase the fluorescence signal from the tail, since single molecule fluorescence tracking of GFP with &lt;5 nm precision at 100 frames/s is challenging. The resulting traces showed that both the large-scale translocation of the head and the subsequent smaller backwards transition coincide with translation of the tail (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This implies that the small-scale transition accompanies the power stroke of the attached labeled head (AB transition) and is representative of a pre- to post-power stroke transition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

This suggests that the AB transition reports on a conformational change of the bound head, which is a rotation of the N-terminal domain, rather than a translation of the head itself along actin. The consequences of a rotational movement of the label are presented schematically in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>. The red circles indicate the positions of two labels in the pre-power stroke A state (with radii r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub>, where r<sub>2</sub> = 2 \u00d7 r<sub>1</sub>). The grey circles correspond to the post-power stroke B state. Red and grey dots indicate their respective centers. For a larger label (<i>r</i><sub>2</sub>), the same movement of the N-terminus leads to an overall similar motion but with a larger displacement of the center of mass (<i>d</i><sub>2</sub>) than for a small label (<i>d</i><sub>1</sub>). Using this model and our data, we could extract an angle of rotation, <i>\u03b1</i>, as well as a distance, <i>x</i>, that defines the origin of rotation, since sin(\u03b1/2) = \u00bd <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>/(<i>r</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>x</i>) and <i>d</i><sub>2</sub>/<i>d</i><sub>1</sub> = (<i>r</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>x</i>)/(<i>r</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>x</i>).

By monitoring the lifetimes of the A and B states, which effectively provides the dwell times of the labeled and unlabeled heads, respectively, we demonstrate that the 20 nm gold particle attached to the N-terminus of myosin has no measureable effect on the kinetics of stepping. If detrimental effects can be excluded experimentally, as in this case, our results show that the larger size of the label can actually be advantageous in revealing structural dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible. Here, the label probes the structural change occurring in the bound head during the power stroke and amplifies it into a nanometer scale motion. Previous studies using gold labels were not able to observe this transition likely due to a combination of a different labeling strategy (40 nm or 60 nm gold nanoparticle attached to a calmodulin on the lever arm) and much lower spatial precision (&gt;10 nm) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dunn and Spudich, 2007</a>)."

This change is consistent with results of molecular dynamic simulations of both myosin 5a and myosin 2 based on crystal structures suggesting that the N-terminus undergoes a rotation during the power stroke transition (<a href=\"#bib55\">Coureux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cecchini et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Preller and Holmes, 2013</a>)."

During the acquisition of 4728 steps in 635 trajectories, we never observed a large followed by a small forward step. In our work, we labeled the motor domain directly, while in the previous studies, calmodulin bound to the lever arm was used as an attachment point. Since the lever arm moves significantly during the power stroke, attachment of the dye at this location may suggest a sub-step along actin, even though the motor domain itself does not move. Thus the term \u2018sub step\u2019 is inappropriate for this pattern of movement. In addition, the orientation of single dipoles can have a significant impact on the position obtained from standard Gaussian fitting and exacerbate even very small translocations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Enderlein et al., 2006</a>)."

Such behavior was also observed in the single molecule tracking study discussed above, (<a href=\"#bib45\">Syed et al., 2006</a>) although the frequency of occurrence was not discussed in that work. The sensitivity of our tracking methodology to detachment from actin in three dimensions, however, shows that myosin remains firmly bound to actin with both heads during the mechanochemical cycle irrespective of whether the head is leading or trailing (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), except when the head takes a 74 nm step. Only on very rare occasions did we observe detachment of the leading head. Specifically, only ~3% of steps taken at 1 \u00b5M ATP, ~0.6% of steps taken at 10 \u00b5M ATP, none at saturating ATP exhibited this behavior. The unbinding event was not necessarily followed by reattachment at a different site suggesting that these events can be explained simply by the binding equilibria between myosin and actin, rather than being an active component of the stepping mechanism.

From the two head bound state of myosin 5a, the trailing head detaches from actin upon binding of ATP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The leading head then undergoes a power stroke that leans the protein forward, a motion that exhibits a strong torsional component (<a href=\"#bib23\">Komori et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ohmachi et al., 2012</a>). After the power stroke, the unbound head arrives at a minimum in the potential energy from where it approaches the next actin binding site in what appears to be a one dimensional biased search. The transient state lifetime agrees with the duration of increased flexibility reported in optical trapping experiments probing the attachment stiffness at high time-resolution (<a href=\"#bib49\">Veigel et al., 2002</a>) and single molecule tracking of the motor domain (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dunn and Spudich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beausang et al., 2013</a>). The measured lifetime also correlates well with previously reported ensemble rate constant for the weak-to-strong binding transition (47 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rosenfeld and Sweeney, 2004</a>). The presence of an additional high probability density very close to the final binding site further favors such an interpretation. This density very likely corresponds to the weakly bound state from which the head frequently moves back to the side position."

There is neither an intrinsic reason for the head to pause there, nor is there a binding site present at this position. Our experimental data provides no evidence that the transient state is induced or measurably affected by unwanted interactions caused by the particle or the surface as suggested by the similarity of our transient state lifetime to previous studies with alternative labeling strategies, (<a href=\"#bib17\">Forkey et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Snyder et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Warshaw et al., 2005</a>) the presence of the transient state for much smaller labels (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the change in contrast during the step (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), the lack of non-specific binding of our label to the surface or actin and any localizations during the one head bound state that coincide with the underlying actin track. This location and the resulting movement, however, become more intuitive when considering that the intrinsic angle between the lever arms is similar to that found when the two heads are bound to actin, that is, \u223c37 nm away from each other. Comparison of electron micrographs of myosin 5 bound to actin (<a href=\"#bib66\">Walker et al., 2000</a>) and non-specifically bound to a surface in the absence of actin (<a href=\"#bib64\">Takagi et al., 2014</a>) show clearly peaked angle distributions around 105 and 115\u00b0, respectively, suggesting a built-in preference for such a spatial arrangement of the two heads, rather than a truly flexible linkage, another indication that a completely free swivel at the neck-linker is unlikely. In this way, keeping the angle between the lever arms roughly intact during stepping and twisting partially about the leading head causes the translocating motor domain to preferentially reach the desired binding site. As a result a full three dimensional search mechanism is minimized to one defined by a one dimensional arc."

In hindsight, such a mechanism has numerous advantages over a search based on full rotational diffusion. It generates a built-in bias for finding the correct binding site and ensures that the head needs to travel and search only along one dimension to find the desired binding site defined by the torsion about the leading head and neck linker rather than a lower probability three-dimensional Brownian search. Even if the motor domain fails to bind strongly on first passage, it swings back and forth between the transient state and the desired actin site until tight binding can occur. This suggests that the structure of myosin 5a facilitates and controls the motion of the unbound head to achieve such high specificity in finding the desired binding site."

The location of the transient state, the fact that in several thousand steps we never observed a single step with transient localizations on both sides of the actin filament, and a predominantly perpendicular orientation of myosin relative to the surface caused by our surface preparation, however, suggest that diffusion is constrained. On the contrary, we believe that this constraint is a key to myosin 5's efficiency in terms of processive motion in contrast to a completely free, spherical search space."

It suggests that the AB transition cannot solely be a consequence of a steric interaction between the label and the lever arm. In that case, we should only observe one type of AB transition, irrespective of whether right or left-handed walking occurs. Furthermore, it shows a connection between the directionality of the N-terminus and lever arm movement. The observed N-terminus domain movement could thus be a signature of the release of this strain. This conformational change, critical for rearrangement of the nucleotide binding pocket and/or closure of the internal cleft, would then allow for finalizing the actomyosin energy transduction. In other words, the energy from the ATPase reaction, stored in the actomyosin complex can only be fully used after the trailing head detaches and the system can relax."

The fact that the transient state is either to the left or to the right of the filament implies that it cannot be a pure consequence of the attached lever arm swing. We therefore propose that the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition reflect the strain release upon rear head detachment. The initial strain is built up within the head domain and transmitted up to the lever arm during the first binding when one of the heads twists in order to bind to the same actin filament (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2006</a>)."

Otherwise, we would expect each molecule to preserve the orientation of the transient state even when changing from one filament to another. Instead, the decision is made upon binding to actin, with both cases following the right and left hand preference previously mentioned. With respect to the source of the symmetry breaking, one possible explanation involves the steric interaction with the surface. Depending on the initial binding angle the steric interactions with the surface would determine the direction of rotation. However, if the sidedness was only a consequence of an interaction with the surface, then we would at least expect the molecules that are bound perpendicular to the glass surface and thus have the least interaction with it, to show no preference. Since we never observed transient states on both sides of the filament during individual runs, the reported mechanism is likely to be an intrinsic feature of the myosin 5a stepping."

This initial twist, possibly driven by thermal fluctuations, establishes the direction in which the initial torsional strain is built up and is then repeatedly stored and released as the protein moves along actin. Once the directionality of the transient state has been established, both heads follow the same constrained route resulting in an efficient, unidirectional motion."

We segmented each trajectory into step pairs defined as the set containing the data before and after each 74 nm step. These steps were detected manually by using a time interval slider along the 2D trajectory and checking for changes in positional fluctuations. The orientation of the transient state relative to actin was determined and later used to align all steps."

First, we fixed the center of mass of the beginning of the step to coordinate position (0,0). Then, we applied a rotation matrix to the entire step pair trace so that both bound states lie along the horizontal axis. Finally, all aligned step pair traces were overlapped to produce the contour plots shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

Interestingly, the labeled head visits a transiently detached state located about 40 nm off axis, and it alternates between a forward on-axis position and the off-axis position a few times before settling on the new forward on-axis position. Remarkably, the sense (right vs left handed) of this off-axis intermediate is the same for both heads (as they demonstrate using correlated imaging of the other head labeled with a quantum dot at 10 ms time resolution), supporting the symmetric hand-over-hand mechanism. The resulting model posits that the dimeric motor moves like a compass, rotating around its bound head during the powerstroke, and the direction of this rotation is the same through a processive period. But whether the rotation is clockwise or counter-clockwise appears to be determined stochastically upon initiation of the movement. They also combined this with fluorescence particle tracking of quantum dots or GFP to correlate motions of the gold-labeled heads with the partner head or myosin tail. The data also suggest that there is no-substep per se and that stomping of the front head, as was proposed based on AFM images and an earlier fluorescence study, may not be an essential part of the stepping mechanism. Additional data on the slight movement of the bound head upon powerstroke support the conformational change of the bound head instead of it staying in the same conformation. Overall, the work is novel and provides new insights and an overall simple and clean model on myosin V motility. They also conclude that the search by a detached head for the next actin binding site does not sweep out the sphere expected from a free swivel at the head-tail junction, but rather sweeps along an arc limited by a relatively fixed angle between the two lever arms. It's excellent work, carefully executed, and the paper is generally written very clearly. The paper will be of interest to investigators in the motor field and also for tracking microscopists more broadly. Several mechanisms alternative to the ones proposed are not discussed, but otherwise, the paper is outstanding."

These numbers arise from simple geometric considerations but also agree with much more sophisticated simulations based on a free rotational diffusion model (Hinczewski et al., 2013, PNAS). We, however, observed a transient state half way between the two binding sites, 40 nm off axis (marked in orange). Given the head-head separation of 37 nm, our observations are more consistent with myosin maintaining the angle between lever arm.

We attached streptavidin functionalized, 20 nm gold particles using biotinylated antibody against GFP. In this assay, all gold labels produced a positive iSCAT contrast when placed into focus (bright), in contrast to head-labeled gold, which invariably appeared dark (see <a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 2</a>). We remark that the iSCAT contrast of gold particles bound to a surface in water cannot be inverted by simply changing the focusing but requires an additional phase contribution from a difference in optical pathlength between scattered and reflected light (Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura, 2012, Phys Chem Chem Phys). Although precise z-calibration was difficult for reasons already discussed in the text, these observations strongly suggest that gold particles attached to the tail are 40\u201360 nm above those bound to the head in most cases."

For parallel bound molecules, volume exclusion with the surface would result in an average height of about 15 nm above actin. For perpendicular bound molecules, the average position of a freely rotating head would be located slightly above the lever arms\u2019 junction. As we show in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, we occasionally encounter tracks where the transient state cannot be localized with blue illumination because the iSCAT contrast drops to zero. This is only possible if the particle travels \u223c40 nm in along the optical axis, which is inconsistent with the scenario suggested by the referees. This interpretation is strengthened by simultaneous iSCAT measurements using blue (445 nm) and red (635 nm) illumination. In that case, the particle remained visible in the red channel while it disappeared in the blue. At the same time, the off-axis component of the transient state is much smaller compared to those trajectories when the transient state remains visible in both channels, which is most consistent with a parallel bound molecule lifting the detached head \u223c40 nm up (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1, B</a>).

We have now included this figure as <a href=\"#fig8s4\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 4</a> and a short discussion in the aforementioned subsection of the Results. Similarly, our data also agrees very well with an increased mobility of the translocating head measured by single molecule fluorescence polarization (Beausang et al., 2013, Biophys J). The effective time-resolution of this experiment was 0.8 ms after binning to collect sufficient photons, longer than the exposure time used here (0.54 ms). If the stepping head indeed was on a freely jointed swivel and explored the full rotational space on a much faster timescale, these experiments would not have detected the reported wobble, but instead only an average dye orientation, which was different from that when the head is bound to actin, either leading or trailing. The fact that Beausang et al., 2013 observed a wobble is thus in excellent agreement with our observation of constrained diffusion, as is our transit time of 17 ms compared to 13 ms."
