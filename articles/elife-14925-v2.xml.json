The antenna is involved in finding food, oviposition sites and mates. However, the functional significance of the maxillary palp remained unknown. Here, we screened the olfactory sensory neurons of the maxillary palp (MP-OSNs) using a large number of natural odor extracts to identify novel ligands for each MP-OSN type. We found that each type is the sole or the primary detector for a specific compound, and detects these compounds with high sensitivity. We next dissected the contribution of MP-OSNs to behaviors evoked by their key ligands and found that MP-OSNs mediate short- and long-range attraction. Furthermore, the organization, detection and olfactory receptor (Or) genes of MP-OSNs are conserved in the agricultural pest <i>D. suzukii</i>. The novel short and long-range attractants could potentially be used in integrated pest management (IPM) programs of this pest species."

The antenna is involved in finding food, oviposition sites and mates. However, the functional significance of the maxillary palp remained unknown. Here, we screened the olfactory sensory neurons of the maxillary palp (MP-OSNs) using a large number of natural odor extracts to identify novel ligands for each MP-OSN type. We found that each type is the sole or the primary detector for a specific compound, and detects these compounds with high sensitivity. We next dissected the contribution of MP-OSNs to behaviors evoked by their key ligands and found that MP-OSNs mediate short- and long-range attraction. Furthermore, the organization, detection and olfactory receptor (Or) genes of MP-OSNs are conserved in the agricultural pest <i>D. suzukii</i>. The novel short and long-range attractants could potentially be used in integrated pest management (IPM) programs of this pest species."

The antenna, the main olfactory organ, is covered with four types of sensilla: basiconic, trichoid, intermediate and coeloconic. These four sensillum types house olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) types responding to different kinds of chemical stimuli and thus serve distinct chemosensory functions. In contrast, the palp has only three different subtypes of basiconic sensilla, each housing two MP-OSNs. Because of the overlapping response spectra between MP- and antennal OSNs (Ant-OSNs) (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Bruyne et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2001</a>) as well as the location of the maxillary palp in close vicinity to the labellum, the main taste organ in flies, a function connected to taste enhancement has been suggested for the MP-OSNs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shiraiwa et al., 2008</a>). However, taste enhancement would be a very general function for six types of MP-OSNs expressing seven different odorant receptors (Ors). In our previous work we presented data on the importance of Or71a, which is expressed in the maxillary palp sensillum pb1B, in proxy detection of dietary antioxidants (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dweck et al., 2015</a>). It is not yet known whether the other MP-OSNs are also dedicated to detect specific ecologically relevant chemical compounds, and if so, what the ecological importance of these compounds is."

For example, in both the hawk moth <i>Manduca sexta</i> and the African malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, CO<sub>2</sub> detection is primarily mediated via maxillary and/or labial palp OSNs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Thom et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lu et al., 2007</a>). Mammals are also known to possess several peripheral olfactory organs. In mouse, e.g., the main olfactory epithelium is complemented with the vomeronasal organ, the septal organ and the Grueneberg ganglion, each having distinct functions (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib17\">Knaden and Hansson, 2014</a>). The presence of specific functions in different olfactory organs in other insects and in mammals suggests that the maxillary palp may also be involved in the detection of specific chemicals in <i>Drosophila</i>."

We find that each MP-OSN is either the sole or the primary detector of a specific chemical compound and that the maxillary palp contains independent and important olfactory channels that mediate both short- and long-range attraction. Finally, we find that the organization, detection and Or genes of MP-OSNs are conserved in the agricultural pest <i>D. suzukii</i>, and identify novel short and long-range attractants that could potentially be used in IPM programs of this pest species."

In addition, the previously identified ligands activate Ant-OSNs as well as MP-OSNs and have been shown to be much better ligands for Ant-OSNs (i.e. require high concentrations to activate MP-OSNs) (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Bruyne et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>). This suggests that the best ligands of the different MP-OSNs have not yet been identified. Towards this end, we screened each of the six MP-OSNs with headspace collections from 52 different complex, ecologically relevant odor sources using GC-SSR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). These odor sources included 34 fruits, seven microbes, and eleven types of mammal feces. Our GC-SSR measurements revealed that each of the tested headspace collections triggered a response from at least one palp OSN type. Fecal, fruit and microbial volatiles elicited responses from six, five and two palp OSN types, respectively. The pb2B MP-OSN was activated exclusively by fecal volatiles, whereas the other five types were activated by fruit, microbial, and fecal volatiles."

We performed a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on a presence/absence matrix for the SSR active peaks across the tested samples using Bray-Courtis dissimilarity. This analysis indicated that the 52 headspace collections were separated into three distinct groups; one group for fruit samples, another group for microbial samples and the last group for fecal samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The significance of the differences between these three groups was assessed by the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) score (R = 0.61, p&lt;0.0001).

In this odor space, odors with similar descriptors mapped close to each other, whereas odors with diverse descriptors distributed widely. Indeed, compounds that activated different MP-OSNs differed in their descriptors and, hence, distributed widely in the two-dimensional odor space. Compounds, however, that activated the same MP-OSN clustered together except for the ligands recognized by pb2A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

In order to predict which of these two receptors could detect which of the pb2A ligands, we included (-)-fenchone, a previously identified best ligand for Or85e (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goldman et al., 2005</a>), in our PCA. (-)-fenchone distributed widely from furaneol methylether and instead clustered with the other three ligands of pb2A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

Three of the compounds were primarily detected by the MP-OSNs as the 10<sup>\u20135</sup> detection threshold for these Ant-OSNs was two orders of magnitude higher than the 10<sup>\u20137</sup> detection threshold for MP-OSNs. In addition, the number of spikes elicited by these three compounds at any tested concentration from MP-OSNs is significantly higher from Ant-OSNs except for phenethyl propionate at 10<sup>\u20135</sup> concentration from pb3B and ab10A. The fourth activator, butyl 3-hydroxy butyrate, was primarily detected by the Ant-OSN ab2B. The detection threshold of ab2B to this compound was one order of magnitude (10<sup>\u20135</sup> dilution) lower than that of the corresponding MP-OSN pb3A (10<sup>\u20134</sup> dilution). Together, this data suggests that the MP-OSNs are either the sole or the primary detectors of ecologically relevant concentrations of 5-hexen-3-one, 4-ethylguaiacol, methyleugenol, furaneol methylether, phenol, 2-phenethyl acetate, and phenethyl propionate (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

We used trap and T-maze assays to measure short-range attraction, and wind tunnel assays to measure long-range attraction. In trap and T-maze experiments, we used 10<sup>\u20134</sup> concentration, which is similar to the concentration used to measure the specificity of these ligands to different OSN types. In wind tunnel experiments, we used 10<sup>\u20132</sup> concentration because the wind tunnel is supplied with a continuous airstream (0.3\u2009m/s), which further dilutes this concentration. Six out of the eight tested compounds were behaviorally active; two compounds, 5-hexen-3-one and furaneol methylether, in T-maze assays, four compounds,\u00a04-ethylguaiacol, methyleugenol, 2-phenethyl acetate and phenethyl propionate,\u00a0in trap assays, and one compound, furaneol methylether, in wind tunnel assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). The finding that odors are differentially attractive in the trap and the T-maze assays is not new. E.g, the well-known <i>Drosophila</i> attractant, ethyl acetate, is attractive in T-maze assays (<a href=\"#bib11\">Farhan et al., 2013</a>) and neutral in trap assays (<a href=\"#bib18\">Knaden et al., 2012</a>). Part of the explanation of this variation might be due to flies flying in traps assays for 24\u2009hr, while walking in T-maze assays for only 40\u2009min. However, as so far never any odor was observed to be attractive in one and repellent in the other assay, we regard each odor that elicited at least attraction in one assay as attractive."

Sensilla were localized under a binocular at 1000\u00d7 magnification, and the extracellular signals originating from the OSNs were measured by inserting a tungsten wire electrode into the base of a sensillum. The reference electrode was inserted into the eye. Signals were amplified (10\u00d7; Syntech Universal AC/DC Probe; <a href=\"http://www.syntech.nl\">www.syntech.nl</a>), sampled (10,667 samples/s), and filtered (100\u20133000\u2009Hz with 50/60-Hz suppression) via a USBIDAC connection to a computer (Syntech). Action potentials were extracted using Syntech Auto Spike 32 software. For SSR, neuron activities were recorded for 10\u2009s, starting 2\u2009s before a stimulation period of 0.5\u2009s. Responses from individual neurons were calculated as the increase (decrease) in the action potential frequency (spikes/s) relative to the prestimulus frequency. For GC-SSR, neuron activities were recorded for 1220\u2009s, the time of a single GC run. For GC stimulation, 1\u2009\u03bcl of the odor sample was injected into a GC (Agilent 6890, column: DB5, 30\u2009m long, 0.32\u2009mm id, 0.25\u2009\u03bcm film thickness; inlet at 250\u00b0C, oven: 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, then 15\u00b0C min<sup>-1</sup> up to 250\u00b0C, held for 5\u2009min; carrier gas: helium, 2.0\u2009ml min<sup>-1</sup> constant flow). The GC was equipped with a 4-arm effluent splitter (Gerstel, <a href=\"http://www.gerstel.com\">www.gerstel.com</a>), with split ratio 1:1 and N2(30.3 kPa) as makeup gas. One arm was connected with the flame ionization detector (FID) of the GC and the other arm introduced into a humidified air stream (200\u2009ml min<sup>-1</sup>). GC-separated components were directed toward the palps of the mounted fly. Signals from OSNs and FID were recorded simultaneously. Headspace samples were analyzed by GC-MS (Agilent 6890GC &amp; 5975bMS, Agilent Technologies, <a href=\"http://www.agilent.com\">www.agilent.com</a>)."

The reason for performing these experiments with only females is that hungry females live longer than hungry males. For 24\u2009hr, flies could enter (but not leave) these containers through a pipette tip (tip opening, 2\u2009mm). Containers were equipped with the lid of an Eppendorff cap that was loaded with either an odorant or solvent. The attraction index (AI) was calculated as AI = (O\u2212C) / 30, where O is the number of flies entered the odorant containing trap and C is the number of flies entered the solvent containing trap. The index could range from -1 (complete avoidance) to 1 (complete attraction). A value of 0 characterizes no response, i.e. the odor is not detected or is neutral. Experiments were carried out in a climate chamber at 20, 25 or 30\u00b0C and 70% humidity. Experiments were started in the morning with 12\u2009hr of white light, followed by 12\u2009hr of no light."

The lids of the Eppendorff caps contained 0.5\u00a0ml agar (1%) that was loaded either with 50\u2009\u03bcl of the odorant or with solvent only. The positions of odorant and solvent within the t-mazes were changed repeatedly.

The authors use single sensilla electrophysiological recordings and GC-MS to isolate odors that activate the different classes of palp neurons in <i>melanogaster</i>, determine the sensitivity of the response, and compare with antennal sensitivity. They show that these odors influence short- and long- range olfactory behaviors and require the maxillary palp. Moreover, <i>suzukii</i> palp responds to the same odors. Overall, this is a potentially important analysis of olfactory responses in the maxillary palp and the role of these odors in behavior. However, there are major concerns about the methodology and documentation of the study that must be addressed."

However, it has been shown many times that, whether a fly becomes attracted or not by an odorant strongly depends on the bioassay. We therefore decided to use several bioassays. We agree that for the most attractive odorant one would assume that the fly becomes attracted in all assays. However, as already shown even for the well-known attractant ethyl acetate, some assays fail to show attraction (ethyl acetate: Knaden et al. 2012). We, therefore regard an odor as attractive if it at least provokes attraction in one of the assays used. We added \u201cThe finding that odors are differentially attractive in the trap and the T-maze assays is not new. E.g., the well-known <i>Drosophila</i> attractant, ethyl acetate, is attractive in T-maze assays (Farhan et al., 2013) and neutral in trap assays (Knaden et al., 2012). Part of the explanation of this variation might be due to flies flying in traps assays for 24 h, while walking in T-maze assays for only 40 min. However, as so far never any odor was observed to be attractive in one and repellent in the other assay, we regard each odor that elicited at least attraction in one assay as attractive.\u201d"

Interestingly, the aversion elicited by this concentration was independent of functioning Ors (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and Figure 5\u2014source data 2). We, therefore, excluded this concentration in our further experiments.\u201d"

An AI of 0 depicts equal attraction of odor and solvent, while an AI of 1 is a result of strong attraction to the odor (-1: strong repellency of the odor). Hence, by testing the result against 0, one tests, whether the odor is more (or less) attractive than the solvent control.
