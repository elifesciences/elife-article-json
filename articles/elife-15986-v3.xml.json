However, it is unclear whether such firing represents the animal\u2019s intended destination or the execution of a specific trajectory. To distinguish between these possibilities, Lister Hooded rats (n = 8) were trained to navigate from a start box to three goal locations via four partially overlapping routes. Two of these led to the same goal location. Of the cells that fired on these two routes, 95.8% showed route-dependent firing (firing on only one route), whereas only two cells (4.2%) showed goal-dependent firing (firing similarly on both routes). In addition, route-dependent place cells over-represented the less discriminable routes, and place cells in general over-represented the start location. These results indicate that place cell firing on overlapping routes reflects the animal\u2019s route, not its goals, and that this firing may aid spatial discrimination."

One way of answering this question is to study the brains of rats, because the basic plan of a rodent\u2019s brain is similar to that of other mammals, such as humans. For example, the brains of rodents and humans both contain a structure called the hippocampus, which plays important roles in navigation and spatial memory. Cells within the hippocampus called place cells support these processes by firing electrical impulses whenever the animal occupies a specific location."

However, when a rat repeatedly traverses the same location on its way to different destinations, the place fields of hippocampal place cells are strongly modulated by where the animal is going or where it has come from (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wood et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Frank et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bower et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ainge et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ji and Wilson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ferbinteanu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Allen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Catanese et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ito et al., 2015</a>).

Place fields on the central stem and on adjacent portions of the maze often exhibited strong modulation depending on the goal box the animal was headed towards (see Figure 3 in <a href=\"#bib2\">Ainge et al., 2007</a>). One interpretation of this \u2018splitter cell\u2019 pattern of firing (hereafter differential firing) is that it represents the animal\u2019s intended destination."

It is possible that the prospective differential firing observed in the overlapping portions of the routes did not reflect the intended goal location per se, but rather the position along one of four separate trajectories. In this view, differential firing reflects routes, as opposed to goals. This distinction between executing a series of responses and learning a goal location has a long tradition in spatial learning (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tolman et al., 1946</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">McCutchan, 1947</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Restle, 1957</a>)."

If differential firing on the overlapping sections of different trajectories reflects the animal\u2019s intended destination, then firing on the overlapping sections of the two routes leading to the same goal should be similar (but should differ from firing on the routes leading to other goals). In contrast, if differential firing reflects position along a specific route, the firing on these two routes should differ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Our results support the latter interpretation. Place cells with fields on the overlapping portions of different routes leading to a common goal showed strong differential firing, and failed to show similar firing on different routes leading to the same goal."

Additionally, both a permutation <i>F</i>-test and Generalized Linear Model provided similar results (see tables 1\u20134 in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Although the results of the rANCOVA are reported here, we note that other analyses may yield greater numbers of differential cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Prerau et al., 2014</a>). In the maze environment, 284 place cells were assessed by rANCOVA in at least one of the four sectors that were analysed for route/goal-dependent activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; start box, central stem, left stem and right stem). Of these, 161 cells (57%) showed differential firing in at least one sector based on the rANCOVA results. Examining each of the four sectors of the maze separately, 83/176 assessed cells (47%) showed significantly different firing rates in the start box between the four trajectories (termed differential firing; see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). 61/158 (43%) cells showed differential firing in the central stem, and 16/124 (13%) and 14/115 (12%) showed differential firing in the left and right stems respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Examples of these cells can be seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4s2\">2</a>. In the start box, differential firing did not reflect anticipatory firing before the holding block was removed, as cells with differential firing did not differ from other active place cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; (<i>F</i>(1,257) = 0.25, p&gt;0.80, <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03b7</mi><mi>p</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>&lt;0.10, tested by repeated measures ANOVA looking at firing rate x time bin (four equally spaced intervals) x cell type)."

Therefore, we focussed only on the cells with differential activity, as identified by a rANCOVA analysis of firing rates in the start box or central stem. From post-hoc multiple comparison analyses between the four routes, we identified those cells that had significantly different firing on one of the four routes than on each of the other three (e.g. higher firing in the central stem on Route 1 than on Routes 2, 3 and 4), and also those cells which fired at a significantly different (higher or lower) rate on Routes 2 and 3 than on Routes 1 and 4, and whose firing rates did not differ between Routes 2 and 3. Examples of cells which exhibited differential firing are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Overall, 48 cells were identified with one of these patterns of activity, and of these, 9 cells fired at a significantly different rate on Route 1 than on the other 3 routes, 13 cells fired at a significantly different rate on Route 2, 18 cells fired at a significantly different rate on Route 3, and 6 cells fired at a significantly different rate on Route 4. Only two cells fired similarly and at a significantly higher rate for Routes 2 and 3 than for Routes 1 and 4.

First, for the majority (95.8%) of place cells which fired significantly differently on at least one of the routes to the Centre Goal Box, firing appeared to be related to the specific intended route. In only two (4.2%) of the cells did the firing rate appear to be related to the intended goal, independent of the route. This pattern of results is significantly different than expected if equal numbers of cells had coded Route 2, Route 3 and both routes (<i>X<sup>2</sup></i>(1, <i>N</i> = 33) = 25.49, p&lt;0.0001, Fischer\u2019s exact test). Second, of the cells included in this analysis, 69% (33/48) fired preferentially on one (or both) routes to the Centre Goal Box (Routes 2 or 3), whereas only 31% (15/48) fired preferentially on one of the routes to the outer goals (Routes 1 or 4). The probability of observing this pattern of results by chance is also low (<i>X<sup>2</sup></i>(1, <i>N</i> = 48) = 6.75, p&lt;0.015, Fischer\u2019s exact test), and indicates significantly more route coding for the two routes to the Centre Goal Box than to the two routes to the outer goal boxes. In the segments of the maze just after the first choice point, 30 cells (16 or 12.9% in the left stem, 14 or 12.2% in the right stem) were found to fire significantly differently depending on the trajectory of the animal. Over-representation of Routes 2 and 3 also appeared to be present here, however this effect is not statistically significant (<i>X<sup>2</sup></i>(1, <i>N</i> = 30) = 0.53, p&gt;0.5, Fischer\u2019s exact test; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) Left, the result of Spearman\u2019s correlations comparing the firing of all place cells, from all rats and sessions in each pair of goal boxes, depending on the route taken to get there (i.e. firing in the Left Goal Box at the end of Route 1, the Centre Goal Box when at the end of Route 2, the Centre Goal Box at the end of Route 3 and finally the Right Goal Box at the end of Route 4). Correlations comparing the firing in each box to itself were not calculated and have thus been coloured white. Correlations are generally high, however, correlations comparing firing in the Centre Goal Box when it was accessed using the two different routes are the highest (i.e. Route 2 vs. Route 3 and vice versa), confirming that cells fire similarly in this box regardless of the route taken to get there. This suggests that rats and cells considered the Centre Goal Box to be one coherent spatial location. (<b>B</b>) Right, the results of a shuffling procedure to determine if the correlations are higher than would be expected by chance. Only those correlations between firing in the Centre Goal Box for Routes 2 and 3 are statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). This test confirms that firing in the Centre Goal Box is more similar than would be expected by chance and that this firing is more similar than that between other pairs of goal boxes."

In many cases, however, it is unclear what this differential firing represents. In a continuous maze, differential firing appears to represent previous locations early in the common stem of the maze, and intended destinations later in the common stem (<a href=\"#bib9\">Catanese et al., 2014</a>). In discrete trial tasks, where the animal is picked up and returned to a start box on each trial, the finding that place cells are active on journeys to one goal box and not active for journeys to other goal boxes has been interpreted as an encoding of the animal\u2019s intended destination (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ainge et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2012</a>)."

Thus the modulation of place cell firing observed in this task might not represent the intended destination per se, but rather a read-out of a specific trajectory sequence (as in <a href=\"#bib34\">Pastalkova et al. [2008]</a>). To differentiate between these possibilities, we tested animals on a task where two different routes led to the same goal location. Differential place cell firing on the overlapping portions of these routes would suggest that such activity encodes specific routes. Similar firing on the two routes would be consistent with the encoding of a common intended destination."

Of the cells with differential firing in the start box and central stem which fired preferentially on trajectories to the Centre Goal Box, nearly 96% showed differential firing between the two potential routes. Furthermore, at an ensemble level, the firing rate of place cells in the start box or central stem was sufficient to decode the animal\u2019s route at an above chance level, regardless of which route was taken. This indicates that the ensemble firing of place cells carries sufficient information to distinguish the two central routes to the shared goal location and is thus also route-dependent, and not goal-dependent."

We attempted to address this by training a second, na\u00efve group of rats on the same task but without the transparent goal barrier. However, the majority of these animals formed a strong bias for one of the two routes to the Centre Goal Box. Thus, given the choice, the rats appeared to minimize the number of trajectories to learn, suggesting that even in the absence of a barrier, rats choose to solve the task in terms of routes, not goals. Similar navigation has been suggested in baboons, who simplify a complex jungle environment to a limited number of favourite routes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Byrne et al., 2000</a>). The potential biasing of place cell representations is consistent with previous reports of differential place cell firing with respect to deprivation state (i.e., hunger or thirst) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kennedy and Shapiro, 2009</a>), spatial strategy (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferbinteanu et al., 2011</a>), type of reward (<a href=\"#bib4\">Allen et al., 2012</a>), or order of non-spatial (olfactory) stimuli (<a href=\"#bib5\">Allen et al., 2016</a>).

They trained rats on a plus maze task, and showed that even when the animal took indirect trajectories to a goal, differential retrospective firing was observed. That is, retrospective place cell firing depended on which maze arm the rat started from, regardless of its subsequent trajectory. A likely possibility is that the hippocampus represents both where the animal is going, and where it has been.

One possibility is that in mazes where rats run overlapping routes but represent these independently, over-representation is expected for the common segments of the maze. A second, intriguing possibility is that the dorsal hippocampus represents distance to a goal, and this is more apparent in structured tasks with constrained routes. Recent findings suggest that in humans, the posterior hippocampus - which corresponds to the rodent dorsal hippocampus - exhibits more activation the farther one is from a navigational goal (<a href=\"#bib21\">Howard et al., 2014</a>)."

Over-representation may be the result of the recruitment of additional neural resources in the face of a difficult discrimination. The hippocampus has been implicated in the discrimination of structurally similar spatial environments (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sanderson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aggleton and Pearce, 2001</a>), and it is possible that the similarity of two central routes requires greater hippocampal resources to discriminate, yielding an increase in route specific firing."

Finally, we found that place fields over-represent the early portions of the maze, and difficult-to-discriminate routes. These results suggest that although the hippocampus represents places, the firing of place cells can also represent well-learned routes.

The recording cable passed signals through a ceiling mounted slip-ring commutator (Dragonfly Research and Development Inc., Ridgeley, West Virginia) to a pre-amplifier where they were amplified 1000 times. The signal was then passed to a system unit; for single unit recording the signal was band-pass (Butterworth) filtered between 300 and 7000\u2009Hz. Signals were digitized at 48 kHz and could be further amplified 10\u201340 times at the experimenter\u2019s discretion.

All alleyways and octagonal enclosures were painted blue and the maze was elevated 60\u00a0cm from the floor on wooden stools. A moveable wooden barrier (10 cm wide 25 cm tall) could be placed at the exit of the start box to confine the rat to the start box. A moveable transparent Perspex barrier (also 10 \u00d7 25 cm) could be used at one or other entrance to the central goal box to prevent the animal entering the goal box via that entrance. The maze was curtained off from the remainder of the room on the left with a large white sheet. On the right wall there was a large window blackout shutter, and on the wall in front of the maze was an upwardly directed light source. To add to the distinctiveness of the goal boxes within the maze, each contained a different object: a small grey elephant statue, a small white opaque bottle with cork stopper, and a small black and red box with slanted lid. Each goal box also had a Latin alphabet character in a different reflective colour affixed to the wall. Heavy ceramic reward dishes were placed in each goal box, directly beneath these reflective letters. The start box did not contain any objects, but an orange fluorescent star was affixed to the block which kept the animal from entering the alleyways."

We hoped that the rats would sample both routes at a roughly equal frequency without needing to direct their behaviour within blocks of trials to the Centre Goal Box. These rats were trained for a total of 12 sessions. Unfortunately, all of the rats rapidly developed a preference for only one route to Centre Goal Box (mean 71% of trials via preferred route), and thus this variant of the task was unsuitable for assessing differences in place cell activity between routes and goals."

This was repeated for every session included in the analysis. In order to calculate the probability of correct matches being made by chance, we also repeated the above process 10000 times using four goal vectors where the identity of the route (but not of the contributing neuron) were shuffled, therefore disrupting any relationship between firing rate and the animal's trajectory. The probability that the proportion of correct matches made in our unshuffled analysis was the result of chance was estimated by calculating the percentile position of our observed proportion of matches in the distribution observed in the shuffled data. We did this using a kernel smoothed cumulative density function - Matlab function <i>ksdensity.</i> An Epanechnikov kernel was employed as it is one of the most widely used, optimal filters and we set bandwidth to the \u2018default\u2019 mode for all distributions. A brief outline of this process can be seen in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. We reasoned that if the central routes were represented more similarly (due to goal location dependent firing at an ensemble level) then we would expect an above chance level of matches between trajectories along Route 2 and the goal vector calculated for Route 3 (and vice versa) or we may expect fewer correct matches for the central routes than for the outer ones."

The brain was extracted and stored in 4% formalin for at least seven days prior to any histological analyses. The brains were sliced in 32\u00a0\u00b5m sections on a freezing microtome at \u221220\u00b0. These sections were stained with a 0.1% cresyl violet solution and the slice best representing the electrode track was then imaged using ImageJ software (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda)."

The authors utilize a novel maze comprising multiple routes with overlapping goal locations to discern the ontology of \"splitter\" place cells, spatially selective neurons that exhibit differential firing rates according to the rat's intention. They find that a remarkably high number of neurons modulate their activity in anticipation of the route that the rat will take, demonstrating that the activity of the hippocampus reflects how the animal will accomplish its task and not just the intended goal. Though the experimental design is strong and the data are compelling, I have some concerns about the appropriateness of some of the analyses."
