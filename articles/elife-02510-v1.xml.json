Post-transcriptional mechanisms likely make important contributions to mRNA abundance rhythms. We have investigated how microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to core clock and clock-controlled gene expression using mice in which miRNA biogenesis can be inactivated in the liver. While the hepatic core clock was surprisingly resilient to miRNA loss, whole transcriptome sequencing uncovered widespread effects on clock output gene expression. Cyclic transcription paired with miRNA-mediated regulation was thus identified as a frequent phenomenon that affected up to 30% of the rhythmic transcriptome and served to post-transcriptionally adjust the phases and amplitudes of rhythmic mRNA accumulation. However, only few mRNA rhythms were actually generated by miRNAs. Overall, our study suggests that miRNAs function to adapt clock-driven gene expression to tissue-specific requirements. Finally, we pinpoint several miRNAs predicted to act as modulators of rhythmic transcripts, and identify rhythmic pathways particularly prone to miRNA regulation."

Post-transcriptional mechanisms likely make important contributions to mRNA abundance rhythms. We have investigated how microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to core clock and clock-controlled gene expression using mice in which miRNA biogenesis can be inactivated in the liver. While the hepatic core clock was surprisingly resilient to miRNA loss, whole transcriptome sequencing uncovered widespread effects on clock output gene expression. Cyclic transcription paired with miRNA-mediated regulation was thus identified as a frequent phenomenon that affected up to 30% of the rhythmic transcriptome and served to post-transcriptionally adjust the phases and amplitudes of rhythmic mRNA accumulation. However, only few mRNA rhythms were actually generated by miRNAs. Overall, our study suggests that miRNAs function to adapt clock-driven gene expression to tissue-specific requirements. Finally, we pinpoint several miRNAs predicted to act as modulators of rhythmic transcripts, and identify rhythmic pathways particularly prone to miRNA regulation."

These experiments, which involved \u2018knocking out\u2019 a gene that is essential for the production of microRNAs, show that rather than setting the mRNA rhythms, the microRNAs appear to adjust them to meet the specific needs of the liver. Targeting specific microRNA molecules may reveal new strategies to tweak these rhythms, which could help to improve conditions when metabolic functions go wrong."

In mammals, a master pacemaker in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronises subsidiary oscillators present in most peripheral cell types (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib25\">Dibner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Mohawk et al., 2012</a>). Timekeeping by peripheral and SCN clocks relies on negative transcriptional feedback loops that engender oscillatory gene expression. In the core loop, BMAL1:CLOCK transcription factor heterodimers drive the expression of repressors, encoded by the <i>Period (Per1,2)</i> and <i>Cryptochrome (Cry1,2)</i> genes. PER:CRY protein complexes subsequently accumulate in the nucleus and repress BMAL1:CLOCK-mediated transcription. Due to their instability, repressor protein and mRNA abundance rapidly drops below the threshold required for autorepression, clearing the way for a new cycle. The mechanisms that control the stability of clock proteins have been studied to considerable extent and frequently involve post-translational protein modifications that control proteasomal degradation (e.g., <a href=\"#bib109\">Yagita et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Eide et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Shirogane et al., 2005</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib70\">Mehra et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chong et al., 2012</a>). It is less well understood how the decay of core clock mRNAs is controlled (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib51\">Kojima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Lim and Allada, 2013</a>)."

In mouse liver, up to 15% of expressed mRNAs accumulate in a rhythmic fashion (<a href=\"#bib104\">Vollmers et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Mohawk et al., 2012</a>). At least in part, the synergistic activation of genes by circadian and tissue-specific transcription factors may account for the rhythmic expression of cell type-specific transcripts. Conceivably, tissue-specific post-transcriptional regulation could participate in this endeavour as well. Recent studies in liver have indeed suggested that a substantial proportion of mRNA abundance rhythms is generated post-transcriptionally (<a href=\"#bib49\">Koike et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Le Martelot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Menet et al., 2012</a>) and have speculated on the involvement of miRNAs in this process (<a href=\"#bib72\">Menet et al., 2012</a>)."

Mammalian genomes encode &gt;1000 miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bentwich et al., 2005</a>) and each may have hundreds of targets. It has thus been estimated that up to 60% of mammalian protein-coding transcripts can be regulated by miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>). It is therefore likely that these regulatory molecules carry functions in circadian gene expression as well, both at the level of the core clock and clock output genes. The antisense-inactivation of miR-219 and miR-132 in the SCN has indeed been reported to result in mild lengthening of period and in defective light-induced clock resetting, respectively (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cheng et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, an elegant study by <a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al. (2013)</a> has recently reported dramatic period shortening (\u22482 hr) of free-running rhythms in miRNA-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), likely caused by the lack of three miRNAs (miR-24, miR-29a, miR-30a) targeting <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> mRNAs. Other miRNAs have been noted for their capacity to regulate core clock transcripts as well (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kiriakidou et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Meng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Nagel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Tan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Shende et al., 2013</a>), but their circadian functions in vivo are still unclear. Similarly, the functions that miRNAs assume in clock output pathways have barely been investigated in mammals, except in a few cases. The <i>mir122</i> locus thus encodes a highly abundant, hepatocyte-specific miRNA involved in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib54\">Krutzfeldt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Esau et al., 2006</a>) that is clock-controlled in mouse liver (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gatfield et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Menet et al., 2012</a>). Mature miR-122 appears to act as a modulator of circadian output pathways, despite being non-rhythmic due to its high metabolic stability (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gatfield et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Kojima et al., 2010</a>).

We have addressed the following main questions. What functions do miRNAs have in the regulation of the hepatic core clock? To what extent do miRNAs contribute to the post-transcriptional generation of mRNA rhythms? And third, for transcripts subject to both miRNA regulation and cyclic transcription, how do these mechanisms integrate and cooperate to yield the net rhythmic output? Finally, the comprehensive atlas of miRNA-dependent (circadian and non-circadian) gene expression established in this study exhaustively charts the regulatory space that miRNAs occupy in liver gene expression and may thus serve as an important resource beyond chronobiology."

We used mice carrying conditional knockout alleles for the <i>Dicer1</i> gene (termed <i>Dicer</i><sup><i>flox</i></sup> in the following), which encodes the ribonuclease that converts pre-miRNAs to mature miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Harfe et al., 2005</a>), and a <i>Cre-ER</i><sup><i>T2</i></sup> recombinase expressed as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-controlled transgene in the 3\u2032 UTR of the endogenous <i>Albumin</i> locus (<i>Alb</i><sup><i>Cre-ERT2</i></sup> in the following) (<a href=\"#bib89\">Schuler et al., 2004</a>).

We thus first confirmed their suitability for efficient miRNA depletion in the livers of adult animals. To this end, we analysed the kinetics of recombination at the <i>Dicer</i> locus at different timepoints after intraperitoneal tamoxifen (tx) injection. Recombination was undetectable before but highly efficient from 2 to 3 weeks after tx treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We assessed the consequences on miRNA expression by northern blot analysis probing for the highly abundant, hepatocyte-specific miR-122, which has been previously noted for its long half-life (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gatfield et al., 2009</a>) and thus served as a proxy for overall miRNA depletion from hepatocytes. One month after tx treatment, miR-122 was virtually undetectable (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Moreover, loss of mature miR-122 was accompanied by increased levels of its precursor, pre-miR-122 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>), as expected (<a href=\"#bib41\">Harfe et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, we observed that at later timepoints beyond 2 months after tx treatment, miR-122 expression began to recover (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). The most likely explanation for this observation was that after miRNA loss the liver eventually renewed its hepatocytes from a cell population that had escaped recombination. In summary, we concluded that our experimental system appeared suitable for the efficient knockout of <i>Dicer</i> and, at least judging by miR-122, for the depletion of miRNAs. Approximately 1 month after tx treatment appeared to represent a suitable timepoint for experiments aiming at a comparison of knockout with control animals."

A littermate control group was treated identically. We combined both wild-type and heterozygous males for controls because a single functional <i>Dicer</i> allele was sufficient to ensure miRNA processing to wild-type levels (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), as expected from previous studies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Harfe et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kanellopoulou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Murchison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Frezzetti et al., 2011</a>).

Microarray (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) and northern blot analyses (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) showed that beyond miR-122, miRNA levels were globally decreased. Other hepatocyte-enriched miRNAs (e.g., miR-148a, miR-192 and miR-194 [<a href=\"#bib97\">Sun et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Landgraf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Tang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Farid et al., 2012</a>]) were thus virtually undetectable in knockouts. Probably owing to their expression also in non-hepatocyte cells, known ubiquitous miRNAs (e.g., miR-21 [<a href=\"#bib58\">Landgraf et al., 2007</a>], miR-26a, or let-7 family members [<a href=\"#bib56\">Lagos-Quintana et al., 2003</a>]) decreased less strongly, and miRNAs with a particularly strong expression in non-hepatocytes (e.g., miR-126 in hepatic stellate cells [<a href=\"#bib39\">Guo et al., 2013</a>]) were almost unchanged, as expected (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). In all cases, reduced miRNA levels correlated with increased pre-miRNA abundance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Moreover, even in the knockout, pre-miR-122 still showed rhythmic accumulation with a trough at ZT12 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>), which was a consequence of clock-driven rhythmic transcription at the <i>mir122</i> gene locus (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gatfield et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Menet et al., 2012</a>). Other clock-controlled genes such as <i>Dbp</i> (<a href=\"#bib83\">Ripperger et al., 2000</a>) still oscillated as well (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We thus concluded that cyclic gene expression per se was still functional in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts and that the RNA time series collected from the two genotypes was suitable to uncover the effects of miRNA loss on the rhythmic expression of core clock and clock output genes in hepatocytes."

How these events are elicited, and in which order they occur, is still subject of ongoing debate.

We chose a protocol for library generation that was based on the random priming of rRNA-depleted (\u2018Ribo-Zero\u2019) total RNA, which permitted the simultaneous quantification of mRNAs (exon-mapping reads) and pre-mRNAs (intron-mapping reads). Given that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally and is relatively fast, the intron-containing pre-mRNAs are short-lived and their abundance can serve as a proxy for gene transcription rates (<a href=\"#bib49\">Koike et al., 2012</a>). This strategy thus identifies post-transcriptional (mRNA) gene expression changes that occur in the <i>Dicer</i> knockouts and likely represent bona fide miRNA targets, as opposed to transcriptional changes (mRNA and pre-mRNA affected), which likely represent secondary effects of miRNA loss. Conceivably, any transcription factor that is a direct miRNA target would engender numerous such secondary effects."

The intersecting set (mRNA and pre-mRNA detected in knockout and control) contained 11,990 genes (89.4%); another 361 transcripts (2.7%) common to both genotypes corresponded to intronless genes. To assess the changes engendered by miRNA loss, we first compared mRNA and pre-mRNA levels separately between the genotypes (averaging over timepoints). It was apparent that <i>Dicer</i> deficiency caused large changes in mRNA and pre-mRNA abundance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Applying a 1.5-fold cut-off on differential expression, we found that 30.3% of mRNAs and 15.5% of pre-mRNAs were significantly changed in the <i>Dicer</i> knockout. These changes were skewed towards increased levels for mRNAs (19.8% increased, 10.5% decreased) but slightly less so for pre-mRNAs (9.8% increased, 5.7% decreased). In summary, these findings confirmed our expectation that global miRNA loss would lead to the widespread de-repression of targets that affected a substantial part of the transcriptome. Inevitably, these primary effects would provoke numerous secondary responses involving altered transcription. Striking transcriptional effects were detected for several imprinted loci and for a group of known development-specific and sexually dimorphic genes (see <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> for examples), as previously reported from <i>Dicer</i> knockouts (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hand et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Sekine et al., 2009a</a>).

Using experimentally validated targets (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hsu et al., 2011</a>) of miR-122 as a positive control and of miR-124 as a negative control (this miRNA is not expressed in liver, [<a href=\"#bib58\">Landgraf et al., 2007</a>]), we indeed observed that the majority of miR-122 targets showed increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts, whereas most miR-124 targets did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Ribosomal protein mRNAs, whose 3\u2032 UTRs are particularly short (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caldarola et al., 2009</a>) and thus probably not regulated by miRNAs, did not show increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios either (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>).

With regard to mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios, the transcripts of the <i>Period</i> gene family (<i>Per1, Per2, Per3</i>) showed a moderate (average 1.6-fold), but significant increase in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The time-resolved RNA-seq data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) confirmed that <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> mRNAs accumulated to higher levels throughout the day despite similar rhythmic pre-mRNA abundance. For <i>Per3</i>, the higher mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio mainly resulted from decreased transcription (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, we noticed that <i>Cry2</i> showed post-transcriptional up-regulation in the <i>Dicer</i> knockout and was thus a potential miRNA target, although the case was less clear than for <i>Per1</i> or <i>Per2</i> since <i>Cry2</i> transcription was increased at certain timepoints as well. Beyond these genes, the expression of most other core clock components, including <i>Cry1</i>, <i>Clock</i>, <i>Bmal1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and others (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) only showed minor changes, if at all. Consistent with the mRNA profiles, western blot analysis confirmed an estimated twofold increase in the levels of PER2 protein and 1.5-fold higher CRY2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Surprisingly, PER1 levels were barely increased (1.1-fold higher). A number of mechanisms could account for the observed uncoupling of protein from mRNA levels, including secondary effects of miRNA loss acting on <i>Per1</i> mRNA translation or the protein degradation machinery. While we cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism that is operative in counter-regulating <i>Per1</i> mRNA increase, it is interesting to note that the RNA binding protein <i>Syncrip</i> (also known as <i>hnrnp q</i>) is a positive regulator of <i>Per1</i> translation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) and showed decreased expression in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, however, it was clear that core clock functionality was overall unimpaired, as also exemplified by the virtually unchanged expression profiles of genes that are directly regulated by CLOCK:BMAL1, PERs and CRYs, such as <i>Dbp</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

It has indeed recently been reported that the period length of free-running rhythms in <i>Dicer</i>\u2013deficient MEFs is dramatically shortened by \u22482 hr (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the authors identified the lack of miRNA-mediated repression of <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> as the underlying mechanism. We thus measured free-running rhythms in liver explants from <i>Dicer</i> knockout and control mice carrying the <i>mPer2</i><sup><i>Luc</i></sup> reporter allele (<a href=\"#bib115\">Yoo et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, our experiments showed a trend towards period lengthening in knockout liver explants with a period that was on average 41 min longer than in controls.

Indeed, a previous study had noted that many genes that had failed to pass the imposed rhythmicity criteria on the transcriptional level visibly still exhibited transcriptional patterns that resembled those of the mRNA, albeit with much higher variability (<a href=\"#bib72\">Menet et al., 2012</a>)."

A heatmap representation confirmed pronounced rhythmicity mainly at the control mRNA level, as expected, but also suggested that a considerable number of transcripts possibly still possessed underlying, yet noisier rhythms at the level of control pre-mRNA and/or <i>Dicer</i> knockout mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We thus examined all profiles individually, also taking into account mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio changes occurring in the <i>Dicer</i> knockouts (in total 93 of the 290 transcripts in sector I thus had increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios in knockouts, see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The visual inspection confirmed that only a minority of transcripts showed the features expected for true miRNA-driven post-transcriptional rhythmicity and that, instead, many of the non-rhythmic assignments were probably a result of noisier data (Supplementary file 1 in <a href=\"#bib27\">Du et al., 2014</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> for whole transcriptome gene expression plots and rhythmicity parameters). Visual selection resulted in no more than 20 transcripts for which we would confidently postulate that their rhythmic accumulation could indeed be miRNA-driven. As shown for <i>Ddx17, Slc1a5, Stx2, Uba6, Zfp697</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013I</a>) and others (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), these transcripts were all characterised by relatively low amplitude rhythms. As a validation with an independent technique, we confirmed the circadian expression detected by RNA-seq for two of the genes, <i>Stx2</i> and <i>Uba6</i>, also by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). In summary, these findings suggested that miRNAs are only of marginal importance as drivers of circadian rhythmicity. Although we were able to identify several transcripts whose cyclic accumulation was <i>Dicer</i>-dependent and occurred post-transcriptionally, miRNA-mediated mechanisms can probably not account for the previously observed large discrepancy between mRNA and transcription rhythms (<a href=\"#bib49\">Koike et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Le Martelot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Menet et al., 2012</a>)."

The top and lower panels show the transcripts with (N = 167) and without (N = 505), respectively, significantly increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts. (<b>C</b>) Analysis of how the <i>Dicer</i> knockout changes the phases of rhythmic mRNA accumulation. Rhythmic transcripts from (<b>B</b>) are plotted according to the difference of the phase delay between mRNA and pre-mRNA peak in <i>Dicer</i> knockout vs control (abscissa; the further to the right a transcript is located, the later its mRNA is shifted in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts) and according to the change in mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio (ordinate; transcripts at the top of the panel thus become more stable in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts). Transcripts with significantly higher mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts are marked in red. Red and black vertical lines correspond to mean phase shifts for the two groups of transcripts. The blue line shows the correlation of phase delay and mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio over all transcripts (Pearson's r(670) = 0.17; p=9.24e\u221206). Difference in phase delays between the two groups of transcripts was tested using Wilcoxon rank sum test (W(672) = 30,799; p=1.72e\u221207). At the top of the graph, the cumulative density plot shows that the two groups of transcripts are clearly separated. (<b>D</b>) Analysis of how the <i>Dicer</i> knockout changes the amplitudes of rhythmic mRNA accumulation. Rhythmic transcripts from (<b>B</b>) are plotted according to how the ratio of the mRNA amplitude divided by the pre-mRNA amplitude is changed between <i>Dicer</i> knockout and control (abscissa; the further to the left a transcript is located, the lower the amplitude becomes in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts) and according to the change in mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio on the ordinate, as in (<b>C</b>). Red and black vertical lines correspond to mean amplitude changes of transcripts with and without increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios. The blue line shows the correlation of amplitude change over all transcripts (Pearson's r(670) = \u22120.0965; p=1.23e\u221202). Difference in amplitudes between the two groups of transcripts was tested using Wilcoxon rank sum test (W(672) = 36,518; p=9.39e\u221203). (<b>E</b>) Expression plots for six examples of transcripts whose phases are post-transcriptionally delayed in the absence of miRNAs. <i>Aco2, Fbxo21, Nampt, Ngfr, Pppde1</i> and <i>Sgpl1</i> thus all have similar phases of rhythmic transcription (pre-mRNA) in <i>Dicer</i> knockout (red) and control (blue) (right panels), but their mRNA accumulation is shifted to later times in the knockouts (left panels). Dotted lines represent the cosine curve fits. (<b>F</b>) Examples of transcripts showing amplitude effects. <i>Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b</i> and <i>Net1</i> thus all have similar transcriptional amplitudes in <i>Dicer</i> knockout (red) and control (blue) (right panels), but the loss of miRNAs reduces the mRNA amplitudes (left panels).

First (panels <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>), independently for each gene the 12 timepoints were randomly permutated 10,130 times. For each individual permutation, the same newly shuffled order was applied genewise identically across control/knockout and mRNA/pre-mRNA. In the newly created data sets, rhythm detection, and analysis (phase and amplitude determination) were performed in an identical fashion to the analysis of the orginal data shown in the manuscript. Red triangles on the abscissa represent where the original data is located in the distribution of the random data sets. Collectively, these analyses show that there is not per se a trend in the data or its distribution that would lead to similar findings (later phases, shallower amplitudes upon miRNA loss) just by chance. (<b>A</b>) Left panel shows the distribution of phase delay differences between \u2018higher mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio in <i>Dicer</i> KO\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019 rhythmic transcripts from the permutated data and in the original data (reported values correspond to difference between vertical black and red lines in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Only in 2.8% of cases did random permutations give a global phase delay difference effect that was as distant from 0 as the experimental data. Moreover (middle panel), none of the permutations had a similarly high Wilcoxon statistics (reported in top left corner of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) as the experimental data; Wilcoxon test statistics were converted to z-scores in order to ensure comparability between experimental and permutated data sets, which differ in the number of rhythmic transcripts (N = 182.1 \u00b1 10.6; mean \u00b1 SD). Finally (right panel), similarly good Pearson's coefficients of the correlation between phase delay difference and mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios (shown in blue in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) only occurred in 4.7% of permutations. (<b>B</b>) Analogous analysis as in (<b>A</b>), but for amplitudes. Since the <i>Dicer</i> KO and control data sets kept their genotype identities in the reshuffling of time points, amplitude effects were overall conserved even after permutation, as expected. In a second permutation analysis (panels <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>), time points were kept in the original order, but the assignment to \u2018<i>Dicer</i> KO\u2019 or \u2018control\u2019 was switched randomly. Downstream analyses as in (<b>A</b>) and (<b>B</b>). (<b>C</b>) None of the 10,010 permutations had a comparable or stronger phase difference (left panel) analogous to that shown by vertical black and red lines in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> or a comparable Wilcoxon test z-score (middle panel). Similar or stronger Pearson's correlation coefficients were only found in 0.03% of permutated data sets.

We thus calculated the time lag between the transcripts' pre-mRNA and mRNA peaks for the <i>Dicer</i> knockouts, and subtracted the equivalent values calculated from the control mice. Positive and negative \u2018phase delay differences\u2019 thus signified that in the <i>Dicer</i> knockout, mRNA accumulation peaked later and earlier, respectively, than in controls (an additional analysis of absolute pre-mRNA and mRNA phases can be found in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Phase delay differences were plotted against the mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio change (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; the 167 transcripts with a significantly higher ratio in the knockout are marked in red). This analysis revealed a shift to later phases of mRNA accumulation in the <i>Dicer</i> knockout, which correlated with increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios (blue line in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; Pearson's r(670) = 0.17; p=9.24e\u221206). In the absence of miRNAs, mRNAs with significantly increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios thus peaked on average 48 min later (vertical red line in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), whereas the average for all other rhythmic transcripts (vertical black line) lay at 5 min. Both groups of transcripts, that is those that showed higher mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios and those that did not, were significantly different (p-value 1.72e\u221207; Wilcoxon rank sum test; cumulative density plot at the top of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Although the globally detectable effect of miRNA loss on the phases of mRNA rhythms was relatively modest (less than 1 hr), individual transcripts were affected more dramatically (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). For genes such as <i>Aconitase 2 (Aco2), F-box protein 21 (Fbxo21), Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt)</i> or <i>Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr),</i> the phase-shifts amounted to several hours (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

                                "text": "Using a similar approach, we next assessed how the loss of miRNAs influenced the amplitudes of mRNA rhythms. For each transcript, we calculated the ratio of the mRNA amplitude to the pre-mRNA amplitude in the <i>Dicer</i> knockout and divided this value by the corresponding ratio in control mice. We thus found that miRNA loss led to globally shallower amplitudes in the <i>Dicer</i> knockout (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), although the mean effect was small and amounted only to a 7% decrease in fold-amplitude (see difference between red and black vertical lines in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; p-value for difference between transcripts with and without increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratio: 9.39e\u221203; Wilcoxon rank sum test). Nevertheless, individual examples clearly suggested that miRNAs assume important functions in ensuring that rhythmically transcribed genes give rise to rhythmic mRNAs that oscillate with the desired amplitudes and magnitudes, as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> (qPCR validations in <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5C,D</a>) for the expression of <i>DNA methyltransferases 3A (Dnmt3a)</i>, <i>3B (Dnmt3b)</i> and <i>Neuroepithelial cell transforming gene (Net1),</i> as well as for several other genes in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a><i>.</i> In some cases, such as <i>Lysosomal acid lipase A (Lipa)</i>, rhythmicity generated at the pre-mRNA level was completely lost at the mRNA level when miRNAs were absent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Here, miRNA-mediated decay could thus represent the mechanism ensuring that after cyclic transcription, mRNAs are sufficiently unstable to show rhythmic accumulation at all. Interestingly, the protein encoded by <i>Lipa</i>, lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), is the key enzyme hydrolysing cholesteryl esters and triglycerides stored in lysosomes after LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Fouchier and Defesche, 2013</a>) and has been reported to be rhythmic in liver, but non-rhythmic in other organs (<a href=\"#bib99\">Tanaka et al., 1985</a>). Conceivably, miRNAs could be involved in rendering <i>Lipa</i> rhythms tissue-specific."

                                "text": "Altogether the effects of miRNA loss on amplitudes were less uniform than those on phases (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Several reasons could account for this difference. First, we noticed that amplitude estimations appeared technically more error-prone than phase estimations. Both parameters were read from cosine curves fitted to the data, but the peak-trough symmetry imposed by the cosine function frequently resulted in the underestimation of amplitudes; this was especially the case for high amplitude rhythms with pronounced \u2018spiky\u2019 appearance (i.e., with rapid rising and declining phases; see cosine fits of <i>Nr1d1/Rev-erb\u03b1</i> and <i>Dbp</i> in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, miRNAs likely only represent one of several mechanisms operative in amplitude modulation; direct consequences of miRNA loss on target mRNA amplitudes might thus be partially masked by secondary effects occurring in the <i>Dicer</i> knockouts. Third, the model of how phases and amplitudes should ideally correlate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) is almost certainly an oversimplification. Indeed, for transcripts such as <i>Cpeb1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), later phases were even accompanied by higher amplitudes. Globally, there was indeed no significant correlation between phase delays and amplitude decreases (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). An uncoupling of amplitude and phase effects could occur, for example, through miRNA activity that is not constant over the day but confined to specific timepoints (\u2018Discussion\u2019). Overall, we concluded that the phase delays seemed to be the dominant, consistent consequence of miRNA loss in liver. Nevertheless, both the amplitude decrease and the phase delay were individually highly significant, as also shown by permutation tests in which we randomly reshuffled either the timepoints of the original data or the <i>Dicer</i> KO/control assignments on a genewise basis, followed by analyses of rhythm parameters. Among &gt;10,000 datasets with permuted timepoints, the likelihood of finding similar or stronger delays in phase difference (in both size and significance) or correlations (between mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios and phase difference) than those in the original data were very low (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The observed shift in phase differences was therefore not an intrinsic data set property. By contrast, because the expression level differences (<i>Dicer</i> KO vs control) were untouched by the reshuffling of timepoints, a sizeable number of permutations still showed amplitude effects comparable to the original data (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, when reshuffling occurred at the level of the genotypes, the permuted data no longer retained any trend reminiscent of the original data, neither for phases nor for amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). We concluded that the correlations uncovered between miRNA loss and rhythmic gene expression parameters were not likely to have arisen by chance, for example as a result of a specific predisposition of the data structure or distribution that could have occurred in our particular time series and the downstream analyses."

Using the same data set of circadian transcripts as before (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), several over-represented GO terms could be identified with statistical significance (FDR-adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) in the group of rhythmic transcripts with increased mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts, but not among the remaining rhythmic transcripts. However, the enrichment was relatively low, indicating that the function of miRNAs in regulating circadian gene expression was broad rather than confined to specific rhythmic functions. The individual GO terms affected three major fields: cell adhesion, apoptosis/development, and (lipid) metabolism. In particular, the latter caught our attention because serum analyses of <i>Dicer</i> knockout animals indicated metabolic phenotypes as well, especially for cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels, which were all reduced (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At least in part, these effects were likely mediated by the loss of miR-122, whose inactivation has previously been shown to impact lipid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib54\">Krutzfeldt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Esau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gatfield et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Wen and Friedman, 2012</a>)."

Ideally, the targeted inactivation of single miRNAs that fulfil prospective functions in circadian regulation would allow for more straightforward investigations. To identify such miRNAs, we analysed whether the circadian transcripts that became more stable in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts were enriched for predicted miRNA binding sites (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, this analysis revealed nine miRNA seed families with more circadian targets than expected by chance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) specifically in the data set with higher mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios. Of these, miR-25, miR-92, miR-122, miR-22, and miR-29 are expressed at readily detectable levels in liver, as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib58\">Landgraf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gatfield et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Vollmers et al., 2009</a>) and confirmed by northern blot (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and small RNA-seq (data not shown).

Interestingly, miR-29 is also one of the miRNAs that was reported to regulate <i>Per1</i> in MEFs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013</a>).

Nevertheless, before embarking on follow-up experiments for individual transcripts, validation experiments to map miRNA binding sites in the targets' 3\u2032 UTRs and to identify the responsible miRNAs will be necessary. To this end, we designed a luciferase reporter assay based on the lentiviral transduction of <i>Dicer</i> knockout and control primary hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We chose the core clock transcripts to demonstrate the utility of the assay, as we were particularly intrigued by the difference in phenotypes between the <i>Dicer</i> knockout in liver (i.e., mild period lengthening, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) and the previously reported strong period shortening in MEFs (\u22482 hr), which the authors attributed to miRNA-regulation of <i>Per1</i> (by miR-24 and miR-29) and <i>Per2</i> (by miR-24 and miR-30) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). We tested whether the firefly luciferase reporter gene carrying the full-length <i>Per1, Per2</i> or <i>Cry2</i> 3\u2032 UTRs (or fragments thereof) was subject to de-repression in <i>Dicer</i> knockout hepatocytes, as compared to control hepatocytes. Consistent with the RNA-seq and western blot analyses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), this assay indeed identified <i>Per2</i> as the main miRNA-regulated core clock component (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Moreover, truncated versions of the 3\u2032 UTR that contained the miR-24 and miR-30 sites identified by Chen et al. recapitulated some of the miRNA regulation observed for the full-length <i>Per2</i> 3\u2032 UTR sequence. However, additional regulation was also conferred by a portion of the 3\u2032 UTR containing a predicted target site for the miR-25/92 seed family (fragment 1739\u20132129, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and full regulation may thus require the synergistic activity of several sites. <i>Per1</i> and <i>Cry2</i> full-length 3\u2032 UTRs showed 1.2-fold and 1.8-fold up-regulation, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This was in the same range as what we had observed for the endogenous proteins by western blot (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In particular, the lack of strong <i>Per1</i> regulation in liver was a striking difference to the MEF data and could be responsible for phenotypic differences, as Chen et al. have proposed that the faster translation and higher accumulation of PERs (approximately twofold higher PER1 and PER2 peak levels in <i>Dicer</i> knockout) shortens the time delay within the oscillator's main feedback loop and speeds up the clock. It is possible that tissue-specific miRNA expression contributes to the observed differences; in line with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib105\">Vollmers et al., 2012</a>), we have thus observed that miR-30 is among the most abundant miRNA species in liver (within the top 10 of miRNAs detected by small RNA-seq), but that miR-29 and miR-24 are expressed at lower levels (not in the top 50) (data not shown), which could thus partially explain the comparably weak effect of the <i>Dicer</i> knockout on PER1 in liver. In summary, in addition to shedding light on miRNA regulation of core clock transcripts, we concluded that the reporter assay in hepatocytes represented a useful tool for future studies aimed at verifying direct miRNA targets and at unravelling the contribution of specific miRNAs."

This phenotype is a plausible consequence of the approximately twofold increase in expression of PER2, which we identified as the main miRNA-regulated core clock component in hepatocytes. Mice in which <i>Per2</i> levels are increased due to additional <i>Per2</i> transgenes thus show a similar period lengthening (<a href=\"#bib38\">Gu et al., 2012</a>), while <i>Per2</i> knockout mice have short periods before becoming arrhythmic (<a href=\"#bib118\">Zheng et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2001</a>). Conceivably, the longer period seen in <i>Dicer</i> knockout liver explants is masked in the animal due to constant entrainment by the SCN and other cues. It is well possible that a phenotype will manifest in knockouts only under conditions that bring the steady-state relationship between entrainment cues and the liver clock out of equilibrium, such as in jet lag or food shifting experiments (<a href=\"#bib23\">Damiola et al., 2000</a>); this situation would be consistent with models stating that miRNAs confer robustness to oscillatory networks and denoise negative feedback loops (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cohen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gerard and Novak, 2013</a>).

Interestingly, an earlier study on the SCN clock has revealed brain-specific miR-219 and miR-132 as regulators of period length and light-induced clock resetting, respectively (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cheng et al., 2007</a>). It is thus tempting to speculate that miRNAs generally function to post-transcriptionally tune the core clock in a cell type-specific fashion.

To this end, we found that miRNAs contributed only marginally to generating transcript rhythms at the post-transcriptional level. Less than 2% of all rhythmic mRNAs thus fulfilled our criteria for miRNA-driven rhythmicity and the identified examples (e.g., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013I</a>) showed low amplitude cycling. This finding is consistent with the notion that miRNAs are usually highly stable molecules and generally not expected to show pronounced daily variations in abundance (see below). By contrast, we have found that miRNAs exert important functions in refining the rhythmic mRNA accumulation profiles of cyclically transcribed genes. We thus estimate that for about 30% of the rhythmic transcriptome, miRNA-mediated regulation adds an additional layer of post-transcriptional control. Concretely, the absence of miRNAs caused a global shift of mRNA accumulation to later phases during the day. Moreover, peak-to-trough amplitudes of mRNA accumulation were overall reduced in <i>Dicer</i> knockouts, although this effect was globally smaller and more variable across the transcriptome. These results establish that miRNAs are in charge of an important regulatory control level sandwiched between rhythmic transcription and the final rhythmic mRNA and, eventually, protein output. Because many miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, they may thus be key to converting rhythmic transcriptional information into the desired tissue-specific rhythmic outcome. Our miRNA target prediction analysis would suggest that a discrete group of miRNAs (miR-25/92, miR-122, miR-22 and miR-29) is specifically involved in the post-transcriptional tuning of circadian transcripts in the liver. Using the lentiviral reporter system, it will be possible to confirm some of the predicted miRNA-target interactions in hepatocytes, which could then form the basis for targeted experiments in which the expression of individual miRNAs is manipulated, for example by genetic or antisense loss-of-function techniques."

Several miRNAs have been previously reported as potentially rhythmic in mouse liver (<a href=\"#bib76\">Na et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Vollmers et al., 2012</a>), but our small RNA-seq profiling (data not shown), as well as previous analyses of individual miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gatfield et al., 2009</a>) could not confirm high-cycling miRNA species. Similarly, the recently reported circadian expression of <i>Dicer</i> itself (<a href=\"#bib110\">Yan et al., 2013</a>) was not evident from our data (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Collectively, these findings suggest that the potential for rhythmic miRNA activity in mouse liver is relatively low. However, our approach, which analyses miRNA activity almost exclusively from the perspective of miRNA targets, cannot resolve this issue; a dedicated study would thus be informative."

                        "text": "The <i>Dicer</i> knockout allele that we have used (<a href=\"#bib41\">Harfe et al., 2005</a>) has previously served as an entry point to define the role of miRNAs in many other fields (e.g., <a href=\"#bib42\">Harris et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Sheehy et al., 2010</a>). In spite of the insinuated universality of miRNA loss, there are some limitations to the approach. First, in a few exceptional cases, miRNA biogenesis can be independent of canonical Dicer processing, for example for miR-451 (<a href=\"#bib111\">Yang and Lai, 2011</a>). This miRNA is indeed not depleted from <i>Dicer</i> knockout livers (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> and data not shown). Moreover, similar to most other studies, we deduced miRNA activity from target mRNA abundance. This approach seems justified overall because genome-wide measurements of miRNA action on mRNA and protein levels have shown that these correlate generally well (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baek et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Selbach et al., 2008</a>). Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that miRNAs may affect mRNA levels less strongly than protein levels (<a href=\"#bib92\">Selbach et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Yang et al., 2010</a>), and that mRNA changes can even be absent altogether (e.g., <a href=\"#bib9\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</a>). Finally, distinguishing direct from indirect effects in <i>Dicer</i> knockout data is challenging. We have used a measure of mRNA stability (mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios) to deplete our dataset of gene expression changes that involve altered transcription and that are probably mostly indirect. However, in specific cases miRNAs have been reported to directly interfere with transcription through promoter complementarity (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib44\">Huang and Li, 2012</a>). Obviously, our analyses miss direct effects of miRNAs that are not post-transcriptional. On the other hand, the use of increased mRNA stability (mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios) to enrich for likely direct miRNA targets will inevitably result in false-positives that are post-transcriptionally regulated due to indirect effects, for example because components of the mRNA decay machinery are direct miRNA targets. In spite of these caveats, our study represents a comparatively complete analysis of miRNA activity in liver and should prove a valuable resource for further investigations of circadian and non-circadian functions that these regulatory molecules exert in hepatic gene expression, metabolism, and physiology."

Sequencing runs were only then allowed into our data analysis work flow, if their statistics related to quality of base calling and to preliminary alignment against mouse genome were within three standard deviations of the mean of all runs. The five quality related statistics used were the percentage of clusters passed filtering (%PF clusters), mean quality score (PF clusters), percentage of reads aligned, mean alignment score and percentage of alignment error, and had the following population means and standard deviations, respectively, 93.39 \u00b1 1.85, 36.34 \u00b1 0.5, 72.24 \u00b1 3.0, 290.6 \u00b1 15.13 and 0.98 \u00b1 0.15. Presence of adapter sequences in the datasets was checked with cutadapt utility (<a href=\"#bib68\">Martin, 2011</a>). Less than 0.65% of the reads were estimated to include an adapter sequence longer than 10 bps; and more than 95% of such reads were left unmapped after the alignment of the reads to the mouse genome. Therefore, it was not necessary to trim reads to remove the adapter sequences."

Prior to flattening, transcript isoform models whose expression was not evidenced by count data or splice junction coverage were removed from the annotation database. This was achieved first by estimating the expression level of each isoform contained in Ensembl database by cufflinks software version 2.0.2 (<a href=\"#bib102\">Trapnell et al., 2010</a>) with following parameters: -G Mus_musculus.GRCm38.68.gtf -u -j 0.8 -m 160 -s 50 -N. Isoform models which did not comprise at least 5% of the total expression of the locus or which were only expressed in fewer than three samples were excluded from the gene annotation database. Furthermore, spliced isoform models, whose splice junctions were not covered on average by 6 reads, or 40% or more of whose splice junctions were not covered at least by 6 reads were also removed from the annotation database. In addition to the removal of non-supported isoform models, novel exons overlapping with reference on the opposite strand were identified and added to the annotation database to improve the unambiguity of read counting. Briefly, cufflinks was run in reference annotation based transcript (RABT) mode (<a href=\"#bib84\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>) and isoform models were assembled with cuffmerge software. Novel exon models with a class code \u2018X\u2019, which overlap with a reference exon on the opposite strand, were then validated by splice junction coverage as outlined before and added to the annotation database.

To adapt the harmonic regression to sequencing count data, several modifications were introduced. First, a negative binomial generalised linear model (GLM), with a log link function was used to regress the rounded normalised counts on a cycle with a 24-hr period. Count data were not detrended or smoothened before the regression. Dispersion values that were already fitted for each gene during DE analysis were used as an estimate of the shape parameter theta. From the fitted parameter values, then, amplitude and phase estimates were calculated for each gene. The goodness-of-fit for the harmonic model (sinusoidal expression) was tested with a likelihood ratio test against the updated null model including only the intercept parameter (constant expression).

Combining two complementary tests in this way provided for relatively low stringency in rhythm detection, which we deemed important in particular for the pre-mRNA data, which is naturally noisier due to the low abundance of short-lived pre-mRNA molecules."

The most intriguing aspect of the poor overlap was the fact that many transcripts appeared to become rhythmic in the Dicer KO (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, sectors B-D). We used GO term analysis (Table S3) to obtain an idea of the biological basis and visual inspection of the affected genes to confirm the findings. Interestingly, these analyses showed that there were indeed many transcripts that \u2013 transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally \u2013 became rhythmic specifically in the <i>Dicer</i> knockouts. Many of these had connections to the cell cycle and DNA replication (e.g., the Mcm complex), showed high expression and high amplitude rhythms in the knockouts, but frequently lower expression in the controls. We have assembled a number of examples in <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 3</a>. In the initial version of the manuscript (in connection with <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1D,E</a>) we had speculated about increased cellular turnover rates in the <i>Dicer</i> knockouts. The synchronised expression of cell cycle and DNA replication genes confirms this initial suspicion and is in line with findings on the circadian gating of the cell cycle in the regenerating liver that was demonstrated by the Okamura lab 10 years ago (Matsuo et al. Science 2003). We have integrated the figure supplements in the main manuscript and describe the findings in the revised version."

However, as shown in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>, our reported phase delay phenotype was a rare event in the random data in terms of the magnitude of the effect (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>, left panel: only 2.8 % of permutations showed a similar or greater delay), its statistics calculated by the Wilcoxon test (not a single permutation was as significant) and the Pearson\u2019s correlation between phase delay differences and mRNA/pre-mRNA ratios (4.7 % of permutations did equally well or better).

While in this manuscript we do not have the means to conclude on the exact mechanism(s) that is (are) operative in counter-regulating the <i>Per1</i> mRNA increase on the protein level, it is interesting to note that there is an RNA binding protein, hnRNP Q/Syncrip, which has been reported to enhance the translation of <i>Per1</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lee et al. 2012</a>). In the <i>Dicer</i> knockout, <i>hnRNP Q</i> mRNA shows decreased expression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), which could thus lead to decreased PER1 translation and protein abundance, hence counteracting increased mRNA levels."

This mechanism could therefore contribute to regulating translational efficiencies for endogenous <i>Per1</i>, but not for the luciferase reporter, which only carries the <i>Per1</i> 3\u2019 UTR."
