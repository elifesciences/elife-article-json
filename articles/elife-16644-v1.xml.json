Here we assess the impact of HIV co-infection on the emergence of resistance and transmission of <i>Mtb</i> in the largest outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB in South America to date. By combining Bayesian evolutionary analyses and the reconstruction of transmission networks utilizing a new model optimized for TB, we find that HIV co-infection does not significantly affect the transmissibility or the mutation rate of <i>Mtb</i> within patients and was not associated with increased emergence of resistance within patients. Our results indicate that the HIV epidemic serves as an amplifier of TB outbreaks by providing a reservoir of susceptible hosts, but that HIV co-infection is not a direct driver for the emergence and transmission of resistant strains."

Here we assess the impact of HIV co-infection on the emergence of resistance and transmission of <i>Mtb</i> in the largest outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB in South America to date. By combining Bayesian evolutionary analyses and the reconstruction of transmission networks utilizing a new model optimized for TB, we find that HIV co-infection does not significantly affect the transmissibility or the mutation rate of <i>Mtb</i> within patients and was not associated with increased emergence of resistance within patients. Our results indicate that the HIV epidemic serves as an amplifier of TB outbreaks by providing a reservoir of susceptible hosts, but that HIV co-infection is not a direct driver for the emergence and transmission of resistant strains."

This observation is possibly explained by differing manifestation of TB in HIV positives, namely less frequent cavitation and lower pulmonary bacillary load (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kwan and Ernst, 2011</a>). External factors such as social isolation or HIV infected patients being followed up more closely than HIV negatives may also contribute to this pattern (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kwan and Ernst, 2011</a>). Indeed, in a low-incidence setting of close follow-up, HIV co-infection was associated with reduced TB transmission (inferred by clustering) and TB among HIV co-infected was at least partly due to transmission from HIV-negative patients (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fenner et al., 2012</a>)."

The isolates were collected from patients with known HIV status from the mid-90s until 2009, providing important temporal information. To assess the impact of HIV co-infection on <i>Mtb</i> evolutionary rates, we estimated mutation rates in the terminal branches of a time-labelled phylogenetic tree, roughly corresponding to the evolutionary history of individual clinical <i>Mtb</i> isolates within sampled patients. We also inferred transmission networks by implementing a novel epidemiological model accounting for the long latency of TB. Finally, we estimated the length of the latent period by combining the results of the phylogenetic reconstruction and inferred transmission networks."

A large fraction of isolates from before 2001, which includes the peak of the outbreak, were lost in a freezer accident. From 2003 to 2009, the M strain caused 228 cases in Argentina, of which 143 genomes were available (63%), 116 isolates were sequenced from HIV positive patients and 85 from negatives. Lost isolates amounted to 40 positives and 25 negatives. For these years there are hence no reason to suspect any bias in the HIV status of the sampled patients (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>; p\u00a0=\u00a00.53).

We found that the resistance load was near identical between <i>Mtb</i> isolates from HIV positive and negative patients (mean = 5.99 and 6.04 respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2b</a>).

To investigate the impact of HIV co-infection on evolution of new resistance, we collected available treatment history for patients from whom isolates with terminal branch resistance mutations had been sampled (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>: Treatment histories). We excluded secondary mutations in resistance genes, namely <i>katG</i> and <i>rpoB</i> mutations, in isolates already harboring high-level resistance mutations in these genes. These mutations could either be random events or be involved in fitness compensation, but not resistance per se. We then excluded isolates collected from patients who had not been treated with drugs relevant for the terminal branch resistance mutation, as these most likely represent mutations that evolved in unsampled cases and subsequently transmitted to a sampled secondary case. This left 13 resistance mutations that evolved with high probability during therapy in 11 patients (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Nine events of acquired resistance occurred in seven HIV negatives and four in HIV positives. Based on the frequency of HIV co-infection among the sampled patients, HIV negative patients were overrepresented among cases of acquired resistance, but the difference was not significant (p=\u00a00.24, Fisher\u2019s exa\u00a0ct test). While the sample size is arguably small, this finding does also not implicate HIV as a driver of Mtb drug resistance within the outbreak."

This was needed because a phylogeny is not directly informative about transmission events as a result of within-host diversity and evolution (<a href=\"#bib14\">Didelot et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pybus and Rambaut, 2009</a>). Our methodology is briefly outlined below and explained in more details in the materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section. A coalescent within-host model (<a href=\"#bib12\">Didelot et al., 2014</a>) was combined with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) epidemiological model (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lekone and Finkenst\u00e4dt, 2006</a>). The likelihood of transmission from one host to another can be computed under this combined model, and this calculation was performed for all pairs of individuals with one acting as potential infector and the other as potential infectee. The likelihood calculation relies solely on the dates at which the two individuals were sampled, their relative position on the phylogeny, and whether the putative infector was smear positive or negative. It does not incorporate other information such as HIV status, so that these effects can be tested separately."

The infectious period includes time from symptom onset to infection clearance. A standard method for diagnosing TB is direct microscopy of sputum smears. If bacteria are visible under the microscope, the case is denoted smear positive. If no bacteria are observed, but <i>Mtb</i> can be cultured from the sputum, the case is culture positive but smear negative. Smear positive cases transmit TB far more efficiently on average than smear negative cases. We thus applied a so-called smear-correction, penalizing transmission event likelihoods involving a smear negative transmitter by multiplying likelihood values with 0.05."

Four pairs of household contacts were identified as likely transmission pairs by the genomic analysis. All four were among the 35% most likely transmission events, and two among the top 25%. The SNP differences between these epi-pairs ranged from one to three SNPs (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>: SNP distances between epi-pairs). The remaining two epi-pairs were not identified as likely transmission events. These included one pair of household contacts and one pair of isolates from the same patient taken 4.5 years apart. The genomic differences were nine and five SNPs respectively, which explains why the model did not identify these as likely transmission pairs. Interestingly, drug resistance had evolved in one of the epidemiologically linked isolates in both of these pairs, but in none of the four other pairs. We previously showed that a large number of mutations can hitchhike in the genetic background of resistance mutations sweeping to fixation and hypothesized that such selective sweeps could potentially confuse the reconstruction of transmission events (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eldholm et al., 2014</a>). These two cases might well exemplify such a situation. However, it cannot be ruled out that the epi-links actually represent independent sources of infection (re-infection in the serially sampled patient)."

For pairs of samples connected by a transmission event, transmission of <i>Mtb</i> from host A to B must happen after the date of the node connecting the two isolates in the Bayesian phylogeny (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Didelot et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2013</a>). The date of transition from silent infection to active TB is unknown, but must happen before sampling time, when the active status is known. An upward biased estimate for the length of latency period of individual <i>j</i> is therefore given by the difference between the date of the MRCA of the transmitter <i>i</i> and the receiver <i>j</i> (when <i>j</i> was not yet infected) and the date of sampling of <i>j</i> (by which time <i>j</i> had developed active TB). Although this estimator clearly overestimates the latency period, there is no <i>a priori</i> reason to suspect that the bias should be different between HIV negatives and positives. Any significant difference is therefore likely to reflect a difference in length of the actual latency period. Accordingly, we extracted the length (in years) of the branches separating the MRCA and recipient of the transmission pairs and stratified the data by HIV status of the recipient."

Again, we expected the proportion of genuine transmissions to increase in frequency as we restricted the analysis to a smaller subset of the best-supported transmissions. The length of the branches leading to HIV negative hosts was significantly longer than for HIV positive hosts when including all 251 estimated transmission events (p&lt;0.001), and this difference remained significant for all three subsampling regimes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Another meta-study found that HIV positive status was associated with both increased and decreased diagnostic delay, depending on study setting (<a href=\"#bib41\">Storla and Yimer, 2008</a>). The study most relevant to the current setting was conducted in 2005 in Buenos Aires and other Argentinean provinces and found a delay of about three months, with no significant effect of HIV status (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zerbini et al., 2008</a>). As the difference in TB activation time we infer between HIV- and HIV+ is several times higher than the diagnostic delay reported in any setting, we feel confident that it reflects faster progression to active TB in HIV+ patients."

However, our outbreak analysis is necessarily restricted to people who develop active TB, and in this subset of cases, HIV co-infection seems to be associated with a relatively modest acceleration of TB progression, speeding up the process by about 11 months. We do not know when individual patients contracted TB and HIV respectively. Hypothetically, the accelerating effect of HIV co-infection on TB progression is likely to be underestimated in patients who were infected with HIV significantly later than TB. Conversely, patients who were infected with TB late in the study period might be enriched for HIV co-infection as these patients were more likely to develop TB in time for inclusion in the study. However, as the study period was relatively long, we do not believe this potential bias to have significantly affected our results."

The HIV prevalence in Argentina is approximately 0.4% (in 2001 and 2014) (<a href=\"#bib47\">World Health Organization,\u00a02013</a>), whereas the proportion of HIV co-infected individuals is 60.7% within the M outbreak. These numbers demonstrate that HIV infection is a massive risk factor for developing TB with the MDR M strain. We found that HIV co-infection is associated with a moderately faster, yet statistically significant, progression to active TB. As this subtle effect of HIV status on time to active TB cannot explain the far higher incidence of the M strain in HIV positives, this suggests that the main effect of HIV co-infection is to increase the absolute risk of developing active TB. In other words, we surmise that a large proportion of HIV negatives infected by the M strain will not progress to active TB but for those that do, the latency period is only slightly longer than for HIV positives."

Clinical data on HIV progression was not available and we were thus unable to quantify the effect of anti-retroviral treatment by stratifying our analyses by CD4 counts. We predict CD4 counts would correlate negatively with TB progression. However, we do not expect that antiviral therapy (and increased CD4 counts) would nullify the effect of HIV on TB progression. Indeed, it has been shown that TB incidence during highly active anti-retroviral treatment is significantly higher than background levels even though a number of possible confounders makes the exact quantification of the effect of antiretroviral therapy challenging (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gupta et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Girardi et al.,\u00a02005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lawn et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lawn and Wood, 2005</a>)."

Restricting the transmission network analyses to the most likely transmission events did not affect our finding that HIV status does not significantly impact the transmissibility of <i>Mtb</i> (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). We also found that HIV co-infection does not affect the rate of <i>Mtb</i> evolution within patients. In fact, <i>Mtb</i> was found to accumulate more mutations in HIV negatives. This likely reflects the slower progression to active disease in this group, with these patients harboring <i>Mtb</i> for a more extended period relative to HIV positives. This pattern holds true also for antimicrobial resistance mutations, which were found to evolve significantly more often in HIV negatives than in HIV positives."

The likelihoods of transmission from smear negative individuals was multiplied by 0.05 to reflect the lower infectiousness of these individuals. The SEIR epidemiological model assumed in the calculations above implies that there is random mixing between the individuals, with every infectious individual being <i>a priori</i> equally likely to infect any susceptible individual. Although the assumption of random mixing is appealing in theory, in practice human population are well known to behave differently, with for example a strong effect of the household structure in the transmission patterns of many pathogens (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cauchemez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Whittles and Didelot, 2016</a>). Here we did not have information on the structure of the population and so could not integrate it in our model. Application of our methodology in a setting where such information is available could be performed simply by multiplying the likelihood values with the <i>a priori</i> probabilities of transmission caused by the host population structure."

From the remaining transmission events, we used Edmonds algorithm implemented in the RBGL R package (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carey et al.,\u00a02016</a>) to find the spanning arborescence of minimum weight (sometimes called an optimum branching). An optimum branching is a graph defined as a set of directed edges that contain no cycles and such that no two edges are directed towards the same node. In our reconstruction, such a graph contains <i>n</i> nodes, <i>n</i> being the number of isolates and <i>n-1</i> directed edges representing the transmission events. As our sampling of the outbreak was not exhaustive, we know that a proportion of direct transmission events did not happen. To deal with that situation, we used various thresholds of inferred transmission events with the highest associated likelihoods to plot the transmission graphs and analyze the distribution of transmission events."

These values of <i>N</i> and \u03b2 were selected to produce simulated outbreaks of roughly the same size as in the real data, and these values are not used for inference. The transmission tree generated by this simulation was recorded. A timed phylogeny was then constructed from the transmission tree, using a coalescent within-host evolutionary model with coalescent rate \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.83 per year, and leaves were randomly removed from this tree to simulate incomplete sampling of cases, keeping two thirds of the leaves in the second half of the outbreak to emulate the sampling frame in our study. The resulting phylogeny (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) was then analyzed in exactly the same way as the real data: the likelihood of transmission was computed for every pair of leaves, a transmission tree was deduced using Edmonds algorithm, and only the 25%, 35% or 45% most likely transmission links were retained to account for incomplete sampling. When applying these three thresholds to the simulated data, we found that the proportion of correctly inferred links were 74%, 69% and 63%, respectively. These results conform with our expectation given that there is significant uncertainty about who infected whom based on genomic data alone when accounting for extended periods of within-host evolution (<a href=\"#bib14\">Didelot et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Biek et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Didelot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Worby et al., 2014</a>)."

These parameters were selected based on the literature and clinical experience. The latent period can vary extensively between people. Approximately two months of diagnostic delay (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sreeramareddy et al., 2009</a>) plus two months from treatment onset to clearance of the MDR infection (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brust et al., 2013</a>) suggests that 120 days is a reasonable estimate of infectious period. Finally, A 20-fold decreased transmissibility of smear-negative cases was chosen as a reasonable parameter (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ma et al., 2015</a>). We performed a sensitivity analysis to test how reliable our results would be if any of these parameters were inaccurate. For each of the three parameters, we ran the analysis again considering double and half of their specified values above, and compared the reconstructed transmission links with those of the main analysis. In each case, the proportion of links identical with the main analysis was between 91% and 99%. We also performed an analysis in which no smear correction was applied and recovered 90.5% of the links in the main analysis."

Prevalence estimates from countries with lower GDP are indeed likely to be less robust as the coefficients between the significant correlations in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> (panels A, B and C) were substantially higher for the countries with high GDP. However, importantly, we never recovered a significant correlation between the prevalence of HIV and the proportion of TB that were MDR-TB. In <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure\u00a05\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, we report the correlations between the same variables than in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> for the 50% countries with highest GDP."

While the top X% analyses are affected by the same issue to a lesser extent, there could be another bias in these analyses since enriching for actual transmission pairs would seem to condition on there being at least 1 transmission from the putative source case and thereby eliminates (many of) the instances in which no TB transmission occurred.

In this scenario, TB would appear to have the same transmissibility among those who transmitted (i.e. 1 TB transmission per TB transmitter in each HIV group). However, this would give a misleading picture of the actual TB transmission potential of HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative individuals since coinfected people had an 80% probability of transmitting whereas HIV-negative people had a 60% chance of transmitting."

This finding strongly suggests that HIV was not a driver of <i>Mtb</i> drug resistance within the outbreak.\" Given that you indicate that these results strongly back up a key part of your findings, it is important that more information be provided. Specifically, it is unclear exactly which numbers were being compared in the test (e.g. was the null hypothesis that there should be a 50:50 split between HIV-positives and negatives, or was it directly comparing the fraction of mutations found in HIV-infected vs. uninfected individuals [though this would not seem to give the p-value reported]).

It does not rely on HIV status, so that the effect of HIV status on transmission can be tested independently. We have clarified this important point in the Results section (subsection \u201cEffect of HIV co-infection on TB transmission\u201d, first paragraph). The underlying epidemiological model is a SEIR model, which assumes random mixing of the population, and we have clarified this in the Methods section (subsection \u201cReconstruction of transmission chains and assessment of the impact of HIV co-infection\u201d, first paragraph) and now discuss how information on the host population structure could be integrated into our inferential framework.
