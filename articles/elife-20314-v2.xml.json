Although hermaphrodites might also benefit from the possibility of self-fertilization (and many do), most hermaphrodites\u00a0do all they can to avoid \u2018selfing\u2019 because it is often detrimental to a plant\u2019s fitness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Charlesworth and Willis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Barrett, 2002</a>).

The stigma sits on the end of a stalk called the style. Some flowers have long styles and hold their stamens, which produce pollen, deep in the floral tube, whereas others have short styles and hold their stamens much higher in the floral tube (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This means that pollen from a long-styled plant is more likely to pollinate a short-styled flower, and vice versa. Long- and short-styled plants may also differ in the size and colour of their pollen grains and the texture of their stigmas, and outcrossing is only possible between different morphs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barrett, 2002</a>). Remarkably, despite its complexity, heterostyly has evolved repeatedly in flowering plants and is found in at least 30 families, including the primroses (genus <i>Primula</i>)."

The presence or absence of the duplication has been maintained in the genus by a process called negative frequency-dependent selection, whereby the fitness of a trait (e.g. short styles) increases if it becomes rare, thus preventing its loss."

                        "text": "In his short autobiography, Darwin reflected that \"I do not think anything in my scientific life has given me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure of heterostylous flowers\". Like so much of his work, the hypothesis that he put forward has stood the test of time and remains the favoured explanation for how and why heterostyly evolved (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barrett, 2002</a>). By identifying the gene that controls style length, the work of Huu et al. is an important step towards understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in heterostyly. A future challenge is to understand the evolutionary history of the other genes involved in heterostyly and to work out what roles they play in flower development."
