How thalamocortical synapses are formed and maintained in this competitive environment is unknown. Here, we show that astrocyte-secreted protein hevin is required for normal thalamocortical synaptic connectivity in the mouse cortex. Absence of hevin results in a profound, long-lasting reduction in thalamocortical synapses accompanied by a transient increase in intracortical excitatory connections. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cortical neurons from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) revealed that, during early postnatal development, dendritic spines often receive multiple excitatory inputs. Immuno-EM and confocal analyses revealed that majority of the spines with multiple excitatory contacts (SMECs) receive simultaneous thalamic and cortical inputs. Proportion of SMECs diminishes as the brain develops, but SMECs remain abundant in Hevin-null mice. These findings reveal that, through secretion of hevin, astrocytes control an important developmental synaptic refinement process at dendritic spines."

The Puncta Analyzer plugin then uses an algorithm to detect the number of puncta that are in close alignment across the two channels, yielding quantified co-localized puncta.",

How thalamocortical synapses are formed and maintained in this competitive environment is unknown. Here, we show that astrocyte-secreted protein hevin is required for normal thalamocortical synaptic connectivity in the mouse cortex. Absence of hevin results in a profound, long-lasting reduction in thalamocortical synapses accompanied by a transient increase in intracortical excitatory connections. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cortical neurons from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) revealed that, during early postnatal development, dendritic spines often receive multiple excitatory inputs. Immuno-EM and confocal analyses revealed that majority of the spines with multiple excitatory contacts (SMECs) receive simultaneous thalamic and cortical inputs. Proportion of SMECs diminishes as the brain develops, but SMECs remain abundant in Hevin-null mice. These findings reveal that, through secretion of hevin, astrocytes control an important developmental synaptic refinement process at dendritic spines."

The most abundant cells in the central nervous system are star-shaped cells known as astrocytes, which secrete molecules that control the timing and extent of synapse formation. Many previous studies on synapses have used a type of neuron found in the eye\u2014called retinal ganglion cells\u2014because these cells can be purified and grown in the laboratory in the absence of astrocytes. Under these conditions, they form very few synapses. However, in the presence of astrocytes the retinal ganglion cells form many more synapses, which is thought to be due to a protein called hevin and several other proteins that are secreted by the astrocytes."

In the cortex of normal mice, the neurons generally form synapses with other neurons within the cortex, or with neurons from other parts of the brain that send long-distance projections into the cortex. The experiments revealed that fewer of these long-distance synapses formed in the cortex of the mice missing hevin compared to normal mice. When hevin was injected directly into the brains of the mice, more long-distance synapses were formed."

In mice missing hevin, the synapses were much smaller and the dendritic spines were thin and long, indicating that they were not fully grown. The images also show that in normal mice, the dendritic spines often have multiple synapses when the animal is young, but many are lost as the brain matures so that only a single synapse remains in each dendritic spine. However, multiple synapses persist in the dendritic spines of mice lacking hevin, which could lead to competition between short and long distance synapses and may contribute to neurological diseases."

In the mouse brain, innervation of the cortex by projecting neurites called axons begins during embryonic development and continues for the first several postnatal days (<a href=\"#bib13\">Garel and Lopez-Bendito, 2014</a>). Only after the axons project to their approximate target areas, hosting their suitable postsynaptic partners, does an intense period of synapse formation occur, corresponding roughly to the second and third postnatal weeks in mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2010</a>). Cortical excitatory synapses, which primarily use the neurotransmitter glutamate, are formed between dendritic protrusions called spines and axonal projections coming from two predominant inputs: intracortical and thalamic. Though the bulk of the cortical synapses from both of these inputs are made during the same early postnatal synaptogenic period (P5\u2013P21) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nakamura et al., 2005</a>), whether they form through similar or differential mechanisms is unclear."

In most cortical areas, VGlut1-positive (VGlut1+) intracortical projections greatly outnumber the VGlut2+ thalamic projections. The cellular and molecular mechanisms through which thalamocortical connections are established and maintained, despite steep competition from the vastly more abundant intracortical axons, have yet to be elucidated."

For example, hevin (a.k.a. synaptic cleft-1 or SPARC-like 1) is an astrocyte-secreted extracellular matrix protein that localizes to the clefts of excitatory synapses (<a href=\"#bib20\">Johnston et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lively et al., 2007</a>) and promotes excitatory synaptogenesis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</a>). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, here we show that in the cortex, hevin is specifically required for the formation of thalamocortical synapses. Moreover, using three-dimensional reconstructions of serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM)-imaged dendrites and axons, we show that P25 hevin KO dendritic spines often make multiple excitatory contacts with different axons."

The majority of these spines make two distinct types of synapses: one excitatory with an asymmetric postsynaptic density (PSD) opposed to an axon with round presynaptic vesicles, and one inhibitory synapse with a symmetrical PSD and flattened vesicles (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones and Powell, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Knott et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). A small percentage, however, make multiple excitatory contacts (termed SMECs, i.e., <span class=\"underline\">s</span>pines with <span class=\"underline\">m</span>ultiple <span class=\"underline\">e</span>xcitatory <span class=\"underline\">c</span>ontacts). We found that SMEC structures are frequent earlier in development at P14 in WT but essentially disappear by P25, indicating that they represent a transient stage in synaptic spine maturation. This developmental refinement is impaired in hevin KO mice. Moreover, using both confocal imaging as well as immunolabeling of electron micrographs with antibodies specific to VGlut1 and VGlut2, we found that these SMECs often contact thalamic and cortical axons simultaneously. These results suggest that, during cortical synaptic development, dendritic spines serve as sites of competition between thalamic and cortical axons. Through secretion of hevin, astrocytes help maintain thalamic inputs onto cortical neurons and facilitate resolution of SMECs into singly-innervated spines."

Hevin expression is not restricted to the retinocollicular system.

Layer I) of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1 region) in littermate age-matched hevin KO and wild-type (WT) mice using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Excitatory pyramidal neurons from upper cortical layers project extensive dendritic trees to this region and form a large number of the cortical synaptic connections. Cortical neurons receive two main classes of excitatory inputs: (1) the intracortical connections that are VGlut1 positive (VGlut1+), and (2) the sensory pathway inputs from the thalamus that are VGlut2+. The majority of the excitatory connections within the S/Z are of intracortical origin. On the other hand, the bulk of thalamocortical connections are made onto layer IV with a subset projecting to other layers including S/Z (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaneko and Fujiyama, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Khan et al., 2011</a>). To determine the role of hevin in the formation of these different classes of cortical synapses, we quantified the number of synaptic puncta as the co-localization of the presynaptic VGlut1 or VGlut2 with postsynaptic PSD95 at P25 in littermate hevin-KO and WT mice. This synapse quantification assay takes advantage of the fact that pre- and post-synaptic markers are within separate compartments (axons and dendrites, respectively), but they appear to co-localize at synapses due to their close proximity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ippolito and Eroglu, 2010</a>). Surprisingly, we found that the number of VGlut1+ intracortical synapses in the S/Z of hevin KOs were significantly higher when compared to littermate WTs at P25 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, thalamocortical VGlut2+ synapses were profoundly reduced in hevin KOs compared to WTs at P25 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). It is important to note that the appearance of co-localized VGlut/PSD95 puncta is not merely due to chance, since the randomization of puncta by rotating the channels out of alignment by 90\u00b0 nearly abolished occurrence of co-localized puncta in both the WT and KO (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Cortical dendritic spines, including those in V1, follow a stereotypic maturation timeline (<a href=\"#bib18\">Irwin et al., 2001</a>). Long, highly motile filopodia-type protrusions abundant in early development give way to short, stable, wide-headed mushroom spines in the mature brain (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kaneko et al., 2012</a>). The spine maturation timeline coincides to a large extent with the expression of hevin protein, which reaches its highest levels at P25 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). This observation prompted the following question: Does the deficient thalamocortical connectivity in hevin KO coincide with aberrant synaptic morphology? In order to address this question, we investigated whether hevin is involved in the structural development of spine synapses. To do so, we analyzed dendritic morphology in the secondary and tertiary dendrites of layer II/III pyramidal neurons, which receive the majority of the excitatory connections within the S/Z. Analyses of spines in V1 of littermate hevin KO and WT mice at P25 by Golgi-Cox staining showed a significant increase in immature filopodia-like protrusions in P25 hevin KOs concomitant with a decrease in mature mushroom spines compared to littermate WT controls (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). There was no significant difference in total protrusion density between genotypes (WT, 1.12 \u00b1 0.03 spines/\u00b5m; KO, 1.07 \u00b1 0.03 spines/\u00b5m; <i>n</i> = 45 dendrites per condition; p &gt; 0.05, Student's <i>t</i> test).

Three-dimensional (3D)-EM reconstructions, visualizing dendrites, spines and synapses, confirmed the structural immaturity of hevin KO dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Analysis of postsynaptic density (PSD) area revealed smaller, asymmetric (i.e., excitatory) synapse area in hevin KO V1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicative of synaptic immaturity. Despite the deficits in synapse morphology, overall asymmetric synapse density was not significantly affected in hevin KO V1 (WT, 2.16 \u00b1 0.16 synapses/\u00b5m; KO, 2.63 \u00b1 0.27 synapses/\u00b5m; <i>n</i> = 12 dendrites per condition; p = 0.15, Student's <i>t</i> test).

Interestingly, a fraction of excitatory synapses in the hevin KOs was made directly onto the dendritic shafts rather than on spines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), a configuration that was rare in the WTs at P25. This observation reveals that hevin is required for the proper compartmentalization of excitatory synapses onto spines.

To investigate if SMECs occur in the context of normal synaptic development, we created ssEM-derived 3D reconstructions of dendrites in the synaptic zone of WT V1 at P14, an age when dendritic spine structures are not yet fully mature. Electron micrographs revealed the existence of SMECs in P14 V1 in which a single postsynaptic spine contained more than one asymmetric PSD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). 3D reconstructions from ssEM confirmed that each PSD on a SMEC was contacted by a different presynaptic axon (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This ruled out SMECs as having either a single perforated PSD or multiple PSDs opposed to the same axon. Several configurations of SMECs were detected; some in which two axons synapsed on opposite sides of the same spine head (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, left), and others with one PSD on the head and a second PSD on either the neck or base of the spine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right). SMECs were primarily of the thin spine type, though we also found numerous examples of filopodia and mushroom SMECs. Remarkably, 25% of all excitatory connections are formed onto SMECs at P14, a finding that may have gone unnoticed if not for the spatial resolution offered by 3D ssEM. The prevalence of SMECs is largely decreased by P25 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), indicating that SMECs represent a transient stage in excitatory synaptic maturation."

When multiple axons are contacting a single spine, they will have to share the postsynaptic machinery available within that spine. Such a configuration would potentially provide means to drive competition between neighboring inputs for postsynaptic resources, and the activity levels of the presynaptic axons contacting that spine could directly influence this competition. To determine whether specific axonal populations were contacting SMECs, we completed full 3D reconstructions of axons contacting SMECs in P25 hevin KOs and P14 and P25 WTs. We found that if an axon made a connection with a SMEC, it had nearly a 50% chance of contacting another SMEC nearby (42.5% in P14 WT, 45.4% in P25 WT, 41.6% in P25 hevin KO; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), which is vastly higher than what would be expected by chance (6.4% in P14 WT, 0.5% in P25 WT, 3.1% in P25 hevin KO). This specific preference of certain axons for SMECs suggested that SMECs are targeted by particular subpopulations of axons which may be in competition with their neighbors for common postsynaptic spines."

During this period, confocal microscopy images of VGlut1+ and VGlut2+ terminals first appear to frequently overlap, but this overlap resolves over time (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nakamura et al., 2007</a>). Based on our findings, we postulated that the close positioning of VGlut1+ and VGlut2+ terminals at the same SMEC might yield an apparent co-localization between these two presynaptic markers in conventional light microscopy. If that is the case we expected hevin to affect the segregation of VGlut1 and VGlut2 terminals during cortical development. To test this possibility, we used IHC to compare the apparent co-localization of the two VGluts in the S/Z of V1 in WTs and hevin KOs at P15 and P25. We found that, in agreement with earlier findings from other brain regions and layers (<a href=\"#bib16\">Herzog et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakamura et al., 2007</a>), 10.97% of VGlut terminals appeared to co-localize in P15 WT, which was significantly reduced in P25 WT (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In hevin KOs, co-localization of VGlut1/VGlut2 was originally lower than WT at P15, perhaps due to the overall loss of VGlut2+ synapses. Interestingly, the frequency of overlap in the P25 hevin KO was essentially unchanged compared to P15 and was significantly higher than the P25 WT (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). These results suggest that hevin is important for the resolution of the VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap (and, potentially, SMECs). Analysis of rotated images confirmed that the observed VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap by confocal microscopy is not due to random chance (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

To test if this co-localization is mainly due to the resolution limit of light microscopy rather than the expression of these two VGluts at the same terminal, we used high-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging of presynaptic puncta in the synaptic zones of P15 WT mice (since the VGlut1/2 overlap is highest at this age). SIM uses constructive and deconstructive interference of excitation light at the focal plane of the objective to illuminate a sample with a series of sinusoidal stripes; from the resulting moir\u00e9 fringes it is possible to generate super-resolution data and produce a minimum two-fold improvement in resolution over confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schermelleh et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, SIM imaging of VGlut1 and VGlut2 puncta in P15 WT showed virtually no co-localized presynaptic puncta (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). By increasing the maximum distance with which to detect co-localized puncta, SIM analysis eventually reached a point at which VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap approached the level observed in P15 WT by confocal imaging; this occurred near the practical resolution of confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This provided strong evidence that the overlap of VGlut1/VGlut2 puncta we observed with confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) was due to adjacent presynaptic puncta rather than co-expression in the same terminal."

Therefore, the possibility arises that most SMECs actually receive inputs from multiple intracortical axons, rather than existing as sites for simultaneous thalamic and cortical innervation. Taking advantage of the finding that co-localized VGlut1/VGlut2 puncta in light microscopy is predominantly due to close expression by different presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), we next imaged presynaptic puncta in close proximity to dendritic spines with confocal microscopy in order to quantify the types of inputs made onto SMECs. Using an in utero electroporation (IUE) approach at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) we specifically labeled cortical layer II/III neurons with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). We then harvested brains at specific developmental ages and co-stained for VGlut1 and VGlut2. S/Z dendrites and presynaptic puncta were imaged via confocal Z-stacks and reconstructed in 3D with the Imaris processing package (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Presynaptic puncta in close proximity to the dendrite were identified using a Matlab algorithm embedded in Imaris (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This analysis method was first confirmed in P15 WT, an age when SMECs are still prevalent. Unisynaptic spines (i.e., spines contacting only one presynaptic puncta; either VGlut1 or VGlut2) and SMECs in various configurations were successfully detected (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>). In accordance with a role for SMECs in synaptic competition during development, the majority of SMECs were innervated by both VGlut1 and VGlut2 inputs at this age, with fewer examples of VGlut1/VGlut1 and VGlut2/VGlut2 SMECs (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>)."

Taken together, these findings reveal that SMECs are typically sites of contact by cortical and thalamic axons, potentially representing a novel paradigm for synaptic competition between these two main sources of presynaptic input onto cortical spines. Our results indicate that resolution of SMECs into single synapse spines is a developmental process that is regulated by astrocytes through secretion of hevin."

In the developing cortex, the process of refinement includes the resolution of synaptic competition between incoming thalamic projections and the resident intracortical axons. In the present study, we show that an astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic protein, hevin, is required for the connectivity of thalamocortical synapses. Furthermore, we found that thalamic and cortical axons simultaneously innervate dendritic spines, uncovering a potential role for spines as sites of synaptic competition. Based on our findings, we propose that, in the developing visual cortex, SMECs serve as sites at which cortical and thalamic inputs compete (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This competition is normally resolved by P25 with the establishment of single synapse spines contacting either VGlut1+ or VGlut2+ terminals. This resolution is dependent on astrocyte-secreted hevin to stabilize VGlut2+ synapses. In the absence of hevin, the VGlut2+ connections cannot be stabilized thus cannot effectively compete with VGlut1+ terminals for postsynaptic spines, resulting in increased VGlut1+ synapses and the persistence of SMECs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>)."

These results reveal that during development the formation and stabilization of VGlut1+ intracortical and VGlut2+ thalamocortical synapses are differentially regulated. Our findings also suggest that the reduction in VGlut2+ synapses in hevin KO V1 enable synaptic takeover by the more abundant VGlut1+ projections. In agreement with this possibility, previous observations of synaptic competition have shown that retraction of one axon is often succeeded by the expansion of another (<a href=\"#bib49\">Walsh and Lichtman, 2003</a>)."

During development, spontaneous retinal activity relayed by thalamus facilitates proper patterning and connectivity within visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ackman and Crair, 2014</a>). Furthermore, it was previously shown that perturbations in synaptic competition for eye-specific territories in V1 can compromise dendritic spine refinement (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mataga et al., 2004</a>). Defective thalamocortical connectivity in hevin KO mice may therefore be responsible for driving generalized spine synapse immaturity in the cortex. In agreement with this possibility, we found that a hevin KOs had increased numbers of excitatory synapses made onto dendritic shafts. It is postulated that excitatory shaft synapses are among the first synapses to form along dendrites (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reilly et al., 2011</a>). These shaft synapses may be induced to become spines by presynaptic activity during the early stages of postnatal development (P8\u2013P12) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</a>); our results suggest that thalamocortical connectivity in general and/or hevin in particular may be playing a role in the shaft to spine transition of some synapses."

Hevin may also act as a \u2018protection signal\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</a>) to prevent elimination of thalamocortical synapses.

The presence of SMECs in the central nervous system was described a long time ago (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones and Powell, 1969)</a>. Perhaps due to the difficulty of observing these synaptic structures, because of their unique geometrical arrangement, this early finding of SMECs was largely ignored and their purpose remained unknown. Instead, a simple \u2018one spine: one excitatory synapse\u2019 view of connectivity prevailed. The one spine: one synapse configuration provides a context in which spines can compartmentalize calcium and filter membrane potentials in an input-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yuste, 2013</a>). Though important, these features of spines may not represent the full extent of their functions in the developing CNS."

In agreement with this, multiply-innervated filopodia have been seen in the juvenile CA1 region of hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fiala et al., 1998</a>); these protrusions were proposed to \u2018sample\u2019 alternative axonal partners during a highly active period of synaptogenesis. In addition, live imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled dendrites in acute hippocampal slices from P10\u201312 mice showed that spines sample nearby synaptic resources even after making a stable contact (<a href=\"#bib30\">Konur and Yuste, 2004</a>). This sampling was proposed to trigger synaptic competition at individual spines. However, these experiments inferred the presence of axonal boutons from labeling of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin, raising the possibilities that this staining could have been the result of multiple presynaptic release sites (i.e., active zones) on the same synapse or even different boutons belonging to the same axon. By using ssEM-derived 3D reconstructions of synaptic structures, here we show that multiple independent axons compete for synaptic territory on single spines. Furthermore, our finding that SMECs are contacted by different axonal populations (i.e., VGlut1+ and VGlut2+) suggests that establishment of synaptic networks in the cortex depends on the outcome of synaptic competition at spines, demonstrating a dynamic new role for spines in synaptic development."

Moreover, this process occurs on spines serving as simultaneous contact sites for thalamic and cortical inputs during development, a finding that expands the current view of spines as input filters or calcium buffers. These results may also have important clinical implications. Hevin is strongly upregulated in reactive astrocytes in disease conditions (<a href=\"#bib37\">McKinnon and Margolskee, 1996</a>) and has also been linked to neurological disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, suicide and depression (<a href=\"#bib41\">Purcell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jacquemont et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kahler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vialou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhurov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">De Rubeis et al., 2014</a>).

Maximum projections of three consecutive optical sections (corresponding to 1 \u00b5m total depth) were generated from the original z-stack. Analyses were performed blind as to genotype. The Puncta Analyzer plugin that was developed by Barry Wark (available <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>) for ImageJ 1.29 (NIH; <a href=\"http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/\">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</a>, version ImageJ 1.29 is available at <a href=\"http://labs.cellbio.duke.edu/Eroglu/Eroglu_Lab/Publications.html\">http://labs.cellbio.duke.edu/Eroglu/Eroglu_Lab/Publications.html</a>) was used to count the number of co-localized, pre-, and post-synaptic puncta. This quantification method is based on the fact that pre- and post-synaptic proteins (such as VGluts and PSD95) are not within the same cellular compartments and would appear co-localized only at synapses due to their close proximity. Previous studies showed that this quantification method yields an accurate estimation of the number of synapses in vitro and in vivo which were previously confirmed by other methods such as EM and electrophysiology by us and others (<a href=\"#bib3\">Christopherson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Eroglu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</a>). Details of the quantification method have been described previously (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ippolito and Eroglu, 2010</a>). Briefly, 1 \u00b5m thick maximum projections are separated into red and green channels, background subtracted (rolling ball radius = 50), and thresholded in order to detect discrete puncta without introducing noise. The Puncta Analyzer plugin then uses an algorithm to detect the number of puncta that are in close alignment across the two channels, yielding quantified co-localized puncta. In order to calculate % of WT co-localization, co-localized puncta values for WT were averaged, then all image values (WT and KO) were converted to % of the calculated WT average."

Z-stacks of Golgi-stained dendrites (up to 80 microns total on z-axis; optical section thickness = 0.5 \u00b5m) were taken at 63\u00d7 magnification on a Zeiss AxioImager M1.

Spines were analyzed by the rapid Golgi analysis method described in <a href=\"#bib43\">Risher et al. (2014)</a>. Briefly, using the \u2018Draw Z-trace\u2019 tool in RECONSTRUCT, the three-dimensional length of each spine (from the point where the spine neck contacted the dendritic shaft out to the tip of the spine head) was measured. Spine head width was measured by drawing a straight line across the widest point of each spine in a single image of the z-series. These measurements were exported to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, WA), where a custom macro was used to classify spines based on the spine length, width, and length:width ratio measurements obtained in RECONSTRUCT. Spines were categorized based on the following hierarchical criteria: (1) Branched = more than one spine head attached to same spine neck; (2) Filopodium = length &gt; 2 \u00b5m; (3) Mushroom = width &gt; 0.6 \u00b5m; (4) Long thin = length &gt; 1 \u00b5m; (5) Thin = length:width ratio &gt; 1; (6) Stubby = length:width ratio \u2264 1."

The reviewers are also impressed by the intensive EM reconstruction you used to document these findings. On the other hand, the reviewers also feel that the evidence for competition is correlative and weak at this point, and the mechanisms by which Hevin bias thalamocortical vs. intracortical synapse formation is unclear. On balance, we invite you to submit a revised manuscript addressing the following specific critiques:"

Perhaps growth and innervation are slower in general, but since intracortical synapse formation is earlier, at the P25 time point it has already 'caught up' but the thalamic axons are not all there yet, and synaptic competition is also delayed. You need to provide evidence against this synaptic delay alternative explanation."

While <i>eLife</i> has a policy to not require extensive new experiments, the following experiments, while not necessarily required for acceptance, would, in our opinion, greatly strengthen the paper. We hope that you can address as many of these issues as possible. We hope that you may have some relevant data in hand, and remind you that <i>eLife</i> has no restriction on the number of figures. Of course, brevity is always a virtue, but if you have data that was omitted because of length restrictions at most journals, we would rather have the full story. Otherwise the rhetoric of the paper needs to be significantly toned down, and it needs to focus more specifically on the findings for which you have strong data."

The main evidence is increased in cortical VGlut1 and decreased VGlut2 staining at P25. Although you show in Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 3 that the number of LGN neurons is normal in the Hevin KO, you do not show (despite the misleading title of this figure) that thalamic ingrowth into cortex and thalamic axonal arborization is intact. You need to show that thalamic axons needed for synapse formation in the cortex are intact in the Hevin KO, and that the fewer VGlut2 synapses are not due to deficiencies such as reduced thalamic ingrowth or arborization. The fact that immunohistochemistry from P7 mice already shows reduced VGlut2 staining at a time point where SMECs are expected to be similar between WT and KO mice, and Hevin levels are relatively low strengthens this concern. You could further bolster the claim of synaptic competition by demonstrating that cortical expression of Hevin KO rescues the VGlut2 staining loss in cortex."

The caveat raised above applies here too. One would also like to see the P15 Hevin KO data in this comparison. Similar WT and KO overlap at P15 would support your hypothesis. It would not if there is already reduced overlap at P15 (which one might imagine if initial ingrowth or axon elaboration is deficient)."

While interesting, these data are anecdotal (see major concern #1). There is no quantification of % SMECs innervated by both VGlut1 and VGlut2 at P14 vs P25 as opposed to only VGlut1 (or VGlut2) synapses. The reduction in SMECs with age has already been reported, so the fact that they represent sites of synaptic competition during development is not new. The main added value would have been to show that this competition is relevant to a significant % of thalamic vs intracortical inputs, and that it is this particular aspect of the competition that is deficient in the Hevin KO. In other words, since thalamic axons are fewer in general, one would expect that at P15, when the WT and KO have the same number of SMECs in both cases, most of these would represent multiple VGlut1 contacts. With maturation each WT spine would retain only a single synapse, VGlut1 OR VGlut2. In the case of the KO one should also see a reduction in SMECs, but they should be biased towards VGlut1 contacts. The fact that SMECs are still so abundant in the P25 KO suggests a general problem with maturation/competition rather than a thalamus specific problem."

We had initially intended to provide quantification for this analysis, but we were faced with a major technical bottleneck. To visualize SMECs in 2D electron micrographs, even at P15 when they are abundant, is extremely difficult due to their unique geometry. Only 3D reconstructions obtained from serial sections can properly resolve SMECs at an appreciable rate in EM. After careful observation of over 200 two-dimensional electron micrographs of VGlut1/VGlut2 immuno-labeled tissue, we were only able to capture one single SMEC. This SMEC was innervated by VGlut1- and VGlut2-positive terminals (which is the image that appears in the manuscript)."

Therefore, the merger of these two techniques at EM-level represented a steep technical challenge that was not possible to complete within the time frame allotted for revisions. However, in the revised manuscript we devised a different method to address this important concern raised by the reviewers. To do so, we labeled dendrites from layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons in WT and Hevin KO mice using in utero electroporation (IUE) at embryonic day 15.5 to sparsely transfect them with a plasmid that expresses GFP. These IUEs were performed in collaboration with our colleague Dr. Debra Silver\u2019s lab. The brains were harvested postnatally and stained for VGlut1 and VGlut2 to mark presynaptic terminals. The secondary and tertiary dendrites of the sparsely GFP-labeled Layer 2/3 neurons were imaged with a confocal microscope. Confocal Z-stacks were then imported into Huygens image processing software for deconvolution. Dendrites, spines, and VGlut1/VGlut2 puncta were then reconstructed in Imaris in 3D. Using a \u201cFind spots close to surfaces\u201d Matlab algorithm, we could isolate the presynaptic puncta that were in close proximity (0.2 \u00b5m) to the dendrite. This procedure allowed us to image potential SMECs in a quantitative fashion. We first verified this technique on P15 WT samples and found that this method yields SMEC counts that are similar to our results with 3D ssEM. Then we performed the same analyses on P21 Hevin KO and WT mice (blind to genotype) to study the effect of lack of hevin on the composition of the inputs onto SMECs. We found that the majority of the SMECs are doubly innervated by VGlut1/VGlut2 positive terminals. Interestingly, in line with our 3D EM data, we found that the abundance of SMECs and particularly SMECs with simultaneous VGlut1/2 partners was significantly increased in Hevin KO mice. Taken together, these results, which are presented in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 2</a> of the revised manuscript, strengthen our findings that SMECs are primarily sites for simultaneous contact for intracortical and thalamocortical axons. Our results also indicate that in Hevin KO mice, the VGlut2+ thalamic inputs cannot stabilize their individual spine contacts, thus they continue to be associated with VGlut1+ intracortical inputs at SMECs; this proposed model is presented in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>."

To determine if, in Hevin KOs, the thalamocortical axons efficiently innervated the cortex, in particular the synaptic zone (S/Z, layer 1) of V1, we used a Flex-AAV-GFP viral delivery system in combination with rabies virus glycoprotein-coated Lenti-FuGB2-Cre. This way we were able to specifically trace the thalamic axons that originate from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of thalamus innervating the V1 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3B-D</a>). These experiments were performed in collaboration with our colleague Dr. Scott Soderling\u2019s lab. This method allows us to observe long-distance projections whose source neurons and target regions are precisely known. Our results showed that thalamic axons in the Hevin KOs had no difficulty reaching the synaptic zone during the period of thalamocortical synapse formation and maturation. The number of labeled neurons varies from animal to animal due to the reliance on viral infection at two distinct sites, which precludes quantification in this type of analysis. Regardless, we found equal innervation of the S/Z by thalamic axons in Hevin KOs. These results strongly indicate that the defect in thalamocortical synapse numbers we observed in Hevin KOs was not due to a problem with path finding and cortical innervation of thalamic axons."

To test this, we quantified the number of VGlut/PSD95 synapses in adult (12-week-old) mice.

Thus, in Hevin KOs, synaptic competition is rigged towards the stabilization of cortical connections.

Our reasoning was that VGlut1/2-positive SMECs might appear as sites of overlap between these two presynaptic markers at the resolution of conventional confocal microscopy. In the revised manuscript, we have included new data investigating the nature of this VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap through the use of high-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). These experiments were done in collaboration with Dr. Beth Stevens\u2019 lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. The lateral resolution of SIM is at least 2-fold greater than confocal microscopy, which allowed us to show that the apparent overlap of VGlut1 and 2 in P15 WT cortex with confocal could essentially be resolved to discrete VGlut1 and VGlut2 puncta with SIM (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1D,E</a>). This finding provides strong evidence for overlapping VGlut puncta being the result of closely positioned VGlut1 and VGlut2 puncta rather than the presence of these two markers at the same terminals. These closely associated puncta could potentially be SMECs. However, we now have a better analysis method for SMEC contacts (see major concern #1 and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), therefore we moved the VGlut1/2 overlap data to <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. In line with the reviewers\u2019 suggestion in the revised manuscript, we also analyzed VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap in P15 Hevin KOs (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Interestingly, the P15 Hevin KOs have an intermediate VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap at P15, which is midway between the P15 WT and P25 WT overlap; this P15 Hevin KO overlap is essentially identical to the elevated overlap levels observed in P25 Hevin KOs. Taken together, these findings show that hevin is required for effective overlap and resolution of the closely associated VGlut1/2 terminals in the cortex. Provided that the overlap we see between VGlut1 and 2 are representative of SMECs, the fact that Hevin KOs have an intermediate phenotype both at P15 and P25 suggests that, in the absence of hevin, both the efficient formation and resolution of VGlut1- and 2-innervated SMECs is impaired.

There is no quantification of % SMECs innervated by both VGlut1 and VGlut2 at P14 vs P25 as opposed to only VGlut1 (or VGlut2) synapses. The reduction in SMECs with age has already been reported, so the fact that they represent sites of synaptic competition during development is not new. The main added value would have been to show that this competition is relevant to a significant % of thalamic vs intracortical inputs, and that it is this particular aspect of the competition that is deficient in the Hevin KO. In other words, since thalamic axons are fewer in general, one would expect that at P15, when the WT and KO have the same number of SMECs in both cases, most of these would represent multiple VGlut1 contacts. With maturation each WT spine would retain only a single synapse, VGlut1 OR VGlut2. In the case of the KO one should also see a reduction in SMECs, but they should be biased towards VGlut1 contacts.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that SMECs are developmentally regulated in the cortex, and that they can be innervated by different populations of axons simultaneously. In addition, the revised manuscript includes quantitative evidence to support the idea of SMECs as sites for simultaneous contact between thalamic and cortical axons. As pointed out by the reviewers, the overall loss of VGlut2+ terminals in the Hevin KOs would suggest that remaining SMECs in Hevin KOs would more likely be innervated by multiple VGlut1+ contacts. However, our Imaris-assisted 3D reconstructions of GFP-filled dendrites showed that the majority of SMECs were in fact of the mixed VGlut1/VGlut2 subtype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A, B</a>). This particular enrichment of VGlut1/2-positive SMECs indicates that these structures are sites of competition mainly between thalamic and cortical inputs. We propose a model for hevin\u2019s regulation of thalamocortical connectivity at dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) in accordance with these findings. Future studies investigating the mechanism driving the close association of cortical and thalamic inputs on dendrites are needed to fully understand the purpose of these structures, but as the reviewers would agree this would be beyond the scope of this study."
