                    "text": "The spliceosome is a complex machine composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and accessory proteins that excises introns from pre-mRNAs. After assembly the spliceosome is activated for catalysis by rearrangement of subunits to form an active site. How this rearrangement is coordinated is not well-understood. During activation, U4 must be released to allow U6 conformational change, while Prp19 complex (NTC) recruitment is essential for stabilizing the active site. We used multi-wavelength colocalization single molecule spectroscopy to directly observe the key events in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> spliceosome activation. Following binding of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, the spliceosome either reverses assembly by discarding tri-snRNP or proceeds to activation by irreversible U4 loss. The major pathway for NTC recruitment occurs after U4 release. ATP stimulates both the competing U4 release and tri-snRNP discard processes. The data reveal the activation mechanism and show that overall splicing efficiency may be maintained through repeated rounds of disassembly and tri-snRNP reassociation."

After assembly the spliceosome is activated for catalysis by rearrangement of subunits to form an active site. How this rearrangement is coordinated is not well-understood. During activation, U4 must be released to allow U6 conformational change, while Prp19 complex (NTC) recruitment is essential for stabilizing the active site. We used multi-wavelength colocalization single molecule spectroscopy to directly observe the key events in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> spliceosome activation. Following binding of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, the spliceosome either reverses assembly by discarding tri-snRNP or proceeds to activation by irreversible U4 loss. The major pathway for NTC recruitment occurs after U4 release. ATP stimulates both the competing U4 release and tri-snRNP discard processes. The data reveal the activation mechanism and show that overall splicing efficiency may be maintained through repeated rounds of disassembly and tri-snRNP reassociation."

Removal of introns from precursors to mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) involves the coordinated action of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and &gt;100 proteins (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wahl et al.,\u00a02009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hoskins and Moore 2012</a>). Some of these proteins along with the snRNAs assemble into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs) that work together with other accessory proteins to catalyze splicing. Experiments in vitro (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ruby and Abelson 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Konarska and Sharp 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cheng and Abelson 1987</a>) and in cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tardiff and Rosbash 2006</a>) indicate that spliceosomes are unlikely to exist as preformed complexes. Instead, spliceosomes are built from their snRNP and accessory protein components on pre-mRNAs, carry out splicing, and then are disassembled after each reaction (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>). Consequently, the overall process can be described as sequential progression through distinct stages of spliceosome assembly, formation of the active site (called activation), catalysis, disassembly, and component recycling. A number of biochemical and genetic experiments have elucidated the splicing factors present at each stage (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>), as well as characteristic interactions between snRNA, pre-mRNA, and protein components (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brow 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>)."

While U1 binding is ATP-independent, U2 base pairing with the intron to form the pre-spliceosome or A complex typically requires ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A pre-formed complex of U4, U5, and U6 (the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP) then joins A complex to form B complex. While B complex contains dozens of proteins and five snRNAs, it is not capable of mediating either of the two chemical steps of splicing (5' SS cleavage and exon ligation) since the spliceosomal components are not yet rearranged into a configuration capable of catalysis. This rearrangement encompasses two stages during the activation process. In the first stage, the Prp19-associated complex (NTC), the final major spliceosomal subcomplex, joins and U1 and U4 are expelled to form the B<sup>act</sup> spliceosome. In the second stage, B<sup>act</sup> is further remodeled to the B<sup>*</sup> complex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lardelli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wlodaver and Staley 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liu and Cheng 2012</a>). Single molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments suggest that it is only in B* complex that the 5' SS and BS become juxtaposed, a necessary prerequisite for formation of a spliceosome competent for 5' SS cleavage (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crawford et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Krishnan et al., 2013</a>). These catalytically activated B<sup>*</sup> spliceosomes then progress further through stages of exon ligation, mRNA product release, and finally disassembly of the lariat intron-containing product complex."

CoSMoS is particularly suited for the study of unsynchronized reactions such as spliceosomal activation since individual reaction trajectories can be followed in real time and subsequently grouped into common patterns of behavior during data analysis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Larson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Walter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2012</a>).

By simultaneously observing multiple species, we were able to distinguish reaction pathways relevant to activation from off-pathway processes and define the order and reversibility of on-pathway binding and dissociation steps. Together the data reveal new features of spliceosomal activation, provide evidence for an ATP-dependent checkpoint that results in rapid tri-snRNP discard, and define the major pathway for NTC recruitment."

However, the profile of U1 fluorescent spot accumulation under the two conditions was quite different: at 2\u2009mM ATP, U1 snRNP spot numbers increased, then decreased as spliceosomes underwent activation; at 50 \u00b5M ATP, U1 spots reached a higher surface density that did not decrease with time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The latter result is consistent with U1 remaining bound to pre-activation spliceosomal B complexes. Inspection of individual U1 binding events on single pre-mRNAs confirmed this assumption. In 50 \u00b5M ATP, U1 spots often remained visible for tens of minutes (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, light green and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is much longer than previously observed either in the absence of ATP (which prevents A complex formation) or at an ATP concentration (2\u2009mM) that supports splicing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, dark green and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; [<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>]). The distribution of U1 dwell times fit a three component model. This model contained short and intermediate dwell time components (~0.15 and 1.3\u2009min, respectively) previously observed in 2\u2009mM ATP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>) plus a much longer-lived component (<span class=\"underline\">&gt;</span>11\u2009min) new to the 50 \u00b5M ATP condition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). It is likely that these long-lived U1s are in stalled B complexes analogous to those previously purified from 50 \u00b5M ATP splicing reactions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tarn et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chan et al., 2003</a>)."

To investigate whether and for how long NTC associates with stalled B complexes, we used yeast extracts bearing green-excited SNAP tag fluorophores on NTC components (Cef1 and Ntc90) to compare NTC association with pre-mRNA at 2\u2009mM and 50 \u00b5M ATP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). As previously observed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>), spots of NTC fluorescence accumulated on a surface with tethered pre-mRNAs in the presence of 2\u2009mM ATP. However, at 50 \u00b5M ATP we observed much less NTC accumulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). These results suggest that either the NTC cannot associate with B complex or it can associate only transiently, consistent with previous hypotheses (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tarn et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chan et al., 2003</a>). Inspection of individual pre-mRNAs showed fewer bound NTC molecules in 50 \u00b5M ATP and that NTC binding events often lasted for only a few seconds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, light green and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Analysis of the observed dwell times showed that at both 2\u2009mM and 50 \u00b5M ATP, NTC binding events could be described by a distribution containing two exponential terms corresponding to short (~0.4\u2009min) and long (~5\u2009min) dwell time components (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). However, under 50 \u00b5M ATP the long dwell time component represented only a negligible fraction of the distribution (amplitude of 0.06 vs. 0.46 for 50 \u00b5M and 2\u2009mM ATP, respectively). Thus, the kinetically more stable interactions of NTC that are present at 2\u00a0mM ATP are largely absent at 50 \u00b5M ATP. In summary, the single-molecule U1 and NTC binding dynamics under low ATP conditions are consistent with the formation of stalled, B complex spliceosomes on surface tethered pre-mRNAs."

Also consistent with these observations, at 2\u2009mM ATP U4 exhibited two comparatively short lifetime components of ~0.2 and ~2\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). In contrast, at 50 \u00b5M ATP the measured dwell times fit to a tri-exponential distribution with two similar short components (~0.1\u2009min and ~1\u2009min), but with a substantial fraction in an additional much longer component (<span class=\"underline\">&gt;</span>13\u2009min). We hypothesize that this long component arises from the formation of stalled B complex spliceosomes at 50 \u00b5M ATP. Absence of this component at 2\u2009mM ATP is consistent with the idea that binding of U4/U6.U5 to form B complex is followed quickly by activation and concomitant U4 dissociation."

Although it is presumed that only the tri-snRNP binds to the U1.U2 pre-spliceosome, this has not been directly tested. Therefore, it is possible that the short-lived dwell time components reported above might represent transient interactions of U4 alone or U4/U6 di-snRNP with pre-spliceosomes. In order to specifically identify tri-snRNP binding events, we constructed a yeast strain bearing labels on both U5 and the U4/U6 component Prp3 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This strain grew similarly to the parental strain and its WCE exhibited high levels of in vitro splicing activity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Similarly 46% of U4 spots (467 of 1016 total) arrived simultaneously with a U5 spot appearance. Colocalization of simultaneously arriving U4 and U5 spots sometimes persisted for tens or hundreds of seconds; these events likely reflect tri-snRNP binding. Consistent with this interpretation, simultaneous appearances of U4 and U5 at control areas of interest (AOIs) with no detected pre-mRNA molecules were extremely rare (~3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> events AOI<sup>-1</sup>\u2009min<sup>-1</sup>). In contrast, the U4-only and U5-only binding events were typically transient, often lasting only a single frame (&lt;3 s), and were not analyzed further (data not shown)."

Because the same preparation of labeled U4/U5 extract was used in both 2\u2009mM and 50 \u00b5M ATP experiments, it is probable that differences in the amount of coincident U4 and U5 binding reflect differences in tri-snRNP relative abundance under the two conditions; differences that likely originate from tri-snRNP disruption that accompanies spliceosome activation and splicing occurring at 2\u2009mM ATP but not at 50 \u00b5M ATP. In addition, the tri-snRNP itself is destabilized by the addition of ATP, leading to an decrease in its abundance relative to free U4 and U5 snRNPs and the U4/U6 di-snRNP (<a href=\"#bib39\">Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huang et al., 2014</a>)."

We observed four different outcomes from these coincident binding events (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>): (1) the U4 snRNP spot disappeared while the U5 spot remained; (2) the U5 snRNP spot disappeared while the U4 spot remained; (3) both the U4 and U5 spots disappeared simultaneously; or (4) both the U4 and U5 signals persisted on the pre-mRNA until the experiment was terminated after one hour. In the two cases in which one spot disappeared before the other, disappearance could be caused by photobleaching of the dye label, or by dissociation of the individual snRNP from B complex, leaving the other behind. However, simultaneous disappearance of both spots most likely represents U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP dissociation because simultaneous photobleaching is improbable."

This outcome is consistent with the expected U4 loss accompanying B complex activation followed by U5 loss after splicing. Loss of the U5 signal prior to loss of U4 was rarely seen (2%), and in no case did the U4.U5 signals persist until the end of the experiment. The remainder mostly (36%) followed the route in which U4 and U5 spots disappeared simultaneously. These results are consistent with the majority of tri-snRNP interactions with pre-mRNA at 2\u2009mM ATP resulting in activation and U4 dissociation. The smaller fraction with simultaneous spot disappearance may represent release of intact tri-snRNP without spliceosome activation."

The U4-first loss pathway was rarely observed (9%; 19/207 events in a given experiment), consistent with activation being blocked at 50 \u00b5M ATP. Instead, U4 and U5 most frequently (76%) disappeared simultaneously, with a small fraction (9%) not disappearing at all but persisting until the end of the experiment. These results suggest that when activation is suppressed by reducing ATP, tri-snRNP mostly releases intact but on rare occasions participates in formation of a kinetically stable complex on the pre-mRNA. The persistent complexes may correspond to the stalled B complexes previously isolated in ensemble studies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fabrizio et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tarn et al., 1993</a>). Further, the observation that U4-first loss is infrequently observed at 50 \u00b5M ATP confirms that most of the more frequent U4-first loss events observed at 2\u2009mM ATP are due to U4 snRNP dissociation, not photobleaching."

At both 50 \u00b5M and 2\u2009mM ATP the dwell time distributions were multi-exponential (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>), suggesting the presence of multiple distinct types of tri-snRNP/pre-mRNA complexes. At 50 \u00b5M ATP, the dwell time distribution fit to the sum of two exponential terms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), whereas the distribution at 2\u2009mM ATP required three exponential terms for a satisfactory fit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The two time constants at 50 \u00b5M ATP (52 and 780\u2009s) appear to most closely correspond to the two longest time constants at 2\u2009mM ATP (34 and 660\u2009s; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). However, at 2\u2009mM ATP the majority of dissociation events are not in these longer components but rather in the shortest-lived component (4\u2009s). Thus, our observations suggest that at 2\u2009mM ATP most non-productively bound tri-snRNPs are quickly discarded by a pathway not operative or much slower at 50 \u00b5M ATP."

We then exchanged the WCE containing 50 \u00b5M ATP with splicing buffer, also containing 50 \u00b5M ATP, to remove any unstable tri-snRNP-containing complexes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). During this first buffer wash, the majority of U4.U5 complexes remained bound to the slide (10\u201317% decrease in U4.U5 spot density, <i>N</i> = 253 \u00b1 18 U5 spots per field of view in WCE prior to the wash). We next carried out a second buffer exchange and flowed in buffer containing either 50 \u00b5M or 2\u2009mM ATP. When a second 50 \u00b5M ATP wash was carried out, the majority of U4/U5 complexes remained bound (~19% decrease in spot density between the first and second wash steps, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast, the majority of U4 and U5 spots were released when a 2\u2009mM ATP wash was used: 74% and 68% decreases in U4 and U5 spot density, respectively, and only a small fraction of remaining U4 and U5 particles colocalized with one another (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). Release of U4 and/or U5 occurred very rapidly\u2014within the deadtime of our experiment (~30\u00a0s). Loss of signals from both U4 and U5 is most consistent with ATP-dependent discard of these complexes since U5 should be retained in B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Furthermore, these results suggest that the ATPase responsible for the discard of U4 and U5 is stably associated with the pre-mRNA and remains bound when the WCE is removed and replaced by buffer. Our data indicate that the majority (~68%) of stable U4.U5-containing complexes assembled at 50 \u00b5M ATP in WCE will be discarded in the presence of 2\u2009mM ATP in buffer and only a smaller fraction (at most 32%) can potentially form B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes."

This suggests that at least some pre-mRNAs that do splice also bind the tri-snRNP more than once. When multiple tri-snRNP associations were observed they were nearly always sequential: a second tri-snRNP binding was very rarely seen unless both U4 and U5 fluorescence from the previous association had already disappeared (simultaneous colocalization of two tri-snRNPs was potentially observed on only 6 out of 481 RNAs, <span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span>1%). Some tri-snRNP binding events on a pre-mRNA molecule resulted in simultaneous appearance of both the U4 and U5 signals followed by their simultaneous loss, usually a short time later (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, yellow highlights). Other tri-snRNP binding events on the same pre-mRNA molecule would show simultaneous appearance of both U4 and U5 followed by loss of U4 fluorescence prior to loss of U5 (i.e., spliceosome activation; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, red highlights).

Instead, we observed that approximately 10% (49 of 481) of pre-mRNAs under 2\u2009mM ATP exhibited at least two repeats of U4/U5 simultaneous binding, followed by loss of the U4, followed by loss of U5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Since binding of the tri-snRNP is dependent on presence of an intron (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>), we conclude that on these pre-mRNAs the first U4 release event did not result in productive splicing and that subsequent observations of U4 release result from spliceosome re-assembly on the same pre-mRNA. These data indicate that activation does not always commit the pre-mRNA to splicing, and are consistent with the presence of discard pathways that can prevent splicing subsequent to activation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mayas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Koodathingal et al., 2010</a>)."

In contrast, re-association of U4 complexes containing the labeled protein Prp3 after prior U4 departure was exceedingly rare. Of 260 cases in which both U4 and U5 fluorescence appeared simultaneously followed by disappearance of U4 and then U5, we observed only 15 instances (5.7%) of reappearance of U4 while U5 remained visible. It is likely that some of these rare events arose from background binding of fluorescent molecules to the slide surface since control experiments revealed that the rate of background U4 binding is similar to the observed rate of U4 re-binding subsequent to U5 loss (2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> vs. 9.8 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> events/min, respectively). In addition, only 5 cases were found in which the rebound U4 spot was stable enough to last more than a single frame. Taken together, these results are consistent with activation being largely irreversible, with only a slim likelihood (&lt;2%) for rebinding of Prp3-containing U4 or U4/U6 snRNPs."

This suggests that rebinding of the tri-snRNP to pre-mRNA following discard of tri-snRNPs or activated spliceosomes involves fewer steps than initial tri-snRNP recruitment, possibly because they are rebinding to an already partially assembled complex. Thus, splicing efficiency may potentially be maintained by not only multiple tri-snRNP binding events occurring on the pre-mRNA but also by facilitating subsequent recruitment of the tri-snRNP to those pre-mRNAs."

In order to address this issue, we carried out 3-color CoSMoS experiments in which the U4 snRNP was labeled with a green-excited fluorophore on Prp3 and red-excited fluorophores were attached to NTC components (Cef1 and Ntc90) with the DHFR tag (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This triply-tagged strain showed near-parental-strain growth kinetics and splicing activity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In 2\u2009mM ATP, we observed transient U4 and longer-lasting NTC associations with pre-mRNA molecules, consistent with the behaviors seen in extracts in which U4 and NTC were individually labeled (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). We then measured for each pre-mRNA molecule the sequence of U4 and NTC appearance and disappearance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the majority of cases (79%), NTC signals appeared soon (typically ~30\u2009s) <i>after</i> loss of U4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). A randomized control (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, red lines) indicates that this distribution did not arise by chance. In addition, the data show evidence for a small subpopulation (on order 10% of complexes) where NTC bound first but U4 release followed almost immediately (within a few seconds). Since ~53% of all molecules that recruit NTC subsequently are spliced (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins 2011</a>), the data suggest that the main pathway leading to functional spliceosomes is NTC association subsequent to U4 loss."

However, little is known about how activation is coordinated in terms of both the ordering of events and points of regulation. Here we demonstrate that the tri-snRNP can interact reversibly with pre-mRNA, that some tri-snRNP interactions do not result in release of U4, that when U4 is released this release is effectively irreversible, that ATP can promote both rapid activation and discard, and that NTC binding usually occurs only after U4 release. Together our data allow us to propose an integrated model for tri-snRNP association with the pre-spliceosome and subsequent spliceosome activation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The model proposes an ordered pathway for activation in which physiological ATP concentrations facilitate both U4 dissociation leading to NTC addition (progressing towards splicing) and tri-snRNP dissociation resulting in B-complex disassembly (progressing away from splicing)."

It has often been assumed that the tri-snRNP binds to but cannot release from pre-mRNAs under these conditions. Our data show that this is not the case: the majority of tri-snRNP encounters with pre-mRNA molecules involved simultaneous U4 and U5 association and dissociation of both after just tens of seconds. While we did not examine U1 and U2 directly in these experiments, it is likely that these pre-mRNAs were assembled into pre-spliceosomes since single molecules of the tri-snRNP fail to accumulate on pre-mRNAs without ATP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>) and tri-snRNP association almost always requires prior U1 and U2 binding (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</a>). Only a small fraction of events resulted in tri-snRNP retention at the conclusion of our experiments. Based on our data, it is unclear what distinguishes complexes that released the tri-snRNP from those in which it was retained for tens of minutes. It is likely that the longest-lived complexes are the assemblies that have been purified and characterized as the spliceosomal B complex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tarn et al., 1993</a>). Our experiments (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggest that the majority of spliceosome complexes formed at 50 \u00b5M ATP and that survive removal of the WCE are not competent for B<sup>act</sup> formation and are instead rapidly discarded by an ATP-dependent mechanism. However, neither our work nor previous studies have directly established what fraction of the remaining long-lived complexes are kinetically competent intermediates on the splicing pathway at physiological ATP."

The reason that splicing can nevertheless occur is because at high ATP U4 release is rapid, irreversible, and is thus able to compete with tri-snRNP dissociation even though that dissociation rate has also increased. Based on the observed fluxes through the U4 release and tri-snRNP dissociation pathways, a significant fraction (one of every three) tri-snRNP binding events ends in tri-snRNP dissociation without spliceosome activation."

In &gt;98% of events in which U4 was ejected after tri-snRNP binding, Prp3-containing U4 snRNPs did not reappear while U5 remained bound. This indicates effective irreversibility of U4 loss. Since U4 loss permits U6 to make both inter- and intramolecular basepairing interactions to form the spliceosome catalytic core and these are mutually exclusive with U4 basepairing, our results suggest that U4 is quickly recycled in the extract (<a href=\"#bib39\">Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998a</a>) and/or that the conformational rearrangements within U6 occur rapidly, preventing re-base pairing with U4 directly or with the aid of the U4/U6 annealing protein Prp24."

Thus, release of U4 during activation does not always commit a particular spliceosome to catalysis and mRNA release. This result is consistent with the presence of proofreading and discard steps carried out by Prp16 and Prp22 occurring after spliceosomal U4 release, and with disassembly of discarded spliceosomes by Prp43 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burgess and Guthrie 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Koodathingal et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mayas et al., 2006</a>).

In particular, the relative timing of U4 release and NTC recruitment has remained ambiguous (<a href=\"#bib18\">de Almeida and O'Keefe 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hogg et al., 2010</a>). Early immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that the NTC joins the spliceosome soon after or concomitant with U4 loss (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tarn et al., 1993</a>). In contrast, later mass spectrometry analyses of purified spliceosomes stalled by limiting ATP detected small amounts of NTC in B complex, suggesting that stable U4 and NTC binding are not mutually exclusive (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>). Our data explain this apparent contradiction by showing that at 2\u2009mM ATP NTC recruitment soon after U4 release is the predominant pathway (79% of events). However, under limiting ATP (where there is little U4 release) transient interactions of NTC were still observed. More stable binding of NTC after U4 release is in agreement with both previous crosslinking results (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rasche et al., 2012</a>) and more recent spliceosome structures (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yan et al., 2015</a>) that show key binding sites for the NTC include the U6 internal stem loop (ISL) and the catalytic core.

ATP-dependent U4 release is known to be mediated by the Brr2 helicase (<a href=\"#bib40\">Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998b</a>). The rapid tri-snRNP discard pathway is consistent with ATP-dependent proofreading by Prp28 during exchange of U1 for U6 basepairing at the 5' SS (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). If exchange is successful the spliceosome can proceed through the next steps of activation. If unsuccessful, Prp28 may induce rapid tri-snRNP release. It is possible that the discard pathway observed here may be related to prior observations of yeast pre-spliceosomes containing weakly bound tri-snRNPs upon inhibition of U1/U6 exchange (<a href=\"#bib46\">Staley and Guthrie 1999</a>) and the labile tri-snRNPs present in human exon-defined splicing complexes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boesler et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, there now exists a powerful toolset for studying compositional changes and dynamics of single spliceosomes in real time. Further mechanistic insights are likely to result from combining these tools with mutations in key spliceosomal components to better dissect the roles of individual proteins and snRNAs in the steps of spliceosomal assembly, activation, proofreading, chemistry, and recycling. Even in the absence of further studies, the data presented here define the sequence of major molecular events in spliceosome activation and explain how splicing can be efficient despite high fluxes through discard pathways after tri-snRNP binding and after activation."

Single-molecule data were collected on a homebuilt, micromirror TIRF microsope at room temperature as previously described (<a href=\"#bib21\">Friedman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>). To facilitate correction of stage drift, chambers also included fluorescent beads (TransFluoSpheres, streptavidin-labeled, 40 nm, 488/645) to act as fiducial markers. Laser powers were typically set at either 150 or 450 \u00b5W for both the 532 and 633 nm lasers. The distributions of dwell times from both laser powers in experiments at 2\u2009mM ATP were compared to assess the impact of photobleaching and showed little difference in the fitted parameters (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In three-color CoSMoS experiments, the 488 nm laser was set to 800 or 1750 \u00b5W and RNAs containing 488-excitable fluorophores were only imaged at the beginning and end of the experiment to avoid photobleaching of other fluorophores. In three-color CoSMoS experiments, data were collected with a frame duration of 1\u2009s, a spacing between frames of 3\u00a0s, and with simultaneous illumination with both the 532 and 633\u00a0nm lasers. The same frame duration and spacing was used to collect data for two-color CoSMoS experiments following U4 binding dynamics except that only the 532\u00a0nm laser was used. Two-color CoSMoS experiments of U1 and NTC binding dynamics under low ATP used a frame duration of 1\u2009s, a spacing between frames of 5\u2009s, and illumination with the 532 nm laser. In all experiments, autofocusing was carried out once per minute with a 785\u00a0nm laser (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>). A reference data set used for mapping the &lt;635\u00a0nm and &gt;635\u00a0nm fluorescence emission fields of view onto one another was acquired with each experiment (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hoskins et al., 2011</a>)."

They investigate formation of the B complex and its conversion to the Bact complex by observing splicing substrate association and dissociation of U1, the tri-snRNP components U4 and U5, and/or the NTC, the complex characteristic of catalytically-activated spliceosomes. At low ATP, which stalls spliceosome assembly, the authors observed increased lifetimes of U1, U4, and U5 but decreased lifetimes of the NTC, consistent with previous observations. By simultaneously monitoring U4 and NTC binding and release from the substrate by three-color CoSMoS, the authors demonstrate that the NTC only transiently samples the substrate before U4 release and generally binds stably only after release, providing the first direct evidence for the dependence of stable NTC binding on U4 release. By co-localization of U4 and U5 by three-color CoSMoS, the authors also observed a substantial frequency of events in which both dissociate simultaneously. Surprisingly, at high ATP, there is a very fast phase of this event that predominates, implying a novel discard pathway that dominates the spliceosome activation phase. Importantly, the authors show that such discard events can be followed by rebinding of the tri-snRNP components. Further, while some studies on the U4/U6 annealing factor Prp24 have suggested action on the spliceosome, the authors provide the first evidence that U4 release from U6 on the spliceosome is irreversible and, strikingly, that subsequent U5 release can be followed by simultaneous reassociation of U4 and U5, revealing for the first time spliceosome re-assembly after the presumed discard of the splicing substrate and concomitant disassembly of the spliceosome."
