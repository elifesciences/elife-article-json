Here we show that compensatory arm usage in individuals born without a hand (one-handers) reflects functional connectivity of spontaneous brain activity in the cortical hand region. Compared with two-handed controls, one-handers showed reduced symmetry of hand region inter-hemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and corticospinal white matter microstructure. Nevertheless, those one-handers who more frequently use their residual (handless) arm for typically bimanual daily tasks also showed more symmetrical functional connectivity of the hand region, demonstrating that adaptive behaviour drives long-range brain organisation. We therefore suggest that compensatory arm usage maintains symmetrical sensorimotor functional connectivity in one-handers. Since variability in spontaneous functional connectivity in our study reflects ecological behaviour, we propose that inter-hemispheric symmetry, typically observed in resting sensorimotor networks, depends on coordinated motor behaviour in daily life."

Here we show that compensatory arm usage in individuals born without a hand (one-handers) reflects functional connectivity of spontaneous brain activity in the cortical hand region. Compared with two-handed controls, one-handers showed reduced symmetry of hand region inter-hemispheric resting-state functional connectivity and corticospinal white matter microstructure. Nevertheless, those one-handers who more frequently use their residual (handless) arm for typically bimanual daily tasks also showed more symmetrical functional connectivity of the hand region, demonstrating that adaptive behaviour drives long-range brain organisation. We therefore suggest that compensatory arm usage maintains symmetrical sensorimotor functional connectivity in one-handers. Since variability in spontaneous functional connectivity in our study reflects ecological behaviour, we propose that inter-hemispheric symmetry, typically observed in resting sensorimotor networks, depends on coordinated motor behaviour in daily life."

In the sensorimotor system, a link between brain plasticity following amputation and compensatory behaviour has only recently been established (<a href=\"#bib15\">Makin et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Philip and Frey, 2014</a>). In people who were born without a hand, or who lost it in childhood, research on related behavioural changes has focused on compensatory foot usage (which is uncommon relative to arm usage), with conflicting results (<a href=\"#bib36\">Yu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Stoeckel et al., 2009</a>). We recently showed using task-evoked fMRI that the way individuals use their bodies to compensate for their disability when missing a hand (either at birth or later in life due to injury) is reflected in the way the cortical territory of the missing hand is recruited during limb movements (<a href=\"#bib15\">Makin et al., 2013a</a>). Specifically, individuals born with one hand (i.e., congenital unilateral upper limb absence; hereafter termed: \u2018one handers\u2019) showed both higher usage of the handless arm (i.e., residual arm) in daily tasks and increased activation in the cortical territory of the missing hand when moving that arm. In contrast, amputees that lost a hand later in life tended to use their remaining hand (i.e., intact hand) more frequently and also showed greater activation in the territory of the missing hand when moving the intact hand. These results provide evidence that whichever body part is being over-used to compensate for the absence of a hand also gains increased representation in the cortical territory of the missing hand."

During rest, the human brain is characterised by activation patterns that are temporally coherent and reproducible across known functional networks, and this coherence is termed \u2018functional connectivity\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Biswal et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Nir et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Smith et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Yeo et al., 2011</a>). To date, the relationship between altered resting-state functional connectivity and compensatory behaviour in one-handers is not known (<a href=\"#bib37\">Yu et al., 2014</a>). Since it has been hypothesised that patterns of resting-state functional connectivity reflect the activity patterns evoked by every-day behaviours (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harmelech and Malach, 2013</a>), we predicted that the way individuals behave to compensate for their disability would also be reflected in resting-state connectivity patterns. We focused on inter-hemispheric functional connectivity patterns, which are stronger between homologous regions along the sensorimotor homunculus, resulting in a symmetrical connectivity pattern. We aimed to test whether this symmetry is disrupted in one-handers who have a more asymmetrical pattern of limb use in daily life (i.e., increased usage of their intact hand vs their residual arm)."

Importantly, the degree of functional connectivity between the two homologous hand regions in the sensorimotor cortex reflected the degree to which one-handers utilised their residual arm during daily activities. These findings extend our previous reports by demonstrating that resting-state connectivity alterations reflect adaptive behaviours beyond the scope that could be identified using task-evoked brain activity. These findings also demonstrate the imprinting of daily behaviours in spontaneous brain activity, as previously postulated (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harmelech and Malach, 2013</a>)."

To study structural alterations in motor-related pathways of one-handers, asymmetry in white matter microstructure of the bilateral corticospinal tracts was investigated. Fractional anisotropy (FA), an index commonly derived from diffusion MRI, was used as a probe of tissue microstructure. This measurement is thought to reflect myelination and fibre density, but is also influenced by other micro-features (e.g., membrane permeability, tissue geometry, see \u2018Discussion\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zatorre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Jones et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Sampaio-Baptista et al., 2013</a>). One-handers showed increased asymmetry in white matter microstructure (reflected by decreased white matter FA in the corticospinal tract contralateral to the missing hand relative to the ipsilateral tract) compared to controls (p = 0.003, randomisation test, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The effect peaked at the posterior limb of the internal capsule (peak z coordinate = 88, p = 0.02 corrected, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), an area that contains sensory thalamic fibres, but was also distributed across extensive regions of the tract (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

To study functional changes in one-handers, voxel-wise alterations in resting-state functional connectivity to the missing hand's territory (or the non-dominant hand region in controls) were examined using a seed-based approach (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We defined the seed-region based on the mirror image of task-evoked activation while participants moved their dominant/intact hand (controls/one-handers, respectively). This seed-region encompassed both the primary somatosensory and motor cortices (SI and M1, respectively, see purple region in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>). Connectivity was assessed in one-handers compared with controls across the entire brain. Reduced connectivity to the seed-region was identified in the medial aspect of the homologous (intact) hand region, in the anterior bank of the central sulcus, corresponding with M1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This finding reflects an aberration in the typically symmetrical resting-state sensorimotor network. Group comparison of inter-hemispheric connectivity in the intact hand region, defined based on brain activations during hand movements, confirmed reduced connectivity between the two sensorimotor hand regions (p = 0.002, randomisation test, middle panel of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Smaller Clusters showing reductions in connectivity with the seed-region were also identified in the posterior aspect of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex contralateral to the missing hand and in the middle temporal gyrus bilaterally (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Coloured lines show brain areas activated during execution of movements of the arms (blue), hands (purple), and lips (green) in the control group, using task-evoked fMRI scans. (<b>B</b>) Whole-brain group comparison (controls &gt; one-handers) of resting-state functional connectivity using the missing hand's cortical territory as the seed-region. The seed-region (the mirror projection of intact/dominant hand activity, averaged across groups) is shown in purple shading. The orange-yellow clusters show areas with lower levels of connectivity to the missing hand territory in one-handers (corrected, p &lt; 0.05). The insert on the left shows that the main resulting cluster overlaps with the task-evoked hand region, as measured in controls in (<b>A</b>), suggesting lower levels of inter-hemispheric connectivity between the cortical hand regions in one-handers. The bar plot in the middle reflects group-wise mean (\u00b1s.e.m.) connectivity levels between the seed-region and the intact hand ROI (defined based on intact/dominant hand activity, averaged across groups). (<b>C</b>) Whole-brain correlations between connectivity levels with the missing hand's seed-region (purple shading) and level of one-handers residual arm usage in daily tasks (level of bimanual usage). Significant correlations were restricted to the anterior aspect of the intact hand knob of the central sulcus, as can be seen in the insert to the left. Scatter plot in the middle reflects connectivity levels between the seed-region and the intact hand region (y axis) versus residual arm use (x axis). The red line on the y axis shows the mean \u00b1 confidence interval of controls' hand region inter-hemispheric connectivity. The significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.005) reflects that one-handers using their residual arm more frequently to support bimanual tasks showed higher levels of hand region functional connectivity, similar to those of control participants. This suggests that increased residual arm usage to support bimanual tasks normalises the aberrantly reduced levels of inter-hemispheric connectivity in one-handers, shown in (<b>B</b>). 1H = one-handers; CTR = controls; Asterisks denote significance at the level of **p &lt; 0.005."

Given that the missing hand territory (used here as a seed-region) was shown to represent the residual arm, It is possible that variations in connectivity strength between the hand regions of one-handers reflect compensatory arm usage. To address this, a whole brain voxel-wise analysis was conducted to test for positive correlations between functional connectivity values (to the missing hand's territory, as described above) and the level of residual arm usage in everyday activities (<a href=\"#bib15\">Makin et al., 2013a</a>). Significant correlation with behavioural scores was found in a single cluster within the intact cortical hand region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), specifically in the anterior bank of the central sulcus, corresponding with M1. This result indicates that one-handers who employ their residual arm for typically bimanual tasks also demonstrate higher levels of hand region inter-hemispheric connectivity."

We find reduced symmetry of white matter microstructure in the corticospinal tracts of one-handers, as well as reduced symmetry of resting-state functional connectivity patterns between the sensorimotor hand regions (i.e., reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity). Importantly, although we detected asymmetrical structural and functional patterns across the group of one-handers, we were also able to observe more symmetrical functional connectivity patterns in some individuals. Specifically, those one-handers who utilising their residual arm for typically bimanual tasks showed normal (i.e., symmetrical) levels of resting-state inter-hemispheric connectivity. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, we are unable to determine the origin of the increased functional connectivity observed in those who used their residual arm more frequently. This observation may reflect preservation of initially intact inter-regional connections, which are otherwise lost through lack of use, or may instead reflect establishment of (otherwise missing) functional connections through usage. The fact that individuals with increased functional connectivity didn't also show greater structural symmetry may support the latter interpretation of functional reorganisation. Either way, our findings suggest that compensatory behaviour is a powerful driver in shaping brain organisation associated with sensorimotor deprivation, as reflected in resting-state functional connectivity. Our unique dataset also provides a rare opportunity to demonstrate how individualised ecological behaviour is imprinted in spontaneous brain connectivity patterns, as was previously hypothesised (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harmelech and Malach, 2013</a>)."

The white matter measurement used here (FA) is an indirect and relatively unspecific measure of white matter microstructure (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zatorre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Jones et al., 2013</a>). It reflects how directional water diffusion is within tissue, due to presence of structural barriers. The more coherent these barriers are, the higher the degree of diffusion directionality, that is, FA, will be. Many different features, including the degree of myelination, the fibre packing density, the membrane permeability, axon diameter and the tissue geometry, could therefore influence the reported structural asymmetry. Our observation is in line with numerous studies showing that the maturation and refinement of corticospinal pathways crucially depends on motor behaviour and the neural activity it elicits in early life (<a href=\"#bib5\">Eyre, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Martin et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, asymmetry of white matter microstructure in the posterior limb of the internal capsule has been previously shown to predict poor motor function of the upper limb after stroke (<a href=\"#bib31\">Stinear et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Lotze et al., 2012</a>). According to this account, reduced motor behaviour and subsequent neuronal activity in one-handers may result in decreased white matter microstructure in the corticospinal tract contralateral to the missing hand. However, as we couldn't identify any statistical relationship between residual arm usage and white matter microstructure along the corticospinal tract, this interpretation remains tentative."

We proposed that reductions in functional connectivity may relate to abnormal signalling of the peripheral injured nerve (<a href=\"#bib34\">Vaso et al., 2014</a>), which could reduce the synchronicity of fluctuations between the bilateral hand regions. In the one-handers studied here, who rarely experience phantom sensations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Price, 2006</a>), the observed reduction in inter-hemispheric connectivity may instead be related to the strong and chronic lateralisation of motor behaviour, resulting in dis-synchronisation of inputs between the two hand regions, as will be discussed below."

These repeated cortical activations are imprinted into resting-state connectivity patterns (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harmelech and Malach, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Guerra-Carrillo et al., 2014</a>), and are therefore reflected as symmetrical levels of inter-hemispheric connectivity in these individuals. The current study therefore highlights the pivotal role of the missing hand's cortical territory in use-dependent plasticity. We note that significant group differences in functional connectivity were not entirely exclusive to the intact hand region (e.g., prefrontal cortex, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). However, effects in these other cortical areas were not related to compensatory behaviour (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Therefore, additional research will be needed in order to understand the functional role of brain regions beyond the primary sensorimotor cortex in one-handers."

In contrast to lateralised activation patterns evoked by unimanual movements, resting-state patterns typically show strong bilateral coherence, resulting in highly symmetrical networks (<a href=\"#bib3\">Biswal et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Yeo et al., 2011</a>). Our observation that reduced bimanual movements (in the absence of one hand, and with limited compensatory capacity of the residual arm) is related to decreased inter-hemispheric coherence in one-handers, provides compelling new evidence that the symmetrical resting-state coherence typically found in the sensorimotor network is likely to be due to coordinated body movements in naturalistic daily settings. We therefore propose that spontaneous coherence seen in brain networks during rest (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nir et al., 2006</a>) relates to the relatively integrated activity of network sub-regions during complex real-life behaviours."

In each iteration, participants' labels (one-handers or controls) were shuffled, creating two random experimental groups, and the difference between the averaged group indices was calculated. This procedure was repeated 10,000 times to construct the null distribution, and the position of the test's statistic in relation to this distribution was determined.

The block design paradigm, as well as its temporal derivatives, was convolved with a gamma function (<a href=\"#bib6\">Friston et al., 1998</a>) to model the activation time-course, associated with hand and arm movements (versus baseline) at the individual participant level. The contrast of main interest was the intact hand condition against baseline. The intact hand ROI was defined by averaging the low-level contrast of intact/dominant hand vs rest across the two groups (one-handers and controls). A threshold of Z &gt; 7.5 was chosen, yielding a cluster centered around the hand knob of the central sulcus. As the spatial resolution and co-registration methods used here are insufficient to reliably dissociate the somatosensory and motor primary cortices, cortical regions spanning the central sulcus, and the pre- and post\u2013central gyri were described here as \u2018sensorimotor\u2019. Since the primary sensorimotor cortex shows the highest levels of functional symmetry across the two cerebral hemispheres (<a href=\"#bib30\">Stark et al., 2008</a>), the ROI representing the cortical territory of the missing hand was created by mirror flipping the intact hand ROI coordinates on the x-axis."

Specifically, it has been shown to be a powerful and sensitive measurement of white-matter features, as reflected in many studies involving both healthy and diseased populations. Unfortunately, being an MRI-derived index, it is an indirect measure, and as such lacks the specificity for an unambiguous biological interpretation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jones et al, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Sampaio-Baptista et al, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zatorre et al., 2012</a>). To answer the Reviewer\u2019s questions, yes, FA does correlate with tract density and myelin, but also with many other microstructural features, including axon diameter, membrane permeability and the tissue geometry. FA changes can reflect changes in any of these factors individually and/or their combinations. For these reasons, in the manuscript we avoided making speculative claims about the microstructure features underlying our effect. In the revised manuscript we describe the microstructural features that might underlie the white matter measurement, and its limitations."

It reflects how directional water diffusion is within tissue, due to presence of structural barriers. The more coherent these barriers are, the higher the degree of diffusion directionality, i.e. FA, will be. Many different features, including the degree of myelination, the fibre packing density, the membrane permeability, axon diameter and the tissue geometry, could therefore influence the reported structural asymmetry. Our observation is in line with numerous studies showing that the maturation and refinement of corticospinal pathways crucially depends on motor behaviour and the neural activity it elicits in early life (<a href=\"#bib5\">Eyre, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Martin et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, asymmetry of white matter microstructure in the posterior limb of the internal capsule has been previously shown to predict poor motor function of the upper limb after stroke (<a href=\"#bib31\">Stinear et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Lotze et al., 2012</a>).\u201d"

We focused on inter-hemispheric functional connectivity patterns, which are stronger between homologous regions along the sensorimotor homunculus, resulting in a symmetrical connectivity pattern. We aimed to test whether this symmetry is disrupted in one-handers who have a more asymmetrical pattern of limb use in daily life (i.e. increased usage of their intact hand versus their residual arm).\u201d"
