Its striated, periodic appearance in electron micrographs led to the idea that transverse filaments within this structure \u2018crosslink\u2019 the axes of homologous chromosomes, stabilizing their pairing. SC proteins can also form polycomplexes, three-dimensional lattices that recapitulate the periodic structure of SCs but do not associate with chromosomes. Here we provide evidence that SCs and polycomplexes contain mobile subunits and that their assembly is promoted by weak hydrophobic interactions, indicative of a liquid crystalline phase. We further show that in the absence of recombination intermediates, polycomplexes recapitulate the dynamic localization of pro-crossover factors during meiotic progression, revealing how the SC might act as a conduit to regulate chromosome-wide crossover distribution. Properties unique to liquid crystals likely enable long-range signal transduction along meiotic chromosomes and underlie the rapid evolution of SC proteins."

Its striated, periodic appearance in electron micrographs led to the idea that transverse filaments within this structure \u2018crosslink\u2019 the axes of homologous chromosomes, stabilizing their pairing. SC proteins can also form polycomplexes, three-dimensional lattices that recapitulate the periodic structure of SCs but do not associate with chromosomes. Here we provide evidence that SCs and polycomplexes contain mobile subunits and that their assembly is promoted by weak hydrophobic interactions, indicative of a liquid crystalline phase. We further show that in the absence of recombination intermediates, polycomplexes recapitulate the dynamic localization of pro-crossover factors during meiotic progression, revealing how the SC might act as a conduit to regulate chromosome-wide crossover distribution. Properties unique to liquid crystals likely enable long-range signal transduction along meiotic chromosomes and underlie the rapid evolution of SC proteins."

In most human cells, the two copies of each chromosome \u2013 the one inherited from our mother and the one from our father \u2013 are physically separated and behave independently. However, in the reproductive cells that give rise to eggs or sperm, each chromosome must pair with its partner. Pairing first occurs at one or more positions along each chromosome. This triggers a protein-based polymer called the \u201csynaptonemal complex\u201d to assemble between the paired chromosomes, and then spread along the interface between the partners until they are fully lined up side-by-side. Chromosomes in reproductive cells must pair in this particular way to exchange genetic information and generate new combinations of traits."

Once chromosomes establish local interactions with their homologs through recombination or other mechanisms, the central region of the SC nucleates and assembles progressively between paired axes, resulting in close side-by-side alignment of homologous chromosomes along their entire lengths (<a href=\"#bib45\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Page and Hawley, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</a>).

Structural components, defined here as proteins required for SC assembly, have been identified through genetic screens and/or immunocytochemistry in a variety of organisms. Three to five such proteins have been characterized in budding yeast, <i>Drosophila</i>, <i>C. elegans</i>, and mammals, and at least one SC protein has been identified in plants. However, it is not yet clear whether the full cohort of SC structural elements has been defined in any organism. While the dimensions and appearance of the SC are conserved among diverse phyla, these structural proteins show remarkable divergence in their lengths and primary sequences. All known SC structural proteins contain extensive regions that score highly on coiled-coiled prediction scales. Together with the transverse striations observed by TEM, this has led to a prevalent view of the SC as a stable, \u2018crosslinking\u2019 polymer assembled through coiled-coil interactions, perhaps resembling intermediate filaments. However, other observations have hinted at a more dynamic structure. In particular, evidence from budding yeast has revealed that SCs can incorporate newly translated proteins after assembly (<a href=\"#bib76\">Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2012</a>), consistent with dynamic exchange of subunits. Additionally, in many organisms SCs are known to undergo \u2018synaptic adjustment,\u2019 post-assembly progressive reorganization that tends to simplify their topology (<i>e.g.</i>, the extent of loop structures and unsynapsed axes is minimized) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Page and Hawley, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">MacQueen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Henzel et al., 2011</a>) \u2013 a behavior that implies extensive rearrangement of subunits after initial assembly of the complex."

In the nematode <i>C. elegans,</i> the SC comprised of at least four structural proteins (SYP-1\u20134), which are mutually dependent for their chromosome association (<a href=\"#bib45\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Colai\u00e1covo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Smolikov et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schild-Pr\u00fcfert et al., 2011</a>). When the chromosome axis is disrupted \u2014 for example, in <i>C. elegans</i> mutants lacking either the essential meiotic axis protein HTP-3, or all three meiotic kleisins (REC-8, COH-3, and COH-4) \u2014 SC proteins fail to assemble between chromosomes, and instead form large bodies in the nucleoplasm of meiotic cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Goodyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Severson et al., 2009</a>). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that these nuclear bodies have a multilaminar internal structure, in which each layer recapitulates the appearance and dimensions of SCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u00a0and\u00a0C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dernburg et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schild-Pr\u00fcfert et al., 2011</a>). Similar periodic, multilaminar structures formed by SC proteins have been observed in wild-type nuclei or cytoplasm of meiocytes or nurse cells from a wide variety of organisms, as well as under perturbed conditions where SCs cannot assemble between chromosomes, and are known as \u2018polycomplexes\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Roth, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Page and Hawley, 2004</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i> these structured bodies have also been observed in wild-type meiocytes prior to SC assembly (<a href=\"#bib28\">Goldstein, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</a>). Importantly, polycomplexes in <i>htp-3</i> mutants do not contain any of the known chromosome axis components (cohesins, HIM-3, or HTP-1\u20133) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>, and our observations), indicating that these proteins are not essential for self-assembly of SC proteins into an ordered structure, but only for their assembly as a unilamellar structure between chromosomes. Additionally, this reveals that the electron-dark bands with 100 nm periodicity within polycomplexes, which correspond to the cytologically-defined \u2018lateral elements\u2019 of the SC, are not equivalent to chromosome axes."

Coupled with their structural similarity to SCs, we reasoned that it might be possible to learn more about the SC, independent of its interactions with chromosome axes, by analyzing polycomplex dynamics in living worms. Time-lapse imaging of <i>htp-3</i> mutant worms expressing GFP-SYP-3 revealed that prophase nuclei frequently contained more than one fluorescent polycomplex. Unexpectedly, we observed that when these came into contact, they readily fused to form a single larger body (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We also observed polycomplexes to undergo large-scale structural deformations, particularly towards the end of prophase as the nuclear volume increased (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The ability of such bodies to merge together and to readily change in shape are defining characteristics of liquids, since they imply that molecules can rapidly rearrange within a material. These observations were thus initially very surprising, given the highly ordered appearance of polycomplexes. However, materials with liquid-like properties and ordered arrangements of molecules, known as structured fluids or liquid crystals, are a well-known class of soft condensed matter, and a variety of structures within cells have been postulated to have such properties (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Wolken, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rey, 2010</a>)."

Our early efforts to carry out long-term recordings in living worms consistently led to meiotic arrest, which we deduced to be a physiological response to food withdrawal (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wynne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</a>). Arrest was evident as abatement of the dramatic chromosome movements that normally occur throughout early prophase (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wynne et al., 2012</a>), which typically ceased within 15\u201320 min of immobilization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>; see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> for a schematic of the <i>C. elegans</i> gonad). In nuclei that had initiated synapsis before arresting, we observed that diffuse GFP-SYP-3 gradually coalesced to join existing segments of SC between chromosomes. These partial SCs became brighter but not longer, likely reflecting addition of subunits to form a multilayered structure, much as they must stack within 3D polycomplexes. Consistent with this idea, EM analysis of lateral and cross-sectional views of SCs has indicated that they contain varying numbers of layers (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schmekel et al., 1993a</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">1993b</a>). The observation that these pre-existing SC segments did not spread along partially synapsed chromosomes following arrest suggests that longitudinal extension is an active process. In earlier, presynaptic nuclei, GFP-SYP-3 coalesced within each nucleus over a period of tens of minutes to form several compact aggregates. Similar coalescence of SC proteins was observed in animals treated with sodium azide, which reversibly arrests meiosis and other physiological processes by depleting ATP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that phosphorylation and/or other ATP-dependent mechanisms normally maintain the solubility of SC subunits."

(<b>B</b>) The proximal region of a gonad from a <i>C. elegans</i> hermaphrodite, fixed and stained with DAPI, is shown as a reference for other figures and recordings. Each gonad contains a complete progression of meiotic stages; here, nuclei enter and advance through meiotic prophase from left to right. A signal from the distal tip inhibits meiotic entry; once cells move far enough from this signal they enter meiosis and progress through prophase. At the loop region of the gonad, a spatially regulated signal triggers exit from pachytene. (<b>C</b>) Projection images from deconvolved 3D image stacks, showing premeiotic and early meiotic nuclei from wild-type adult hermaphrodites that were incubated for 1 hr on plates containing 0.5% w/v sodium azide before fixation, and control (non-azide-treated) animals. Gonads were dissected and fixed immediately following azide treatment, and stained with antibodies against SYP-2 and HTP-3 to localize SCs and chromosome axes, respectively. Small polycomplexes that contain SYP-2 but not HTP-3 are observed in some early meiotic nuclei in the absence of any treatment, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Goldstein, 2013</a>), but become much larger and more abundant in response to azide exposure.

We engineered worm strains expressing SYP-3 fused to the photoconvertible fluorescent protein mMaple3 (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2014b</a>). We photoconverted subnuclear regions in live worms and imaged these nuclei over time. The photoconverted proteins rapidly redistributed throughout the SCs within the same nucleus, becoming homogeneously dispersed within 22 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). By contrast, when the axis protein HIM-3 was tagged with mMaple3, we observed no significant redistribution of converted fluorophores over more than 30 min of observation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This implies that other axis components, particularly HTP-3, which scaffolds the recruitment of HIM-3 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kim et al., 2014</a>), are also stably associated with the axis. We conclude that SC central region proteins are far more mobile than axis components. The relatively slow rate of subunit turnover within the SC compared to that observed for other liquid-like compartments might reflect a high viscosity of the liquid-like phase, and/or other constraints such as confinement within the very thin laminar space, or a slow rate of exchange of subunits between the different SC compartments in the nucleus. Future studies using high-speed imaging and other tools should provide a more complete understanding of the movement of proteins within the SC. Taken together, our observation of coacervation following meiotic arrest, of liquid-like behaviors of polycomplexes, and of the dynamic exchange of subunits all indicate that the SC is a phase-separated compartment with liquid crystalline properties."

We therefore wondered whether the biophysical properties we observed in <i>C. elegans</i> are conserved. We found that SCs in both <i>Drosophila</i> and budding yeast were rapidly dispersed by 1,6-hexanediol, while axis markers (Rec8p in budding yeast; C(2)M in <i>Drosophila</i>) remained associated with chromosomes, as in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>; see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> for an explanatory diagram). This indicates that weak hydrophobic interactions are important for SC integrity in diverse lineages."

Because the effects of 1,6-hexanediol on cellular structures are not well understood, we also probed the sensitivity of SCs to disruption by a number of other water-miscible alcohols. These di-alcohols vary in the length of the hydrocarbon chain and the positions of their hydroxyl groups. Most experiments were performed with yeast cells arrested in mid-pachytene, since it is simple to manipulate the media in which these cells are immersed and no dissection or cell permeabilization was required to see the effects of 1,6-hexanediol. For each di-alcohol we determined the minimal concentration required for complete SC disruption, based on loss of any discernible structure by fluorescence microscopy of unfixed yeast cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We observed a clear correlation between the extent of the hydrophobic domains of different solvents and their effects on the SC. For example, 1,2-heptanediol disrupted the structure at lower concentrations than 1,2-hexanediol, which was more potent than 1,2-pentanediol. Similar results were obtained for the series 1,7-heptanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, and 1,5-pentanediol. Together, these results reinforce the idea that solvation by aliphatic alcohols is due to suppression of the hydrophobic effect, and support a major contribution of hydrophobic interactions to SC stability."

We noted that SC central region proteins in various organisms are predominantly polyampholytic, <i>i.e.</i>, they contain an unusually large fraction of charged residues, both acidic and basic, which are well-mixed within the primary sequences. This suggests that electrostatic interactions likely contribute to SC integrity, and that higher salt concentrations, which shield electrostatic interactions (<a href=\"#bib75\">Veis, 2011</a>), might disfavor assembly. Consistent with this, we found that increasing the concentration of KCl potentiated the ability of 1,6-hexanediol to dissolve the SC in budding yeast (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; other salts showed similar effects [data not shown]), highlighting a role for electrostatic interactions, in addition to hydrophobic interactions, in SC assembly and stability. The effects of increasing salt concentration were fairly modest in light of the highly charged nature of SC proteins; however, only a limited range of ionic strength could be investigated in living cells, and the effects of these buffer manipulations on intracellular ionic strength could not be directly monitored."

Nevertheless, we tested whether various mutations in <i>C. elegans</i> that perturb meiotic recombination or chromosome structure might affect 1,6-hexanediol sensitivity, and observed no major differences, except that the aberrant SCs in <i>syp-3(me42)</i> mutants, which carry a small C-terminal truncation in an SC protein (<a href=\"#bib71\">Smolikov et al., 2007</a>), were hypersensitive to 1,6-hexanediol (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>).

Some fluorescent material that had exited the nucleus, perhaps due to transient disruption of the nuclear pores, formed small puncta in the cytoplasm. Notably, reassembly of SCs following 1,6-hexanediol dilution occurred much more quickly than physiological SC assembly between axes, which requires 20\u201330 min per chromosome pair (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</a>). Polycomplex dissolution was also reversible: upon dilution of 1,6-hexanediol, multiple small puncta formed in each nucleus, and rapidly fused with each other to form larger bodies (<a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), qualitatively similar to the behavior of polycomplexes in live animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>).

These results provide additional evidence that neither the chromosome axes, which are essential for SC assembly between chromosomes, nor the SC proteins themselves, are irreversibly perturbed by exposure to 1,6-hexanediol."

We therefore wondered whether the SC might regulate and surveil recombination by partitioning CO factors into a distinct compartment between homologous chromosomes. At least one essential CO factor that is not required for SC assembly, the conserved RING-finger protein ZHP-3, is observed throughout the SC during early prophase, before becoming restricted to designated CO sites (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jantsch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>), whereupon it colocalizes with COSA-1, another conserved protein required for COs (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>). We found that CO formation altered not only the localization of ZHP-3 but also its sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol: Prior to CO designation, the ZHP-3 distributed throughout SCs was dispersed by the solvent, while CO-associated ZHP-3 foci remained intact even after disruption of the SC by 1,6-hexanediol (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>)."

Indeed, we found that in <i>htp-3</i> mutants, ZHP-3 was concentrated throughout polycomplexes during most of meiotic prophase. However, near the \u2018loop\u2019 region of the gonad, where exit from pachytene normally occurs (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> for reference), we observed an abrupt change in ZHP-3 localization: The protein largely disappeared from the interior of the polycomplexes and became restricted to a single focus conspicuously abutting the surface of each polycomplex. Intriguingly, at the same stage, COSA-1, which was not detected earlier, became localized to these same small, peripheral puncta (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). This dynamic relocalization of ZHP-3 and COSA-1 is highly analogous to what is observed along bona fide SCs upon CO designation (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>). We further determined that ZHP-3 is required for the appearance of COSA-1 foci at polycomplexes, while COSA-1 is required for the relocalization of ZHP-3 to the edge of these bodies and its disappearance from the interior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>), mirroring the interdependence of these factors for their localization to CO sites (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>). We also found that the earlier ZHP-3 localization throughout polycomplexes is readily disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol, whereas the foci of COSA-1 and ZHP-3 foci at the edges of polycomplexes are 1,6-hexanediol-resistant (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), again mirroring the properties of ZHP-3 and COSA-1 associated with SCs and designated CO sites, respectively. Polycomplexes do not appear to be associated with chromosomes and moreover, meiotic recombination does not initiate in <i>htp-3</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib29\">Goodyer et al., 2008</a>). Thus, localization of COSA-1 and ZHP-3 to foci on polycomplexes does not require their interaction with CO intermediates such as Holliday junctions, or indeed with chromosomes. These results imply that in response to exogenous cell cycle signals, polycomplexes can recapitulate a signaling network that normally designates COs, and hence suggest how a liquid-like SC compartment may promote and regulate CO recombination along meiotic chromosomes."

Here we report another conserved property of SCs and polycomplexes: they assemble through coacervation of polypeptides into compartments with liquid crystalline properties. While the symmetric, transversely striated appearance of the SC, combined with known properties of coiled-coil proteins, has suggested a filamentous and stable internal structure, our observations indicate that SCs instead resemble smectic (planar) liquid crystal bilayers, structurally analogous to lipid bilayers. Moreover, the SC can also assemble into its canonical smectic structure when its normal association with chromosome axes is prevented. The preferential assembly of SC proteins into a thin lamellar structure between two axes is further evidenced by our observation that upon meiotic arrest, nuclear aggregates appear only if no pre-assembled SC bilayers are present (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). While biological membranes are well-known examples of smectic liquid crystals, to our knowledge, the SC is the first known example of such a highly ordered, liquid-like structure arising from protein-protein interactions. However, a variety of biological assemblies of less regular structure have been described as liquid crystals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Wolken, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rey, 2010</a>), and many others have been created in vitro by mixing synthetic peptides in aqueous solution."

Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that the proteins that assemble to form SCs are markedly different from those that have been implicated in the assembly of other liquid-like compartments within cells. Many such proteins have low-complexity, intrinsically disordered domains that are essential for their phase transition behavior (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hyman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhu and Brangwynne, 2015</a>), and some of these have been shown to adopt cross-beta strand structures in vitro (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, SC proteins are predicted to be largely alpha-helical in structure, and have extensive domains predicted to form coiled-coils. Smectic liquid crystals assemble from elongated, amphipathic rod-like molecules (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gennes and Prost, 1993</a>). It is known that some of the longer SC proteins, particularly SYCP1 in mammals and Zip1p in budding yeast, have a head-to-head orientation within the SC, with their N-termini near the center and their C-termini near the chromosome axes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Liu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schmekel et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dong and Roeder, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2005</a>). Interaction of their C-termini with axis-associated proteins seems to promote their coacervation with other SC proteins, possibly by promoting high local concentrations. Axis association also favors the formation of single bilayers (lamellae), rather than the stacks of bilayers that make up polycomplexes. By specifying the orientation of these \u2018transverse filament\u2019 proteins, the chromosome axes may also act as a \u2018director\u2019 for the liquid crystalline array."

Thus strong selective forces to maintain the responsive, liquid-like properties of the SC, which plays a central role in fertility and fitness, may underlie the sequence diversity observed among its constituent proteins, especially among ectothermic organisms. In support of this idea, direct evidence has recently indicated that SC proteins, among other chromosome structural components, are subject to rapid positive selection in plant populations growing at different temperatures (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wright et al., 2015</a>)."

These modifications presumably tune the strength of interactions among SC proteins to control the timing and location of assembly and disassembly, as has been described for other cellular coacervation processes, such as the formation of P-granules (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2014a</a>). Consistent with this, PLK-2, a kinase that promotes SC disassembly at the end of meiotic prophase, localizes to SCs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Harper et al., 2011</a>), and we have found that several of the SYP proteins can be phosphorylated by PLK-2 in vitro (Y. Kim and AFD, unpublished). Because liquid crystals are ultrasensitive to perturbations of their intermolecular interactions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gennes and Prost, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carlton et al., 2013</a>), we envision that posttranslational modifications may also modulate the dynamic properties of assembled SCs during meiotic progression."

This property can concentrate specific cellular activities while excluding others (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hyman et al., 2014</a>). While the liquid crystalline properties of the SC set it apart from other compartments that resemble amorphous liquids, we provide evidence that it may have some analogous properties. Specifically, this assembly dynamically regulates the localization of at least two conserved recombination factors, ZHP-3 and COSA-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which are not required for SC assembly, in response to meiotic progression. Previous work has shown that Zip3p, the budding yeast homolog of ZHP-3, also localizes throughout polycomplexes, while the CO factors Zip2p, Zip4p, Msh5p and the 9-1-1 clamp proteins localize to one or two foci abutting polycomplexes, sometimes referred to as a \u2018capping complex\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Tsubouchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Shinohara et al., 2015</a>), very similar to the physical distribution we observe for ZHP-3 and COSA-1 during late meiotic prophase. Homologs of ZHP-3 in plants, mammals and fungi also localize to SCs before concentrating at sites of COs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chelysheva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Reynolds et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">De Muyt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jahns et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Qiao et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that spatial regulation of COs by the SC is widely conserved. We envision that the SC acts as an active \u2018scaffold\u2019 to localize and concentrate \u2018client\u2019 proteins (<a href=\"#bib2\">Banani et al., 2016</a>), defined here as SC-resident proteins that are not required for SC assembly. These factors, including ZHP-3, are recruited by the SC to control the processing of double-strand breaks that are induced during meiosis. We also speculate that the SC may share an evolutionary relationship with other liquid-like nuclear compartments, such as repair foci, which concentrate repair factors at sites of DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhu and Brangwynne, 2015</a>)."

Evidence that SCs share physical properties with liquid crystals, a particularly responsive class of active materials, illuminates how they might contribute to the transduction of a long-range, cis-acting interference signal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In particular, the knowledge that macromolecules can diffuse laterally within the plane of smectic liquid crystals suggests that the dynamics of diffusion within the SC likely determine the rate at which biochemical signals are propagated along the chromosomes. (By analogy, 2D diffusion within lipid membranes profoundly impacts the spatial organization and kinetics of signaling by membrane-associated proteins.) Thus, our discovery that the SC acts as a non-membrane-bound compartment suggests how COs could be regulated in cis through a reaction-diffusion mechanism, which is consistent with quantitative analysis of CO interference in several organisms (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fujitani et al., 2002</a>). This idea is also consistent with evidence that reduction in the expression levels of SC proteins, which likely results in discontinuities of the SC along individual chromosomes, can permit additional COs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hayashi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Libuda et al., 2013</a>)."

We have found that depletion of the ERK kinase MPK-1, which has been implicated in regulating late meiotic prophase events in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nadarajan et al., 2016</a>), does not affect the relocalization of COSA-1 or ZHP-3 on SCs or polycomplexes (Liangyu Zhang, OR and AFD, unpublished), so the nature of the \u2018exit pachytene\u2019 signal that triggers this switch is unknown."

This property could provide a rapid response to crossover formation. Specifically, we imagine that structural changes could be induced within the SC at sites of CO formation and transmitted laterally, in which case interference might be mediated by a mechanochemical rather than a purely biochemical signal. This idea is analogous to a \u2018beam-film\u2019 model that has been proposed to explain interference (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), but posits that the medium that stores strain is the SC, or more precisely, the SC as confined by its interaction with chromosome axes. Ultrastructural analysis of SC organization before and after CO formation may eventually allow this idea to be tested. Additionally, future studies of the role of SC organization and dynamics in CO interference may enable development of new synthetic materials with long-range signaling capabilities."

However, while the recovery rate is slower than seen with 3D structures, it is hard to know what one should expect for a very thin strand of liquid flowing in a minute space between two chromosomes; viscosity could be very high. Certainly, a solid would not show spreading at all. The structural similarity and dynamics make, in my mind, a pretty strong analogy between the polycomplexes and SCs.

The EM data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> show that the polycomplexes are composed of ordered bands with 97 nm spacing, each of which is composed of a striated array. The dynamics show that they fuse with each other, and recover from hexanediol like a liquid. This would be consistent with a smectic LC. Your EM of the SC in the top image of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> looks very much like a single band taken from the polycomplex \u2013 it is also 97 nm thick, and is composed of an analogous striated array. The spacing between the striations looks similar, although that's harder to tell.

This may not appear to be the case, however, if the initial droplets are smaller than the diffraction limit (as would seem to be the case in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, circle E).

In addition, we cannot currently distinguish between diffusion within an individual SC compartment and exchange of subunits between compartments. We are currently exploring these questions using correlation-based image analysis methods, but they are clearly beyond the scope of this work."

If I understand correctly, the beautiful EM images of polycomplex bodies certainly have such a multilaminar structure, but the normal SC does not (so I would actually not call a typical biological membrane a smectic liquid crystal as stated in the discussion, although multilaminar bilayers can be formed which can be referred to as liquid crystalline arrays. The EM data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> show that the polycomplexes are composed of ordered bands with 97 nm spacing, each of which is composed of a striated array. The dynamics show that they fuse with each other, and recover from hexanediol like a liquid. This would be consistent with a smectic LC. Your EM of the SC in the top image of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> looks very much like a single band taken from the polycomplex \u2013 it is also 97 nm thick, and is composed of an analogous striated array. The spacing between the striations looks similar, although that's harder to tell. Again, I think you should comment on these issues, as they will certainly be issue that readers of the paper would question.</i>"

This is well-known in the meiosis field and unlikely to be questioned by readers familiar with the SC. Ours is the first demonstration that the aggregates that form in worm axis mutants have the same periodic internal structure seen for polycomplexes in other organisms, and that this order is lost at high temperatures. Our EM images obtained from high-pressure-frozen samples are actually somewhat less clear than some of the \u201cclassic\u201d images from the mid-20th century using conventional fixation, in which the SC and polycomplexes appear in higher contrast, probably because of more extensive extraction of other cellular material."

While these pre-existing SC segments became much brighter following arrest, they did not spread longitudinally along partially synapsed chromosomes.\" Once phase separation has occurred, unless the properties of the molecules change (e.g. by phosphorylation), the concentration in the new compartment will not change as new molecules are added, the compartment will merely grow larger. This may not appear to be the case, however, if the initial droplets are smaller than the diffraction limit (as would seem to be the case in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, circle E). In such a case their sub-diffraction growth will appear to be an increase in concentration. Could this be the case here, with multiple short SC segments growing within diffraction-limited volumes?</i>"

We didn\u2019t mean to suggest that the segments were becoming denser or more concentrated; we think that they are probably growing in thickness (above and below the plane defined by the SC) but not longitudinally; i.e., along the chromosome axis.
