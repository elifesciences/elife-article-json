                    "text": "Protection against malaria in humans can be achieved by repeated exposure to infected mosquito bites during prophylactic chloroquine treatment (chemoprophylaxis and sporozoites (CPS)). We established a new mouse model of CPS immunization to investigate the stage and strain-specificity of malaria immunity. Immunization with <i>Plasmodium chabaudi</i> by mosquito bite under chloroquine cover does not generate pre-erythrocytic immunity, which is acquired only after immunization with high sporozoite doses. Instead, CPS immunization by bite elicits long-lived protection against blood-stage parasites. Blood-stage immunity is effective against a virulent, genetically distinct strain of <i>P. chabaudi</i>. Importantly, if exposure to blood-stage parasitemia is extended, blood-stage parasites induce cross-stage immunity targeting pre-erythrocytic stages. We therefore show that CPS immunization can induce robust, long-lived heterologous blood-stage immunity, in addition to protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites following high dose sporozoite immunization. Cross-stage immunity elicited by blood-stage parasites may further enhance efficacy of this immunization regimen."

We established a new mouse model of CPS immunization to investigate the stage and strain-specificity of malaria immunity. Immunization with <i>Plasmodium chabaudi</i> by mosquito bite under chloroquine cover does not generate pre-erythrocytic immunity, which is acquired only after immunization with high sporozoite doses. Instead, CPS immunization by bite elicits long-lived protection against blood-stage parasites. Blood-stage immunity is effective against a virulent, genetically distinct strain of <i>P. chabaudi</i>. Importantly, if exposure to blood-stage parasitemia is extended, blood-stage parasites induce cross-stage immunity targeting pre-erythrocytic stages. We therefore show that CPS immunization can induce robust, long-lived heterologous blood-stage immunity, in addition to protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites following high dose sporozoite immunization. Cross-stage immunity elicited by blood-stage parasites may further enhance efficacy of this immunization regimen."

Immunity against severe disease can be acquired following repeated infection, but sterile parasite clearance is rarely achieved (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goncalves et al., 2014</a>). Clinically immune adults in endemic areas still harbor parasites in their blood-stream (<a href=\"#bib42\">Okell et al., 2009</a>).

Parasites that arrest during the liver stage, either because of irradiation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nussenzweig et al., 1967</a>) or targeted gene deletion (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mueller et al., 2005</a>), can provide immunity against challenge infection. Indeed, immunization of human volunteers with irradiated sporozoites can induce sterile protection in experimental settings (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clyde et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Seder et al., 2013</a>). However, in the absence of acquired immunity to the blood-stage parasite a pre-erythrocytic vaccine that is only partially effective, and therefore permits breakthrough erythrocytic infections, will provide no protection against severe malaria (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bejon et al., 2011</a>). The inclusion of a blood-stage component together with an effective pre-erythrocytic vaccine is therefore preferred to provide a multi-stage malaria vaccine that minimizes both transmission and disease (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ellis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodman and Draper, 2010</a>)."

In agreement with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belnoue et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Friesen and Matuschewski, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Inoue et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nganou-Makamdop et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lewis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Peng et al., 2014</a>), mice immunized <i>iv</i> three times with 10,000 <i>P. chabaudi</i> CB sporozoites under chloroquine cover did show reduced liver parasite burden (up to 90%) after mosquito bite challenge, compared to infection controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Conversely, mice immunized <i>iv</i> three times with a low dose of 100 <i>P. chabaudi</i> CB sporozoites (representative of the estimated number of <i>P. chabaudi</i> sporozoites that initiate infection via mosquito bite, <a href=\"#bib52\">Spence et al., 2012</a>) do not acquire pre-erythrocytic immunity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It also appears that CPS immunization with 10,000 live sporozoites was more effective at inducing pre-erythrocytic immunity than immunization with 10,000 irradiated <i>P. chabaudi</i> CB sporozoites, which arrest during hepatic development (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suhrbier et al., 1990</a>) and do not establish a blood-stage infection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This suggests that complete liver-stage maturation and the increased blood-stage parasitemia that accompanies immunization with 10,000 sporozoites (as compared to 100 sporozoites or mosquito bite) could contribute to pre-erythrocytic protection."

Protection against erythrocytic parasites was also evaluated by direct blood challenge, using blood-stage parasites obtained from a donor mouse infected by mosquito bite.

We wanted to assess whether blood-stage parasites have the potential to induce pre-erythrocytic protection also in the context of mosquito transmission. We therefore asked whether a fulminant blood-stage infection could elicit cross-stage immunity against pre-erythrocytic parasites. We infected mice with <i>P. chabaudi</i> AS by mosquito bite or intraperitoneal (<i>ip</i>) injection of recently mosquito transmitted blood-stage parasites. The two groups of mice were not drug-treated, and therefore experienced a low-grade chronic, recrudescing blood-stage infection for up to 90 days (<a href=\"#bib53\">Spence et al., 2013</a>). After mosquito bite challenge, both groups of mice demonstrated reduced liver parasite burden (up to 85%), compared to infection controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Cross-stage immunity is therefore a powerful mechanism for protection against pre-erythrocytic parasites, which may be absent during CPS immunization with small sporozoite numbers as the blood-stage infection is curtailed by the use of chloroquine."

We incorporated many of these aspects from human clinical trials (<a href=\"#bib49\">Roestenberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bijker et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2014</a>) in a new <i>P. chabaudi</i> mouse model of CPS immunization to investigate the stage- and strain-specificity of CPS-induced protection against malaria. Our results highlight the complexity of immunity against the different life cycle stages of the malaria parasite (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Pre-erythrocytic immunity appears to depend on the number of immunizing sporozoites. In this study, we find no evidence of pre-erythrocytic immunity after CPS immunization with <i>P. chabaudi</i> infected mosquito bites, which inoculate an estimated maximum of 100 sporozoites per immunization (<a href=\"#bib52\">Spence et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2013</a>). Sterile pre-erythrocytic protection was however reported in human CPS immunization trials (<a href=\"#bib49\">Roestenberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bijker et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2014</a>). <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> mosquitoes experimentally infected with <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 or NF54 habor 50\u2013200 times more sporozoites in their salivary glands (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bijker et al., 2013</a>) compared to <i>P. chabaudi</i> AS (<a href=\"#bib52\">Spence et al., 2012</a>). However, only few sporozoites are injected into the skin during mosquito bite and this number is independent of salivary gland sporozoites load (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beier et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ponnudurai et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Medica and Sinnis, 2005</a>). Since the number of sporozoites establishing a liver-stage infection can further be influenced by inherent sporozoite infectivity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Khan and Vanderberg, 1991</a>), our best estimate of immunizing sporozoite dose is the number of infected erythrocytes observed directly after egress from the liver. Assuming that 10,000 merozoites are released from one infected liver cell (<a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2014</a>), we estimate approximately 400 infected hepatocytes (95% CI 137\u20131250) in human volunteers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bijker et al., 2013</a>) compared to 5 in <i>P. chabaudi</i> AS immunized mice (95% CI 1\u201331). Therefore, the number of infected hepatocytes after CPS immunization by mosquito bite in the <i>P. chabaudi</i> mouse model is approximately 100-fold lower than in CPS immunized humans. We show that this differences in infected hepatocyte numbers by a factor of 100 can be significant for the development of pre-erythrocytic immunity: three immunizations with 10,000 <i>P. chabaudi</i> sporozoites <i>iv</i> induce long-lasting protection against mosquito bite challenge, while three immunizations with 100 <i>P. chabaudi</i> sporozoites fail to do so. This is in general agreement with other rodent malaria studies using <i>P. berghei</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beaudoin et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Golenser et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Orjih et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Friesen and Matuschewski, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nganou-Makamdop et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lewis et al., 2014</a>) or <i>P. yoelii</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belnoue et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Inoue et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Doll et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Peng et al., 2014</a>), in which sterile pre-erythrocytic immunity is observed after immunization with high sporozoite doses (typically 10,000\u201350,000 sporozoites per immunization), while a reduction in sporozoite dose or the number of immunizations leads to breakthrough blood-stage infections upon challenge (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belnoue et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Inoue et al., 2012</a>). Reduction of the number of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i>-infected mosquitoes also reduces the frequency of sterilely protected volunteers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bijker et al., 2014</a>), indicating that the number of sporozoites establishing a liver-stage infection fails to surpass the protective threshold to elicit sterile pre-erythrocytic immunity. This may also explain why in malaria-endemic areas pre-erythrocytic immunity is thought to be absent (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tran et al., 2013</a>). In addition to maximizing specific responses against immunodominant antigens, CPS immunization with high numbers of sporozoites may broaden the immune repertoire by including protective responses against subdominant antigens, which could enhance heterologous pre-erythrocytic protection (<a href=\"#bib59\">Trieu et al., 2011</a>). This may further be enhanced by the longer liver-stage development of <i>P. falciparum</i> (egress 6.8 days after mosquito bite, <a href=\"#bib50\">Roestenberg et al., 2012</a>) compared to <i>P. chabaudi</i> (egress after 52 hr, <a href=\"#bib54\">Stephens et al., 2012</a>). Longer liver stage development may positively influence the generation of pre-erythrocytic immunity by allowing time for protective immune responses to develop."

Our results also clearly show that during CPS immunization repeated transient blood-stage infection (less than 0.01% parasitemia for 48\u201372 hr) elicits long-lasting blood-stage immunity. Protection against challenge infection was only apparent after multiple erythrocytic replication cycles and patent blood-stage parasite densities, which could indicate that blood-stage protection was not observed in CPS immunized human volunteers after direct blood-challenge because drug treatment is required at low parasite densities as soon as patency is reached (typically between the third and fourth erythrocytic cycle, <a href=\"#bib7\">Bijker et al., 2013</a>). Blood-stage parasites are however recognized in human volunteers, which was demonstrated by an earlier increase of IFN\u03b3 and monokines induced by IFN\u03b3 (MIG) concentrations in CPS immunized volunteers compared to infection controls after direct blood challenge (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bijker et al., 2013</a>).

Nevertheless, CPS immunization can elicit long-lived protection against both homologous and heterologous blood-stage parasites, which will be important to minimize disease severity in the case of breakthrough blood-stage infections.

This suggests that blood-stage parasites immediately after mosquito transmission express antigens not present on serially blood passaged parasites and that these antigens may be the target of protective immunity following CPS immunization. Serially blood passaged parasites can hence escape from CPS-induced blood-stage immunity. One group of <i>Plasmodium</i> genes, whose expression is altered by mosquito transmission during blood-stage infection is the <i>Plasmodium</i> interspersed repeat gene family (<i>pir</i>); termed <i>cir</i> in <i>P. chabaudi</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lawton et al., 2012</a>). Transcription of more than half of all <i>cir</i> genes is increased in blood-stage parasites after mosquito transmission compared with their transcription after serial blood passage. This diversification of <i>cir</i> transcription is associated with a more effective host immune response, which in turn attenuates parasite virulence (<a href=\"#bib53\">Spence et al., 2013</a>). The <i>cir</i> genes could also be candidate targets for cross-stage immunity, as <i>P. berghei pir</i> genes are also transcribed during the liver stages (personal communication BM Franke-Fayard and CJ Janse, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands). An investigation into shared PIR proteins between liver and blood-stage parasites may hence provide valuable information for multi-stage malaria vaccine development. Furthermore, the absence of blood-stage protection in previous CPS models may have been due to challenge with serially blood passaged rather then recently mosquito transmitted blood-stage parasites. It is therefore always essential to evaluate blood-stage immunity in the context of mosquito transmission."

Genetically modified <i>fabb/f</i>- sporozoites that arrest late in liver-stage development protect against <i>iv</i> challenge with 100 blood-stage parasites (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butler et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, a blood-stage infection with serially blood passaged <i>P. yoelii</i>, drug-treated with chloroquine after 4\u20135 days, reduces liver parasite load upon <i>iv</i> challenge with 35,000 sporozoites (<a href=\"#bib6\">Belnoue et al., 2008</a>). In our model of CPS immunization by mosquito bite, it is likely that repeated transient blood-stage infection during immunization elicits the observed blood-stage protection, although we cannot yet exclude that responses acquired against pre-erythrocytic antigens, which are shared with blood-stage parasites (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tarun et al., 2008</a>), contribute as well. Because of the low number of infected hepatocytes after CPS immunization with <i>P. chabaudi</i>-infected mosquito bites this seems however unlikely. Nevertheless, we demonstrate unequivocally that extended exposure to blood-stage parasites is an effective stimulator of pre-erythrocytic immunity. Exposure to blood-stage parasites during CPS immunization may thus significantly contribute to the observed pre-erythrocytic protection in human volunteers (<a href=\"#bib49\">Roestenberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bijker et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2014</a>). Indeed, cross-stage immunity could be responsible for the unprecedented efficacy of CPS immunization compared to immunization with irradiated sporozoites (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clyde et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Seder et al., 2013</a>), which arrest early during liver-stage development and never establish a blood-stage infection. While extending exposure to replicating blood-stage parasites by delayed drug administration is not possible in humans, the incorporation of chemically (<a href=\"#bib22\">Good et al., 2013</a>) or genetically (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ting et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aly et al., 2010</a>) attenuated blood-stage parasites should be considered to further enhance the generation and maintenance of both pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage immunity.

Mice were treated after each immunization with 100 mg/kg chloroquine diphosphate salt (chloroquine, Sigma, Gillingham, UK) by gavage daily for 10 days, starting from the day of mosquito transmission. Mock immunized mice received uninfected mosquito bites and chloroquine treatment. 100 days after the last CPS immunization mice were challenged with <i>P. chabaudi</i> AS or <i>P. chabaudi</i> CB-infected mosquito bites, or via <i>ip</i> injection of 100,000 parasitized erythrocytes (direct blood-challenge) that were obtained from either a donor mouse infected by mosquito bite or after serial blood passage. Since each erythrocytic cycle of <i>P. chabaudi</i> is approximately 24 hr long (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stephens et al., 2012</a>) development of blood-stage parasitemia was monitored daily by microscopy of Giemsa-stained thin blood films, from erythrocytic cycle 3 to 14 and every other day thereafter.

Using the Gentle MACS homogenizer (Miltenyi, Bisley, UK) the whole liver was homogenized in 4 ml Guanidinium thiocyanate (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) solution (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006</a>), and 600 \u03bcl aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To assess blood-parasite burden during CPS immunization and in the first erythrocytic cycles following bite challenge 10 \u03bcl of blood were isolated from the tip of the mouse-tail and after two washes in RNAse-free PBS stored at \u221280\u00b0C in 100 \u03bcl Guanidinium thiocyanate solution (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006</a>). The first sample was taken either just before (erythrocytic cycle 0) or 20 hr after liver merozoite egress (erythrocytic cycle 1) and then every 24 hr for 4 days. Since <i>P. chabaudi</i> displays a synchronous infection (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stephens et al., 2012</a>) all blood-stage parasites analyzed were therefore at the late trophozoite stage of development. RNA was extracted from liver- as well as blood-samples using the Guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol-chlorophorm method (all Sigma, Gillingham, UK; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006</a>). RNA was thereafter reverse transcribed by PCR (temperature profile: 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 20 min, 98\u00b0C for 5 min) using 75U MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, 30U RNAse Inhibitor, and 2.5 \u03bcM Random Hexamer primers (all Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK) per sample. The amount of 18S rRNA copies was quantified by Real-Time PCR using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK), 300 \u03b7M forward primer (5\u2032-AAGCATTAAATAAAGCGAATACATCCTTAT-3\u2032), 300 \u03b7M reverse primer (5\u2032-GGGAGTTTGGTTTTGACGTTTATGCG-3\u2032), and 50 \u03b7M probe ([6FAM]CAATTGGTTTACCTTTTGCTCTTT[TAM]). All reactions were performed in the ABI 7900 HT Real Time PCR machine (temperature profile: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min). The amount of parasite 18S rRNA in the liver was calculated based on a Standard curve of known copy numbers of 18S rRNA. For every experiment liver-parasite burden was normalized to the mean burden of controls infected in the same experiment. Blood-stage parasitemia was quantified based on a Standard curve of 10-fold dilutions of mosquito transmitted <i>P. chabaudi</i> AS late trophozoites prepared identically to the samples."

As discussed in comment #1 this is likely explained by longer liver-stage development and a 100-fold higher number of infected hepatocytes, which translate into exponentially more blood-stage parasites being released from the liver in human clinical trials. Here we demonstrate that exposure to a large amount of blood-stage parasites gives rise to robust pre-erythrocytic immunity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This suggests that pre-erythrocytic protection after CPS immunization of human volunteers may, at least in part, be mediated by exposure to blood-stage parasites during immunization under chloroquine cover.

Therefore, given exposure to sufficient numbers of sporozoites and blood-stage parasites, CPS immunization can elicit powerful pre-erythrocytic as well as blood-stage immunity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). CPS immunization is therefore an invaluable tool to explore the generation of antimalarial immunity against multiple parasite life cycle stages, which can empower multi-stage malaria vaccine development."
