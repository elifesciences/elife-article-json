                    "text": "Kidney formation involves patterning events that induce renal progenitors to form nephrons with an intricate composition of multiple segments. Here, we performed a chemical genetic screen using zebrafish and discovered that prostaglandins, lipid mediators involved in many physiological functions, influenced pronephros segmentation. Modulating levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) or PGB<sub>2</sub> restricted distal segment formation and expanded a proximal segment lineage. Perturbation of prostaglandin synthesis by manipulating Cox1 or Cox2 activity altered distal segment formation and was rescued by exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. Disruption of the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors Ptger2a and Ptger4a similarly affected the distal segments. Further, changes in Cox activity or PGE<sub>2</sub> levels affected expression of the transcription factors <i>irx3b</i> and <i>sim1a</i> that mitigate pronephros segment patterning. These findings show for the first time that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a regulator of nephron formation in the zebrafish embryonic kidney, thus revealing that prostaglandin signaling may have implications for renal birth defects and other diseases."

Here, we performed a chemical genetic screen using zebrafish and discovered that prostaglandins, lipid mediators involved in many physiological functions, influenced pronephros segmentation. Modulating levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) or PGB<sub>2</sub> restricted distal segment formation and expanded a proximal segment lineage. Perturbation of prostaglandin synthesis by manipulating Cox1 or Cox2 activity altered distal segment formation and was rescued by exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. Disruption of the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors Ptger2a and Ptger4a similarly affected the distal segments. Further, changes in Cox activity or PGE<sub>2</sub> levels affected expression of the transcription factors <i>irx3b</i> and <i>sim1a</i> that mitigate pronephros segment patterning. These findings show for the first time that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a regulator of nephron formation in the zebrafish embryonic kidney, thus revealing that prostaglandin signaling may have implications for renal birth defects and other diseases."

Vertebrate kidney organogenesis is a dynamic process involving the generation of up to three distinct structures that originate from the intermediate mesoderm (IM) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Saxen, 1987</a>). In mammals, a pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros develop in succession. Of these structures, the pronephros and mesonephros both eventually disintegrate, leaving the metanephros as the adult kidney. In contrast, lower vertebrates such as fish and amphibians only form a pronephros and mesonephros, which are active during embryogenesis and larval stages, respectively, and the mesonephros subsequently serves as the adult organ (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dressler, 2006</a>)."

The tubule portion of the nephron is configured along its proximo-distal axis with specific groupings of cells, termed segments, which possess unique physiological roles in solute reabsorption and secretion. While the organization of proximal and distal nephron segments is broadly conserved (<a href=\"#bib53\">Romagnani et al., 2013</a>), the genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate formation of each segment lineage have yet to be fully described (<a href=\"#bib8\">Costantini and Kopan, 2010</a>)."

Here, we depict the prostaglandin E synthase, Ptges, creating the bioactive prostaglandin PGE<sub>2</sub> that can transduce signals through binding several G-protein coupled receptors such as Ptger2a and Ptger4a. Other receptors work with other bioactive prostaglandins. Indomethacin is a nonselective Cox (Ptgs1/Ptgs2a) inhibitor that prevents prostaglandin biosynthesis."

Prior to this, the renal progenitors undergo complex segment lineage patterning events, beginning with their segregation into rostral and caudal subdomains, a process that is orchestrated by the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) which is locally secreted by the adjacent paraxial mesoderm (PM) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wingert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</a>). Modulating levels of RA affects the specification of renal progenitors, inducing proximal segment lineage formation over distal, which can be accentuated by the addition of exogenous all-trans RA, while distal fates are induced over proximal by inhibiting endogenous production of RA through the application of the biosynthesis inhibitor N,N-diethlyaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wingert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</a>).

With regard to the adult kidney, prostaglandins regulate many aspects of renal physiology, ranging from tubular transport processes to hemodynamics (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nasrallah et al., 2007</a>). Prostaglandins are lipid mediators produced by the sequential actions of a series of enzymes, and exert their effects by paracrine or autocrine signaling through distinct G-protein coupled receptors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Funk, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tootle, 2013</a>). More specifically, there are five major prostaglandins produced from the precursor arachidonic acid (AA) by the enzymes Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase one or Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2a (Ptgs1 and Ptgs2a in zebrafish, also known as cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 in mammals) followed by subsequent processing by particular synthases (<a href=\"#bib16\">Funk, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tootle, 2013</a>).

Firstly, although it is thought that various factors that produce prostaglandins are broadly expressed during ontogeny, precise knowledge about the spatiotemporal progression of particular pathway components is incomplete. Secondly, there is a substantial void in our understanding due to the results of murine loss of function studies where genetic disruptions of components within the prostaglandin pathway was associated with observably normal development. This led to the hypothesis that maternal prostaglandin sources had rescued embryogenesis, thereby complicating the use of mammalian models to study prostaglandin requirements during ontogeny. The importance of reevaluating prostaglandin signaling in kidney formation has been emphasized by a recent report that COX-2 dosage is critical for murine metanephros development, though it is presently enigmatic whether there are requirement(s) for discrete stages of nephrogenesis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Slattery et al., 2016</a>)."

A chemical genetic screen in zebrafish also identified the prostaglandin pathway as a modifier of endoderm organogenesis, where in subsequent work it was found that PGE<sub>2</sub> activity controls opposing cell fate decisions in the developing pancreas and liver through the <i>ep4a</i> receptor (also known as <i>ptger4a</i>), which derive from a bipotential endoderm progenitor (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garnaas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nissim et al., 2014</a>).

Further, we found that addition of PGE<sub>2</sub> was sufficient to rescue distal segmentation in Ptgs1 and Ptgs2a deficient zebrafish. Interestingly, treatment with exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> or PGB<sub>2</sub> during nephrogenesis induced a striking expansion of a proximal tubule segment lineage in a dosage-dependent manner. Taken together, this work reveals for the first time that alterations in PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling, and possibly other prostaglandins as well, has important consequences for the developing nephron."

The zebrafish pronephros is an experimentally tractable system to interrogate the genetic factors that regulate nephrogenesis because of its simple, conserved tubule structure, with two proximal segments and two distal segments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ebarasi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Drummond and Wingert, 2016</a>). The nephrons share a blood filter comprised of podocyte cells (P), followed by a neck (N) segment that transports fluid into the tubule, and finally a pronephric duct (PD) that drains caudally at the cloaca (C), a common exit for the kidney and gut in the embryo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle panel). Nephron segment fates are established by the 24 hpf stage, based on the expression of unique solute transporters, and each segment has been mapped to a precise axial location relative to the somites that comprise the embryonic trunk (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom panel), which facilitates the analysis of pattern formation within the renal progenitor field (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wingert et al., 2007</a>)."

Therefore, we hypothesized that a chemical genetic screen could provide new insights about the identity of nephrogenesis regulators. To this end, we performed a chemical genetic screen using the Screen-Well ICCB Known Bioactives Library (Enzo Life Sciences), a collection that includes 480 compounds with known biological activities. Zebrafish embryos were collected from timed matings of wild-type (WT) adults, and then arrayed in 96-well plates for control (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) or experimental treatment between 4 and 24 hpf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At the 24 hpf stage, embryos were fixed for multiplex WISH analysis, during which they were assessed for expression of a set of genetic markers that distinguished alternating nephron segments within the pronephros, namely <i>wt1b</i> to directly label the P, <i>slc20a1a</i> to label the PCT, and <i>slc12a1</i> to label the DE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

In conjunction with this change, the DL segment was significantly reduced in length, as visualized by WISH with the marker <i>slc12a3</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). Additionally, the rostral domain of the PCT was reduced in a dosage-dependent fashion, based on expression of <i>slc20a1a</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). Further, there was a caudal shift in the position of the DE segment though its absolute length was unchanged, based on expression of the DE-specific marker <i>slc12a1</i>, which resides between the domains of the PST and DL segments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). Overall, these results recapitulated the phenotypes observed following treatment with various bioactive prostaglandins during the chemical screen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To determine if embryo dimensions were a factor in pronephros segment domain changes, we measured control and treated embryos from tip to tail as well as their pronephric domain (somite 3 to somite 18). We found no statistical differences in the body axis length or pronephric domain between WT controls and dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated embryos (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To further gauge the possible side effects of dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment on surrounding tissues, we assessed development of specific tissues using WISH. We noted no significant changes in the vascular marker <i>flk1</i> or primitive blood precursors using the marker <i>gata1</i> between WT controls and 100 \u03bcM dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated\u00a0embryos (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Furthermore, we performed o-dianisidine staining, which labels hemoglobinized erythrocytes and thereby provides a sensitive assessment of defects in circulation or vascular integrity that can be undetected by live imaging with stereomicroscopy. o-dianisidine staining showed that blood flow in WTs and 100 \u03bcM dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated embryos was equivalent through the 48\u201355 hpf stage, as we did not observe compromised vessel integrity or hematomas (e.g. bleeding, blood pooling) (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). This suggests that PGE<sub>2</sub> exposure did not cause major aberrations in tissues surrounding the pronephros. In sum, these observations confirmed the finding from the chemical screen that exogenous PGB<sub>2</sub> had profound effects on nephron segment formation, and revealed that alterations in PGE<sub>2</sub> had similar consequences."

To test this, we incubated WT embryos with the compound indomethacin, a nonselective Cox1 and Cox2 enzyme inhibitor, which inhibits the first stage of prostanoid biosynthesis, and has been shown to suppress PGE<sub>2</sub> production in zebrafish by mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grosser et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">North et al., 2007</a>).

However, the balance of distal segments was disrupted after indomethacin treatment, such that the majority of embryos developed an <i>slc12a1</i>-expressing DE segment that was significantly expanded in length and an <i>slc12a3</i>-expressing DL segment that was significantly reduced in length compared to wild-type controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B and C</a>). Absolute segment length measurements of the proximal domains in indomethacin treated embryos compared to wild-types confirmed there was no significant change in the lengths of these segments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As with dmPGE2 treated embryos, we assessed the effect of indomethacin exposure at this dosage with various morphological dimensions and the formation of surrounding tissues such as the vasculature, and observed no differences compared to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 3</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s4\">4</a>)."

Indomethacin treatment during this time window elicited an expansion of the DE domain and a reduction of the DL similar to that seen from indomethacin treatments from 4 hpf to 24 hpf (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Further, dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment from the\u00a012 ss to 24 hpf was sufficient to induce an expansion of the PST and a reduction of the DL (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Absolute measurements of these segments changes in indomethacin and dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated embryos revealed that they were significant compared to controls and were similar to pharmacological exposures performed between the 4 hpf and 24 hpf time period (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Interestingly, we also found that treatments with either of two different Ptger2 small molecule antagonists, PF04418948 or AH6809, from the 12 ss to 24 hpf was likewise sufficient to induce a statistically significant expansion of the DE segment and reduction of the DL segment compared to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Prostaglandins have diverse and potent biological actions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Funk, 2001</a>), however, their effects on developing tissues including stem cells have only recently begun to be appreciated (<a href=\"#bib48\">North et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Goessling et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nissim et al., 2014</a>). By conducting a chemical genetic screen in zebrafish embryos to identify factors that affect nephron development, we found that several prostaglandin moieties were capable of modulating proximal-distal segmentation, first validating PGB<sub>2</sub> and then subsequently identifying PGE<sub>2</sub> as well (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Specifically, we demonstrated that the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> or PGB<sub>2</sub> was sufficient to increase PST segment size in a dosage-dependent manner. Using several chemical and genetic approaches, we demonstrated that abrogated prostaglandin activity alters formation of the DE and DL nephron tubule segments, where deficiencies in <i>ptgs1</i>, <i>ptgs2a</i>, or the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors encoded by <i>ptger2a</i> and <i>ptger4a</i> led to an expanded DE and reduced DL segment, and that PGE<sub>2</sub> could specifically rescue the loss of Ptgs1 or Ptgs2a. We also determined that changes in Cox-mediated prostaglandin synthesis or PGE<sub>2</sub> correlated with alterations in the expression domains of essential segmentation transcription factors in renal progenitors, suggesting some mechanisms by which prostaglandin signaling acts to influence segmentation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Understanding how these changes relate with morphogenesis involving cellular dynamics (e.g. proliferation, turnover) or even migration of the renal progenitors will be important aspects for future investigations."

Based on this and our ability to rescue Cox1/2 deficiency with dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment alone, we theorize that PGE<sub>2</sub> is the central endogenous signaling component that affects pronephros development. Further, the localization of <i>ptger2a</i> and <i>ptger4a</i> expression in renal progenitors suggests that these cells directly receive and respond to prostaglandin signals. Since prostaglandins are known to act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion with short half-lives, we speculate that the IM renal precursors themselves or nearby tissues like the paraxial mesoderm are the local source(s) of prostanoids. Based on the results of several epistasis experiments, we currently hypothesize that PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling restricts the DE fate in part by negatively regulating <i>irx3b</i>, and that elevated PGE<sub>2</sub> levels expand the PST segment through positive regulation of <i>sim1a</i>, though future studies are needed to delineate if these interactions are direct or indirect (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Therefore, the zebrafish pronephric model provides an alternative for continued genetic dissection of the cellular and molecular effects in nephron development due to alterations in prostaglandin levels. Based on the requirement for PGE<sub>2</sub> during pronephros development, it will be interesting to explore its effects on renal progenitors in other stages of zebrafish kidney ontogeny, and during new nephron formation and epithelial regeneration events in adults as well (<a href=\"#bib40\">McCampbell et al., 2015</a>).

For example, we have previously shown that RA acts as a morphogen in the zebrafish, and that a gradient of RA induces proximalization of the impending pronephros (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wingert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</a>). It is intriguing to speculate that a prostaglandin signaling gradient, where PGE<sub>2</sub> acts as a morphogen, as recently proposed (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nissim et al., 2014</a>), may articulate with RA to balance proximo-distal specification of the renal progenitors, though further studies are needed to interrogate this possibility. In addition, prostaglandins have been shown to initiate transcription through either interacting with cognate Ptger (EP) receptors or alternatively, passing through the cell membrane and binding with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guan and Breyer, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Berger and Moller, 2002</a>).

Also, it has been shown that different prostaglandins can interact interchangeably, at the right concentration, with the various Ptger receptors (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tootle, 2013</a>).

                                "text": "Prostaglandins have only just started to become recognized as important factors and determinants of cell fate decisions and growth during development. These new roles for prostaglandins have been revealed in part through a study showing that PGE<sub>2</sub> activity has a conserved function to expand the domain of HSCs in development and enhance their ability to home to the bone marrow in transplants (<a href=\"#bib48\">North et al., 2007</a>). PGE<sub>2</sub> is currently in phase two clinical trials for increasing the efficiency of bone marrow transplants (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hagedorn et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, PGE<sub>2</sub> was shown to be a regulator of bipotential endoderm cell fate decisions in development for zebrafish and mouse endodermal cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nissim et al., 2014</a>). Curiously, it was also shown that PGE<sub>2</sub> activity later in organ formation induced proliferation of both the liver and pancreas buds. This change in the function of PGE<sub>2</sub> is explained by the spatial and temporal expression of <i>ptger2a</i> and <i>ptger4a,</i> where blocking <i>ptger2a</i> promoted liver versus pancreas specification and blocking <i>ptger4a</i> promoted the outgrowth of the liver and pancreas buds. These cornerstone studies, along with the present report, give credence to the notion that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a key regulator of progenitor populations during embryogenesis and set the stage for further inquiry into how prostaglandin signaling affects developing cell populations. As more knowledge comes to light about how PGE<sub>2</sub> and other prostaglandins influence ontogeny, they are likely to become an increasingly intriguing option for clinical therapeutic applications."

The authors have used a chemical genetic approach to identify prostaglandins as mediators that influence cell fate choice during development of the proximal and distal nephron segments. Results from the pharmacological screen have been validated through the use of morpholino-based gene knockdown to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. The authors propose that the prostaglandin pathway acts upstream of the previously-identified transcriptional regulators Irx3b and Sim1a in the developing pronephros. The reviewers and editors agreed that the work was interesting and potentially significant. However, they also had some concerns that should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript, as outlined below."

These concerns are exacerbated by the rather mild nephric phenotypes described for prostaglandin pathway morphants. The option of indirect phenotypes therefore needs further discussion. In addition, experiments with later onset of agonist treatment are also required to exclude interference with general early embryonic patterning, for example by Wnt signalling.

Prostaglandins and in particular PGE2 have well documented functions in postnatal mammalian kidney development and renal physiology. In contrast, very little is known about activities in early kidney formation, mainly as genetic studies in mouse provided no major evidence for such requirements. In a screen for small compounds affecting zebrafish pronephron formation Poureetezadi et al. identified several prostaglandin agonists as agents causing caudally shifted or expanded tubule segments upon treatment of embryos between 4-24hpf. Detailed pharmacological analyses confirmed dose-dependent activities of PGE2 and the PGE2-derived PGB2 in tubule segmentation, and provided hints for a requirement of prostaglandin synthesizing enzymes COX1/2 and the PGE2 receptors Ptger2a/4a in the precise positioning of caudal segments. The pharmacological loss-of-function data were further confirmed by knockdown studies using morpholinos that supposedly prevent expression of COX1/2 and Ptger2a/4a proteins. Further, the authors show that nephric phenotypes seen after early embryonic interference with prostaglandin signaling correlate with changed expression of key transcriptional regulators of tubule segmentation and they provided evidence for a genetic role of prostaglandin signaling upstream of these factors. This interesting work is the first one demonstrating prostaglandin activities in nephric tubule patterning."

The images shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>\u2014figure supplement.4 suggest a restricted expression of ptger2a/4a in proximal tubule of 12-24ss embryos. In case of a direct function, pharmacological treatments starting at 12ss rather than at 4hpf should be sufficient to induce relevant gain and loss of function phenotypes. Additional data should be provided to confirm nephron specificity and to give details on the posterior-anterior extent of ptger2a/4a expression (for example sections and co-stains with nephric markers). Further, studies should be performed to determine the critical time-window of prostaglandin responsiveness."

Specifically they found that exposure to prostaglandin agonists expanded the proximal segment (slc20a1a+) lineage and inhibited distal fate (slc12a1a+). In contrast inhibition of PG synthesis altered the distribution of specific distal fates. The authors also identified downstream consequences on key segment associated genes (irx3b and sim1a) that appeared to be influenced, directly or indirectly by PG modulation. The data presented throughout the paper strongly support the authors claims, however, descriptions of prostaglandin synthesis and signaling cascades are over-simplified, and general claims are made for \"prostaglandins\" when only PGE2-specific components are thoroughly investigated. As several types of prostaglandins were isolated in the screen, which can act in methods different from that investigated here (thromboxane receptor and PPARg), more precise language and a rationale for selecting PGE2 (not hit in the screen) would aid the reader. Similarly, while the data is nicely presented and logically organized to support the authors conclusions, the paper would benefit from addition of quantitative evaluations to aid appreciation by those outside of the field."

Similarly, Ptges is the enzyme for prostaglandin E2 synthesis (hence the \"e\" in its name, not general secondary processing), and Ptgers are the receptors for PGE2, not all of the PGs. While PTGS inhibition (Cox enzymes), could indeed broadly impact PG synthesis, the rest is quite specific to PGE2 and should not be generalized in the text, particularly when the screen hit several other potential modifiers as relevant to kidney biogenesis. This is not to say the data for PGE2 modification is wrong, it is just over generalized to \"prostaglandins\" and as such could cause issues for future investigations."

Using treatments with the pathway agonists (dmPGE2, PGB2) or inhibitors, and antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to impair expression of the PG synthetizing enzymes and their receptors (Ptger2a, Ptger4a), the authors provide evidence that prostaglandin signaling limits distal segment formation while promoting the proximal pronephric fates, acting upstream of Irx3b and Sim1a transcription factors, which have been previously implicated in this process. This is a very interesting work that expands our appreciation of the roles of prostaglandin signaling in cell fate specification during vertebrate embryogenesis. These roles were difficult to discern in the murine model, but recent studies in mouse and human point to PG involvement in kidney development and function. The authors leverage the experimental strengths of the zebrafish model, in which prostaglandin signaling can be easily manipulated during kidney development and the resulting effects can be monitored."

We edited the figure legend to remind readers that we correlated a change in the <i>irx3b</i> domain to the shift in the DE location, and that changes in the <i>mecom</i> expression domain correlate with the DL reduction in both (A) and (B)."

While it might be interesting to look across groups in some cases, our primary goal of these statistical analyses was to determine whether PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment or alterations of endogenous prostaglandin biosynthesis significantly altered nephron segments compared to wild-type control embryos, as opposed to delving into the cross-treatment comparisons."
