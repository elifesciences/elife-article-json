                    "text": "Auditory function is dependent on the formation of specific innervation patterns between mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and afferent spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). In particular, type I SGNs must precisely connect with inner HCs (IHCs) while avoiding connections with nearby outer HCs (OHCs). The factors that mediate these patterning events are largely unknown. Using sparse-labeling and time-lapse imaging, we visualized for the first time the behaviors of developing SGNs including active retraction of processes from OHCs, suggesting that some type I SGNs contact OHCs before forming synapses with IHCs. In addition, we demonstrate that expression of Semaphorin-3F in the OHC region inhibits type I SGN process extension by activating Neuropilin-2 receptors expressed on SGNs. These results suggest a model in which cochlear innervation patterns by type I SGNs are determined, at least in part, through a Semaphorin-3F-mediated inhibitory signal that impedes processes from extending beyond the IHC region."

In particular, type I SGNs must precisely connect with inner HCs (IHCs) while avoiding connections with nearby outer HCs (OHCs). The factors that mediate these patterning events are largely unknown. Using sparse-labeling and time-lapse imaging, we visualized for the first time the behaviors of developing SGNs including active retraction of processes from OHCs, suggesting that some type I SGNs contact OHCs before forming synapses with IHCs. In addition, we demonstrate that expression of Semaphorin-3F in the OHC region inhibits type I SGN process extension by activating Neuropilin-2 receptors expressed on SGNs. These results suggest a model in which cochlear innervation patterns by type I SGNs are determined, at least in part, through a Semaphorin-3F-mediated inhibitory signal that impedes processes from extending beyond the IHC region."

Although the type I SGNs ultimately formed connections with inner hair cells, many of them made contact with outer hair cells first. These contacts were short-lived thanks to a protein found near the outer hair cells, named Semaphorin-3F. This protein repels the type I SGNs by activating a receptor on their surface called Neuropilin-2, and so directs the type I SGNs towards the inner hair cells."

SGNs are bipolar afferents linking the peripheral and central auditory systems by projecting peripheral axons that form ribbon-type synapses with cochlear HCs, and central axons that synapse with neurons in the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nayagam et al., 2011</a>). It is known that SGN loss is a key aspect of congenital or noise-induced hearing loss, but only a small handful of mechanisms controlling the formation of this part of the auditory system have been identified (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fritzsch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Green et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Coate and Kelley, 2013</a>). During mouse development, otic neuroblasts delaminate from the otocyst around embryonic day 8.5 and then differentiate into either vestibular or auditory (spiral ganglion [SG]) neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Coate and Kelley, 2013</a>). Subsequently, the SGN somata extend in a spiral that mirrors the adjacent developing cochlear duct (\u223cE11.5-P0) while projecting peripheral processes (sometimes termed \u2018peripheral axons\u2019 or \u2018dendrites\u2019) into the sensory epithelium and central axons into the brainstem. The dependence of neurotrophins for the survival and viability of SGNs during these stages has been documented extensively (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fritzsch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Green et al., 2012</a>), but relatively little is known about the mechanisms controlling SGN diversification and wiring with specific cochlear HC regions during development."

                        "text": "Although SGNs show little morphological variability, they are clearly diverse in several ways. First, SGNs are divided into two broad categories: type I and type II. Type I SGNs represent 90\u201395% of the total SGN population, form monosynaptic contacts with individual inner HCs (IHCs), and facilitate the majority of all hearing function. Type II SGNs comprise the remaining 5\u201310% of the SGN population, and, in contrast with Type I SGNs, bypass the IHCs to form <i>en passant</i> synapses with up to 10 outer HCs (OHCs) per individual SGN fiber (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In addition, type II SGNs are not myelinated by the neural crest derived-Schwann cells that myelinate type I SGNs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carney and Silver, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Breuskin et al., 2010</a>). Although their function is not well understood, recent landmark studies have suggested that type II SGNs may facilitate responses to very loud or painful sounds (<a href=\"#bib47\">Weisz et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2014</a>). SGNs also show differences in protein expression and firing rates that correlate with their location along the tonotopic axis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Flores-Otero et al., 2007</a>). Finally, type I fibers can be sub-divided into two groups based on spontaneous firing rates and synaptic location at the base of individual IHCs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liberman, 1982</a>)."

One of the most basic issues has been the question of whether individual SGN fibers are specified as either type I or type II prior to the arrival of their peripheral processes in the cochlear duct or if phenotype is established based on interactions within the target environment. Echteler used horse radish peroxidase staining to provide evidence that, in the postnatal gerbil cochlea, immature SGNs show unbiased innervation to both HC regions and are subsequently retained in either the IHC or OHC region likely through a process of selective pruning and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Echteler, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Echteler et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, rhodamine-dextran dye-labeling of type I SGNs in mouse suggested that HC innervation was non-specific until about postnatal day 3 when refinement events seemed to commence (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2007</a>). However, genetic-labeling experiments in which sparse numbers of SGNs expressed alkaline phosphatase under the control of Cre recombinase (driven by <i>Neurogenin-1</i> promoter elements; <i>Neurog1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup>) suggested that \u2018mature\u2019 SGN innervation patterns are present by birth (<a href=\"#bib32\">Koundakjian et al., 2007</a>). These results provide conflicting conclusions regarding the timing and determination of type I and type II SGNs. We sought to gain clarity on this issue by combining the same <i>Neurog1</i><sup><i>CreERT2</i></sup> allele with a tdTomato reporter in order to characterize the timeline of IHC and OHC innervation by the SGNs. In addition, we designed experiments to investigate potential molecular mechanisms controlling the differential innervation of IHCs and OHCs and discovered a prominent chemorepulsive role for Neuropilin-2 and its ligand, Semaphorin-3F."

At embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), prior to detectable expression of Atoh1, SGN processes are present outside of the duct, but do not yet project into the cochlear epithelium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). By one day later (E14.5), processes have entered the epithelium at the more mature base of the cochlea while remaining outside in less mature, more mid-modiolar regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Neurite entry correlates with the onset of Atoh1 expression in developing HCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; arrow). At E15.5, the ratio of SGN processes projecting towards the emerging OHC region appears to be closer to 50:50 than to the mature ratio of 5:95 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>; see arrowheads). However, at E16.5, a noticeably higher concentration of processes appears around the IHC region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>; see arrowheads). These data suggest that the SGNs may assume a type I- or type II-like morphology as early as E16.5, which is both consistent with the time period of hair and supporting cell maturation and earlier than previously suggested. Consequently, we focused on these earlier time points in subsequent investigations into the cellular and molecular nature of IHC and OHC innervation."

The mice also carried the <i>Atoh1</i><sup><i>nGFP</i></sup> transgene (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lumpkin et al., 2003</a>), which allows for easy identification of IHCs and OHCs. At the mid-point along the cochlea at E15.5, approximately 60% of individual SGN fibers terminated in the IHC region while the remaining 40% extended into the OHC region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,E</a>). However, in a more basal region of the same cochlea, the number of fibers terminating in the IHC and OHC regions was roughly equivalent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These results were comparable to the distribution of total fibers that was observed in cross-sections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). In contrast, at E17.5 or 18.5, between 70 to 80% of all labeled processes were apposed to IHCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>), suggesting that a progressive transition to the mature innervation pattern begins shortly after E15.5. Consistent with this trend, at P0 and through P3, approximately 90\u201395% of all labeled SGNs fibers terminated in the IHC region with the remaining 5\u201310% extending into the OHC region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J,K</a>). Previously, studies using the postnatal gerbil showed that programmed cell death may contribute to the final distribution of type I and II SGNs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Echteler et al., 2005</a>). To determine if apoptosis could play a role in SGN innervation patterns during embryonic mouse development, we examined cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) immunostaining at E16.5 and E17.5 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In the basal half of the cochlea at these stages, where most of our neuronal-tracing experiments were performed, we detected between 4 and 19 CC3-positive SGNs per cochlea. At the apex, between 18 and 50 CC3-positive SGNs were observed per cochlea. Given that the number of SGNs is estimated to be greater than twenty thousand at this stage (<a href=\"#bib40\">Richter et al., 2011</a>), a role for apopotic cell death in SGN innervation at this stage seems unlikely."

However, an alternate, or possibly, additional hypothesis would be that the population of SGNs observed at E15.5 is largely stable and that the change in the ratio of axon distribution is a result of the arrival of new SGN peripheral fibers in the IHC region. These new fibers would effectively decrease the percentage of fibers projecting to the OHC region. To determine whether existing OHC fibers retract during development, we performed time-lapse imaging using cochleae from N<sup>Cre</sup>R<sup>Tom</sup>;<i>Atoh1</i><sup><i>nGFP</i></sup> mice for up to 20 hr starting at ages E15.5 or E16.5 (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Analysis of time-lapse videos indicated numerous instances of SGN processes that extended into the OHC region and then retracted back into the IHC region or that were present in the OHC region at the beginning of the experiment and then retracted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We quantified this effect for axons in four independent time-lapse experiments and found that 10\u201360% of the axons that started in the OHC region had retracted by the end of the acquisition period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Because of the thickness of the tissue, we were not able to resolve the final location of each process that retracted from the OHC region; however, many of them appeared to aggregate around the IHCs (white arrowheads; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In addition, although we cannot rule out that it occurs at all, we never identified new SGNs approaching the IHCs in these experiments. Overall, these data indicate that many SGN peripheral axons initially extend into the OHC region but subsequently retract to form connections with IHCs. Moreover, these results suggest that most SGNs have determined their phenotype (type I vs type II) by the late embryonic period or just shortly after birth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

The Neuropilins are a well-known class of axon-guidance receptors that are activated by secreted Semaphorins (Sema3s) and play diverse roles in innervation of both the central and peripheral nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</a>). Moreover, our previous unpublished studies using RT-PCR demonstrated that <i>Neuropilin-2</i> (<i>Nrp2</i>) is expressed in whole cochleae at E16.5. Therefore, to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of Nrp2, we localized Nrp2 protein (<a href=\"#bib20\">Giger et al., 2000</a>) on cross-sections of developing cochleae and counterstained with Tuj1 to mark SGN somata and their processes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013H</a>). For the cross-sections shown here, identical fixation, immunostaining, and imaging parameters were used throughout. At E14.5, Nrp2 was detectable in the SGNs, but not in surrounding mesenchyme or epithelial tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). At E16.5, when SGNs develop region-specific innervation patterns, Nrp2 is clearly detectable in the somata and peripheral axons of the SGNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). The Nrp2 antibody labeled all of the SGN cell bodies, which suggests Nrp2 is expressed by all SGNs. Consistent with this conclusion, Nrp2 was visible along all putative type I and II SGN endings in cross-sections at E18.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>) and in whole-mount preparations at P0 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). Interestingly, while cross-sections from P0 and P5 cochleae indicated persistent expression of Nrp2 protein in SGN somata, the overall intensity of staining was substantially reduced by comparison with the earlier time points (not shown)."

To test this, we analyzed SGN process extensions in cochleae from <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib20\">Giger et al., 2000</a>). As expected, in wild type (WT) cochleae at E15.5, SGN processes are nearly evenly distributed between the IHC and OHC regions of the organ of Corti (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013K</a>). In contrast, in <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae at E15.5, there were large bundles of SGN processes that extended into the OHC region, with far fewer processes terminating near the IHC region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L\u2013N</a>). These changes were not a result of a decrease in the total number of SGNs, as quantifying SGN somata density indicated no differences between WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3O</a>). In order to quantify changes in SGN patterning in <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants, it was necessary to discriminate SGNs from associated olivocochlear efferent fibers. Since both are labeled by pan-neuronal markers such as neurofilament or beta-III-tubulin (Tuj1), we screened over a dozen antibodies against known neuronal factors and found that synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) antibodies label the SGN afferent axons but do not mark olivocochlear efferents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P\u2013T</a>). Triple labeling with Tuj1 (all neurons, blue), Syt-1 (SGN afferent axons, red), and GAP-43 (olivocochlear efferents, green; <a href=\"#bib43\">Simmons et al., 1996</a>) in an E17.5 cochlea demonstrates the specificity of the Syt-1 antibody for afferent SGN axons. Next, the number of SGN fibers that cross into the OHC region in WT, <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+</i>/\u2212</sup>, and <i>Nrp2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cochleae was quantified by labeling with Syt-1 antibodies at E16.5. Results indicate significant increases in the number of crossing fibers in both <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+</i>/\u2212</sup> and <i>Nrp2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cochleae (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3U</a>).

However, phenotypic defects in midline commissural axon path finding have been reported in <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice, suggesting that heterozygosity for <i>Nrp2</i> can lead to a significant decrease in Nrp2 protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2000</a>). To determine if this is the case in SGNs, we examined protein levels by Western blot and found a significant decrease in Nrp in <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). It was surprising that the <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> heterozygous cochleae consistently had so little Nrp2 protein, but previous reports have shown positive feedback/autocrine loops associated with <i>Nrp2</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tyler Hillman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Goel et al., 2013</a>). Based on these results and the fact that <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice demonstrate limited survival past birth, we used the <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice to examine changes in SGN innervation at postnatal ages. Moreover, in order to unambiguously visualize potential changes in axonal morphology or path finding, the <i>Nrp2</i> mutant strain was bred onto the N<sup>Cre</sup>;R<sup>Tom</sup> line. This allowed visualization of a limited number of SGN axons in animals with significantly decreased Nrp2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). As expected, an increased percentage of SGN fibers extended into the OHC region in <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>; see arrowheads). To quantify these changes, we determined percentages of labeled fibers with type I- and type II-like morphologies in cochleae from WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice. In previous studies, anti-peripherin immunolabeling has been used to label type II SGNs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Defourny et al., 2013</a>), but we and others have found significant peripherin expression in type I SGNs through postnatal day 6.

Therefore, we wanted to examine whether decreased levels of Nrp2 led to increases in either the number or length of small exploratory processes at the ends of SGN peripheral axons. To accomplish this, terminals of individual SGN peripheral axons were examined in cochleae from WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mutants (with sparse SGN labeling) at P1. The ends of the type II SGNs showed tremendous morphological variability at these stages, but we were not able to detect any substantial differences between <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> and WT. However, we were able to systematically measure and count the number of small branches at the ends of type I SGNs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> SGNs did not show differences in filopodial length (not shown), but <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> SGNs neurites did show a significant increase in the number of filopodial branches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013H</a>). Finally, we examined the synaptic locations of type I SGNs in WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae, as previous work has suggested that low-spontaneous rate fibers synapse on the medial side of IHCs, while high-spontaneous rate fibers synapse on the lateral sides (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liberman, 1982</a>). We tracked over 1500 SGNs between <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> and WT cochleae and found no differences in the percentages of medially or laterally positioned SGNs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). These data support the hypothesis that Nrp2 mediates an inhibitory signal within SGN fibers that decreases terminal complexity and prevents fibers from extending processes into the OHC region. However, Nrp2 does not appear to play a role in the patterning of fibers within the IHC region."

Given that decreased Nrp2 results in an increase in the number of SGN processes in the OHC region, we speculated that this should result in an increase in the number of synaptic ribbon bodies in OHCs. To investigate this, we labeled and counted Ribeye-positive puncta at the base of IHCs and OHCs in WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae at P8 and P21 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). Surprisingly, synapse numbers for both IHCs and OHCs were unchanged between WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). For these studies, we were also able to examine both cochleae from one surviving <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mouse at P21. However, no difference in number of ribbon synapses (as compared to controls) was observed in these cochleae either. Consistent with this result, assessment of hearing sensitivity by auditory brainstem response indicated no significant differences between WT and <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice (not shown). To further examine innervation in <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> adult cochleae, we compared numbers of type II SGNs between <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mutants and WT using sparse SGN labeling. Although there was a small increase in type II projections in <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae as compared to controls, the difference was not significant. Overall, these results suggest that innervation is normal in adult <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> cochleae. The basis for the change in innervation patterns between embryonic/early postnatal and adult <i>Nrp2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> animals is unclear. However, after birth, the cochlea goes through a significant phase of synaptic pruning in conjunction with innervation by olivocochlear efferents (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, it seems likely that this pruning mechanism is independent of Nrp2 and can therefore act to correct any increases in SGN fibers in the OHC region."

To determine which of these ligands could be activating Nrp2 on SGNs, we localized <i>Sema3</i> transcripts by in situ hybridization. <i>Sema3b</i> (not shown) and <i>Sema3c</i> showed a nearly identical expression pattern; mRNA was detectable in the SG, in the greater epithelial ridge (GER; non-sensory cells) of the cochlear epithelium, and very faintly in the IHC and OHCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). <i>Sema3d</i> mRNA was not detectable in the SG but was detectable in an unusual striping pattern in the GER (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>; see the arrow in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In situ hybridization for <i>Sema3g</i> was not performed, but Richardson et al. did not detect <i>Sema3g</i> expression in the E14.5 cochlea (<a href=\"#bib39\">Richardson et al., 2014</a>). In contrast with these results, <i>Sema3f</i> mRNA is expressed in a pattern highly suggestive of a role in activating Nrp2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013N</a>). At E14.5 (not shown) and E16.5, <i>Sema3f</i> transcripts were detectable in the apical, middle, and basal turns of the cochlea in a pattern that is distinct from the other <i>Sema3s</i> we examined (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Expression of <i>Sema3f</i> is present in two regions of the duct: an extreme medial region near the junction with Reissner's membrane and in a lateral domain that correlates with the developing sensory epithelium. At higher magnification, <i>Sema3f</i> appears to be expressed in a domain of cells that includes OHCs, pillar cells (PCs), Dieters' cells, and Henson's cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). Moreover, the domain has a sharp medial boundary that appears to correlate with the junction between the IHC and OHC regions. To better resolve the spatial distribution of <i>Sema3f</i> mRNA, we post-stained samples with antibodies against myosin VI and Neurofilament light chain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J\u2013L</a>). The merged image demonstrates that <i>Sema3f</i> expression clearly overlaps with the OHC region and is completely absent from the IHC region. In addition, the sharp medial boundary appears to precisely correlate with the limiting extension of developing SGN processes. At postnatal day 0 (P0), <i>Sema3f</i> expression in the cochlea is diminished and the distribution pattern has changed. At the apex, <i>Sema3f</i> is detectable in the PCs and faintly present in nearby supporting cells, while at the cochlear base, <i>Sema3f</i> expression is limited to just the outer PCs. At P5, <i>Sema3f</i> was not detectable in the cochlear epithelium (not shown). These data suggest that Sema3F protein is distributed in a spatial and temporal pattern consistent with a role in activating Nrp2 on SGNs."

Therefore, the Sema3F-Fc experiments were repeated using cochleae from N<sup>Cre</sup>;R<sup>Tom</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013K</a>). While exposure to Sema3F-Fc did not decrease the number of processes that reached the IHC region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013G</a>), there was an obvious decrease in the number of branched protrusions per process (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,I</a>). To quantify this change, the number of branches per process was determined for greater than 50 SGNs from each treatment group. Results indicate a significant reduction in the number of branches in the presence of Sema3F-Fc (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a localized source of Sema3F in the OHC region acts to activate Nrp2 in SGN growth cones leading to decreased complexity and extension."

To visualize individual fibers, the sparse-labeling alleles were bred onto the <i>Sema3f</i> mutant line (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>).

Therefore, we examined Plexin-A3 expression in the SGNs during developmental periods corresponding with IHC and OHC innervation (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas Website clearly show <i>Plxna3</i> mRNA distribution in the cochleovestibular ganglion at E11.5 and in the SGNs at E13.5 and E15.5 (<a href=\"http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/gene/show/18610\">http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/gene/show/18610</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To verify these results, we generated <i>Plxna3</i> sense and antisense mRNA probes and performed in situ hybridization at E16.5. Consistent with the Allen Brain Atlas, <i>Plxna3</i> antisense probes indicated broad expression in SGNs in both the apical and basal regions of the cochlea (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>). Using differential interference contrast to closely examine the SGNs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>), we did not detect any obvious differences in <i>Plxna3</i> mRNA within the population, suggesting uniform expression of <i>Plxna3</i>. In contrast, examination of Plexin-A3 protein distribution in whole-mount preparations at E16.5 indicated a striking difference in Plexin-A3 levels in SGN peripheral processes. At low magnification, Plexin-A3 protein is visible broadly in the SGN processes in a pattern similar to that of Tuj1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G\u2013I</a>). However, at high-magnification, Plexin-A3 expression in fibers extending beyond the IHC region is markedly reduced by comparison with substantially higher levels in fibers that terminate near IHCs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G\u2013L</a>). Since SGNs are actively probing the IHC and OHC regions at this stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2</a>), individual fibers cannot unambiguously be designated as \u2018type I\u2019 or \u2018type II\u2019. But, Plexin-A3 expression on fibers located in the OHC region is detectable only on sparse numbers of SGNs as small puncta (arrowheads). These data suggest that Plexin-A3 may act as an Nrp2 co-receptor in SGNs, and that differences in Plexin-A3 protein levels could modulate Sema3F-mediated repulsion."

Despite initial descriptions dating back more than 100 years, our understanding of the development and organization of this structure remains limited. A particularly intriguing issue has been the question of whether type I and type II SGNs are determined as a result of the expression of distinct transcriptional networks, as a result of interactions between peripheral axons and target HCs, or a combination of both. Classic studies of developing SGNs by Echteler and others indicated the presence of individual fibers in contact with both IHCs and OHCs, supporting the possibility of target-mediated determination of SGN cell types (<a href=\"#bib15\">Echteler, 1992</a>). However, more recent work using genetic labeling provides strong evidence for the presence of committed type I and type II SGN fibers in the mouse inner ear even at embryonic ages (<a href=\"#bib32\">Koundakjian et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, detailed morphological and cellular analyses by N Druckenbroad and L Goodrich (personal communication) revealed that both type I and II SGNs show stereotyped path-finding behaviors, supporting the idea that each SGN subtype may be predetermined to an extent. The results presented here (and by Druckenbroad and Goodrich) show that cochlear innervation normally involves the transient extension of SGN fibers into the OHC region between E15.5 and E16.5. After this brief period and continuing through P0, the majority of SGN processes converge on the IHC region. This occurs through both the arrival of new fibers and the retraction of existing processes from the OHC region. Labeling of future type I fibers with transient OHC extensions could appear as individual neurons with indeterminate phenotypes. Moreover, considering that the cells within the cochlear epithelium are in the process of both differentiation and active extension between E15.5 and E16.5 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yamamoto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wu and Kelley, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Coate and Kelley, 2013</a>), it is not surprising that SGN processes might also be highly dynamic during this time period. Nrp2-mediated repulsion in response to Sema3F was identified many years ago and has been documented in multiple events ranging from axon guidance to synaptic pruning (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Giger et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Demyanenko et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, there is strong precedent for Sema3F-Nrp2 interactions serving a repulsive role in SGN-HC connectivity."

In these studies, we demonstrate that repulsive signaling mediated by Sema3F in the OHC region and Nrp2 in SGNs controls, at least in part, the number of SGN fibers that terminate on OHCs. Our findings support a model in which the embryonic OHC region maintains a compartment of Sema3F protein expression, which activates Nrp2 receptors expressed on SGNs leading to retraction of processes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Since this inhibitory signal is restricted to the OHC domain, this interaction would enforce contacts between SGN fibers and IHCs."

First, it is reasonable to assume that compensatory guidance mechanisms are in place to ensure that most type I SGNs terminate on IHCs. For example, there are a variety of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) expressed in the cochlea such as the immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs (like NCAM), cadherins (E-cad and N-Cad), and integrins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kelley, 2003</a>), all of which may help attract type I SGNs to the IHC region. In addition, it was recently shown that ephrin-A5/Epha4 signaling may also act to repel type I SGNs from OHCs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Defourny et al., 2013</a>). These studies, however, were limited to early postnatal and adult cochlear samples, thus, the extent to which these factors are involved in targeting events during embryonic development remains uncertain. Finally, it is also possible that the developing SGN population is heterogeneous with some neurons demonstrating more dynamic exploratory behavior than others. Therefore, some fibers may be less inclined to extend into the OHC region even in the absence of inhibitory signals. This hypothesis might be consistent with the idea that some SGNs are initially committed to a type I fate while others rely on target-based interactions to determine their phenotype."

These results suggest that the additional type II-like fibers observed at birth are most likely eliminated over time and the factors that mediate this recovery are unknown. Given that \u2018mature\u2019 type I/type II SGN patterns are established by P0 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and that HC ribbon synapses are visible by P0 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 2012</a>), it could be that Eph/ephrin signaling might be involved in synaptic pruning-based refinements postnatally. In addition, programmed cell death may also contribute to the final innervation pattern, as apoptosis in SGNs has been reported in the postnatal gerbil (<a href=\"#bib16\">Echteler et al., 2005</a>). However, we did not detect any appreciable SGN fragmentation or apoptosis in our experiments here (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Coate et al., 2012</a>).

                        "text": "Finally, this study also raises several intriguing questions to be addressed in the future. First, since Sema3F acts as a repulsive signal for SGN processes, how are type II SGNs, which appear to express Nrp2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), able to project into the OHC region (see \u2018?\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)? We did not detect differences in Nrp2 levels between putative type I and type II SGNs, which could have accounted possibly for differences in responsiveness to Sema3F. We are currently in favor of the model that type I and type II SGNs differentially express or target Plexin-A co-receptors, as the absence of these obligatory co-receptors could effectively inactive the Sema3F-Nrp2 inhibitory interaction. Plexin-A1 and Plexin-A3 proteins were localized to the SGNs previously (<a href=\"#bib36\">Murakami et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Katayama et al., 2013</a>). Here, we found <i>Plxna3</i> mRNA broadly expressed by the SGNs and Plexin-A3 protein enriched in putative type I SGNs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). While these data suggest that where type I or II SGNs ultimately terminate may depend on Plexin-A3 protein levels, a more careful analysis of the Plexin-A3 distribution and function is needed. A second question relates to the remarkably different patterns of expression exhibited by the different <i>Sema3s</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). What factor(s) control these discrete <i>Sema3</i> domains? GATA transcription factors have been shown previously to regulate <i>Sema</i> expression and are known players in inner ear morphogenesis and wiring (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lepore et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kodo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Appler and Lu, 2013</a>), so perhaps one role of GATAs in the inner ear is to regulate <i>Sema3</i> levels. Other clues related to this matter may come from previous findings where either the loss of Prox1 or Fgfr3 signaling led to increases in OHC innervation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Puligilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fritzsch et al., 2010</a>). It is possible, therefore, that Prox1 controls the expression of factors such as <i>Sema3f</i> or that the local distribution of the different <i>Sema3s</i> is controlled by morphogens such as Fgfs. Overall, it will be important in future studies to investigate upstream activators of <i>Sema3</i> expression and mechanisms that ultimately distinguish the morphological differentiation of type I and type II SGNs."

Low-magnification views were used to measure cochlear length in order to determine the basal and apical halves. Two-tailed <i>t</i>-tests were used throughout. Sample numbers are indicated in the figure legends."

In addition to observing SGN innervation of both IHCs and OHCs, these experiments suggest that SGNs ultimately innervating IHCs appear to prune back contacts with OHCs. Determination of the number of SGCs innervating OHCs and IHCs, coupled with time-lapse imaging of SGN innervation, provide support this model. To understand the molecular basis for selective SGN CE innervation, the authors address the significance of neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) expression they observe in SGN neurons, apparently in all type 1 and II SGNs, during the developmental time window when projections are segregated. In Nrp2 mutants (both -/- and +/-) a general increase in CE innervation in the OHC region is observed, and using Syt-1 as an SGN-specific marker this hyper-innervation is shown to be due to SGN axons. More detailed genetic labeling in Nrp2-/+ mutants leads to a similar conclusion, and it also allows for observations of increased filopodial extensions from SGNs in the IHC CE. Surprisingly, both ribbon synapse number in cochleae (OHC and IHC), and the overall percentage of type II SGNs as determined morphologically by genetic labeling, are unchanged in adult Nrp2-/+ animals. Sema3F expression by in situ analysis correlates very nicely with this cue playing a role in constraining type I SGN extension to the IHC region. In vitro cochlea organotypic cultures are used to show that treatment with exogenous Sema3F can affect the extension and branching of SGN neurons, consistent with the proposed role for Sema3F in SGN connectivity. Finally, assessment using sparse genetic labeling of SGN innervation in a Sema3F null mutant shows photocopies the SGN targeting defects observed in Nrp2-/+ mutants."

The original P0 sample was used to document our observation that Nrp2 levels in the SGN cell bodies begin to diminish around the time of birth. We have left this note in the text. Nrp2 immunoreactivity is still clearly evident in the SGN processes at this time point, however.
