To overcome this, we performed an enhancer screen for developmental defects caused by compromising both global miRISC function and individual genes in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Among 126 interactors with miRNAs, we surprisingly found the CED-3 caspase that has only been well studied for its role in promoting apoptosis, mostly through protein activation. We provide evidence for a non-apoptotic function of CED-3 caspase that regulates multiple developmental events through proteolytic inactivation. Specifically, LIN-14, LIN-28, and DISL-2 proteins are known miRNA targets, key regulators of developmental timing, and/or stem cell pluripotency factors involved in miRNA processing. We show CED-3 cleaves these proteins in vitro. We also show CED-3 down-regulates LIN-28 in vivo, possibly rendering it more susceptible to proteasomal degradation. This mechanism may critically contribute to the robustness of gene expression dynamics governing proper developmental control."

To overcome this, we performed an enhancer screen for developmental defects caused by compromising both global miRISC function and individual genes in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Among 126 interactors with miRNAs, we surprisingly found the CED-3 caspase that has only been well studied for its role in promoting apoptosis, mostly through protein activation. We provide evidence for a non-apoptotic function of CED-3 caspase that regulates multiple developmental events through proteolytic inactivation. Specifically, LIN-14, LIN-28, and DISL-2 proteins are known miRNA targets, key regulators of developmental timing, and/or stem cell pluripotency factors involved in miRNA processing. We show CED-3 cleaves these proteins in vitro. We also show CED-3 down-regulates LIN-28 in vivo, possibly rendering it more susceptible to proteasomal degradation. This mechanism may critically contribute to the robustness of gene expression dynamics governing proper developmental control."

These microRNAs are particularly important for controlling both when cells specialize into a particular type of cell, and the timing of when certain stages of development happen. Experiments using purified proteins showed that CED-3 breaks down three proteins that are produced from genes controlled by this family of microRNA molecules, and one of these proteins was also broken down by CED-3 in experiments with mutant worms. Weaver, Zabinsky et al. therefore propose that CED-3 is part of a semi-redundant system that ensures the proteins are produced at the right level and at the right time even if the microRNAs insufficiently regulate them. This finding demonstrated both a specific role and specific targets for the CED-3 protein during development, entirely distinct from its role in apoptosis."

However, specific physiological roles of individual miRNAs are often executed through the combinatory effects of multi-miRNA, multi-target mRNA networks (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brenner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Karp et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kudlow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Miska et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Parry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Than et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez-Saavedra and Horvitz, 2010</a>). Moreover, these miRNA\u2013mRNA interaction networks may act in concert, and often semi-redundantly, with other regulatory mechanisms to limit the expression of many genes involved in animal development or other physiological functions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Therefore, tackling genetic redundancy would be critical to uncover many specific functions associated with miRNAs and other gene expression regulatory mechanisms."

Among a large number of interactors identified from the screen is the <i>ced-3</i> gene that encodes a caspase, well-characterized as a key component of the apoptotic pathway (<a href=\"#bib12\">Conradt and Xue, 2005</a>). While <i>ced-3</i> is absolutely required for the apoptotic process, null mutations of the gene are not associated with obvious developmental defects (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hengartner, 1997</a>). However, two recent studies have reported different non-apoptotic roles of the <i>ced-3</i> pathway, namely in stress-related neuronal function (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</a>) and aging (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yee et al., 2014</a>). Because no specific downstream targets of CED-3 were found in these studies, the mechanistic detail of such non-apoptotic functions of CED-3 remains unclear. Moreover, whether the CED-3 system is widely utilized to regulate animal development and other functions is a question of high significance."

The fact that strong <i>ced-3(lf)</i> alleles cause robust defects in programmed cell death but not the developmental defects described above suggests that the functions of <i>ced-3</i> with miRISCs uncovered in our screen are non-apoptotic. To further address this question, we first used an assay previously shown to effectively identify apoptotic functions of genes, such as <i>mcd-1</i> encoding a zinc-finger containing protein, for which mutations caused subtle apoptotic defects alone, but significantly enhanced the cell death defect of a <i>ced-3</i> reduction-of-function allele (<i>ced-3(rf)</i>) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Reddien et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We found that, in contrast to the positive control, <i>mcd-1(lf)</i>, the <i>ain-1(lf)</i> mutation did not enhance the apoptotic defect of <i>ced-3(rf)</i> animals as assayed by observing the perdurance of <i>lin-11::GFP</i> positive undead P9-11.aap cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). Because <i>nuc-1</i> encodes an effector nuclease important for the proper execution of apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2000</a>), we then tested if the <i>ain-1(lf)</i> mutation was able to enhance any subtle <i>nuc-1(lf)</i> phenotype and found no significant defect beyond the phenotypes of the single mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Finally, <i>ain-1(RNAi)</i> did not affect the number of apoptotic cell corpses accumulating in the heads of <i>ced-1(lf)</i> first stage larvae (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), which are defective in cell corpse engulfment allowing for visualization of dead cell corpses. Therefore, the <i>ain-1</i> and <i>ced-3</i> interaction described above is non-apoptotic."

After finding pronounced RNAi effects associated with several miRNA deletions, we then generated double or triple mutants containing <i>ced-3(lf)</i> and the miRNA mutations, and observed phenotypes similar to those seen in <i>ced-3(lf);ain-1(lf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, and refer to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013E</a>) Specifically, mutations in the <i>let-7-</i>family members, <i>mir-48</i> and <i>mir-84</i>, had the strongest effect with a fully penetrant egg-laying defect observed in the <i>ced-3(lf);mir-48(lf);mir-84(lf)</i> triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Interestingly, the <i>ced-3(lf);mir-1(lf);mir-84(lf)</i> triple mutant displayed some developmental defects not seen in the <i>mir-1(lf);mir-84(lf)</i>, <i>ced-3(lf);mir-1(lf),</i> or the <i>ced-3(lf);mir-84(lf)</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Since <i>ced-3(lf)</i> had the strongest developmental defects with the <i>let-7-</i>family members, and since both <i>lin-14</i> and <i>lin-28</i> mRNAs are well-known targets of the <i>let-7-</i>family of miRNAs, we thus tested the possibility that <i>ced-3(lf)</i> may enhance specific temporal cell fate patterning defects of these miRNA mutants by examining their adult alae. Normal adult-specific alae are generated by seam cells and defects in adult alae formation are commonly used as a sensitive assay for defects in temporal cell fate patterning (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ambros and Horvitz, 1984</a>). We found that <i>ced-3(lf)</i> significantly enhanced adult alae defects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). This effect was observed for both the <i>miR-48(lf),miR-84(lf);ced-3(lf)</i> triple mutant and the <i>ced-3(lf);ain-1(lf)</i> double mutant, but not the <i>ced-3(lf);mir-1(lf);mir-84(lf)</i> triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These findings suggested the hypothesis that the expression of some developmental timing regulators is co-regulated by miRISCs and <i>ced-3</i>."

                                "text": "To better analyze the mechanism underlying this non-apoptotic temporal cell fate patterning function of <i>ced-3</i>, we tested its effect on seam cell development. The division and differentiation pattern of the stem cell-like seam cells are regulated by a well-described genetic pathway that includes several miRNAs and the LIN-28 pluripotency factor that blocks the maturation of pre-<i>let-7</i> miRNA (<a href=\"#bib65\">Viswanathan and Daley, 2010</a>). During each larval stage, lateral seam cells (V1\u2013V4 and V6) divide in an asymmetric, stem-cell like manner with additional stems cells only produced in the L2 stage by an additional symmetric division pattern that duplicates V1\u2013V4 and V6 seam cell numbers (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Ambros and Horvitz, 1984</a>). Wild-type animals consistently have 16 seam cells on both the left and right sides by adulthood (<a href=\"#bib27\">Joshi et al., 2010</a>). The dynamic changes in the expression levels of several conserved pluripotency factors are critical for proper temporal cell fate patterning. LIN-14 is highly expressed during L1 to promote L1-specific developmental programs, whereas LIN-28 is highly expressed from late embryonic to L2 stages and acts to promote the L2-specific programs including the only normal symmetric division of V1\u2013V4 and V6 seam cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ambros and Horvitz, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ambros, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ruvkun and Giusto, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Moss et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rougvie and Moss, 2013</a>) (Diagrammed in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Expression of LIN-14 and LIN-28 rapidly diminishes after L1 and L2, respectively, which is necessary for animals to progress to the next stage (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Loss-of-function (<i>lf</i>) mutations in <i>lin-14</i> and <i>lin-28</i> result in animals skipping the L1- and L2-specific programs, respectively (precocious phenotype) (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In contrast, hyperactive (gain-of-function, <i>gf</i>) mutations leading to prolonged expression of each gene cause the animals to reiterate the corresponding stage (retarded phenotype) (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Because of the additional symmetric cell division of V1\u2013V4 and V6 seam cells in L2, skipping or reiterating the L2 stage in <i>lin-28(lf)</i> or <i>lin-28(gf)</i> mutations lead to a decrease or increase of total seam cell number, respectively (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ambros and Horvitz, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Moss et al., 1997</a>) and diagrammed in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>. Mammalian DIS3L2 was recently annotated as the ribonuclease that degrades the uridylated pre-<i>let-7</i> miRNA following binding by LIN-28 and 3\u2032-oligo-uridylation by a polyU polymerase (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chang et al., 2013</a>). We identified the likely <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog of Dis3l2 and named it <i>disl-2</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The effects for <i>disl-2</i> on seam cell development have not been determined."

As a caspase, we thought that CED-3 may directly repress the expression of these genes through proteolytic cleavage, which is consistent with our observation that LIN-14, LIN-28, and DISL-2 contain multiple consensus CED-3 cleavage sites that consist of a tetra-peptide sequence usually ending in an aspartic acid residue (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xue et al., 1996</a>). To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro CED-3 cleavage assay as previously described (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xue et al., 1996</a>). We found that the DIS3L2 ribonuclease homolog, DISL-2, was robustly cleaved by the CED-3 caspase while LIN-14 and LIN-28 were partially cleaved (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The multiple cleavage products generated by CED-3 cleavage of DISL-2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>) suggest a clear role for CED-3-mediated inactivation of this target protein. We further tested the specificity of the partial LIN-28 cleavage by CED-3 and found that it was completely blocked by addition of the caspase-specific-inhibitor zDEVD-fmk (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We then determined the proteolytic cleavage site for LIN-28 by mutagenesis and identified the CED-3-specific recognition sequence (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Numerous possible cleavage sites were found for LIN-14 and DISL-2 but were not pursued further (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The identified sequence DVVD fits the canonical CED-3 recognition motif (DxxD) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xue et al., 1996</a>) and mutating the second aspartic acid residue to an alanine (D31A in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) entirely eliminated CED-3 cleavage. CED-3 proteolysis of LIN-28A generates an N-terminal asparagine in the remaining protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Asparagine is known to function generally as a destabilizing residue at the N-terminus of eukaryotic proteins resulting in proteasomal degradation in a phenomenon termed the N-end rule (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sriram et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "To examine CED-3-mediated turnover of the LIN-28 protein in vivo, we generated a polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal peptide in LIN-28 that recognizes both LIN-28 isoforms reported previously (<a href=\"#bib54\">Seggerson et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). We found that the dynamic decrease in LIN-28 abundance during L2\u2013L4 stages was similarly delayed by two different <i>ced-3(lf)</i> mutations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and quantitation shown in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). At late L4 (48 hr in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), LIN-28 was almost completely absent in both wild type and <i>ced-3(lf)</i> mutants, indicating the role of general, non-CED-3-mediated, proteolysis during late larval stages. Interestingly, the 22-kDa cleavage product observed in the in vitro assay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>) was not observable in vivo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), consistent with the idea that the cleavage product with an asparagine at its N-terminus was possibly degraded by an additional proteolytic process. It is possible that the delayed down-regulation of LIN-28 seen in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> is the consequence of the slower post-embryonic growth rate observed for <i>ced-3(lf)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). To address this question, we first used a LIN-28::GFP transgenic strain previously shown to have functional LIN-28 activity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Moss et al., 1997</a>) to monitor stage-matched L3 larvae with or without a <i>ced-3(lf)</i> mutation by DIC microscopy. We observed that the <i>ced-3(lf)</i> mutation delayed the proper down-regulation of the LIN-28::GFP reporter at L3 in the hypodermis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). We also found that down-regulation of LIN-28::GFP expression was delayed in neuronal cells in the head (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>). These findings support the hypothesis for the delayed down-regulation of LIN-28 by <i>ced-3(lf).</i> The difference in magnitude between the Western blot results and the number of fluorescent cells seen by DIC microscopy may suggest that the observed fluorescence levels do not linearly reflect the protein levels and that the two methods may have different dynamic ranges."

Specifically, we made the point mutation in the previously published <i>lin-28(+)::gfp</i> fusion protein (<a href=\"#bib38\">Moss et al., 1997</a>). To ensure that the LIN-28(D31A) mutation did not disrupt the global function of the protein, we tested its ability to overcome the highly penetrant protruding vulva (Pvl) phenotype in <i>lin-28(n719,lf)</i> animals and found that it was able to rescue the Pvl phenotype (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Following integration and outcrossing, we found the copy number of the <i>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</i> transgene to be slightly lower than that of the non-mutated <i>lin-28(+)::gfp</i> transgene (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We then examined the developmental profile and found that the <i>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</i> transgene alone caused a delay in larval development similar to that caused by the combination of the <i>lin-28(+)::gfp</i> transgene with <i>ced-3(lf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Western blot analysis showed that the <i>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</i> integration had less basal expression than the non-mutated <i>lin-28(+)::gfp</i> integration, consistent with the lower copy number estimate. We observed a quantifiable difference in the down-regulation of the <i>lin-28(D31A)::gfp</i> transgene compared to the <i>lin-28(+)::gfp</i> transgene (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>). This finding provides evidence that a failure in CED-3 cleavage of LIN-28 leads to slower degradation of LIN-28 and is one of the causes of slower development, since the D31A point mutation alone resulted in both a slower growth rate (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) and delayed LIN-28 down-regulation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>). Additionally, in this Western blot (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013C</a>), down-regulation of the wild-type LIN-28 transgene in <i>ced-3(lf)</i> worms seems to be delayed more than LIN-28(D31A) in wild-type worms. Such a difference could be due to roles of CED-3 on other targets such as LIN-14 and DISL-2, which is also expected to contribute to the larval developmental defect in <i>ced-3(lf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>)."

To further test the functional outcome of both the LIN-28(D31A) transgene and the LIN-28(+) transgene combined with <i>ced-3(lf)</i>, we examined the adult-specific alae and found significant defects including low quality and gapped alae (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This is consistent with the data described above that <i>ced-3(lf)</i> enhances adult-specific alae defect of let-7-family miRNA mutants and <i>ain-1(lf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>). We should note that the original report of the LIN-28(+) transgene indicated that some of the adults were observed to have gapped alae (<a href=\"#bib38\">Moss et al., 1997</a>). Though we did observe rough and very thin sections of alae for this strain (scored as low quality alae), we did not observe any gapped adult alae. This subtle difference is likely explained by a different threshold since we scored alae using a sensitive camera (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Nonetheless, the relative enhancement of <i>ced-3(lf)</i> with this transgene is quite obvious and similar to that of the caspase-cleavage resistant LIN-28(D31A) point mutant transgene (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Altogether, our data support a causal role for CED-3 cleavage of LIN-28 in the regulation of temporal cell fate patterning. CED-3 appears to facilitate the stereotypical transition of LIN-28 to enhance the robustness of the L2 to L3 developmental transition."

This result may not be explained by slower growth rate since these animals were obtained as synchronous L1s without food. Our attempts to monitor DISL-2 protein levels including developing an antibody to endogenous DISL-2 were impeded by technical difficulties. Moreover, N- and C-terminal GFP fusions to DISL-2 had exceedingly low levels of expression beyond detection by common methods suggesting that DISL-2 protein levels are kept exquisitely low for physiological significance."

Consistent with this, a previous report showed that CED-3 is capable of cleaving more than 22 <i>C. elegans</i> proteins in an in vitro proteomics survey (<a href=\"#bib60\">Taylor et al., 2007</a>) and two recent genetics-based findings showed that <i>ced-3</i> may play important roles in neural regeneration (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pinan-Lucarre et al., 2012</a>) and aging (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yee et al., 2014</a>). Second, the described CED-3 function in repressing gene expression is likely in contrast to the role of CED-3 in promoting apoptosis through activation of protein targets by cleavage at specific sites (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nakagawa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Here, the CED-3 cleavage alone may already destroy the target protein activity. Additionally, the cleavage products may be further degraded by other degradation systems notably via N-terminal destabilizing residues which may make the target more susceptible to additional degradation mechanisms, such as proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sriram et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). We hypothesize that this function operates continually during development to facilitate rapid turnover of these regulatory proteins at the post-translational level and in cooperation with other regulatory mechanisms (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We should note that it is curious that only the LIN-28A isoform was found to be cleaved by CED-3 in vitro yet expression of both LIN-28A and LIN-28B isoforms was altered by <i>ced-3(lf)</i> in vivo. This may imply that <i>ced-3</i> has potential indirect effects on other factors within the heterochronic pathway that could alter LIN-28 isoform expression but further experiments are required to satisfactorily explain this."

Black arrows and blocks indicate aspects of the pathway that were previously known. Red blocks and font indicate the major findings of this study. Blue font indicates factors known to function in this pathway that were also identified in our enhancer screen (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) as genetic interactors of GW182 (<i>ain-1</i> and/or <i>ain-2</i>). The blue asterisk associated with <i>let-7</i> is to indicate that we also identified the <i>let-7</i> family miRNAs in our miRNA-<i>ced-3</i> enhancer screen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) and that <i>ced-3(lf)</i> was able to enhance their specific temporal cell fate patterning phenotypes as seen with adult-specific alae defects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The blue asterisks and dashed red lines for <i>miR-1</i> and <i>miR-246</i> indicate additional miRNAs we identified in our miRNA-<i>ced-3</i> enhancer screen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Both <i>miR-1</i> and <i>miR-246</i> are predicted to target <i>lin-14</i> mRNA (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) but have not been experimentally demonstrated to do so here. They failed to show enhanced specific developmental timing defects and were not pursued further. Dashed arrows and blocks are intended to indicate a combination of complex direct and indirect effects ultimately affecting developmental fate and timing. ** Previous works have indicated DAF-12 functions on several components of the pathway (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rougvie and Moss, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hochbaum et al., 2011</a>), providing the basis for us to have observed the enhanced developmental defects associated with <i>ain-1(lf)</i> and <i>daf-12(RNAi)</i> (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). The exact mechanism of LIN-66 function is still unclear (dashed block) though it is able to negatively regulate LIN-28 function (<a href=\"#bib37\">Morita and Han, 2006</a>). MSI-1 (Musashi-1) was identified as an RNA-binding protein that may be important for LIN-28-mediated regulation of pre-miRNA processing as well as translational regulation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sakakibara et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kawahara et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, we also identified the <i>C. elegans</i> musashi-1 ortholog, <i>msi-1</i>, as an enhancer in our screen (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Following binding by LIN-28, pre-<i>let-7</i> is poly-uridylated by a TUTase (poly-U-polymerase) to mark it for destruction. PUP-2 is indicated here as a <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog for TUTase and it was also identified in our screen (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Recently, the RNAse, Dis3l2 (Dis-3-like RNAse gene 2), was identified as the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease that degrades poly-uridylated-pre-<i>let-7</i> miRNA and is the RNAse mutated in Perlman syndrome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kawahara et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ustianenko et al., 2013</a>). We suggest that the <i>C. elegans</i> gene F48E8.6 is the <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog of Dis3l2 and have therefore named it DISL-2 (Dis-3-like RNAse gene 2) (See <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The intricate network of regulatory factors shown here emphasizes the importance of this pathway and how CED-3 caspase cooperates with the miRISC and numerous other factors to control temporal cell fate patterning."

Consistent with this subtlety, <i>ced-3(lf)</i> alone displays essentially no defect in seam cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The physiological effect of this subtle regulation is clearly seen in seam cell temporal patterning when miRNA function is compromised in the <i>ain-1(lf)</i> mutant background. This prominent enhancement indicates that <i>ced-3</i> has an important role in supporting the robustness of the larval transitions. Based on the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with <i>ced-3(lf);ain-1(lf)</i>, such roles may potentially extend to a broad range of cellular processes."

Asking the same question for the global miRISC function, our screen, by identifying 118 previously unknown miRISC interactors, thus identified new roles for miRISC in normal developmental processes that are otherwise masked by redundancy and/or pleiotropism, as well as identifying other regulatory mechanisms that collaborate with miRNAs. Examples we found for the latter in this study include genes encoding the POU-homeodomain protein (<i>ceh-18</i>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the histone acetyltransferase <i>(pcaf-1</i>), the ras-related GTPase homolog (<i>ral-1)</i>, the homeodomain transcription factor (<i>unc-39</i>), and the cell-killing <i>ced-3</i> caspase (the majority of this study) (and others listed in <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). However, the interactions identified in this study most likely reflect only a small portion of miRNA functions because screening for obvious developmental defects under well-fed conditions only permitted us to identify limited physiological functions. Applying various assays, including behavioural assays or animals under various growth or stress conditions, is expected to identify many more miRNA functions. Furthermore, although feeding RNAi has important advantages for such a screen, it is not effective for many genes especially for genes functioning in certain tissues such as neurons. Therefore, genetic screens or analyses under sensitized backgrounds will continue to play a major role in identifying miRNA functions."

To identify genetic interactors, the authors systematically depleted each protein-coding gene individually by RNAi and scored for a wide range of general phenotypes. This resulted in the identification of 126 genes, that when depleted, result in a reproducibly synergistic enhancement of <i>ain-1</i> and <i>ain-2</i> mutant phenotypes. This list is composed of genes that function in a wide array of cellular and development functions and is interesting in itself with regard to the many functions for miRNAs in normal development."

We have added the following statements to the Methods section: \u201cAny thin region of alae that appeared as a gap through the oculars was imaged by the camera and evaluated on a large screen. Only alae observed as truly discontinuous by aid of the camera were scored as gapped.

However, careful examination of the Western blot data shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> reveals that the basal expression level of the LIN-28(D31A)::GFP reporter is obviously lower than the wild-type transgene (quantified in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a> 0hr). Thus, a direct comparison of these lines by DIC microscopy would effectively be an uncontrolled experiment since there is no satisfactory way to control for exposure time between the two transgenic lines with differing basal expression. This is unlike the wild-type transgene compared in two genetic backgrounds: <i>ced-3(lf)</i> versus <i>ced-3(wt)</i> discussed above. Though not asked for here, we would like to state, as mentioned in the previous review rebuttal, that the toxicity of a lin-28-Cas9 rescue construct has prevented us from making single copy transgenes (which is not itself guaranteed to have the same level of expression). Moreover, we feel that examination of the adult-specific alae gaps is a more meaningful experiment (as suggested by the reviewers in the first review) since it is such a well-established phenotype linking persistent LIN-28 levels to defects in temporal cell fate patterning. This phenotype also considers the entire life history of the animal and thus any perdurance."
