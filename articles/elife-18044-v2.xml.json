Individuals learn the value of cues that predict probabilistic rewards from experienced reward frequencies. Building on the notion that responses of dopamine neurons increase with reward probability and expected value, we asked how dopamine neurons in monkeys acquire this value signal that may represent an economic decision variable. We found in a Pavlovian learning task that reward probability-dependent value signals arose from experienced reward frequencies. We then assessed neuronal response acquisition during choices among probabilistic rewards. Here, dopamine responses became sensitive to the value of both chosen and unchosen options. Both experiments showed also the novelty responses of dopamine neurones that decreased as learning advanced. These results show that dopamine neurons acquire predictive value signals from the frequency of experienced rewards. This flexible and fast signal reflects a specific decision variable and could update neuronal decision mechanisms."

Such learning enables individuals to compute the economic value of environmental cues and thus allows forpa efficient decision making."

Cues that predict reward with high probability evoke larger responses than cues predicting the same reward with lower probability (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fiorillo et al., 2003</a>). Moreover, during an economic choice task, responses of dopamine neurons and striatal dopamine concentration reflect the reward probability of the cue the animal has chosen (<a href=\"#bib20\">Morris et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Saddoris et al., 2015</a>).

This neuronal acquisition happens gradually (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</a>), and is well-approximated by reinforcement learning (RL) models (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pan et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, striatal dopamine concentration reflects values of probabilistically delivered rewards during learning (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hamid et al., 2016</a>).

We studied dopamine responses during both simple Pavlovian conditioning and during risky choices. In both tasks, dopamine responses to cues showed two distinct response components: an early component reflecting novelty, and a later component that developed during learning to encode the value of probabilistic rewards acquired from experienced reward frequencies. Reinforcement learning models served to separate these two components more formally. During choice, the acquired dopamine responses reflected the value of the chosen option relative to the unchosen option."

This behavioural paradigm provides a straightforward platform for monitoring neuronal correlates of learning. To investigate how responses of dopamine neurons develop during learning to reflect the value of probabilistically delivered rewards, we monitored two monkeys during a Pavlovian conditioning task (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Visual cues (fractal pictures, never seen before) predicted gambles between a large (0.4 ml) and a small (0.1 ml) juice reward, delivered 2 s after cue onset. The probability of receiving the large reward was p=0.25, p=0.50, or p=0.75; the probability of small reward was correspondingly 1 -\u00a0p. In each learning block, three novel cues were differentially associated with three different reward probabilities, but only one cue was presented to the animal on each trial. This situation conforms to a learning set in which the animals learned to rapidly assign in each learning block one of the three possible probabilities to each cue (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harlow, 1949</a>)."

Neuronal responses to reward developed gradually to reflect the values of the cues. Specifically, activating neuronal responses to large reward (0.4 ml) were larger after cues that predicted this outcome with lower probability, compared to cues predicting the same outcome with higher probability (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> top). Conversely, depressant neuronal responses to small reward (0.1 ml) were more pronounced after cues predicting large reward with higher probability (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> bottom). Thus, both the activating and depressant responses were consistent with reward prediction error coding. The neuronal responses to both large and small rewards differentiated gradually over consecutive trials, based on the predicted probability of getting each of those rewards, and reached statistical significance after 9 and 16 trials, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, p&lt;0.02, one-way ANOVA on neuronal population responses). The development of dopamine responses to rewards further suggests that early and late responses to cues convey distinct signals. If early responses to cues contained predictive values signals (i.e. reflecting an optimistic value initialisation), such signals should have contributed to prediction error computations at reward time. However, the pattern of neuronal reward prediction errors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) suggests that these responses were computed in relation to late responses to cues, and reflected cue values initialised around the average value of all cues. Accordingly, neuronal responses to rewards were accounted for by the late component of neuronal responses to cues as well as the received reward size, with no significant contribution from the early component of cue responses (p=0.0001, 0.43 and 0.021 for reward size, early and late cue responses, respectively; multiple linear regression). Thus, the development of the prediction error responses at the time of reward reflect the acquisition of probability-dependent value responses to cues; dopamine neurons learn the value of novel cues and use these learned values to compute prediction errors at the time of the outcome."

Consistent with this, regression of second component dopamine responses to cues (0.2\u20130.6 s after the cue onset) onto value estimates of the superior model was highly significant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93, p=0.00003). Moreover, regression of dopamine novelty responses to model-driven novelty estimates was statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>,\u00a0R<sup>2</sup> = 0.63, p=0.001). In this simulation, the estimated learning rate decayed over trials, while fluctuating based on past prediction errors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The model fittings suggested that the development of early and late responses to cues follows different temporal dynamics. In a model variant that is rearranged to include the\u00a0novelty decay term as an error-driven learning process (simulating optimistic value initialisation), the recovered learning constant for the first component of cue responses was significantly larger than the recovered learning constant for the late response component (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test, see Materials and methods). This observation suggests that early and late components of dopamine responses follow distinct temporal dynamics. Together, these results suggest that, during learning about probabilistic rewards, the trial-by-trial dopamine responses to cues adjust according to how much learning has advanced. Neuronal responses to cues rapidly develop early during learning and value updating becomes slower as learning progresses and prediction errors become smaller."

The animals had extensive prior experience with one of the cues (familiar cue) that predicted a 50% chance of receiving a large reward (0.4 ml) and 50% chance of receiving a small reward (0.1 ml). In each block (typically 50 trials) the familiar cue was always offered as one choice alternative. The other cue was novel, and its reward probability was unknown to the animal. Similar to the Pavlovian task, the novel cues were associated with reward probabilities of 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 of receiving the large (0.4 ml) reward and 0.1 ml otherwise. This situation resembled a learning set (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harlow, 1949</a>) in which the animals rapidly learned to assign one of three possible values to the novel cue. In this task monkeys had to choose the novel cue in order to learn its reward probability. At the onset of each learning block, both monkeys consistently selected the novel cue in the first few trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, p&lt;0.01 in both animals, Mann-Whitney U test on choice probabilities in trials 1\u20134 versus later trials). This exploratory behaviour was accompanied by shorter saccadic response times (measured between cue onset and saccadic acquisition of the chosen option), compared to the response times observed during later trials when the highest probability option was usually chosen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, p&lt;0.01 in both animals, Mann-Whitney U test on trials 1\u20134 versus later trials). After five trials, both animals chose the higher option 75% of the time (p&lt;0.001; one-way ANOVA on choice probabilities). These results suggest that the animals rapidly learned the value of novel reward predicting cues in the choice task and used these learned values to make efficient economic choices."

Dopamine responses showed two distinct response components. Responses immediately after the cues decreased as learning advanced, reflecting novelty. The second response component developed during learning to encode the value of probabilistic rewards acquired from experienced reward frequencies. Correspondingly, the prediction error responses at reward time changed over the course of learning to gradually reflect the learned reward values. Results from previous studies on fully established tasks suggest that the acquired dopamine responses to probabilistic rewards do not code reward probability on its own but rather increase monotonically with the statistical expected value (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fiorillo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tobler et al., 2005</a>). The present learning data are fully compatible with those results. During choices, the acquired dopamine value signals coded the value of the chosen option relative to the unchosen option. These results are consistent with previous findings that showed chosen value coding in dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Morris et al., 2006</a>). However, we provide new evidence in favour of a more nuanced, relative chosen value coding scheme whereby dopamine responses also reflect the value of un-chosen option. Together, our data suggest that dopamine neurons extract predictive reward value from the experienced reward frequency and code this information as relative chosen value."

In the learning experiment that involved choices, the neuronal responses rapidly differentiated to reflect animal\u2019s choice. These differential responses, despite appearing more than 100 ms prior to overt behaviour, reflect prediction errors in relation to an already computed choice, and thus might not directly participate in current choice computation. Our modelling results provided further insights into the dynamics of neuronal learning process. First, the development of neuronal responses over trials as well as animals\u2019 choices were best explained by models that adaptively adjusted their learning rate based on past prediction errors, resembling previous studies in human subjects (<a href=\"#bib21\">Nassar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Diederen and Schultz, 2015</a>). Second, value-dependent dopamine responses were still updated even after the dopamine novelty responses stabilized, suggesting two distinct time courses for these two components of neuronal activity. Interestingly, in both Pavlovian and choice tasks, behavioural preferences as well as neuronal responses to cues reflected reward probability earlier during learning than the neuronal reward responses. This temporal difference might suggest an origin of behavioural preferences and acquired dopamine cue responses in other brain structures, rather than relying primarily on dopamine reward prediction error signals."

In both tasks, the novelty signals were mainly present in initial component of neuronal responses to cues. We used RL models to investigate how these novelty signals affected the neural and behavioural computation of value. In principle, novelty can be incorporated into RL models in two ways: (1) novelty directly augments the value function, thus increasing the predicted value and distorting future value and prediction error computations, or (2) novelty promotes exploration (in a choice setting) but does not distort value and prediction error computation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</a>). If novelty increased value estimates early in the learning session (i.e. an optimistic value initialisation), then positive prediction errors at the reward time should be very small in early trials and should slowly grow over trials, as optimism faded. Similarly, negative prediction errors would appear as strong suppressions which would be mitigated later. However, our results showed the opposite. We observed a clear development of reward prediction errors depending on the learned value of cues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). On the other hand, when dopamine novelty responses were large, i.e. during early trials of choice blocks, monkeys had a strong behavioural tendency to explore the unknown option (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, it appears that novelty increased dopamine responses to cues and was correlated with high levels of exploration, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Costa et al., 2014</a>), but the neural responses did not reflect optimistic value initiation. Given the substantial projections of dopamine neurons to cortical and subcortical structures involved in decision making (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lynd-Balta and Haber, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Williams, 1998</a>), dopamine responses to novel situations might set downstream neuronal dynamics to an activity regime that is optimal for learning (<a href=\"#bib28\">Puig and Miller, 2012</a>)."

Accordingly, dopamine neurons respond most strongly to rewards delivered near the start of learning, when rewards are most unpredictable and induce positive prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</a>). Reward responses steadily decrease as the rewards become progressively more predictable (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</a>). However, in that study a small fraction of neurons (12%) responded to fully predicted rewards. Similarly, in studies using rodent models some dopamine responses to fully predicted rewards have remained (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hamid et al., 2016</a>). Several possible mechanisms can explain dopamine responses to \u2018completely predicted\u2019 rewards. With regard to the two cited learning studies in primates, the former task (in which dopamine neurons did not respond to fully-predicted rewards) was a simple instrumental task (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1994</a>), whereas in the latter task the monkeys had to make a choice before performing the instrumental response (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hollerman and Schultz, 1998</a>). It is therefore possible that the more complex task context led to less subjective certainty about upcoming reward. In our study cues predicted the reward only probabilistically, not allowing us to study dopamine responses to fully predicted rewards. Nevertheless, both excitation and suppression of dopamine responses to rewards developed over trials, in a manner consistent with prediction error signalling."

The dopamine response to the simultaneous onset of choice options is a special case of this responding, because future reward delivery is contingent upon the choice as well as the values that are currently on offer. Previous studies of dopamine activity during choice have shown chosen value coding by dopamine signals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Morris et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Saddoris et al., 2015</a>), but other studies have shown coding of the best available option, irrespective of choice (<a href=\"#bib31\">Roesch et al., 2007</a>). Our results confirm the chosen value character of this response and indicate that choice-dependent dopamine signals arose very early with respect to both the onset of learning block as well as the onset of choice within each trial (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, distinct from previous reports, our results indicate that the dopamine signal takes the value of both chosen and unchosen options into account, thus reflecting relative chosen value. The relative value coding nature implies that choosing the exact same option is associated with very different responses in dopamine neurons depending on the value of the alternative option. From this standpoint, our results are fundamentally compatible with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kishida et al., 2016</a>) indicating that striatal dopamine concentration in human subjects reflects standard reward prediction error as well as counterfactual prediction error (the difference between the actual outcome and outcome of the action not taken). Our findings provide a cellular correlate for this phenomenon and indicate that flexible encoding of both choice options already occurs at the level of dopamine action potentials."

These signals are transmitted to the striatum and cortex where they would be capable to update stimulus and action values (<a href=\"#bib30\">Reynolds et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shen et al., 2008</a>). Dopamine signals induce value learning (<a href=\"#bib40\">Steinberg et al., 2013</a>) and are implicated in multiple aspects of goal-directed behaviour (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schultz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Stauffer et al., 2016</a>). The results demonstrated in this study advance our knowledge of dopamine function by suggesting that dopamine signals might play a critical role in computing flexible values needed for economic decision making (<a href=\"#bib23\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>). The fast and flexible dopamine responses we observed during choice correspond well to recent findings demonstrating the encoding of economic utility by dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Stauffer et al., 2014</a>) and the necessity of phasic dopamine responses for consistent choices (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zweifel et al., 2009</a>). Taken together, these data point to a possible function for dopamine neurons in influencing decisions, in form of updating neuronal decision mechanisms in a rapid and flexible manner."

The novel cues were associated with probabilities of 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 of receiving the large (0.4 ml) reward and 0.1 ml otherwise. In each choice trial, after successful central fixation for 0.5 s, choice options appeared on the monitor and the animal indicated its choice by a saccade towards one of the cues. The animal was allowed to saccade as soon as it wanted. The animal had to keep its gaze on the chosen cue for 0.5 s to confirm its choice. Reward was delivered 1.5 s after the choice confirmation. Trials were separated with inter-trial interval of 2\u20135 s. Failure to maintain the central fixation or early break of the fixation on the chosen option resulted in 6 s time-out.

If novelty increased value estimates early in the learning session (i.e. an optimistic value initialisation), then positive prediction errors at the reward time should be very small in early trials and slowly grows over trials, as optimism faded. Similarly, negative prediction errors would appear as strong suppressions which will be mitigated later. However, our results showed the opposite. We observed a clear development of reward prediction errors depending on the learned value of cues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

This fit results in negative or positive values of <i>n</i> for neurons that exhibit a decreasing or increasing cue-evoked response over trials, respectively. We used 95% confidence interval of the fit to acquire statistical significance. In order to test whether dopamine novelty responses (in the Pavlovian task) better reflect cue repetition or progress through the block (i.e. trial number), we regressed neuronal responses on number of times the cues were seen and also on the trial number in the block (for this analysis we only focused on first 10 trials of the block to better dissociate these two variables). To examine the contribution of early and late components of dopamine cue responses to prediction error computation at reward time, we employed a multiple linear regression analysis. In order to relate neuronal response in the Pavlovian task to RL model estimates, we used single linear regressions (see Reinforcement learning models section). To relate neuronal response in the choice task to RL model fits on the behavioural choice data, we used single linear regression analysis both on neuronal population response as well as on responses of each dopamine neuron (see Reinforcement learning models section)."

They found that in both Pavlovian and choice tasks, that animals acquired behavioral responses consistent with the reward rates associated with each cue. In addition, dopamine neuron responses at the time of cue presentation and at the time of reward delivery reflected the reward probability associated with the stimulus. Interestingly, in the choice task, the early dopamine response reflected specifically cue novelty, and a later component reflected cue value. In addition, the dopamine neuron responses that reflected cue value most specifically reflected the difference between chosen and unchosen value. Most of the published data on the responses of dopamine neurons comes from tasks where the cue-outcome contingencies are highly overlearned, and there is even less data in choice tasks. The current manuscript fills that gap and finds results consistent with the reward-prediction error hypothesis."

The added contribution of showing these two together during de novo reward learning does not by itself constitute an <i>eLife</i> paper. The main new result seems to be that dopamine responses to cues in the choice task reflect the difference between chosen and unchosen values, rather than chosen values alone as had been previously reported, but this in itself is also somewhat incremental. (This finding does not actually depend on the learning aspect of the design at all, and should be present but unnoticed in previous datasets with overtrained options.)"

A revised article should leverage this potential to greater effect in a way that could inform the literature so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It would be useful to deliver on the novel aspects of this study by examining the trial-trial development of the dopamine responses more carefully in both experiments by fitting RL models to the neural responses directly, not just the choices, and by performing a regression of lagged outcomes onto the cue responses, somewhat in the manner of Bayer and Glimcher (2005). This should shed a lot of light on aspects of the model like the learning rate issues - how does sensitivity to previous outcomes decay with delay? Is this a Pearce-Hall like error sensitive rule, or more like a decaying learning rate? - and how the novelty responses trade off with value (can this be understood as optimistic value initialization decaying with the same learning rate by which the values come online, or is it a separate process with a distinct time constant?). The data point particularly to interesting and novel answers to the latter, but these aren't yet exposed as clearly as they could be."

(and other rodent voltammetry papers) find persistent responses even to fully predicted rewards, whereas reward predictions in the current manuscript appear to be fully modulated by predictions. Some brief speculation on this in the discussion might be useful. From the current manuscript it's apparently not due to overtraining in monkeys compared to rodents, which one might think underlies these differences. But here, in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4D</a> it looks as though there are standard RPE responses at time of reward even with within session learning. Although this study doesn't have 100% predictive cues (and hence we can't tell what would happen in that case), perhaps the authors could fit a line to the responses in 4D/Large and try to guess the intercept. Does extrapolated response imply zero error for 100% predicted reward? Are there inhibitory responses for small rewards? In both experiments? (However, the fact that the responses to 4D/small are mostly above 1 - which I think is baseline - implies that even for smaller-than-expected rewards the response is excitatory which is actually not consistent with the PE story and possibly more like rodents?) Further, the example shown is for the large drop but they don't show us a response for the small drop. And those are just examples. It wasn't clear how the responses were normalized for the plots showing responses to rewards across trials."

Some brief speculation on this might be useful. It is mentioned near the end of the discussion. Coupled with the late value related responses to the cues is that fact that dopamine acts through second messenger systems (assuming a co-released neuro-transmitter is not mediating these effects) and the second messenger systems add another 100 ms or more to the responses of the system to dopamine. Given <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> it seems unlikely that dopamine can have much effect on the actual choices."

If novelty increased value estimates early in the learning session (i.e. an optimistic value initialization), then positive prediction errors at the reward time should be very small in early trials and slowly grows over trials (as optimism faded). Similarly, negative prediction errors would appear as strong suppressions which be mitigated later, as optimism faded. However, our results showed the opposite. We observed a clear development of reward prediction errors depending on the learned value of cues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). On the other hand, when dopamine novelty signals are large, i.e. during early trials of choice blocks, we observed a strong behavioural tendency to explore the unknown option (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, it appears that while novelty increased dopamine responses to cues and was correlated with high levels of exploration, the neural value response did not reflect optimistic value initiation.

However, the pattern of neuronal reward prediction errors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) suggests that these responses were computed in relation to late responses to cues, and reflected cue values initialised around the average value of all cues. Accordingly, neuronal responses to rewards were accounted for by the late component of neuronal responses to cues as well as the received reward size, with no significant contribution from the early component of cue responses (p = 0.0001, 0.43 and 0.021 for reward size, early and late cue responses, respectively; multiple linear regression).\u201d"
