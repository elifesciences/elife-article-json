Integrating these sources of information is well-described by a Bayesian framework in which estimates of action value are continually updated by incoming sensory information in order to select the most valuable action (<a href=\"#bib32\">K\u00f6rding and Wolpert, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kim and Basso, 2010</a>). This updating of action values, based on experiencing the outcomes associated with past actions, is thought to be mediated primarily by striatal circuits (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lau and Glimcher, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Histed et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tai et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). These action values can be maintained in striatal activity and ultimately used to bias activity in downstream motor centers such that the most valuable actions are more likely to be selected (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2014</a>). This system is capable of flexibly encoding action value estimates in arbitrarily complex and dynamic contexts over a range of time-scales. However, in environments in which only the recent past is relevant to action value, which is often the case in the real world, a simpler complementary mechanism would be to maintain short-term representations of the most recent actions and their outcomes that directly modulate the action selection process."

Further, at the time of action selection and even throughout much of the trial, most PPTg neurons represented the choice (left or right movement), outcome (rewarded or non-rewarded), or both, on the previous trial. Furthermore, we found that these representations influenced action selection: the probability of particular upcoming choices was predictably related to the firing rates of neurons selective for choice on the previous trial, and pharmacological inactivation of the PPTg causally affected behavior, in part by decreasing the influence of recent choices on upcoming choices. Our results suggest a novel mechanism, subserved by the PPTg, for efficiently modulating action selection based on the recent history of actions and their outcomes."

In each trial of the task, the mouse samples a binary odor mixture at a central port, waits for a go signal, and reports which odor is dominant by moving to the left or right port for a water reward (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; see Materials and methods). We have previously used this task to show that the activity of a population of PPTg neurons tends to be higher preceding contralateral than ipsilateral orienting movements (<a href=\"#bib57\">Thompson and Felsen, 2013</a>). Although optimal performance on this task requires that choices be based only on the current stimulus, previous studies \u2013 in mice, primates and humans \u2013 have shown that behavior in such tasks is, nevertheless, often influenced by previous trials (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lau and Glimcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gold et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Busse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akaishi et al., 2014</a>). We therefore examined how, in our task, upcoming choices depend on the choices and outcomes of previous trials by first examining psychometric functions conditional on previous trial history. As illustrated in the example data from one mouse in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, the mouse tended to choose the left port more often when it had chosen the left port on the previous trial and had been rewarded (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, compare solid black line to gray line), and tended to choose the right port more often when it had chosen the right port on the previous trial whether or not it had been rewarded (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, compare solid and dashed black lines to gray line). To quantify the influence of previous trials on choices, separately for each mouse (12 sessions per mouse; 451 \u00b1 115 (mean \u00b1 STD) trials per session), we employed a logistic regression model with terms for previous choice (<math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>C</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mn>1</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>) and outcome (<math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>O</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>:</mo><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>L</mi></mrow><mn>1</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>O</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>:</mo><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><mn>1</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>) (<i>Extended model, 1 trial back</i>; see Materials and methods).

In order to determine whether including these terms improved our behavioral model, we compared the accuracy of the <i>Extended model, 1 trial back</i> to the accuracy of the <i>Simple model</i> at predicting choices (Materials and methods).

For example, if the orientation at which the mouse enters the odor port depends on its previous choice, its subsequent choice behavior may be biased. If this were the case, we reasoned that would likely, although not necessarily, observe that movement duration (from odor port exit to reward port entry) would depend on the previous choice. However, we found that this was not the case (durations for rightward movements preceded by right choices and preceded by left choices, analyzed separately for each mouse, did not differ in 7/7 mice; durations for leftward movements preceded by right choices and preceded by left choices did not differ in 6/7 mice; p&gt;0.05, two-tailed unpaired Students <i>t</i>-tests separately by mouse). Therefore, although it is not possible to entirely rule out a role for the position of the body or any of its parts (e.g., whiskers) in contributing to our observed effect, as we did not measure all dimensions of body position, these results reduce the likelihood that choices depend on patterns of body position arising from the previous choice. Together, these results indicate that choices in our task are influenced by what happened on the previous trial \u2013 primarily by the choice rather than the outcome \u2013 and little influenced by the choice or the outcome from two trials in the past."

We first asked whether PPTg activity reflects the choice or outcome of the current trial. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows rasters and peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) for a representative PPTg neuron aligned to the time of odor valve open and grouped by the choice on the current trial, and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows the same data grouped by outcome on the current trial. Although the firing rate increased around the time of odor valve open, it does not appear to depend on either the choice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) or outcome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) on the current trial. To quantify dependence on choice across the population of 506 PPTg neurons recorded, we used an ROC-based preference analysis that uses the firing rates in a particular epoch to assign values ranging from \u22121 (ipsilateral preference) to 1 (contralateral preference), where the magnitude reflects preference strength (see Materials and methods). We were initially interested in preference during the pre-stimulus epoch \u2013 from odor port entry to 100 ms after odor valve open (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, gray shading; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, gray bar) \u2013 when the mouse is presumably preparing to update its estimates of the value of each option (i.e., to move left or right) with the information provided by the stimulus. We found that few neurons exhibited a preference for choice during this epoch (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>,\u00a0p&lt;0.05, Monte Carlo permutation test). We then used a similar preference analysis to quantify dependence on outcome during this same epoch, where negative values indicate preference for no-reward and positive values indicate preference for reward (see Materials and methods). We found that few neurons exhibited outcome preference (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>,\u00a0p&lt;0.05). It is not surprising that few neurons exhibit choice or outcome preference during this epoch, because the mouse presumably does not commit to a choice and cannot predict the outcome of the trial, before receiving the stimulus."

The influence of the previous trial declines by the time the mouse exits the odor port (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, middle), and the influence of the current choice increases upon reward port entry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right), consistent with the fact that many neurons exhibit preference for the current choice during and following entrance to the reward port (<a href=\"#bib57\">Thompson and Felsen, 2013</a>)."

Initially \u2013 even preceding odor delivery \u2013 the activity of many neurons reflects the choice on the previous trial, while the activity of virtually no neurons reflects the choice on the current trial (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, left). During stimulus presentation many neurons begin to reflect the choice on the current trial, and by the time the movement is initiated more neurons reflect the choice on the current than the previous trial (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, middle). Interestingly, the sign of <math id=\"inf19\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>C</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mn>1</mn></msubsup></mrow></math> of many neurons briefly inverted immediately preceding movement initiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), consistent with the dip in the fraction of significant neurons at this time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The choice on the current trial retains its influence for the remainder of the trial while the influence of the choice on the previous trial declines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, right), although, interestingly, a sizeable fraction of neurons continues to reflect the choice on the previous trial until well-after the mouse has made its choice on the current trial. We also examined, for the same population shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, how the fraction of neurons with activity influenced by the outcome on the previous trial (solid line) and current trial (dashed line) changes over the course of the trial (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Similar to the evolving representation of choice, the activity of more neurons is more strongly influenced by previous trial outcome early in the trial (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, left), and by current trial outcome later in the trial (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, right). In contrast to the long-lasting representation of previous choice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), virtually none of these neurons represent previous outcome by the time the mouse initiates its movement to the reward port (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, middle; however, note that the population of neurons analyzed was selected based on preference for previous choice, and not previous outcome, during the pre-stimulus epoch). These analyses show how PPTg activity evolves from representing information about the previous trial to representing information about the current trial, which may reflect the transfer of previous-trial information from the PPTg to a downstream region where it can be integrated with sensory evidence in order to form a motor plan."

                                "text": "In order to address whether the PPTg activity representing previous trial information is used to guide behavior, we next examined whether this activity influences the choice on the current trial. For simplicity we focused on PPTg activity representing previous choice, and not outcome, because we found that the former representation was more robust (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). If this activity indeed contributes to behavior \u2013 e.g., by providing information about the value of each option \u2013 we would predict a trial-by-trial correlation between the activity of individual neurons that exhibit a preference for previous choice and the likelihood of the mouse choosing the corresponding reward port, particularly on trials in which the sensory cue is ambiguous. Specifically, on trials in which a given neuron exhibits higher activity during the pre-stimulus epoch, we would expect the mouse to be more likely to choose the reward port corresponding to the preferred choice (ipsilateral or contralateral) of that neuron. Therefore, for each neuron exhibiting a significant preference for choice on the previous trial (corresponding to the black bars in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>; 378/506 total neurons), we examined how choice on ambiguous trials (% Left odor = 40, 50, or 60; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) depended on firing rate during the pre-stimulus epoch (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Specifically, for each trial of the session we calculated the firing rate (normalized to its maximum across trials, separately for each previous choice condition) and classified it by whether the mouse chose the preferred or antipreferred choice of the neuron, quantified as 1 and 0, respectively. We then calculated the slope of the best-fit line through these points, each of which correspond to a trial. For a given neuron, a positive slope indicates that the mouse is more likely to choose the reward port corresponding to the preferred choice of the neuron on trials in which its activity is high during the pre-stimulus epoch, as we had predicted. Across this population of neurons, many more exhibited a significantly positive slope than negative slope (p&lt;0.05, Monte Carlo permutation test; positive slopes: 136/378; negative slopes: 30/378; positive &gt; negative, p=0.001, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating a similar relationship between firing rate and current choice as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. However, since firing rate and current choice both depend on previous choice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figuers 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>), it is possible that this relationship is indirect. To determine whether this was the case, we examined the distribution of slopes separately for each mouse and found that each exhibited more neurons with positive than negative slopes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), even though the behavior of some mice did not depend on previous choice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results suggest that the representation of the choice on the previous trial (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) can directly influence the choice made by the mouse on the current trial."

We first found that behavior in a stimulus-cued spatial-choice task can be accounted for by a Bayesian framework (among others) in which choices are influenced by both recent trial history and the sensory stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gold et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Busse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akaishi et al., 2014</a>). We then found that activity of a subpopulation of PPTg neurons reflects choices and outcomes in the recent past (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>) and correlated with upcoming choice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), suggesting a role in mediating the influence of recent experience on behavior. Furthermore, inactivating PPTg decreased the influence of recent experience on behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Together, our results demonstrate that the PPTg encodes representations of recent experience that can contribute to action selection. Below, we consider our findings in light of the evolving view of the role of the PPTg within the interconnected network of brain regions involved in integrating priors with sensory evidence in order to select and control motor output (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mena-Segovia et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>)."

The results described here are consistent with these findings and suggest that PPTg output may play a role in providing information about recent actions and their outcomes that can be used to guide the selection of actions mediated by downstream motor circuits. However, downstream circuits do not necessarily utilize this information, given that it is represented in PPTg activity even in mice that do not exhibit a behavioral dependence on previous choice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

While the PPTg projects to several motor-related regions including other brainstem nuclei and the striatum (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beninato and Spencer, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Inglis and Winn, 1995</a>), and the current study cannot rule out the involvement of these regions, an attractive candidate is the SC. Cholinergic PPTg neurons project to and excite neurons in the SC responsible for motor output (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beninato and Spencer, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sooksawate et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stubblefield et al., 2015</a>), and nicotinic signaling in the SC has been shown to modulate orienting behavior (<a href=\"#bib61\">Weldon et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aizawa et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Watanabe et al., 2005</a>). The SC is thought to integrate a wide range of inputs in order to select orienting actions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kobayashi and Isa, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Krauzlis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grossberg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wolf et al., 2015</a>) and is thus well-positioned to combine \u2013 possibly additively \u2013 incoming sensory information with prior representations of action value (provided before, during, or even after the onset of sensory input; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) in order to select the most valuable action (<a href=\"#bib58\">Trappenberg et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dorris et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kim and Basso, 2010</a>). Our results suggest that the source of these prior representations may be the PPTg, which could complement other SC inputs \u2013 such as inhibition from the basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chevalier et al., 1985</a>) \u2013 in biasing action selection by modulating SC processing according to recently-experienced action-value associations (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kobayashi and Isa, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wolf et al., 2015</a>). While we have found it useful to think of the input from the PPTg to the SC as representing priors, in a Bayesian sense, accepting this framework \u2013 which may be imperfect given that choices in our task should not depend on previous trials \u2013 is not necessary for interpreting our results."

Activity in these regions typically reflects information from several previous trials, while PPTg activity was primarily associated with the immediately preceding trial (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). While this difference may be due to different task demands (recall that tracking past trials conferred no behavioral benefit in our task), the representations in the PPTg that we observed suggest a complementary mechanism to the more computationally\u00a0expensive processing in these other regions for integrating internal representations of experience with sensory evidence: Specifically, that PPTg directly influences the circuits underlying action selection based on recent experience, which may be well-suited to the relevant dynamics of some real-world situations. Future studies can expand upon our findings by recording from specific types of neurons (e.g., cholinergic) in the PPTg (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lima et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Roseberry et al., 2016</a>), as well as by examining how associations between stimuli and reward location are initially learned, in order to further elucidate the function of the PPTg in selecting actions."

For choice preference, \u22121 = left and 1 = right; for outcome preference, \u22121 = no reward and 1 = reward. Since choice is correlated with movement direction, this measure of choice preference alone formally cannot disambiguate whether activity reflects the chosen side itself or the direction of movement either towards or from the reward port. However, either movement is a perfect proxy for the choice \u2013 e.g., leftward movement towards the reward port and rightward movement from the reward port both indicate a left choice \u2013 and we report in the Results section an analysis derived from choice preference that can disambiguate whether PPTg activity reflects choice or movement direction. For clarity, we refer to neural activity with respect to the chosen reward port and the direction of movement towards that port (i.e., left and leftward in the above example). Statistical significance of preference was determined with a Monte Carlo permutation test: we recalculated preference after randomly reassigning each firing rate to one of the two groups, repeated this procedure 1000 times to obtain a distribution, and calculated the fraction of randomly generated preferences exceeding the actual preference. We examined preference during the pre-stimulus epoch (from odor port entry to 100 ms after odor valve open, before stimulus information can reach the PPTg; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). For all preference analyses, we tested for significance at \u03b1 = 0.05. Neurons with fewer than four trials for each condition or with a firing rate below 2 spikes/s for both conditions were excluded from analysis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Thompson and Felsen, 2013</a>)."

They then examined the role of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) in this behavior. This group has previously shown that PPTg activity reflects the choice and outcome on the current trial. In the present study, they found that, in a time window before or around odor delivery, PPTg neurons represent the choice (left or right movement) or outcome (reward or no-reward) in the previous trial, but not in the current trial. They also pharmacologically or optogenetically manipulated the activity of PPTg, in an effort to establish a causal relationship between PPTg and the behavioral effect of the immediate recent choice/outcome."

In the revised manuscript, we have reorganized our presentation of the muscimol experiments such that they are all now at the end of the Results (Revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; Results, last two paragraphs) instead of being split between Original <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, C</a> (direct effect of inactivation on behavioral choice; now Revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A, B</a>) and Original Figure 6D (effect of inactivation on the influence on behavior of the previous choice; now Revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Now that we have deleted the optogenetics experiments, we believe that this organization provides the most natural flow for the manuscript: Revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> demonstrate correlation, and Revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> demonstrates causality, between PPTg activity and behavior."

Interestingly, displaying the data this way reveals that the preferred previous trial choice of many neurons briefly inverted immediately preceding movement initiation (Revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), consistent with the dip in the fraction of significant neurons at this time (Revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Thus, data from M1 and M2 were included, even though these mice did not exhibit behavior influenced by the previous trial (Revised <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Indeed, we took advantage of the absence of a behavioral effect in these mice to show that the relationship between firing rate and current choice (Revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>) was not indirectly due to the fact that both of these variables depend on previous choice (Firing rate: Revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; Current choice: Revised <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>): Even for M1 and M2, in which current choice did not depend on previous choice, more neurons exhibited a positive than negative relationship between firing rate and current choice (Revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; subsection \u201cInfluence of PPTg representations of previous trials on behavior\u201d, first paragraph). In the revised manuscript, we have edited our conclusion from this analysis to \u201cThese results suggest that the representation of the choice on the previous trial (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) can directly influence the choice made by the mouse on the current trial\u201d, and have likewise edited text in the Discussion to \u201cTogether, our results demonstrate that the PPTg encodes representations of recent experience that can contribute to action selection\u201d."
