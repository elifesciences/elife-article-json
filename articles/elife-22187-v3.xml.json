However, the mechanism of mtDNA movement between cells remains unresolved. To determine whether the transfer of mtDNA involves whole mitochondria, we injected B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> mouse melanoma cells into syngeneic C57BL/6N<i><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></i> mice that express red fluorescent protein in their mitochondria. We document that mtDNA is acquired by transfer of whole mitochondria from the host animal, leading to normalisation of mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, knockdown of key mitochondrial complex I (NDUFV1) and complex II (SDHC) subunits by shRNA in B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells abolished or significantly retarded their ability to form tumours. Collectively, these results show that intact mitochondria with their mtDNA payload are transferred in the developing tumour, and provide functional evidence for an essential role of oxidative phosphorylation in cancer."

However, the mechanism of mtDNA movement between cells remains unresolved. To determine whether the transfer of mtDNA involves whole mitochondria, we injected B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> mouse melanoma cells into syngeneic C57BL/6N<i><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></i> mice that express red fluorescent protein in their mitochondria. We document that mtDNA is acquired by transfer of whole mitochondria from the host animal, leading to normalisation of mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, knockdown of key mitochondrial complex I (NDUFV1) and complex II (SDHC) subunits by shRNA in B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells abolished or significantly retarded their ability to form tumours. Collectively, these results show that intact mitochondria with their mtDNA payload are transferred in the developing tumour, and provide functional evidence for an essential role of oxidative phosphorylation in cancer."

This is linked to altered mitochondrial bioenergetics, such that cancer cells are more glycolytic than their non-malignant counterparts, as postulated almost a century ago by Warburg. Altered energy metabolism is now regarded as one of the hallmarks of cancer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Koppenol et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Vyas et al., 2016</a>). In this context, the mitochondrial genome has been reported to play a role in tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee and St John, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Patananan et al., 2016</a>) and in metastatic cancer (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hayashi et al., 2016</a>)."

Recent research has demonstrated a new concept of cancer metabolism, emphasising the importance of OXPHOS in the tumour environment beyond its role in bioenergetics (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gentric et al., 2016</a>). A novel paradigm has emerged, according to which respiration is important for cancer cell proliferation, and also for tumour formation, progression and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib26\">LeBleu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Viale et al., 2014</a>). This is probably linked to metabolic re-modelling (<a href=\"#bib6\">Birsoy et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sullivan et al., 2015</a>). There are reports that some cancer cells retain OXPHOS capacity and have no obvious respiratory defects (<a href=\"#bib11\">Frezza and Gottlieb, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jose et al., 2011</a>). Further, inhibiting glycolysis may restore higher rates of OXPHOS in neoplastic cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moreno-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Michelakis et al., 2010</a>).

Super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy exerted similar levels and distribution of mtDNA nucleoids in B16, B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup>SC, B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup>CTC and B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup>SCL cells, and no nucleoids in B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells, also showing largely unchanged levels of Tom20 and low level of TFAM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig6\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 2E</a>). Native blue gel electrophoresis (NBGE) revealed that B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells do not contain the supercomplex/respirasome (formed by CI, CIII and CIV), but contain low amounts of sub-CV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). CII was found to be fully assembled in all sub-lines, which is reasonable considering that all four subunits in CII are encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To test if cells replicate their mtDNA, we established the mitochondrial chromatin immunoprecipitation (mitoChIP) assay. This showed a high level of DNA polymerase-\u03b31 (POLG1) binding to the <i>D-LOOP</i> region of mtDNA in all cells except B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

The only plausible explanation for this phenomenon is the\u00a0transfer of mtDNA from host cells to tumour cells with compromised mtDNA. The question of how mtDNA moves between cells has not been addressed. An attractive scenario is that whole mitochondria with their payload of mtDNA are transferred, but alternative explanations such as cell fusion have also been suggested (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vitale et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Maiuri and Kroemer, 2015</a>). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as donors of mitochondria due to their high levels of Miro-1, which is the adaptor protein responsible for mitochondrial association with the microtubule mobility complex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmad et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mills et al., 2016</a>).

Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) that binds covalently to amino acid residues inside cells was used for staining the potential recipient (B16 or B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup>) cells. Following co-culture, cells were assessed by confocal microscopy to determine the extent of mitochondrial transfer to recipient cells. Representative images and quantitative evaluation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 3A,B</a>) reveal accumulation of MitoDR stained mitochondria in CFSE stained \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells, as a result of their transfer from MitoDR stained MSCs.

In mammals, the\u00a0mitochondrial gene transfer has been inferred in a 10,000 year-old canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rebbeck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Murchison et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Strakova and Murchison, 2015</a>). These predictions have now been confirmed, and a recent study showed at least 5 mtDNA transfers in CTVT within the last 1\u20132 thousand years (<a href=\"#bib48\">Strakova et al., 2016</a>). Mitochondrial transfer was reported in vitro with functional consequences (<a href=\"#bib46\">Spees et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang and Gerdes, 2015</a>), as well as in mice with endogenously injected MSCs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Islam et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmad et al., 2014</a>), but these results could also be explained by the\u00a0association of membrane-bound particles or exosomes containing mitochondria with the damaged cells rather than functional mitochondria proliferating/dividing inside cells. A recent publication from our laboratory showed, for the first time, horizontal transfer of mitochondrial genes between mammalian cells in vivo, based on acquisition of host mtDNA by \u03c1<sup>0</sup> tumour cells and on the presence of host mtDNA markers in cell lines derived from these tumours (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2015</a>). Several subsequently published papers also provide evidence for horizontal transfer of mitochondria under (patho)physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lei and Spradling, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hayakawa et al., 2016</a>; ,<a href=\"#bib38\">Osswald et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Moschoi et al., 2016</a>), pointing to OXPHOS as a factor complicating cancer therapy (<a href=\"#bib38\">Osswald et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Moschoi et al., 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">Matassa et al., 2016</a>).

To address these queries, B16 metastatic melanoma cells without mtDNA and with compromised respiratory function were used. We show that B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells do not form tumours unless they acquire mtDNA and that severe suppression of either CI- or CII-dependent respiration leads to impaired ability to form tumours, directly linking mitochondrial respiration and tumor growth. The reason(s) for the apparently greater importance of CI-dependent respiration in tumour formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>) remain to be explored, particularly when the role of SDH in metabolic re-modelling is taken into consideration (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cardaci et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lussey-Lepoutre et al., 2015</a>). From a mechanistic point of view, CI is essential for respirasome assembly (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</a>) that is needed for CI-dependent respiration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ac\u00edn-P\u00e9rez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2015</a>).

Consistent with this, 4T1\u03c1<sup>0</sup>SC cells formed tumours with a longer delay than parental 4T1 cells, while no delay was observed for B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup>SC cells. This is likely related to the higher requirement of B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells for respiration recovery to form tumours. This \u2018threshold\u2019, apparently lower for 4T1\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells, may be due to higher routine respiration of B16 cells of some 100 pmol O<sub>2</sub>/s/10<sup>6</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) when compared to less than 20 pmol O<sub>2</sub>/s/10<sup>6</sup> cells for 4T1 cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2015</a>).

Both selective transfer of mitochondria and cell fusion have been proposed in the past (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vitale et al., 2011</a>). Using C57BL/6N<i><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></i> mice with red fluorescent mitochondria in somatic cells, we now provide evidence for acquisition of mtDNA by the\u00a0trafficking of whole mitochondria from host donor cells to \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells both in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), resulting in long-lasting respiration recovery and, consequently, efficient tumour formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>). The transient nature of dsRed expression in recipient B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cell mitochondria in the in vivo model sheds additional light on the mechanism of mitochondrial transfer. When dsRed-containing mitochondria are selectively transferred from the host into the recipient cells, dsRed cannot be replenished in the donated mitochondria by de novo synthesis (not being encoded in the recipient\u2019s nuclear genome), and the red fluorescence in donated mitochondria is quickly lost. On the other hand, if cell fusion were responsible for the observed acquisition of mitochondria from the donor cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maiuri and Kroemer, 2015</a>), the donor\u2019s nuclear material would also be transferred, and mitochondrial dsRed expression would be maintained. As this is not the case, the selective transfer of whole, intact mitochondria remains the only possible explanation of our experimental data. The next step will be to investigate the mechanism of mitochondrial trafficking between cells in vivo, with tunnelling nanotubes being a plausible mode of intercellular transfer of the organelles (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rustom et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rogers and Bhattacharya, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rustom, 2016</a>)."

Our findings are consistent with the emerging notion of the essential role of respiration in cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression (<a href=\"#bib26\">LeBleu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Viale et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Birsoy et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sullivan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cardaci et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lussey-Lepoutre et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berridge et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Viale et al., 2015</a>), and of a role for mitochondrial transfer in maintaining the bioenergetics balance (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sinha et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 2016</a>). From translational angle, recent studies on horizontal mitochondrial transfer indicate two tantalising, novel approaches to cancer therapy: targeting mitochondrial respiration and blocking transfer of mitochondria from stromal cells to cancer cells. While we have started exploring the first approach (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boukalova et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kluckova et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rohlenova et al., 2017</a>), the other approach remains untested, with recent papers (<a href=\"#bib38\">Osswald et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Moschoi et al., 2016</a>) pointing to its plausibility. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first report to show lasting functional consequences of a well-documented mitochondrial transfer event."

The primary cells were plated at the density of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in T25 culture flasks and experiments were performed after the fourth passage. For co-culture experiments, MSCs were stained with Mito Deep Red (Ex/Em, 644/665 nm; Invitrogen) and B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells with the CFSE dye (Ex/Em, 492/517 nm; Invitrogen) for 15 min. The cells were then co-cultured for 24 hr and evaluated by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur) and confocal microscopy (63 x; Leica SP8). Mitochondrial transfer was primarily ascertained by a\u00a0fraction of CFSE-positive cells that were also MitoDeepRed-positive. The\u00a0quantitative mitochondrial transfer was primarily ascertained by pixel counts on Z-stack confocal images i.e. red pixels in cells with green background. Geometric mean intensity of MitoDeerRed fluorescence in double positive cells was additionally calculated, as a confirmatory measurement of the degree of mitochondrial transfer. Other co-culture combinations (MSCs with B16 cells, B16 cells with B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells) were performed in a similar fashion. Additionally, \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for nBFP and pmGFP followed by clonal selection. Transfected \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells were seeded with MSCs prepared from C57BL/6N<i><sup>su9DsRed2</sup></i> mice in glass-bottom dishes (In Vitro Scientific) at 1:1 ratio and co-cultured for 24 hr. Live cells were inspected using the inverted fluorescence microscope Delta Vision Core with laser photo-manipulation. The acquired images were deconvolved by Huygens Professional software (Scientific Volume Imaging) and processed by FiJi ImageJ software."

Transgenic mice expressing red fluorescent protein in somatic cell mitochondria (the <i>CAG/su9-DsRed2</i> transgene) were generated in the Transgenic Unit of the Czech Centre for Phenogenomics, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Czech Republic, using a pronuclear injection from the construct provided by Prof. Masaru Okabe (Osaka University, Japan) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hasuwa et al., 2010</a>) and C57BL/6N mice. The stable colony of transgenic mice was housed in the animal facility of the Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, and food and water were supplied ad libitum. The mice used for the grafting experiments were healthy 10 weeks old animals with no sign of stress or discomfort. All animal procedures and experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Czech Academy of Sciences (Animal Ethics Number 18/2015)."

Approximately 10,000 cells were seeded in a 6-well culture plate, nuclei were stained with DAPI and automated image analysis was performed to identify viable attached cells. Candidate cells were removed with a 30 \u00b5m capillary aspirating 0.1 \u00b5l per cell using automated bottom detection and scrape mode. Each removed cell was deposited into 10 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l BSA (ThermoFisher) in a 384-well plate that was cooled during the cell picking. The plate was then sealed and placed on dry ice until use. Images were collected before and after picking, and only those samples that contained a single cell were used for further analysis. Negative controls were medium only. Half of the cell lysate (5 \u00b5l) was used in 20 \u00b5l ddPCR following the manufacturer\u00b4s recommendations using ddPCR Mastermix for probes (BioRad) supplemented with 450 nM primers, 250 nM probes: <i>tRNA</i> 8A FAM and 9A HEX (Sigma Aldrich, sequences are in <a href=\"#A1-tbl1\">Appendix 1\u2014table 1</a> below).

Loss of linearity was observed at a prevalence of 0.5% and 0.05% spiked in host DNA. Pure parental mtDNA gave a background corresponding to 0.18% of host mtDNA. This very low background is caused by cross reaction due to residual affinity of the 8A host probe to the 9A parental locus. The\u00a0reciprocal cross reaction of 9A probe binding to 8A parental locus was not observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Appendix 1\u2014figure 1</a> for validation of sc/ddPCR). No template controls (NTC) as well as B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells were negative. A single B16 cell contains about 100 copies of mtDNA (not shown); hence our ddPCR sensitivity of 0.5% is sufficient to detect a single host mtDNA molecule."

It follows from a previous study from the same authors demonstrating that rho0 B16 cells acquire mtDNA from the host during tumorigenesis. Here the authors provide two new types of information. First, they significantly extend their previous work to demonstrate the importance of, and selection for, cells with electron transport chain function during tumorigenesis in this model. Second, the authors use additional mouse models to provide evidence for direct transfer of intact mitochondria from the host into rho0 melanoma cells during tumor growth, as opposed to cellular fusion events or transfer of mtDNA. This is a provocative finding, novel to models of cancer biology."

In response to this well taken point, we state that we used four different shRNAs for both NDUFV1 and SDHC. We assessed the level of expression of the relevant proteins and respiration in cell lines transfected with all four shRNAs. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, we document protein levels for shRNA#1 and shRNA#2 for both NDUFV1 and SDHC. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B-D</a> we only show proliferation and respiration (both routine and CI- and CII-dependent) for the more efficient shRNA#2 (for both NDUFV1 and SDHC). Since we then wanted to perform the experiments (respiration and tumour growth) using the shRNA with higher level of knock down, we focused on shRNAs #2 for both NDUFV1 and SDHC. We decided not to carry out the functional experiments with shRNAs #1 due to their less profound effect on the protein levels. The fact that in case of SDHC shRNA and, in particular NDUFV1 shRNA, we observed highly delayed tumour growth initiation or no tumour growth within 100 days after grafting the cells (with the corresponding \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells giving rise of tumour growth within 20-25 days), we believe that the knock down (also given its effect on respiration shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>), is causally linked to knocking down of SDHC and NDUFV1, respectively. It is important that both SDHC and NDUFV1 knockdowns led to a delay in tumor formation. It is quite unlikely that both an SDHC and NDUFV1 shRNA would manifest an off-target effect that would result in a delay of tumor growth, it is much more likely that reduction in CI and CII activity induced by respective shRNA is at the bases of the observed phenomenon. This brings consistency to the reported results, as these are in fact two independent shRNAs directed at different components of the electron transport chain. Furthermore, to perform the in vivo experiments again with an independent set of shRNA would require at least 5 months, including all preparatory work, renewal of mouse work permits and the extended 100 days observation period in mice (cf. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

The reason is that we do not see any mitochondria staining of parental cells co-cultured with MitoDeepRed-labelled MSCs, whereas if die leakage occurred from MCSs, the parental cell mitochondria would be stained as well, all the more so that these cells have higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared to \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells and would accumulate the die more readily. Notwithstanding this reasoning, we performed an additional experiment to unequivocally document intercellular transfer of whole mitochondria in MCSs co-cultures using nuclear-encoded mitochondria-targeted fluorescent protein as suggested by the reviewer. We used transgenic C57BL/6N<i><sup>su9DsRed2</sup></i> mice with red fluorescent mitochondria in somatic cells, from which we isolated MSCs and co-cultured them with \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells, whose nuclei were labelled with blue fluorescent protein (BFP) and plasma membrane with green fluorescence protein (GFP).

In fact, we have started a separate project that will answer the very question why transfer of mitochondria from MSCs occursinto B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells but not into their normal counterparts. The group of our collaborator and co-author of this manuscript Prof. Agrawal published a paper recently showing that mitochondria move from MSCs to rotenone-stressed lung alveolar epithelial cells (Ahmad et al. Miro1 regulates intercellular mitochondrial transport &amp; enhances mesenchymal stem cell rescue efficacy. EMBO J 33, 994-1010). We have now carried out similar experiments with MSCs isolated from C57BL mice and with parental B16 cells stressed with rotenone. As seen from <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>, there was over 3-fold increase in movement of mitochondria from MSCs into rotenone-treated B16 cells compared to their control counterparts, recapitulating our observation with B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells. We do not include these results in the revised version of the manuscript, since they are a part of another project (as eluded to above), in which we study the reasons for selective movement of mitochondria to cells lacking mtDNA or whose mtDNA is compromised in some way. The fact that we do see movement of mitochondria into B16 cells with normal mtDNA that were stressed with rotenone indicates that cells with compromised mitochondrial function (rotenone targets mitochondrial complex I) will import mitochondria in order to correct the situation, such as recover their respiratory capacity as we show in our manuscript. The nature of the signal that directs mitochondrial transfer to mitochondria-compromised cell is a matter of intense research in our laboratory."

Before answering this point, it may be good to recapitulate the experiment we performed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, where we document the presence of dsRed-positive mitochondria donated by the stroma cells of the C57BL/6N<i><sup>su9-DsRed2</sup></i> mouse in the cytoplasm of the grafted, nuclear BFP-expressing B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells. The experiment itself is quite complicated. First, one needs to take into consideration that mitochondria move across over a relatively long period of time. We now have data from a different cell line from another project documenting that mitochondria start to move from the mouse stromal cells to grafted \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells within 5 days (will be published elsewhere). Also, using single cells real-time PCR, we observe continuous movement of mitochondria between stromal cells and grafted \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells for some 20 days following grafting of \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells, until all cells in the small tumour that starts to grow contain mitochondria with DNA. These new, unpublished data are from experiments with 4T1\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells, where the principle of mitochondrial transfer is similar to that of mitochondrial transfer to B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells. An important aspect of the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> stems from the fact that the MitoDsRed protein is coded for in the nucleus of the host (stromal, presumably mesenchymal stem) cells. Once the mitochondrion moves across to the grafted B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> cell, the MitoDsRed protein will \u2018fade\u2019, since it is not replenished \u2013 the recipient \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cell does not code for this transgene. This in itself is a good evidence of selective mitochondria transfer as opposed to other possible mechanisms such as cell fusion. Therefore, at any point in time, we can visualise only a small percentage of mitochondria that would have moved across and would not have yet lost the red fluorescence emitted by the MitoDsRed protein."

As discussed above, we have to take into consideration the fact that, following transfer from stromal cells of the host into the grafted \u03c1<sup>0</sup> cells, the MitoDsRed protein will fade rather fast, within about 20-24 h. Therefore, we only have a small window of opportunity to get an image of cells still expressing the mitochondrial red fluorescent protein. This involves first dissection of the tissue comprising the grafted cells, preparation of single cell suspension and sorting of DP cells with red and blue fluorescence. It takes up to 12 hours from sacrificing the animal to having cells sorted for further experimentation. For confocal microscopy, we need to seed the cells in special dishes and allow them to attach, at least to some extent, so that we can take reasonably clear images. We cannot allow the cells to be in the incubator for more than some 6-8 hours before imaging is performed, otherwise the red fluorescence will fade. Therefore, the images that we take in this way are not perfect, although they still clearly document red fluorescent mitochondria in cells with BFP nuclei. Later on, when we use these cells that are established as a subline, imaging is good but the cells do not comprise the MitoDsRed protein anymore. Therefore, we chose the best image we obtained. Additional images of B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup>DP cells recovered on different days following the engraftment of B16\u03c1<sup>0</sup> nBFP cells into C57BL/6N<i><sup>su9DsRed2</sup></i> mice are presented in the attachment to this document, demonstrating that the images shown do not represent a one-off scenario. Given the technical difficulties of confocal imaging in this setup, the sorting data discussed above present a much more reliable evidence for the reproducibility of the mitochondria-transfer process in vivo."

We know that cells that contain both \u03c1<sup>0</sup> mitochondria and mitochondria with mtDNA will not change their ratio much over longer periods in culture, which more-or-less excludes fusion of mtDNA-positive and mtDNA-negative mitochondria, which need to undergo fission in the course of cell division, at which stage they need to be shared relatively similarly between the daughter cells. A rather different issue is to resolve what happens under in vivo conditions, i.e. after cells with \u03c1<sup>0</sup> mitochondria are grafted in mice and after they import mitochondria with mtDNA from the stroma. The original \u03c1<sup>0</sup> mitochondria may fuse with the incoming mitochondria with mtDNA or \u03c1<sup>0</sup> mitochondria may be removed by mitophagy, or both processes may occur in parallel.
