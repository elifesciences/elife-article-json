Most oncogenes, however, require a combination of at least two signals to promote proliferation. In this study, we present evidence that Yap activation is insufficient to promote growth in the otherwise normal tissue. Using a mosaic mouse model, we demonstrate that Yap overexpression in a fraction of hepatocytes does not lead to their clonal expansion, as proliferation is counterbalanced by increased apoptosis. To shift the activity of Yap towards growth, a second signal provided by tissue damage or inflammation is required. In response to liver injury, Yap drives clonal expansion, suppresses hepatocyte differentiation, and promotes a progenitor phenotype. These results suggest that Yap activation is insufficient to promote growth in the absence of a second signal thus coordinating tissue homeostasis and repair."

Most oncogenes, however, require a combination of at least two signals to promote proliferation. In this study, we present evidence that Yap activation is insufficient to promote growth in the otherwise normal tissue. Using a mosaic mouse model, we demonstrate that Yap overexpression in a fraction of hepatocytes does not lead to their clonal expansion, as proliferation is counterbalanced by increased apoptosis. To shift the activity of Yap towards growth, a second signal provided by tissue damage or inflammation is required. In response to liver injury, Yap drives clonal expansion, suppresses hepatocyte differentiation, and promotes a progenitor phenotype. These results suggest that Yap activation is insufficient to promote growth in the absence of a second signal thus coordinating tissue homeostasis and repair."

Together with a related protein Taz, Yap is the central target of the Hippo pathway, a growth-suppressive network of kinase complexes that inactivates Yap and Taz (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hong and Guan, 2012</a>). The Hippo pathway has been implicated in organ size control, as overexpression of Yap or inactivation of the Hippo components leads to tissue overgrowth and organomegaly in <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse models (<a href=\"#bib15\">Camargo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lin et al., 2013</a>).

Thus, in some tissues Yap may be dispensable for homeostasis but required specifically in response to injury. The liver is one of the organs most responsive to excessive Yap activity. Transgenic overexpression of Yap or inactivation of its upstream negative regulators causes a dramatic increase in liver size, hepatocyte proliferation, progenitor cell expansion, and tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Camargo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kowalik et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zheng et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, deletion of Yap in the liver leads to defects in bile duct formation but no apparent defects in hepatocyte number and function (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that Yap may be dispensable for hepatocyte homeostasis. However, whether its function is required for hepatocyte homeostasis and response to injury remains to be established (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yu et al., 2014</a>)."

Collectively, these data suggest that hyperactivation of Yap abrogates organ size control mechanisms and drives tumorigenesis in a seemingly unrestrained fashion. However, growth-promoting pathways are normally safeguarded by tumor-suppressive mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hahn and Weinberg, 2002</a>). For example, c-myc hyperactivation sensitizes cells to apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Evan et al., 1992</a>), oncogenic Ras induces senescence (<a href=\"#bib49\">Serrano et al., 1997</a>), and overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibits cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib42\">O'Reilly et al., 1996</a>). Whether or not Yap activity is subject to a similar tumor-suppressive regulation is currently unclear. While Yap is known to interact with p73 and promote apoptosis in response to DNA damage in vitro (<a href=\"#bib54\">Strano et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lapi et al., 2008</a>), there is no evidence that Yap can induce apoptosis in vivo."

Yap activity is regulated by adherens and tight junctions, cell polarity complexes, and the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boggiano and Fehon, 2012</a>). At high cell densities, Yap is either directly recruited to intercellular junctions or undergoes phosphorylation and cytosolic retention via the Hippo pathway, which itself is also regulated in a cell contact-dependent manner. This feature makes Yap competent to direct cell fate decisions depending on cell density and architecture. Thus, cell environment may be a major determinant of the outcome of Yap activation. Moreover, evidence from <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chen et al., 2012</a>) and mammalian cell culture (<a href=\"#bib41\">Norman et al., 2012</a>) suggest that the outcome of Yap activation depends on Yap activity in neighboring cells. The regulation of Yap activity by such mechanism has not been characterized in mammalian tissues in vivo."

We present evidence that a high level of Yap in this context is insufficient to drive clonal expansion, as increased proliferation of Yap-overexpressing hepatocytes is balanced by their increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Yap-mediated clonal expansion requires a second signal provided by disruption of tissue homeostasis, such as injury or inflammation. Upon returning to homeostasis, excessive Yap-overexpressing cells are eliminated by apoptosis."

We used <i>Yap1</i> mutant S112A which has enhanced nuclear localization and has been previously shown to cause a several-fold increase in liver size when overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>) in the entire organ. A targeting construct driving expression of the <i>Yap1</i><sup><i>S112A</i></sup><i>-IRES-GFP</i> downstream of a floxed transcriptional STOP cassete was knocked into the <i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</i> (<i>Rosa26</i>) locus. Upon expression of Cre recombinase, the transcriptional STOP cassette is removed, allowing expression of Yap together with GFP (YapKI mice; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Both populations have a recombined STOP cassette, but the gene of interest is expressed above physiological level only in GFP<sup>high</sup> cells. GFP<sup>low</sup> cells serve as an internal control population of the identical genetic background for the GFP<sup>high</sup> cells. In the absence of selective pressure, the ratio of GFP<sup>low</sup> to GFP<sup>high</sup> cells remains constant throughout life. Thus, crossing <i>YapKI</i> mice to <i>Albumin-Cre</i> (<i>Alb-Cre</i>) yields mosaic Yap expression in the hepatic lineage, where individual cells overexpressing Yap can be traced by GFP fluorescence (YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice). Similar to the previously reported Rosa26-DNp53 mice (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bondar and Medzhitov, 2010</a>), the proportion of GFP<sup>low</sup> to GFP<sup>high</sup> cells remained stable in the blood of YapKI<sup>CreER</sup> mice upon tamoxifen induction for many months (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). In the colons of YapKI<sup>Villin-Cre</sup> mice, crypts were either entirely GFP<sup>high</sup> or GFP<sup>low</sup> (GFP<sup>low</sup> appearing as GFP\u2212 due to limited sensitivity of GFP detection by tissue immunostaining). There were no crypts that have mixed populations, as would be expected if cells randomly switched expression level (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Collectively, these data illustrate stable inheritance of the Rosa26 allele expression level."

                                "text": "First, we verified the correlation of Yap and GFP expression by immunofluorescence staining of the YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> liver sections. Indeed, Yap and GFP in hepatocytes displayed mosaic and overlapping expression pattern, with cytosolic as well as nuclear Yap localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Utilizing the GFP marker, we tested the recombination efficiency by flow cytometry. More than 90% of hepatocytes were GFP-positive, indicating high deletion efficiency of the STOP cassette (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Recombination was also confirmed by genomic qPCR (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The hepatocytes formed two distinct populations differing in GFP brightness. To determine the level of Yap activity in these cells, we sorted each of these populations by FACS. Since GFP fluorescence varied 10-fold within the GFP<sup>low</sup> population, we further subdivided it into GFP<sup>low</sup> and GFP<sup>med-low</sup> populations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The exogenous transcripts of Yap are highly expressed only in the GFP<sup>high</sup> population, but not in the GFP<sup>low</sup> and GFP<sup>med-low</sup> populations. The small amount of the exogenous Yap mRNA in the GFP<sup>low</sup> and GFP<sup>med-low</sup> populations is insignificant due to a potential negative feedback mechanism that reduces the endogenous Yap expression, resulting in a similar level of total Yap mRNA compared to that of wild-type (WT) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Additionally, CTGF, a known Yap downstream target gene (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>), was significantly upregulated only in the GFP<sup>high</sup> population, whereas its expression remained unchanged in GFP<sup>low</sup> and GFP<sup>med-low</sup> populations, indicating normal levels of Yap activity in these cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, GFP and Yap protein levels correlate in YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice, and Yap is overexpressed and has higher activity specifically in the GFP<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes (to which we will refer as Yap<sup>high</sup> cells)."

We therefore tested whether Yap influenced proliferation and apoptosis in YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> liver. Indeed, more Yap<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes incorporated BrdU than their GFP<sup>low</sup> neighbors or hepatocytes in WT livers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

By day 4, ALT levels returned to baseline (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), normal pericentral morphology was restored, and expression of the CV-proximal marker glutamine synthase was reestablished in both groups (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, YapCKO<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> hepatocytes proliferated significantly less than their WT counterparts throughout the repair phase, as shown by BrdU labeling on days 1\u20133 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Consistent with the defective regeneration, YapCKO<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> livers displayed abnormal collagen deposition around the CV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Tissue injury is accompanied by inflammation, which can promote proliferation by mechanisms distinct from homeostasis. To test whether Yap cooperates with inflammatory signals to drive cell cycle progression, we measured hepatocyte BrdU incorporation in YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice after 6 continuous days of intraperitoneal injections of LPS. This chronic LPS treatment induced a massive expansion of Yap<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes, similar to what was seen after CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Consistently, the BrdU incorporation index indicated that Yap<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes proliferated significantly more than hepatocytes in the WT livers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> livers displayed significant hyperplasia, as visualized by increased hepatocyte density (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and measured by total number of hepatocytes per liver (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

In contrast, we observed high cell density, strong cytoplasmic eosinophilia, round to ovoid nuclei, and increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio in the pericentral zones of livers from CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These morphological changes are often seen in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and are associated with dedifferentiation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Balani et al., 2013</a>). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that these cells were GFP<sup>+</sup> and therefore originated from Yap<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To determine whether Yap induction affects differentiation status of hepatocytes, we compared the gene expression of hepatocytes sorted from YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice at steady state and 4 days after CCl<sub>4</sub> damage. The majority of liver-specific transcripts (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2013</a>) (which roughly represent hepatocyte differentiation state) were strongly repressed in Yap<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes from CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated mice, whereas WT and Yap<sup>low</sup> hepatocytes showed minimal alterations and no bias towards decreased expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Immunofluorescent staining and Western blot for hepatocyte-specific gene glutamine synthase also showed a strong downregulation of expression in YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> livers after CCl<sub>4</sub> damage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Downregulation of other hepatocyte-specific genes (acute phase protein Orm1 and urea cycle component Asl) was also confirmed by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further verify RNA-sequencing data and evaluate levels of Yap activation in our model, we performed qPCR analysis of the genes previously shown to be induced in Yap-Tg liver by Pan's group (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dong et al., 2007</a>) and found comparable effects (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Not surprisingly, an expanding number of pathways restricting the pro-growth potential of Yap have been identified, including the Hippo pathway, the actin cytoskeleton and cell junction complexes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boggiano and Fehon, 2012</a>), C/EBPa, and Trib2 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Despite these multifactorial control mechanisms, mere overexpression of Yap in the whole liver in mouse models leads to hyperplasia, organomegaly, dedifferentiation, and cancer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Camargo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</a>), raising a question as to whether some layer of homeostatic growth control may be lacking in such models. Organ-wide Yap activation in the liver does occur during embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib48\">Septer et al., 2012</a>) and adaptive hepatomegaly (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kowalik et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, these are also examples of physiologically relevant settings of liver size increase. Transgenic Yap overexpression in the entire liver may thus be viewed as a model of these physiological scenarios. In contrast, during response to a localized injury, only the cells within the damage site need to proliferate, and Yap activation in this case should conform to the physiological organ size limits. Our study suggests that under these circumstances, activation of a pro-growth gene program by Yap requires an additional local signal (e.g., growth factor, cytokine, or release of contact inhibition) provided by the injury. Our preliminary data implicate IL-6 as at least one of such signals (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Proto-oncogenes typically require two signals in order to induce proliferation. In case of Yap, which acts as a sensor of cell density, its overexpression mimics a condition in which a cell has lost its contacts with the neighbors. This in itself should not induce proliferation unless cell-extrinsic signals of tissue damage such as inflammatory cytokines are also present. The mechanism of cooperation between activation of Yap and injury/inflammatory signals may occur at the level of gene expression, as many proliferation genes have TEAD as well as NFkB binding sites (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While it is also possible that cooperation is mediated by increased Yap stability or recruitment of TEAD, this possibility is less likely as we observed induction of high number of TEAD-dependent genes in Yap-overexpressing hepatocytes whereas proliferation genes were not induced."

The mosaic model of Yap induction described here reveals selective pressures that determine the fate of Yap<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes: no growth advantage at steady state, positive selection during early stages of tissue injury, and negative selection at later stages when injury induced signals subside. The mechanisms opposing clonal expansion of Yap<sup>high</sup> hepatocytes under homeostatic conditions may have many components, but one implicated by our data is apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic effects of Yap have been extensively documented in vitro (<a href=\"#bib54\">Strano et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lapi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tomlinson et al., 2010</a>), and increased apoptosis has been reported in Mst1/2-deficient mouse livers (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lu et al., 2010</a>), but to our knowledge there has been no evidence of Yap promoting cell death in vivo. We show that Yap activation in the mouse liver leads to increased apoptosis in vivo and sensitization to TRAIL measured ex vivo. The induction of proliferation or apoptosis by Yap is modulated by tissue damage and inflammatory signals. This is analogous to the well-characterized functions of c-myc, which is also known induce proliferation or apoptosis, depending on growth factor availability (<a href=\"#bib20\">Evan et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harrington et al., 1994</a>).

                        "text": "YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice display many features described in other in vivo models of Yap induction, including increased proliferation, dedifferentiation, and activation of TEAD target genes. However, the unexpected phenotype unique to YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice is that the pro-growth effects of Yap are only manifested in a state of altered homeostasis, such as tissue injury or inflammation. These differences are unlikely to be due to an insufficient level of Yap expression, as a large number of genes are highly induced by Yap under steady-state conditions in YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice. One relevant difference may be mosaic vs tissue-wide Yap activation. We show that mosaic deletion of Mst2 in Mst1\u2212/\u2212 background does not lead to clonal expansion or liver size increase. Furthermore, in another mouse model recently reported by Camargo et al. (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yimlamai et al., 2014</a>) while this manuscript was under consideration, mosaic Yap activation in hepatocytes did not induce proliferation of clonal expansion in the first weeks. Instead, it promoted hepatocyte dedifferentiation into progenitors, which then expanded. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of Yap in hepatic progenitor cells is sufficient for clonal expansion but in mature hepatocytes it requires the second signal to drive proliferation. Another possible cause of different phenotypes may lie in different levels of inflammation between our mouse model and the whole liver transgenics. Of note, livers with a hepatocyte-specific ablation of Mst1/2 or Sav (both of which result in Yap activation) have elevated expression of immune response genes, including TNFa and IL-6 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lu et al., 2010</a>). Many variables may contribute to differences in systemic inflammation. One likely contributor is the intestinal microbiome composition, which varies greatly across mouse facilities (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bleich and Hansen, 2012</a>) and can induce inflammatory responses in the liver (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henao-Mejia et al., 2012</a>). Another source of inflammation in case of whole-liver Yap overexpression may be the disruption of systemic metabolism due to Yap-mediated repression of liver-specific genes ([<a href=\"#bib62\">Yimlamai et al., 2014</a>] and our RNA-sequencing analysis). As liver-specific genes are still expressed at normal levels in a large fraction of hepatocytes (Yap<sup>low</sup> cells), systemic metabolism is not compromised in YapKI<sup>Alb-Cre</sup> mice. It is therefore possible that the level of systemic inflammation is low in our mice, and this is why they require an exogenous inflammatory signal to enable Yap pro-growth effects. Inflammation is an essential component of carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011</a>) and anti-inflammatory treatments can inhibit aberrant proliferation and delay tumor development (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pribluda et al., 2013</a>). Inflammation can promote tumor development through multiple mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011</a>), including provision of a permissive signal for proliferation in the settings of disturbed homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bondar and Medzhitov, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pribluda et al., 2013</a>)."

These transcriptional targets of Yap appear to be the most common across many cell types and contexts of Yap activation; for example, the gene widely used as a hallmark of Yap activation is a matricellular growth factor CTGF. Since loss of cell contacts is known to activate Yap, it makes sense that Yap induces a restorative transcriptional program. Second, Yap strongly suppresses liver-specific genes in response to injury. Hepatocytes are known to downregulate liver-specific transcripts as they enter the cell cycle during liver regeneration (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ito et al., 1991</a>). Proliferation and tissue-specific activities are often segregated between progenitor and differentiated cells, especially in tissues with high cell turnover. This suggests that extensive proliferation may be generally incompatible with specialized tissue functions."

Furthermore, our data highlight the role of tissue microenvironment in the outcome of Yap activation and argue that during homeostasis, growth-promoting function of Yap in differentiated cells requires an additional signal, which may be provided by inflammation or injury."

The studies reported in this manuscript begin to reveal that additional cues are necessary for Yap to realize its full pro-proliferative power, and identifies built-in pro-apoptotic restrictive mechanisms. Overall, the manuscript nicely demonstrates the link between acute injury and liver cell repair responses in the YAP mosaic overexpression mice. Additionally, the interplay between proliferation and cell death is laid out clearly. Although the link between inflammation/injury and full blown YAP pathway activation is still somewhat underdeveloped, the concept is of enough novelty that it will be beneficial for this rather unique model, data, and concept describing YAP biology be published."

One possibility (among many) is that the Su et al. model results in less Yap activation than what was published in the literature, either due to different expression levels or protein activities. This interpretation would be consistent with the lower induction of several Yap target genes reported in the present manuscript compared to what was previously reported. For example, H19 and AFP were barely induced in the Su et al. model, but significantly induced in the <a href=\"#bib18\">Dong et al. (2007)</a> model. Given the Yimlamai et al. paper, it would be difficult for the authors to definitively draw the conclusion that mosaic Yap activation does not yield clonal expansion. What they can conclude is that under a condition in which Yap overexpression can drive the expression of at least some of the target genes, it is insufficient to drive clonal expansion."
