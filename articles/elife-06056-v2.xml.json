Random segregation of an extra chromosome is predicted to result in a high frequency of trisomic offspring from a trisomic parent. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> with trisomy of the X chromosome, however, have far fewer trisomic offspring than expected. We found that the extra X chromosome was preferentially eliminated during anaphase I of female meiosis. We utilized a mutant with a specific defect in pairing of the X chromosome as a model to investigate the apparent bias against univalent inheritance. First, univalents lagged during anaphase I and their movement was biased toward the cortex and future polar body. Second, late-lagging univalents were frequently captured by the ingressing polar body contractile ring. The asymmetry of female meiosis can thus partially correct pre-existing trisomy."

Random segregation of an extra chromosome is predicted to result in a high frequency of trisomic offspring from a trisomic parent. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> with trisomy of the X chromosome, however, have far fewer trisomic offspring than expected. We found that the extra X chromosome was preferentially eliminated during anaphase I of female meiosis. We utilized a mutant with a specific defect in pairing of the X chromosome as a model to investigate the apparent bias against univalent inheritance. First, univalents lagged during anaphase I and their movement was biased toward the cortex and future polar body. Second, late-lagging univalents were frequently captured by the ingressing polar body contractile ring. The asymmetry of female meiosis can thus partially correct pre-existing trisomy."

HIM-8 is a zinc finger protein that binds to specific DNA sequences that are enriched on the X chromosome. <i>him-8</i> mutants have a pairing defect that is completely specific for the X chromosome, resulting in two X univalents and five autosomal bivalents in 95% of diakinesis oocytes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>). If the two X univalents segregated randomly, <i>him-8</i> mutants would be expected to produce equal frequencies of nulloX ova and diploX ova. However, <a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al.

First, trisomic embryos might die during embryonic development resulting in undercounting of XXX offspring. This is unlikely in <i>C. elegans</i> because both XXX and <i>him-8</i> mutant mothers produce a very low frequency of dead embryos (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A second possibility is that mitotic non-disjunction in the XXX mother results in a mosaic gonad that contains both diploX and triploX oocytes. Selective apoptosis of XXX germ line cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bhalla and Dernburg, 2005</a>) would then enrich for XX germ line cells. This does not contribute to the segregation bias in <i>C. elegans</i>, as the most mature diakinesis oocytes in <i>him-8</i> and wild-type XXX worms have 7 rather than 6 DAPI-staining bodies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>; this study). A third possibility is that a univalent present during metaphase I or a single chromatid present during metaphase II would be broken or otherwise degraded during anaphase. A fourth possibility is that many XXX progeny look normal because of the stochastic nature of dosage compensation and thus are undercounted. A fifth possibility is that univalent chromosomes present at metaphase I are preferentially placed in the first polar body. Here, we demonstrate that indeed biased deposition of univalent X chromosomes into the first polar body reduces the frequency of trisomic zygotes resulting from oocytes with unpaired X chromosomes."

                                "text": "Elimination of the extra chromosome from an oocyte starting with a trisomy would result in rescue to a euploid state. It has previously been shown that <i>C. elegans</i> XXX wild-type oocytes have a paired bivalent X and an unpaired univalent X chromosome in pachytene (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goldstein, 1984</a>). We picked wild-type XXX adult hermaphrodites from the progeny of an XXX strain (AV494, <a href=\"#bib31\">Mlynarczyk-Evans et al., 2013</a>) based on their characteristic dumpy morphology as described by <a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al. (1979)</a>. Meiotic embryos from XXX mothers were fixed and stained for microtubules and DNA. Chromosomes are well separated by bundles of microtubules during <i>C. elegans</i> female meiotic metaphase. This unique morphology facilitates counting of individual chromosomes on the metaphase plate when viewed down the pole-to-pole axis of the spindle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We found that 100% of metaphase I meiotic embryos from XXX wild-type worms had 7 DAPI-staining bodies on the spindle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>), consistent with 6 bivalents and a single univalent X. Two chromosomes were labeled with an X-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe in these spindles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). This result shows that a mosaic gonad resulting from mitotic nondisjunction cannot explain the low frequency of XXX offspring from XXX worms. If the univalent segregated randomly during anaphase I, 50% of metaphase II spindles should have 6 DAPI-staining bodies (6 bivalents) and 50% should have 7 DAPI-staining bodies (6 bivalents and 1 univalent). Instead, 71% of metaphase II spindles contained only 6 DAPI-staining bodies and only 29% contained 7 DAPI-staining bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). These frequencies match the 2:1 ratio of X to XX ova previously interpreted from genetic studies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>) and are significantly different than the 50% expected from random segregation (one-tailed p = 0.004, Pearson's chi-squared test). This result eliminates the possibilities that XXX mothers have many XXX offspring that are undercounted due to incomplete penetrance of the XXX dumpy phenotype or that hermaphrodite nulloX sperm contributes significantly to the low frequency of XXX self-progeny. The finding that all assayed metaphase I spindles had 7 chromosomes also indicates that our method of identifying XXX worms as dumpy individuals is accurate and the high frequency of metaphase II spindles with 6 chromosomes is not a result of misidentifying diploid worms as XXX worms. FISH with an X-specific probe revealed that in 6/6 metaphase II embryos with only 6 DAPI-staining bodies, a single hybridization signal was present in the spindle and 2\u20133 hybridization signals were present in the polar body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Because only a single X-hybridization signal was observed in the first polar body in 5/5 spindles from diploids, these results demonstrate that single X univalents are deposited in the first polar body with greater than 50% frequency."

It has previously been shown that diakinesis stage <i>him-8</i> oocytes have 5 autosomal bivalents and two X univalents (<a href=\"#bib36\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>). If segregation of the two X univalents was random, these worms should produce equal numbers of nulloX and diploX ova. Instead, <i>him-</i>8 mutants produce a fivefold higher frequency of nulloX ova over diploX ova (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>), indicating that both maternal X univalents are lost at some time after diakinesis in a large fraction of embryos. To determine when maternal X univalents are preferentially lost, we imaged both live embryos within <i>him-8</i> worms expressing GFP::tubulin and mCherry::histone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013E</a>) and also fixed embryos stained with DAPI and anti-tubulin antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013J</a>). We assayed the number of chromosomes (defined here as DAPI-staining or mCherry:histone-positive bodies that would include univalents and bivalents) present at metaphase of meiosis I and II (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). At meiosis I metaphase, 7 chromosomes were present in 96% of <i>him-8</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,K</a>), with the remainder having 6 chromosomes. If the two univalents segregated randomly without losing cohesion, 25% of metaphase II spindles would be expected to have 5 autosomes and no X, 50% would have 5 autosomes and 1 X, and 25% would have 5 autosomes and 2 X chromosomes. Instead, 40% of <i>him-8</i> metaphase II embryos had 5 chromosomes, 55% had 6 chromosomes, and only 5% had 7 chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). These frequencies differ significantly from those expected from unbiased segregation (chi-square test, two-tailed p &lt; 0.0001), closely match the ratio of nulloX to diploX ova inferred by <a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al. (1979)</a> and support the hypothesis that the majority of X univalents are eliminated between metaphase I and metaphase II. These maternal chromosome counts are also unaffected by nulloX or diploX sperm that might contribute to phenotype-based progeny counts."

FISH revealed two X univalents and 7 total DAPI-staining bodies on 93% of all the <i>him-8</i> metaphase I plates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,L</a>). At metaphase II, FISH revealed at least two X hybridization foci in the first polar body and none on the metaphase plate when the spindle had 5 DAPI-staining bodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). When 6 DAPI-staining bodies were present on the metaphase II plate, we always observed one X hybridization focus each on the metaphase plate and in the first polar body (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Finally, metaphase II embryos containing 7 DAPI-staining bodies had two X hybridization foci on the metaphase plate and none in the first polar body (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that both achiasmate X univalents are deposited into the first polar body in 40% of <i>him-8</i> embryos as compared with the 25% expected from random segregation."

Unlike the situation with <i>him-8</i> and pairing of the X, redundancy between ZIM proteins may contribute to chromosome V pairing. Phillips and Dernburg reported only 72% of diakinesis oocytes with 7 rather than 6 DAPI-staining bodies in a <i>zim-2</i> mutant, and our <i>zim-2</i> strain with lacO(V) had only 62% of diakinesis oocytes with 7 DAPI-staining bodies (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). FISH revealed two distinct chromosome V hybridization foci and 7 DAPI-staining bodies on 41% of metaphase I spindles (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,E</a>). Starting with 41% achiasmate V's, random segregation should yield 10% of metaphase II embryos with both V's in the first polar body (25% of 41%). Instead, FISH revealed 27% of metaphase II embryos had five DAPI-staining bodies on the metaphase plate and chromosome V hybridization foci only in the first polar body (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,E</a>). Likewise, random segregation of achiasmate V's should yield 10% metaphase II spindles with 7 DAPI-staining bodies on the metaphase II spindle, two distinct chromosome V hybridization foci on the spindle, and none in the first polar body. Only 5% of this embryo class was observed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). These frequencies are significantly different than those expected from random segregation (chi-square test, two-tailed p &lt; 0.0002). The discrepancy in the fraction of <i>zim-2</i> oocytes with 7 DAPI-staining bodies at diakinesis vs metaphase I raises the possibility that chromosomes might be systematically undercounted in <i>zim-2</i> metaphase I spindles (but not in wild-type, <i>him-8</i>, or XXX metaphase I spindles). If this is the case, the two V univalents must be positioned close together on the spindle because 0/57 <i>zim-2</i> metaphase I plates with 6 DAPI-staining bodies had two widely spaced lacO(V) FISH foci and the deviation between expected and observed nulloV metaphase II spindles would be even greater. Two results strongly indicate that the same mechanisms acting on univalent X's in <i>him-8</i> mutants also act on V univalents in the <i>zim-2</i> mutant. First, the fivefold preponderance of metaphase II spindles with 5 DAPI-staining bodies over those with 7 DAPI-staining bodies is similar to <i>him-8</i>. Second, the presence of lacO FISH signal only in the first polar body of metaphase II embryos with 5 DAPI-staining bodies on the spindle is the same in <i>him-8</i> and <i>zim-2</i>. Thus, achiasmate autosomes, like achiasmate X chromosomes, are preferentially deposited into the first polar body."

Antibodies specific for the cohesin subunit, REC-8, label a cruciform on metaphase I bivalents (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) and a single band on metaphase II chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). The single REC-8 bands on wild-type metaphase II chromosomes and on <i>him-8</i> metaphase I univalents were both oriented perpendicular to the pole-to-pole axis of the spindle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), indicating that <i>him-8</i> X univalents biorient at metaphase I. <i>him-</i>8 worms expressing GFP::KNL-2, which labels the <i>C. elegans</i> cup-shaped meiotic kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dumont et al., 2010</a>), were also analyzed for biorientation and yielded the same conclusion as analysis by REC-8 antibody (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also examined the localization of GFP:AIR-2, the aurora B kinase that is essential for the loss of cohesion at anaphase I and which is loaded between homologs of wild-type bivalents in a chiasma-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rogers et al., 2002</a>). The fluorescence intensity of GFP::AIR-2 was 2.3 times higher on bivalents than univalents at metaphase I of <i>him-8</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). AIR-2 is normally re-loaded between sister chromatids at metaphase II. GFP::AIR-2 on metaphase II chromosomes was 1.7 times higher than on <i>him-8</i> metaphase I univalents (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), indicating that the reduced amount of AIR-2 on metaphase I univalents was not simply a consequence of the smaller size of a univalent relative to a bivalent. AIR-2 is required for the crossover dependent, prometaphase, partial removal of REC-8 from between homologs in a wild-type bivalent, an event proposed to be essential for loss of cohesion at anaphase I (<a href=\"#bib43\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). Consistent with the low levels of AIR-2, <i>him-8</i> univalents had 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 times the intensity of REC-8 staining as the inter-homolog region of bivalents in the same spindle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; n = 8 embryos, two-tailed p = 0.04, chi square relative to expected 1.0)."

Each lagging chromosome eventually moved as a single unit either toward the cortex or into the embryo in 98% of embryos (n = 179) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B, 5A</a>), indicating that cohesion between sister chromatids is maintained and that univalents are not broken or destroyed during anaphase. At anaphase II, only 10% of <i>him-8</i> embryos exhibited lagging chromosomes (n = 60) and 0/22 wild-type embryos had lagging chromosomes, suggesting that lagging chromosomes are caused by the presence of univalents at meiosis I."

To analyze this, we conducted time-lapse imaging of embryos from <i>him-8</i> worms expressing GFP::tubulin and mCherry::histone, as well as embryos from <i>him-8</i> worms expressing these along with GFP::PH (plextrin homology domain) to label the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Our time-lapse analysis revealed that 65% of lagging chromosomes eventually moved toward the cortex and the forming polar body of <i>him-8</i> embryos during anaphase I (n = 181) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that preferential expulsion of lagging univalents into the first polar body could contribute to the higher than random frequency of metaphase II spindles with 5 autosomes and no X. Because the polar body contractile ring ingresses inward toward the midpoint of the late anaphase spindle where it normally scissions, we hypothesized that the preferential resolution of lagging chromosomes toward the cortex might result from inhibition of contractile ring scission until the ring ingresses past lagging chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In wild type, ingression of the polar body contractile ring initiates when homologs have separated by 2.3 \u03bcm and polar body scission completes when homologs have separated by 5.6 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fabritius et al., 2011b</a>). The bias of univalents that moved toward the cortex before initiation of contractile ring ingression could not be caused by engulfment by the polar body. Therefore, we separated lagging univalents into two categories, early-resolving univalents that moved to one pole while the main chromosome masses were separated by less than 4.0 \u00b5m and late-resolving univalents that moved to one pole only after the main chromosome masses were separated by greater than 4.0 \u00b5m. If late-resolving univalents were engulfed during polar body formation, elimination of contractile ring activity would reduce the fraction of lagging chromosomes resolving toward the cortex. Indeed, RNAi depletion of the non-muscle myosin, NMY-2, which causes complete loss of cortical furrowing and polar body formation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fabritius et al., 2011b</a>), in <i>him-8</i> embryos resulted in a significant (p = 0.02) reduction in the percentage of late-lagging univalents resolving toward the cortex from 64% to 43% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

We previously showed that the depletion of the myosin phosphatase, MEL-11, doubled the rate of polar body ring ingression (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fabritius et al., 2011b</a>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the inactivation of MEL-11 might enhance the preferential engulfment of lagging univalents by the first polar body. Unlike NMY-2 depletion, which generates 100% dead embryos, the lethality of <i>mel-11</i> mutants is rescued by wild-type sperm so the chromosome constitution of progeny from a <i>mel-11</i> mother can be scored by phenotype. Mating otherwise wild-type males bearing the recessive X-linked marker, <i>lon-2</i>, to <i>him-8</i> hermaphrodites allows measurement of the frequency of nulloX ova (which give rise to lon male progeny) and diploX ova (which give rise to XXX dumpy progeny) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al., 1979</a>). Random segregation of univalents should generate a 1:1 ratio of nulloX:diploX ova. We found that <i>mel-11</i> increased the segregation bias of <i>him-8</i> by sevenfold from 3:1 to 23:1 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Septins are polymerizing GTPases that assemble in the contractile ring with myosin II, F-actin, and anillins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Green et al., 2013</a>). In wild type or <i>him-8</i> with early-resolving univalents, GFP:UNC-59 labeled a flat washer\u2013shaped contractile ring that moved down to the midpoint of the elongating anaphase spindle as reported previously for GFP:NMY-2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fabritius et al., 2011b</a>). The septin ring transformed into a tube (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, 255 s) as previously described for myosin and ANI-1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dorn et al., 2010</a>). When cortical furrowing relaxed at the end of telophase I, the septin tube moved outward to the embryo surface, then flopped over, and remained as a separate entity next to the chromosomes in the first polar body (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, 420 s). In 5/10 <i>him-8</i> embryos in which the septin-labeled ring reached the lagging univalent, the univalent was trapped in the septin tube and moved with the septin tube outward during cortical relaxation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In these cases, the univalent remained trapped in the septin tube adjacent to the polar body as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>. In 3/10 cases, the septin ring passed the univalent before the tube was formed, and in these cases, the univalent joined the main mass of chromatin in the polar body. In the 2/10 cases where the univalent did not end up in the polar body, the univalent slipped out of the septin tube into the embryo before the septin tube moved toward the embryo surface. These results are consistent with a model where the septin tube traps late-lagging univalents until scission occurs on the embryo side of the septin tube."

Septins act together with anillins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Green et al., 2013</a>). <i>C. elegans</i> has three anillins: ANI-1 that is required for polar body scission, ANI-2 that is required for gonad development, and ANI-3 that has no known function (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maddox et al., 2005</a>). We hypothesized that ANI-3 might play a non-essential structural role in the polar body septin tube and that <i>ani-3</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) might therefore allow late-lagging univalents to slip out of the tube back into the embryo. Indeed, RNAi of ANI-3 initiated on L4 <i>him-8</i> hermaphrodites (which have already completed spermatogenesis) significantly (p &lt; 0.001 binomial test) reduced the fraction of XO male progeny from 37% (n = 9 mothers, 1960 progeny) to 27% (n = 11 mothers, 2123 progeny), whereas <i>ani-3</i> (<i>RNAi</i>) had no significant effect on wild-type worms (wt: 0.04% XO, 1% dead, n = 11 mothers; <i>ani-3</i> [<i>RNAi</i>]: 0.05% XO, 1% dead, n = 17 mothers).

These were resolved toward the cortex 64% of the time (n = 72), and NMY-2 depletion had no significant effect on this class of embryos (p = 0.8) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These results suggest that an additional mechanism biasing univalent movement toward the cortex might be at work earlier in the cell cycle. During wild-type meiosis, bivalents congress to the metaphase plate on an 8-\u00b5m long spindle that is oriented parallel to the cortex. Upon anaphase promoting complex activation, the meiosis I spindle shortens to 4.8 \u03bcm in length (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2003</a>), then one spindle pole moves to the cortex in a dynein-dependent manner, and homolog separation initiates (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ellefson and McNally, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2011</a>). We found that univalents were misaligned toward the spindle poles in fixed <i>him-8</i> embryos at late metaphase I, when the meiotic spindle is shortened but not yet rotated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>). In 46% of these embryos, both univalents were misaligned toward the same pole (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), close to the 50% expected from random positioning. In fixed <i>him-8</i> embryos at the onset of anaphase, when spindles are shortened and rotated but chromosomes are not yet separated, 57% had one or both univalents closer to the cortical pole (38 + 19%; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). No embryos had both univalents closer to the interior spindle pole. We hypothesized that one of two mechanisms might link spindle rotation with the early anaphase preference for univalent movement toward the cortex. Univalents might stochastically align closer to one spindle pole before rotation and bias the movement of that pole to the cortex. Alternatively, the cortex-proximal pole might acquire distinct biochemical properties after rotation due to cortical contact and subsequently generate more pulling force on the lagging univalents and pull them preferentially toward the cortex."

If offset univalents bias spindle rotation or if the cortex-proximal pole exerts greater pulling on univalents after rotation, then a <i>mei-2</i>(<i>ct98</i>) <i>him-8</i> double mutant should have a reduced frequency of male progeny relative to <i>him-8</i> alone. At 20\u00b0C, the <i>mei-2</i>(<i>ct98</i>) <i>him-8</i> double mutant produced only 21% male progeny (n = 1440 progeny from 14 parents), which is significantly less than the 36% male progeny produced by the <i>him-8</i> single mutant (n = 964 progeny from 8 parents; p &lt; 0.0001 by one-tailed binomial test) and is significantly different than <i>mei-2</i> (<i>ct98</i>) alone (0% males; n = 925 progeny from 8 parents). The reduction in male progeny is unlikely to be due to effects on spermatogenesis, as sperm is unaffected by katanin-null mutants (<a href=\"#bib25a\">Mains et al., 1990</a>). This result is consistent with either spindle rotation-based models for the early anaphase segregation bias.

In 6/8 of these cases, the univalent-proximal pole rotated to the cortex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I,H</a>). In 1/8 cases, the univalent-proximal pole rotated away from the cortex. In 1/8 cases, the two univalents were offset to opposite poles both before and during rotation. If the cortical environment conferred a stronger pulling force on the cortical pole after rotation, then lagging univalents crossing the midpoint of the anaphase spindle should be common. Time-lapse imaging of spindles after rotation revealed that among 30 embryos in which one or two lagging chromosomes were already positioned closer to one pole at anaphase I onset and the lagging chromosome resolved early, the lagging chromosome resolved toward the pole that it was already close to in 80% of these embryos (data not shown). Among the 20% of embryos in which the lagging chromosome moved to the opposite pole after spindle rotation, the chromosome moved toward the cortex 3 times, toward the embryo 3 times, and in one instance, the two lagging chromosomes resolved to opposite poles. These observations are not consistent with a cortical pole that generates a stronger pulling force after rotation but instead favor the idea that the offset position of univalents before rotation increases the probability that the univalent-proximal pole will move to the cortex."

(1979)</a> showed that <i>C. elegans</i> that are trisomic for the X chromosome or that fail to form a chiasma between the normal two X homologs have fewer trisomic offspring than expected from random segregation. Our results explain this phenomenon by demonstrating that two cellular pathways preferentially segregate X univalents into the first polar body. Mechanisms reducing the frequency of trisomic offspring have not been investigated in other model organisms because in both mouse and <i>Drosophila</i>, animals with trisomy X are not fertile (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schupbach et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tada et al., 1993</a>), and there are no mutants, like <i>him-8</i>, that specifically block crossover formation on one specific chromosome in females. However, women with trisomy 21 or trisomy X are often fertile and have been reported to have more than 50% euploid offspring (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bovicelli et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Neri, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ratcliffe et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Robinson et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Stewart et al., 1991</a>). Triploid oysters provide a stronger example of apparent female-specific correction to a diploid state. Eggs produced by triploid females and fertilized with sperm from diploid males result in 57% diploid, 31% triploid, and 12% aneuploid offspring, whereas eggs produced by diploids and fertilized by sperm from triploids result in 15% diploid and 85% aneuploid offspring (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gong et al., 2004</a>). Gaging the likelihood that the phenomenon described here for <i>C. elegans</i> might be relevant to trisomic humans or triploid oysters is complicated by two issues. In contrast with trisomic <i>C. elegans</i>, triploid oysters (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo and Allen, 1994</a>) and trisomic human oocytes sometimes form trivalent structures rather than a separate bivalent and univalent. Only 42\u201316% of diplotene oocytes from fetuses with trisomy 21, trisomy 13, or trisomy 18 exhibited a separate bivalent and univalent (<a href=\"#bib40\">Roig et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Robles et al., 2007</a>). It is difficult to predict the behavior of trivalents on the spindle. In addition, it is not clear whether a univalent present during anaphase I of a human or oyster oocyte would be more likely to move to one pole intact as in <i>C. elegans</i> or to separate equationally. We speculate that single chromatids resulting from equational separation of univalents at anaphase I could be subjected to asymmetric segregation at anaphase II. Our results suggest that any chromosome that lags during late anaphase might be prefentially expelled simply due to the conserved asymmetric nature of polar body formation."

In the case of diploid oocytes with two univalent autosomes, however, 100% efficient expulsion of univalents into the first polar body would increase the frequency of lethal monosomy.

Thus, the efficiency of placing univalents in the first polar body has evolved to a point that corrects trisomy without reducing the frequency of haploid eggs produced from oocytes that failed to form a chiasma between one pair of homologs. The conservation of these mechanisms in other species will have to be elucidated by studies focused specifically on the concept of chromosomal errors that are corrected, rather than caused, by female meiotic spindles."

Worms were then gently crushed between the slide and a 25-mm sq. #1 coverslip to extrude meiotic embryos and immediately submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10\u201315 min. Coverslips were then flicked off to freeze-crack eggshells, and slides were submerged in \u221220\u00b0C methanol for 20\u201330 min. Slides were then washed in 1\u00d7 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice for 10 min and then in 1\u00d7 PBST (PBS with 0.2% Tween-20) for 10 min. Slides were then blocked in 1\u00d7 PBST with 4% bovine serum albumen (BSA) for 30\u201345 min at room temperature in a moist chamber. Blocking solution was wicked away being careful not to dry out the samples, and FITC-conjugated DM1a was applied 1:30 in 1\u00d7 PBST with 4% BSA using 20 \u03bcl coverwells (Grace BioLabs). Slides were incubated in this antibody for 4 hr at room temperature or left overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were then washed sequentially in 1\u00d7 PBST, 1\u00d7 PBS, and 2\u00d7 SSCT (saline sodium citrate buffer with 0.4% Tween-20) for 10 min each. Following the last wash, slides underwent secondary fixation in 7% formaldehyde in 1\u00d7 egg buffer for 5 min and were immediately dipped in 2\u00d7 SSCT to wash off fixative. Slides were then washed in 2\u00d7 SSCT twice for 5 min each and then pre-hybridized. Pre-hybridization was performed by adding 200 \u03bcl of 50% formamide in 2\u00d7 SSCT with a 200 \u03bcl coverwell (Grace BioLabs) overnight at 37\u00b0C in a moist chamber. After 24 hr, slides were taken out of 37\u00b0C incubation and placed at room temperature while the FISH probe was prepared. The FISH probe was prepared by adding 0.6 \u03bcl of the stock (900 ng/\u03bcl) to 30 \u03bcl of hybridization buffer (hybridization buffer was made as described in <a href=\"#bib35\">Phillips et al., 2009</a>) with 300 \u03bcl/ml salmon sperm DNA and 0.1% Tween-20 per slide. Slides were then incubated in 30 \u03bcl of this solution under a hybridization slip (Grace BioLabs) at 95\u00b0C for 3 min on an OmniSlide (Thermo Scientific) and then at 37\u00b0C in a moist chamber for 48\u201372 hr. Following this incubation, slides were washed in 50% formamide in 2\u00d7 SSCT as before but for two 1-hr incubations. Finally, slides were stained with DAPI by submerging in a Coplin jar filled with 2\u00d7 SSCT 6 \u03bcg/ml DAPI for 10 min and were then washed for 30 min in fresh 2\u00d7 SSCT. Slides were then wicked dry with a Kimwipe taking care not to dry out the sample and were mounted with 8 \u03bcl of DABCO Mowiol and sealed with nail polish. Following 2\u20133 days for curing, slides were imaged."

The direction of resolution was determined from the last frame where the lagging chromosome was still discernable from the segregating chromosome masses. At this frame, spindle length was determined by measuring the distance between the outside edges of the main masses of segregating chromosomes. Lagging chromosomes that decided which way to go when the spindle was more than 4 \u03bcm long were classified as late resolving because earlier work indicated that myosin-dependent polar body scission occurs when spindles are longer than 4 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fabritius et al., 2011b</a>). We confirmed this assumption by finding that 5/5 FM232 (GFP:PH) spindles longer than 4 \u03bcm exhibited deep cortical furrows."

The FISH analysis leaves no doubt that the unpaired chromosome is the one being asymmetrically distributed during meiosis I. However, the major contributing factor to the asymmetry appears to be the inability of unpaired chromosomes to lose cohesion during meiosis I. This aspect needs to be paid greater attention as it is arguably a prerequisite for any type of asymmetric distribution to occur. Given recent work from the Meyer lab, the most likely explanation for this is that in the absence of recombination the cohesion is largely comprised of complexes containing Rec8 (deposited during pre-meiotic S-phase), which are more difficult to cleave in meiosis I (on bivalents, the axis of cohesion loss during meiosis I that is defined by crossovers has primarily Coh3/4-containing cohesion; Rec8 and Coh3/4 are different kleisin subunits of the cohesion complex that are employed during meiosis). Another explanation is that the lack of chiasma somehow reduces Aurora B loading onto the chromosome axis and prior work has shown that Aurora B is important for segregation. A supplementary figure shows reduced Aurora B on univalents in meiosis I compared to bivalents and also compared to paired sister chromatids in meiosis II. As mutants in Rec8 show equational division and form viable triploids (when mated to a wild-type male), I suspect the former may be the reason that the unpaired X chromosomes do not show equational meiosis I. Thus, it is not the \u201casymmetry of female meiosis\u201d but the \u201cinability to dissolve meiotic cohesion and the asymmetry of female meiosis\u201d that is at play here. To address this point, we suggest the following experiment:"

One additional issue here is that sperm meiotic defects are not accounted for in the phenotypic outcomes. It would help if the author used FISH to analyze X chromosomes in sperm nuclei and quantitatively relate the combination of their oocyte and sperm analysis to the phenotypic outcome. There may also be some clever genetic way to fertilize with a male that only delivers an X chromosome; this would be even better."

Because removal of the AIR-2 inhibitors, HTP-1/2, from the short arms requires a crossover (Martinez-Perez et al., 2008), it is expected that <i>him-8</i> univalents might have both reduced amounts of AIR-2 and increased amounts of REC-8 relative to the short arms of a bivalent. These are not two mutually exclusive possibilities but rather integrally related consequences of a crossover failure. We have added analysis of the fluorescence intensity of REC-8 staining on <i>him-8</i> univalents relative to the short-arms of bivalents within the same spindle, along with a citation of <a href=\"#bib43\">Severson and Meyer (2014)</a> who showed that this would be expected when there is reduced AIR-2. We have not added FISH analysis of <i>rec-8 him-8</i> double mutants because this would provide limited new insight. Because <i>rec-8</i> mutants produce mostly 12 univalents, it is a relatively weak hypothesis that <i>rec-8 him-8</i> would be different than <i>rec-8</i> alone. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> in Severson and Meyer (2009) clearly shows that there is no bias toward eliminating univalents at anaphase I in <i>rec-8</i> mutants. We agree with the reviewers that univalents that biorient and lose cohesion at anaphase I are likely to show no segregation bias at anaphase I. We believe that equational separation of univalents at anaphase I leaves open the possibility of biased (or random) segregation of single chromatids at anaphase II (this was already stated in our Introduction and is now stated in the Discussion). This cannot be studied in <i>rec-8</i> because the second polar body is not formed (Severson and Meyer, 2009)."

Our FISH analysis of male pronuclei (distinguishable from female pronuclei by the presence of centrosomes) in the self progeny of <i>him-8</i> hermaphrodites revealed 90% haploX, 8% nulloX sperm and 2% diplo X sperm (n=52). This agrees with genetic results in <a href=\"#bib17\">Hodgkin et al.
