K-fibers are composed of many microtubules that are held together throughout their length. Here we show, using 3D electron microscopy, that K-fiber microtubules are connected by a network of microtubule connectors. We term this network 'the mesh'. The K-fiber mesh is made of linked multipolar connectors. Each connector has up to four struts, so that a single connector can link up to four microtubules. Molecular manipulation of the mesh by overexpression of TACC3 causes disorganization of the K-fiber microtubules. Optimal stabilization of K-fibers by the mesh is required for normal progression through mitosis. We propose that the mesh stabilizes K-fibers by pulling MTs together and thereby maintaining the integrity of the fiber. Our work thus identifies the K-fiber meshwork of linked multipolar connectors as a key integrator and determinant of K-fiber structure and function."
