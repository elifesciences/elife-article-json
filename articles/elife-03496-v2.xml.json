Recent studies suggest that levels of ROS generated as a byproduct of oxidative folding rival those produced by mitochondrial respiration. Mechanisms that protect cells against oxidant accumulation within the ER have begun to be elucidated yet many questions still remain regarding how cells prevent oxidant-induced damage from ER folding events. Here we report a new role for a central well-characterized player in ER homeostasis as a direct sensor of ER redox imbalance. Specifically we show that a conserved cysteine in the lumenal chaperone BiP is susceptible to oxidation by peroxide, and we demonstrate that oxidation of this conserved cysteine disrupts BiP's ATPase cycle. We propose that alteration of BiP activity upon oxidation helps cells cope with disruption to oxidative folding within the ER during oxidative stress."

In these cells, Wang et al. observed that the high levels of reactive oxygen species caused part of a chaperone molecule called BiP to oxidize. This modification of BiP acts like a switch that the reactive oxygen species flip on. When activated by the reactive oxygen species, BiP enhances its activity as a folding molecular chaperone, keeping proteins apart. This is thought to allow BiP to minimize the protein misfolding that may otherwise occur in the wake of the damage caused by the building levels of peroxide. Wang et al. created a mutant BiP chaperone that mimics the oxidized form, and found that it also protects cells from the damage inflicted by the excess of reactive oxygen species."

Ero1 is a primary enzymatic catalyst of biosynthetic disulfide bonds (<a href=\"#bib2\">Araki and Inaba, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ramming and Appenzeller-Herzog, 2012</a>). A byproduct of Ero1 activity is peroxide, a ROS. Studies with recombinant Ero1 demonstrate that for every disulfide bond generated by Ero1 a peroxide molecule is formed (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tu and Weissman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gross et al., 2006</a>). Extrapolating from these in vitro results, it is estimated that Ero1 activity in living cells could generate up to 25% of the cellular ROS produced during protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tu and Weissman, 2004</a>). Fluorescent probes that measure ROS in living cells indicate that the amount of ROS in the ER lumen exceeds the quantity of ROS within the mitochondria, a substantial and well-characterized source of intracellular ROS (<a href=\"#bib26\">Malinouski et al., 2011</a>)."

These enzymes enhance the efficiency of oxidative protein folding by coupling peroxide reduction with oxidation of the disulfide-bond forming enzyme PDI, ultimately converting peroxide generated as a byproduct of disulfide bond formation into additional nascent chain disulfides (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tavender et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zito et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nguyen et al., 2011</a>). We expect these identified detoxification pathways operate within the ER alongside additional and more general systems conserved across eukaryotes that remain to be elucidated. Lower eukaryotes maintain robust Ero1-dependent protein oxidation pathways that produce ROS, however these organisms do not contain homologs of either mammalian PDRX4 or GPx7/8."

Regulation of Ero1 activity normally serves to maintain redox homeostasis in the ER lumen and helps to moderate the amount of ROS produced by Ero1. Disruption of the Ero1 feedback loop (de-regulation of Ero1) is detrimental to the ER redox environment, resulting in severe redox imbalance in the ER and oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sevier et al., 2007</a>). We took advantage of the ROS generated by overproduction of a de-regulated, constitutively active mutant of Ero1 (Ero1-C150A-C295A; hereafter referred to as Ero1*) to identify cellular systems activated in response to an overabundance of ER ROS."

We show that modification of BiP decouples the ATPase and peptide-binding activities of BiP, disrupting the normal allostery between these domains. We propose that oxidation of BiP during conditions of increased ER ROS both enhances the ability of BiP to bind polypeptides and prevents consumption of cellular ATP by hydrolysis. We suggest that this conserved ROS-sensing mechanism has evolved to protect against oxidative stress in the ER by minimizing protein aggregation and maintaining ER folding homeostasis during conditions of excess ROS."

This cysteine is localized within the ATP-binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and is the sole cysteine in yeast BiP (Kar2 Cys63). To probe the role of this conserved cysteine, we replaced the cysteine in yeast BiP with alanine and found that the cysteine is not required for the essential cellular function of BiP. Specifically, we observed that a <i>kar2-C63A</i> allele can complement an otherwise inviable <i>KAR2</i> chromosomal deletion strain (<i>kar2\u0394</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Viability of the cysteine-less Kar2 strain was not a consequence of upregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has the potential to compensate for decreased Kar2 function through a transcription-mediated increase in Kar2 levels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beh and Rose, 1995</a>). As evidence, an UPR-promoter element (UPRE)-<i>lacZ</i> reporter showed a similar basal level of UPR induction for both wild-type and <i>kar2-C63A</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). BiP is not only a target of the UPR but also modulates UPR induction (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pincus et al., 2010</a>). Replacement of the BiP cysteine with alanine did not perturb the UPR response; treatment with the reductant dithiothreitol (DTT), which disrupts disulfide bond formation and causes unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER lumen, resulted in a comparable UPR induction in both wild-type and <i>kar2-C63A</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

A Kar2-C63W allele could not support growth of a chromosomal deletion of <i>KAR2</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>); Kar2-C63D, Kar2-C63F and Kar2-C63Y mutants were viable but temperature sensitive for growth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). BiP normally facilitates nascent chain translocation into the ER lumen. Decreased polypeptide translocation into the ER was observed for the Kar2-C63D, Kar2-C63F, and Kar2-C63Y strains after a 90 min shift to 37\u00b0C, further corroborating a loss of vital BiP activity for these cysteine substitution mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), Untranslocated polypeptides were readily detected by the accumulation of precursor protein forms (pre-Kar2, pre-PDI, Gas1 precursor) that lack the characteristic size shifts associated with post-translational processing that occurs after translocation into the ER lumen, including signal sequence processing, glycosylation (PDI, Gas1), and GPI anchor addition (Gas1) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In keeping with a loss of vital BiP activity and disruption of the ER folding environment, an approximately fivefold induction of the UPR was observed in the Kar2-C63D/F/Y strains at both permissive (24\u00b0C) and restrictive (37\u00b0C) temperatures relative to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). UPR levels in the mutant strains at 37\u00b0C were comparable to those observed in cells treated with DTT, an established robust inducer of the UPR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Significantly, the phenotypes observed for Kar2-C63D, Kar2-C63F, and Kar2-C63Y alleles contrast markedly the Kar2-C63A mutant, which showed wild-type activity with respect to growth, protein translocation, and UPR activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and afforded no protection against oxidative stress (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Note the ability of the loss-of-function Kar2-C63D/F/Y/W alleles to rescue the cell death phenotype from Ero1* overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) was observed at 37\u00b0C, the temperature at which none of these alleles are viable as the sole copy of cellular BiP."

To assess whether oxidation of BiP impedes polypeptide translocation, we checked if cells overexpressing Ero1* accumulate unprocessed untranslocated precursor proteins, which show characteristic size shifts on SDS-PAGE. We observed that Ero1* overproduction results in an inhibition of protein translocation, which was most striking when Ero1* was overproduced in a sensitized strain background (an <i>ire1\u0394</i> strain) that is unable to induce the UPR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). A robust translocation block was not as reproducible in wild-type (<i>IRE1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>) cells, yet we did observe precursor protein accumulation in some assays using a wild-type strain background, which was dependent both on Ero1* overexpression and the presence of the Kar2 cysteine (e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, pre-Kar2 accumulation). We speculate the <i>ire1\u0394</i> background facilitates a robust translocation block because there is no transcriptional upregulation of <i>KAR2</i> upon Ero1*-induction (due to the loss of a UPR response) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sevier et al., 2007</a>). Lower levels of BiP in the <i>ire1\u0394</i> strain may result in a higher fraction of modified BiP upon Ero1* expression, which may lead to a more dramatic impact on ER translocation."

Together these data suggest BiP modification may account for the observed translocation attenuation; however, at present we are unable to definitively link BiP oxidation with a block in polypeptide translocation. Attempts to facilitate a robust translocation block in wild-type cells with exogenous oxidant (diamide or CHP), or a combination of oxidant (Ero1*, diamide, CHP) and heat (37\u00b0C), have been unsuccessful; none of these conditions stimulate a robust reproducible translocation attenuation in wild-type cells. Experiments to study the role of the BiP cysteine in an <i>ire1\u0394</i> background, where we do observe a strong translocation attenuation, have also been uninformative. To test the role of the BiP cysteine, we constructed a <i>kar2-C63A ire1\u0394</i> double mutant overexpressing Ero1*, which would be expected to show a less pronounced translocation block if BiP oxidation triggers translocation attenuation. Although viable, a <i>kar2-C63A ire1\u0394</i> double mutant exhibits heterogeneous colony size and slow growth, and experiments to study translocation attenuation during oxidative stress with this strain have produced inconsistent results."

When a solution of reduced and chemically denatured rhodanese is rapidly diluted out of denaturant, rhodanese forms large aggregates that can be detected by light scattering (<a href=\"#bib21\">Langer et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Significantly, we observed that the presence of the ATPase-deficient Kar2 cysteine-substitution alleles (Kar2-C63D/F/Y/W) during dilution not only lessened aggregation (minimized light scattering) of denatured rhodanese but also was more effective than wild-type BiP at minimizing rhodanese aggregation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). An enhanced capacity to prevent aggregation relative to wild-type BiP was observed as well for oxidized BiP (peroxide treated; Kar2-SOH) and alkylated BiP (Kar2-NEM) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Treatment of a Kar2-C63A mutant with peroxide or NEM did not enhance its ability to lessen aggregation of rhodanese, demonstrating that the enhanced capacity to limit aggregation correlates with modification of the BiP cysteine (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). Notably, the ATPase-deficient Kar2-T249G mutant (which did not enhance growth of cells during oxidative stress; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) did not show an enhanced ability to prevent aggregation of rhodanese (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), supporting a correlation between a greater holdase capacity of BiP and enhanced viability during oxidative stress. It is worth pointing out that at the concentrations used in our assay, addition of wild-type, Kar2-C63A, and Kar2-T249G mutants did not allow for significant aggregation protection; the presence of any of these three proteins at the time of dilution resulted in light scattering comparable to the light scattering observed by rhodanese diluted into a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Assays with a second model substrate, IgY, showed similar trends. Kar2-C63F/Y and alkylated BiP (Kar2-NEM) showed a greater ability to curtail IgY aggregation than wild-type Kar2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). Kar2-C63D and Kar2-C63W were prone to aggregation at high temperature (required for IgY aggregation), and we were unable to assess their activity in the IgY assay (data not shown)."

Biochemical assays of oxidized and alkylated BiP, as well as assays of BiP cysteine-substitution alleles that mimic oxidized BiP, indicate that modification of the BiP cysteine alters BiP chaperone activity, such that ATPase activity is inhibited while avidity of binding to misfolded proteins is increased.

A primary outcome of oxidative stress is oxidative damage to proteins, including the mispairing of cysteine residues to form non-native disulfide bonds as well as the oxidation of cysteine thiols with small molecules, which prevents disulfide bond formation. These oxidized proteins are unlikely to be able to fold properly until ER conditions are returned to a less oxidized state. We suggest that activation of a redox switch in BiP upon ROS accumulation in the ER converts BiP from a chaperone driven by ATP hydrolysis to a high avidity polypeptide holdase. An enhanced capacity for oxidized BiP to bind polypeptides may serve to maintain proteins in a folding-competent state until the ER returns to a more reduced status. Upon restoration of a more reduced ER environment, reduction of BiP would reestablish BiP activity as an ATP-driven chaperone to facilitate protein folding through its binding and release of polypeptides. Inactivation of ATPase activity for a pool of BiP upon oxidation may additionally benefit cells by limiting ATP turnover during oxidative stress. In the absence of modification, BiP has the potential to consume ATP while carrying out futile chaperone cycles of binding and release from polypeptides locked into non-native states by covalent bonds; inactivation of BiP ATPase activity would limit hydrolysis of cellular ATP as a byproduct of futile folding cycles. Finally, inhibition of the translocation activity of BiP under hyper-oxidizing conditions could decrease the flux of nascent polypeptides into the ER further decreasing the burden on the ER folding machinery (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We are unable to definitively link translocation attenuation with BiP modification due to the lack of a measurable translocation defect in wild-type cells under ER oxidative stress. Yet these data do not preclude a more modest decrease in polypeptide flux during oxidative stress; note we do not anticipate all BiP becomes modified during oxidative stress, which is consistent with the lack of a complete translocation block during stress."

Recently mammalian BiP was established as a main player in an oxidative stress response pathway initiated by activation (oxidation) of GPx7 (NPGPx) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). Wei et al. reported that GPx7 acts as a direct sensor of cellular ROS, and they propose that oxidized GPx7 catalyzes the formation of an intramolecular BiP Cys41-Cys420 disulfide. Similar to what we observed upon BiP oxidation, Wei et al. show that formation of an intramolecular BiP disulfide enhances the ability of BiP to bind denatured luciferase in vitro. Notably, GPx7 and the disulfide-bonded cysteines in BiP are found only in mammals and not in other eukaryotes (yeast BiP has one cysteine), suggesting the GPx7-BiP signaling pathway is likely unique to mammalian cells. Yet it is significant that in their study Wei et al. observed in vitro treatment of recombinant mammalian BiP with peroxide facilitated not only the Cys41-Cys420 disulfide but also a sulfonic acid (\u2212SO<sub>3</sub>H) at Cys41, which corresponds to Kar2 Cys63 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wei et al., 2012</a>).

For example, in vitro alkylation of the three cysteines in the cytosolic yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 triggers a loss of ATPase activity and augments the capacity of Ssa1 to prevent aggregation of denatured luciferase (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hermawan and Chirico, 1999</a>). Cys15 in Ssa1 is equivalent to the conserved BiP cysteine, and changes in chaperone activity for alkylated Ssa1 could occur through a mechanism similar to what we describe for BiP. Alternatively, the mechanism may be distinct from what we describe for BiP and make use of the other two Ssa1 cysteine residues; indeed, precedent exists for a redox-sensing role for Ssa1 Cys264 and Cys303 (but not Cys15) in the derepression of Hsf1 in response to a variety of thiol-reactive compounds (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Irreversible inhibition of the Hsp70 ATPase activity of mammalian Hsp70 (HSPA1A) has been shown to occur upon oxidation of the same two cysteines with methylene blue (<a href=\"#bib29\">Miyata et al., 2012</a>). Intriguingly, a separate study reported that the in vitro acquisition of peptides by cytosolic Hsp70 is enhanced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, raising the possibility that ATPase and chaperone activities of Hsp70 may also be decoupled by oxidation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Callahan et al., 2002</a>). To the best of our knowledge our study shows the first example of an Hsp70 modified by endogenous ROS; given the reported susceptibility of numerous Hsp70s to oxidation by exogenous oxidants it will be exciting to determine if and what endogenous oxidants are sensed by the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Hsp70s."

Oxidation of Cys15 in the bacterial Hsp70 DnaK (equivalent to Kar2 Cy63) has been demonstrated to occur when bacteria are exposed to exogenous oxidants at elevated temperatures (<a href=\"#bib51\">Winter et al., 2005</a>). Markedly distinct from what we observe for BiP, oxidant exposure inhibits DnaK's ability to prevent luciferase aggregation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Winter et al., 2005</a>). Although modification of the DnaK cysteine is detected in cells exposed to oxidant, a DnaK-C15A mutant shows the same oxidant-induced loss of activity as wild-type DnaK, suggesting that cysteine oxidation may contribute to but does not account for the inactivation of DnaK chaperone activity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Winter et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, the inactivation of DnaK during oxidative stress occurs concurrently with oxidant-induced activation of holdase activity for the general chaperone Hsp33 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Winter et al., 2005</a>). Thus oxidative stress appears to evoke similar functional outcomes in both bacteria and eukaryotes (loss of Hsp70 ATP-dependent chaperone activity and enhanced holdase capacity), but in eukaryotes this can be achieved through a switch in BiP activity alone whereas in bacteria this outcome is a product of altered activities for a coupled DnaK-Hsp33 system."

Sulfenic acid at the site of the cysteine is unlikely itself to physically block ATP entry into the cleft; it seems more likely that cysteine oxidation will perturb the surrounding residues, which in turn may alter residues necessary for ATP positioning or hydrolysis, leading to decreased ATPase activity. It is well established that the nucleotide and peptide binding domains of BiP are allosterically coupled; nucleotide binding and hydrolysis modulates both the structure of the peptide binding domain and its affinity for polypeptides (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zuiderweg et al., 2013</a>).

Our experiments detect only a small fraction of BiP isolated from cells in an oxidized state; we estimate recovery of less than 1% of the total isolated BiP in a modified form. Low yields of oxidized cellular BiP species have limited our ability to use mass spectrometry for conclusive identification of any additional modifications. It is worth noting that the limited recovery of oxidized BiP from cells likely reflects the difficulty in preserving oxidized thiols, which are prone to reduction during lysate preparation. We speculate that a pool of modified BiP, greater than the recovered 1%, exists in cells during oxidative stress; indeed, it is difficult to envision that a 1% pool of oxidized BiP in wild-type cells during oxidative stress could account for the striking growth difference between the wild-type and <i>kar2-C63A</i> strains during oxidative ER stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

The efficacy of the BiP-C63F/Y/W alleles may reflect the ability of these larger amino acid side chains to mimic BiP glutathiolation and protection.

Although the UPR was originally designated as a stress response system based on its importance during acute stress, it is now appreciated that the UPR plays crucial roles in maintaining ER plasticity and function under normal growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moore and Hollien, 2012</a>). Similarly, we propose that BiP oxidation likely influences cell growth and development in the absence of extreme redox imbalance. Notably, modified BiP was detectable even in the absence of Ero1* overproduction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), consistent with a role for BiP oxidation not only during stress but also during non-stressed growth conditions. Increased ROS content within the ER as a consequence of enhanced secretory capacity could increase the pool of oxidized BiP to help maintain secretory protein dynamics. Assays similar to those described herein should enable future studies of yeast and mammalian BiP oxidation under non-stress conditions."

Plasmids pCS623 and pCS681 show identical phenotypes in yeast. To create pCS757 and pCS760, a FLAG epitope (DNA sequence: GGAGATTATAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGGT) was inserted by two-step fusion PCR immediately prior to the DNA sequence in <i>KAR2</i> encoding for the HDEL retrieval signal. pCS584 was made by placing a \u223c2.4 kb <i>CAN1</i> fragment into pRS316, and then replacing an EcoRI-SpeI piece within <i>CAN1</i> with an EcoRI-SpeI fragment from pCS452.

Although enzymes have been identified in higher eukaryotes to aid in their neutralization, they do not appear to exist in lower eukarotes including yeast. In this study a novel mechanism for sensing and responding to hyper-oxidation of the ER is described, which involves oxidation of the single cysteine in Kar2 found in the nucleotide binding domain. Although direct detection of this modification was not possible, convincing data are obtained through employing a thiol-switch assay and a variety of Kar2 mutants. Oxidation of this cysteine dramatically reduces Kar2p ATPase activity as do several \u201cbulky residue\u201d substitutions at this site, which are argued to mimic cysteine modifications. Due to their defective ATPase activity, these mutants cannot substitute for loss of Kar2p but they complement yeast bearing a C63A mutant, which cannot be modified in response to hyper-oxidation of the ER by ERO1*, as well as wild-type Kar2. Similar to other Kar2 ATPase mutants reported previously, these mutants are defective in translocation of protein into the ER at non-permissive temperature, and additional data reveal they are even better at preventing the aggregation of denatured rhodanese that wild-type Kar2, which leads them to conclude that oxidation of Kar2 under hyper-oxidizing conditions results in Kar2 acting as a holdase to prevent aggregation of existing proteins and to inhibit new proteins from entering the ER thus serving a double beneficial role. The ability to modify Kar2 activity, as opposed to simply changing levels in response to a stress is a very intriguing finding and given the fact that the same cysteine in mammalian was recently shown to be reactive allows one to speculate that this mechanism may be conserved for other ER Hsp70s."

I am convinced this idea is likely to be correct, but the choice of the Kar2 ATPase mutant used might have prevented a clean link to this point. The T249G mutant that was used cannot hydrolyze ATP, which is included in the assay and thus doesn't lock onto the substrate, and the wild-type Kar2 would likely be continuously released. A better choice might be either the G246D or G247D mutants that do not bind nucleotide and thus remain in the substrate-locked position. Both of these have been reported to prevent translocation in yeast. Another choice would be a mutant corresponding to mammalian T37G, which does not undergo the requisite conformation change upon nucleotide binding."

When the ER environment was hyperoxidizing, the Cys63 residue in Kar2 was oxidized to sulfenic acid and cells harboring a Kar2 C63A mutation to block this modification were viable but more sensitive to oxidative stress. These results suggested that the sulfenic acid modification could play a protective role against oxidative stress and when bulky amino acids were substituted for this cysteine to mimic the modification, cells became more tolerate to oxidative stress when expressed in a Kar2 C63A background. Interestingly the bulky cysteine substitution alleles decrease Kar2 ATPase activity and produced thermosensitive translocation blocks <i>in vivo</i> when expressed as the sole source of Kar2. <i>In vitro</i> experiments with purified proteins showed that rhodanese aggregation rates were markedly reduced by mutant versions of Kar2 containing bulky Cys63 substitutions compared to wild type Kar2 or an ATPase dead version. Moreover double mutants that contained bulky Cys63 substitutions and a mutation in the peptide-binding domain of Kar2 no longer protected cells to oxidative stress. Based on these findings the authors propose that Kar2 helps manage oxidative stress through redox conversion of Cys63 to a sulfenic acid modified form of Kar2 that binds folding intermediates to prevent protein aggregation but hydrolyzes ATP at reduced rates to slow polypeptide translocation, protein folding and ATP consumption until a favorable redox state returns."
