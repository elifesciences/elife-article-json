The molecular mechanisms that regulate the spatial distribution of RNA granules in cells are poorly understood. During polarization of the <i>C. elegans</i> zygote, germline RNA granules, called P granules, assemble preferentially in the posterior cytoplasm. We present evidence that P granule asymmetry depends on RNA-induced phase separation of the granule scaffold MEG-3. MEG-3 is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds and phase separates with RNA in vitro. In vivo, MEG-3 forms a posterior-rich concentration gradient that is anti-correlated with a gradient in the RNA-binding protein MEX-5. MEX-5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress MEG-3 granule formation in vivo, and suppresses RNA-induced MEG-3 phase separation in vitro. Our findings suggest that MEX-5 interferes with MEG-3\u2019s access to RNA, thus locally suppressing MEG-3 phase separation to drive P granule asymmetry. Regulated access to RNA, combined with RNA-induced phase separation of key scaffolding proteins, may be a general mechanism for controlling the formation of RNA granules in space and time."

The molecular mechanisms that regulate the spatial distribution of RNA granules in cells are poorly understood. During polarization of the <i>C. elegans</i> zygote, germline RNA granules, called P granules, assemble preferentially in the posterior cytoplasm. We present evidence that P granule asymmetry depends on RNA-induced phase separation of the granule scaffold MEG-3. MEG-3 is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds and phase separates with RNA in vitro. In vivo, MEG-3 forms a posterior-rich concentration gradient that is anti-correlated with a gradient in the RNA-binding protein MEX-5. MEX-5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress MEG-3 granule formation in vivo, and suppresses RNA-induced MEG-3 phase separation in vitro. Our findings suggest that MEX-5 interferes with MEG-3\u2019s access to RNA, thus locally suppressing MEG-3 phase separation to drive P granule asymmetry. Regulated access to RNA, combined with RNA-induced phase separation of key scaffolding proteins, may be a general mechanism for controlling the formation of RNA granules in space and time."

However, some organelles, such as the germ granule, do not have a membrane. It is thought that these organelles may form in the same way that oil droplets tend to come together when mixed with water. However, oil droplets form in water spontaneously and do not fall apart, so it is not clear how cells could control the assembly and destruction of such organelles."

RNA granules are ubiquitous cellular structures and several classes of cytoplasmic RNA granules have been described, including stress granules, P bodies, neuronal granules and germ granules (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</a>). Cytoplasmic RNA granule components typically exchange rapidly between a highly concentrated pool in the granule and a more diffuse, less concentrated pool in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib35\">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</a>). In addition to RNA-binding domains, proteins in RNA granules often contain prion-like, low complexity, or intrinsically-disordered regions (IDRs) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Courchaine, 2016</a>). In concentrated solutions, IDRs spontaneously de-mix from the aqueous solvent to form liquid droplets (liquid-liquid phase separation or LLPS) or hydrogels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Guo and Shorter, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Nott et al., 2015</a>).

In eggs, germ granules assemble in the germ plasm, a specialized area of the cytoplasm that is partitioned to the nascent germline during the first embryonic cleavages (<a href=\"#bib33\">Voronina et al., 2011</a>).

For most of development, P granules are stable perinuclear structures, but in the transition from oocyte-to-embryo, P granules detach from the nucleus and become highly dynamic (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pitt et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). As the oocyte is ovulated in the spermatheca, P granules disassemble and release their components in the cytoplasm. After fertilization, P granule proteins reassemble into dynamic granules that undergo repeated cycles of assembly and disassembly in synchrony with cell division. Live imaging in the 1-cell zygote has revealed that these cycles are spatially patterned along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo: granule assembly is favored in the posterior and granule disassembly is favored in the anterior (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gallo et al., 2010</a>). By the first mitosis, P granules are found exclusively in the posterior cytoplasm together with other germ plasm components. As a result, P granules are segregated to the posterior germline blastomere P<sub>1</sub> and excluded from the anterior somatic blastomere AB."

MEX-5 and MEX-6 in turn restrict P granules to the posterior (<a href=\"#bib28\">Schubert et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gallo et al., 2010</a>). In <i>mex-5 mex-6</i> double mutants, P granule still undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly but these are no longer patterned along the anterior-posterior axis, and small granules remain throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gallo et al., 2010</a>).

PGL-1 and PGL-3 are RGG domain proteins that self-associate and recruit other RNA-binding proteins to the granules, including the GLH family of RNA helicases (<a href=\"#bib31\">Updike and Strome, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hanazawa et al., 2011</a>). MEG-3 and MEG-4 are redundant, serine-rich proteins that bind to PGL-1 in vitro and are essential for P granule assembly in embryos. In zygotes lacking <i>meg-3</i> and <i>meg-4</i>, PGL-1 and GLH-2 form transient assemblies that do not segregate asymmetrically and are not maintained in later stages (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Phosphorylation of MEG-3 by the DYRK kinase MBK-2 promotes granule disassembly in zygotes, but the mechanism that favors disassembly specifically in the anterior cytoplasm is not known (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). In this study, we use a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to examine the contribution of the MEX, MEG, and PGL proteins to P granule assembly and asymmetry. We show that MEG-3/4, but not PGL-1/3, are essential for granule assembly and asymmetry, and that MEX-5 localizes MEG-3 in a posterior-rich gradient. We demonstrate that MEG-3 is an RNA-binding protein that is stimulated by RNA to undergo phase separation. MEX-5 is sufficient to block MEG-3 phase separation in vitro and to block MEG-3 granule formation in vivo. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby MEX-5 antagonizes MEG-3\u2019s access to RNA to inhibit MEG-3 condensation in the anterior cytoplasm."

In zygotes derived from mothers treated with double-stranded RNA against <i>mex-5</i> and <i>mex-6</i> (<i>mex-5/6(RNAi)</i> zygotes), the MEG-3 gradient did not form and MEG-3 and PGL-1 granules remained uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gallo et al., 2010</a>).

Using <i>mex-5</i> transgenes, <a href=\"#bib13\">Griffin et al. (2011)</a> showed the finger mutations R247E and K318E also disrupt formation of the MEX-5 gradient in vivo. To determine the effect of these mutations on MEG granule assembly, we introduced R247E and K318E (hereafter referred to as ZF-) at the <i>mex-5</i> locus by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing into an OLLAS::MEX-5 tagged line and the MEG-3::GFP line. Like MEX-5(S404A), MEX-5(ZF-) did not form a gradient and was uniformly distributed in zygotes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In contrast to <i>mex-5(S404A)</i> zygotes, however, <i>mex-5(ZF-)</i> zygotes assembled posterior MEG-3 granules as in wild-type (data not shown). <i>mex-5</i> is partially redundant with its paralog, <i>mex-6</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Schubert et al., 2000</a>), which is sufficient to polarize MEG granules in the absence of MEX-5 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with this redundancy, we found that depletion of <i>mex-6 by RNAi</i> in <i>mex-5(ZF-)</i> zygotes caused MEG-3 granules to assemble throughout the cytoplasm, as in <i>mex-5/6(RNAi)</i> zygotes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These observations suggest that <i>mex-5(ZF-)</i> is a loss-of-function allele. The loss of <i>mex-5</i> activity was not due to reduced expression as MEX-5(ZF-) was expressed at the same level as wild-type MEX-5 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We were not able to maintain high concentrations of MEG-3 or MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> in solution in the presence of high salt (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods).

We found that MEG-3 and MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> readily formed phase-separated condensates within 10 min at room temperature. Control proteins (BSA and MBP) subjected to the same treatment did not phase separate (data not shown). MEG-3 condensates were observed across a range of protein concentrations (0.5 \u03bcM to 5 \u03bcM) and became larger and more abundant with increasing protein concentration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

LET-711 is the scaffolding component of the CCF/NOT1 deadenylase, the main deadenylase that promotes mRNA turnover in oocytes and early embryos (<a href=\"#bib8\">DeBella et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Nousch et al., 2013</a>).

MEG-3 localizes in a posterior-rich gradient under the control of the RNA-binding protein MEX-5, which localizes in a mirror-image, anterior-rich gradient.

MEG-3 follows this paradigm: MEG-3 readily formed condensates within minutes of dilution from urea to an aqueous buffer (150 mM NaCl). MEG-3 phase separation could be stimulated by RNA: addition of poly-U30 to the phase separation buffer increased the number of MEG-3 condensates especially at 1 \u03bcM and lower protein concentrations. MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> behaved similarly to full-length MEG-3, except that MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> required higher concentrations of RNA to phase separate at low protein concentrations. Consistent with this in vitro behavior, MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> did not form large granules in wild-type zygotes, but could be induced to do so in zygotes defective in mRNA deadenylation and turnover (RNAi depletion of the LET-711/NOT1). These observations suggest that the IDR confers on MEG-3 an intrinsic tendency for phase separation that is tunable by RNA. RNA-induced phase separation has also been observed for Whi3, a fungal RNA-binding protein, and for hnRNPA1, a stress granule protein (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). In these proteins, the IDR and RNA-binding domain are distinct and RNA-induced phase separation requires both domains. It will be interesting to determine whether the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> in fact contains separable domains for phase separation and RNA binding."

                                "text": "A recent theoretical study has suggested that MEX-5 patterns P granules by regulating the phase separation of a different P granule protein: PGL-3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Saha et al., 2016</a>). This model is based on the assumption that PGL-3 is essential to assemble P granules and on three in vitro observations: (1) PGL-3 binds RNA using a C-terminal RGG domain, (2) RNA-binding via the RGG domain stimulates phase separation of PGL-3 and (3) MEX-5 can interfere with the formation of PGL-3/RNA condensates. Using estimates for the in vivo concentrations and diffusion rates of PGL-3, MEX-5 and RNA, Saha et al. built a mathematical model that simulates a competition for RNA between MEX-5 and PGL-3. In the simulation, introduction of the MEX-5 gradient is sufficient to dissolve PGL-3 granules in the anterior cytoplasm. This model is inconsistent with several in vivo observations. First, <a href=\"#bib15\">Hanazawa et al. (2011)</a> have reported that PGL-3 lacking the RGG domain still forms asymmetric granules in zygotes. Second, the\u00a0formation of the MEX-5 gradient does not correlate temporally with, and is not sufficient for, PGL-3 asymmetry in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Third, PGL-3 and its paralog PGL-1 are not required to assemble or localize MEG granules in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The in vivo data demonstrate that, contrary to the model proposed by <a href=\"#bib27\">Saha et al. (2016)</a>, PGL-3 does not require RNA binding to localize to the granules, does not sense the MEX-5 gradient directly, and does not drive granule assembly or asymmetry. The in vivo data indicate instead that MEG-3/4 are responsible for P granule asymmetry and recruitment of PGL-3 to P granules. In vitro, MEG-3 binds to PGL-1 and PGL-1 binds to PGL-3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hanazawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), raising the possibility that the MEGs recruit the PGLs by direct protein-protein interactions. We showed previously that MEG-3 overlaps but does not co-localize perfectly with PGL-3 in P granules (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Formation of stable PGL assemblies in embryos also requires LAF-1, a DEAD-box RNA helicase that phase separates in vitro independently of RNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</a>). P granules therefore appear to comprise multiple phases, each with distinct properties and components that have an\u00a0affinity for one another but do not fully mix. We suggest that MEG-3 and MEG-4 form the main RNA-dependent phase of P granules. The MEG phase functions as a scaffold that recruits other P granule components to build multi-phasic assemblies. An important question will be to determine the physical and biochemical properties of the MEG phase. The conclusion that P granules are liquid droplets was based mostly on observations of the PGL phase (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>). Whether the MEG phase is also liquid or is a more ordered gel-like or solid condensate remains to be determined. How the MEG scaffold specifies the unique RNA/protein composition of P granules will be an exciting area for future inquiry."

The authors show P granule assembly occurs stepwise and critically depends on the function of Mex 5/6 and Meg3/4. They further demonstrate that Mex-5 needs to be phosphorylated and have intact Zn fingers that can bind to poly U stretches to generate <i>meg-3/4</i> gradient. The most interesting aspect of the study is the analysis of the ability of Meg3 (4) to bind RNA primarily through its N-terminal IDR domain. Interestingly in vitro the affinity for polyU is similar between Mex5 and Meg3, suggesting a competition between these two proteins for RNA. The authors demonstrate in vitro phase transitions of purified IDR and full length Meg3, that this is increased by polyU RNA and can be competed by Mex5 binding to RNA. in vivo the Meg3 IDR is able to form granules however at a later stage or under increased RNA levels. Overall this is a very interesting study that outlines how non-sequence specific RNA interactions with IDR domains can facilitate phase transitions."

In this study a role for Pgl proteins akin to the function of Meg3/4 proposed here is populated.

In particular, in vitro Pgl proteins can phase separate and recruit other granule components but apparently in vivo granule formation depends on Meg3/4.

The most interesting aspect of the study is the analysis of the ability of Meg3 (4) to bind RNA primarily through its N-terminal IDR domain.

Previous work has shown that a series of asymmetric protein gradients are established after fertilization, culminating in the anterior enrichment of an RNA-binding protein called MEX-5 in the <i>C. elegans</i> zygote prior to mitosis. MEX-5 is necessary to block phase separation of P granules, but posterior MEX-5 is destabilized so P granules phase separate and segregate with the nascent germline. P granules consist of a heterogeneous mix of MEG, PGL, and GLH proteins (among other things), but the link between MEX-5 and P-granule proteins was unknown. Recently, a separate group (Saha, et al. Cell 2016) reconstituted P granule-like droplets in vitro, demonstrated that competition between PGL-3 and MEX-5 for mRNA can regulate droplet formation, and used theory to show that a MEX-5 gradient can drive PGL-3 and P-granule assembly in vivo. Smith et al. complement the findings of Saha et al., confirming that MEX-5 does act as an RNA sink to prevent phase separation, but in contrast they also demonstrate that the mRNA binding competition in the zygote is between MEX-5 and MEG-3 instead of MEX-5 and PGL-3. These findings make a significant contribution to what drives phase separation and P-granule assembly in the cytoplasm."

Recent work by these authors demonstrated that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich proteins (specifically the MEG proteins) regulates the dynamics of P granule assembly and disassembly. Here, with a combination of in vivo and in vitro work, the authors describe a model in which RNA binding competition between MEX-5 and MEG-3 results in P granule asymmetry. in vivo, the authors first show the opposing localization patterns of MEX-5 and MEG-3, and through mutational studies show that MEX-5 gradients drive MEG-3 granule asymmetry. in vitro, the authors show that purified MEG-3 (and its disordered region) can phase separate, and that this phase separation is greatly enhanced by addition of RNA through MEG-3 RNA binding. Finally, it is shown that addition of MEX-5 in vitro inhibits phase separation of MEG-3. These findings dovetail nicely with recent work showing a similar phenomenon with MEX-5 and PGL-3 (Saha et al. 2016). Overall, this study provides a clear and logical presentation of experimental work to support the majority of its conclusions, and I fully support its publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The Hyman paper is a theoretical study that makes several predictions that are not consistent with in vivo observations. For example, the Hyman model predicts that the RNA binding domain of PGL-3 is essential for PGL-3 to form granules in the posterior cytoplasm in response to MEX-5. In fact, Hanazawa et al., showed in 2011 that PGL-3 lacking its RNA binding domain still forms posterior granules in vivo. The Hyman model also predicts that PGL-3 responds directly to the MEX-5 gradient. In fact, we find that PGL-3 asymmetry requires <i>meg-3/4</i> and does not correlate temporally with the MEX-5 gradient. Finally, the Hyman model assumes that PGL-3 is the driver of P granule asymmetry. In fact, neither PGL-3 (nor its paralog PGL-1) are required for P granule asymmetry: zygotes lacking PGL-1 and PGL-3 still assemble MEG granules in the posterior. Future genetic studies will be needed to compare the different contributions of MEG and PGL proteins to germline development, but with respect to P granule asymmetry in zygotes, the MEG proteins are the drivers."
