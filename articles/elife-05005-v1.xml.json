Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks."

Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks."

The miRNAs conserved to fish have been grouped into 87 families, each with a unique seed region. On average, each of these families has &gt;400 conserved targeting interactions, and together these interactions involve most mammalian mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>).

Experiments have confirmed that the preference for an adenosine opposite position 1 is independent of the miRNA nucleotide identity (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib213\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Baek et al., 2008</a>) and due to the specific recognition of the target adenosine within a binding pocket of Argonaute (<a href=\"#bib226\">Schirle et al., 2014</a>). Two other canonical site types, each associated with weaker preferential conservation and much lower efficacy (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>), are the 6mer (position 2\u20137 match [<a href=\"#bib147\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>]) and offset-6mer (position 3\u20138 match [<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>]).

Although these 3\u2032-supplementary sites can be detected above background when searching for preferentially conserved pairing configurations, they are exceedingly rare, with conserved miRNA families in mammals and nematodes each averaging &lt;1 preferentially conserved 3\u2032-supplementary site (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>). Other relatively rare, yet effective sites include centered sites, which have 11\u201312 contiguous Watson\u2013Crick pairs to the center of the miRNA (<a href=\"#bib229\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), and cleavage sites, which have the very extensive pairing required for Argonaute-catalyzed slicing of the mRNA (<a href=\"#bib250\">Yekta et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Davis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Karginov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib229\">Shin et al., 2010</a>).

As previously mentioned, the type of site (e.g., whether the site is an 8mer or a 7mer-A1) strongly influences the efficacy of repression. The number of sites also influences efficacy, with each additional site typically acting independently to impart additional repression (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib213\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>), although sites between 8\u201340 nt of each other tend to act cooperatively, and those &lt; 8 nt of each other act competitively (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>). Additional features of site context help explain why a given site (e.g., a 7mer-m8 site to miR-1) can be more effective in one 3\u2032 UTR than it is in another. These features include the positioning of the site outside of the path of the ribosome (which includes the first 15 nt of the 3\u2032 UTR [<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>]) and the positioning of the site within 3\u2032-UTR segments that are more accessible to the silencing complex, as measured by either high local AU content (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib213\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>), high AU content of the entire 3\u2032 UTR (<a href=\"#bib219\">Robins and Press, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Hausser et al., 2009</a>), shorter distance from a 3\u2032-UTR terminus (<a href=\"#bib59\">Gaidatzis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib188\">Majoros and Ohler, 2007</a>), shorter 3\u2032-UTR length (<a href=\"#bib90\">Hausser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Betel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib247\">Wen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib217\">Reczko et al., 2012</a>), or less stable predicted competing secondary structure (<a href=\"#bib220\">Robins et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ameres et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Kertesz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib187\">Long et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib235\">Tafer et al., 2008</a>). Conserved sites are also more effective, in part because they tend to reside in more favorable contexts (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib213\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>). Features of the miRNA can also influence site efficacy, with sites being more effective if the miRNA has lower target-site abundance (TA) within the transcriptome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arvey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Garcia et al., 2011</a>) and stronger predicted seed-pairing stability (SPS) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Garcia et al., 2011</a>)."

This finding justified a focus on the statistical modeling of canonical, seed-matched sites within 3\u2032 UTRs, which mediate the vast majority of repression that can be predicted with current methods. To this end, we pre-processed the 74 datasets to minimize confounding biases and then used stepwise regression to identify the most informative features from a large set of potential targeting features. This approach unbiasedly selected 14 features, which were combined to develop the context++ model of miRNA targeting efficacy. The context++ model was more predictive than any published model and at least as predictive as the most informative in vivo crosslinking approaches. As the engine powering the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; <a href=\"http://targetscan.org\">targetscan.org</a>), this model provides a valuable resource for placing the miRNAs of human, mouse, zebrafish, and other vertebrate species into their respective gene-regulatory networks."

These experiments all observe significant enrichment for cognate seed-matched sites in the vicinity of the crosslinks, which validates their ability to detect authentic sites. Despite this enrichment, some crosslinks do not correspond to canonical sites to the relevant miRNAs, raising the prospect that these results might reveal novel types of non-canonical binding that could mediate repression. Indeed, five studies have reported crosslinking to non-canonical binding sites proposed to mediate repression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Chi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib186\">Loeb et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Helwak et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib122\">Khorshid et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Grosswendt et al., 2014</a>).

Nucleation-bulge sites consist of 8 nt motifs paired to positions 2\u20138 of their cognate miRNA seed, with the nucleotide opposing position 6 protruding as a bulge but sharing Watson-Crick complementarity to miRNA position 6. Meta-analyses of miRNA and small-RNA transfection datasets revealed significant repression of mRNAs with the canonical site types but found no evidence for repression of mRNAs that contain nucleation-bulge sites but lack perfectly paired seed-matched sites in their 3\u2032 UTRs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Reasoning that the nucleation-bulge site might be only marginally effective, we examined the early zebrafish embryo with and without Dicer, analyzing the targeting by miR-430, the most highly expressed miRNA of the early embryo. Even in this system, one of the most sensitive systems for detecting the effects of targeting (where a robust repression is observed for mRNAs with only a single 6mer or offset-6mer sites to miR-430), we observed no evidence for repression of mRNAs with nucleation-bulge sites to miR-430 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>).

(2014)</a> but modified to control for background conservation. Plotted for the indicated miRNAs is the average conservation of chimera-supported non-canonical sites, as measured by branch-length score (BLS), compared to the average conservation of 100 equally sized cohorts of controls; error bars, standard deviation of cohort averages; **, p &lt; 0.01; *, p &lt; 0.05, one-sided <i>Z</i> test. We considered chimera-supported non-canonical sites that mapped within 3\u2032 UTRs and contained a single mismatch to the 6 nt seed of the miRNA. This set of sites mirrored that analyzed previously (<a href=\"#bib79\">Grosswendt et al., 2014</a>), and excluded offset 6mers, which as a class was already known to mediate repression and exhibit preferential conservation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>). Cohorts of control sites were generated such that for each chimera-supported site, each control cohort contained a single example of the identical 6 nt motif that was present in the indicated region (either an AGO cluster or 3\u2032 UTR) but not supported by chimeric reads. To control for local background conservation and thereby avoid treating sites within slowly evolving 3\u2032 UTRs the same as those within rapidly evolving 3\u2032 UTRs, we used the binning procedure developed for calculating <i>P</i><sub>CT</sub> scores (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>); 3\u2032 UTRs were partitioned into 10 conservation bins (based on the median BLS of the nucleotides of the human sequence), and control sites were randomly selected (with replacement) from 3\u2032 UTRs in the same bin as the actual site. Control AGO clusters were collected as was done previously (<a href=\"#bib79\">Grosswendt et al., 2014</a>), using genome-wide data downloaded from clipz.unibas.ch and derived from multiple AGO PAR-CLIP experiments performed in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#bib123\">Kishore et al., 2011</a>). The union of AGO clusters for all experiments was computed and filtered for overlap with Ensembl-annotated 3\u2032 UTRs, using the \u2018merge\u2019 and \u2018intersectBED\u2019 utilities, respectively, found in BEDTools v2.20.1 (parameter \u2018-s\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib216\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>). (<b>B</b>) Attribution of the conservation signal to the confounding effects of conserved regions. Considered are 1443 non-canonical chimera-supported sites selected as in (<b>A</b>) but including sites of all miRNA families. For each chimera-supported site, a <i>z</i> score was generated using the distribution of BLSs for 100 control sites chosen as in panel (<b>A</b>) from either AGO clusters or 3\u2032 UTRs, as indicated. Each <i>z</i> score reflected how the conservation of the actual site differed from that of its controls. Compared are cumulative distributions of the <i>z</i> scores for sites of broadly conserved miRNAs and those of less conserved miRNAs, using the previously defined sets of broadly and less conserved miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>). If the chimera-supported non-canonical sites were preferentially conserved because of their function in mediating repression, then sites of broadly conserved miRNAs would be expected to have a right-shifted distribution compared to sites of less conserved miRNAs. However, no significant difference was discerned between each pair of <i>z</i>-score distributions. The remainder of this legend outlines the rationale for the analysis of this panel. One way to reconcile the conservation signal observed in panel (<b>A</b>) with our conclusion that a large majority if not all of these sites bind miRNA but do not mediate repression is to consider the potentially confounding biochemical properties of conserved regions, which are illustrated by the observation that artificial siRNAs preferentially target sites that are evolutionarily conserved over those that are not (<a href=\"#bib213\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>). Because these siRNAs are not natural (and do not share a seed with conserved miRNAs) the evolutionary conservation of these preferred sites could not have arisen because they function to mediate sRNA-guided repression. Instead, some other function of these 3\u2032-UTR regions, such as greater accessibility to RNA-binding factors, must explain their preferential conservation and also endow them with properties that favor sRNA binding (<a href=\"#bib213\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>). To examine whether confounding properties of conserved 3\u2032-UTR regions might similarly explain the elevated conservation of chimera-supported sites, we compared the <i>z</i> scores for sites bound by broadly conserved miRNAs (miRNAs in families conserved beyond mammals, as listed in TargetScan7) with those bound by less conserved miRNAs. MicroRNAs conserved among mammals but not more broadly were grouped with the less conserved miRNAs because canonical 6mer and 7mer sites to these miRNAs have no conservation signal above background, presumably because these miRNAs have not been present long enough for the number of preferentially conserved 6mer and 7mer sites to rise above the background (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>); we reasoned that the same would be true of non-canonical sites, to the extent that any are preferentially conserved. If the conservation signal observed in panel (<b>A</b>) were related to miRNA binding, we would have expected a difference between the scores for the sites of broadly and less conserved miRNAs. The lack of a significant difference supports the idea that chimera-supported non-canonical sites tend to be conserved for the same reason that functional sites to artificial siRNAs tend to be conserved."

As previously observed, we found that the levels of these mRNAs tended to increase in T cells lacking miR-155 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, a closer look at the distribution of mRNA fold changes between wild-type and knockout cells revealed a pattern not normally observed for mRNAs with a functional site type. As illustrated for the mRNAs with canonical sites (including those supported by CLIP), when a miRNA is knocked out, the cumulative distribution of fold changes for mRNAs with functional site types diverges most from the no-site distribution at the top of the curve, which represents the most strongly derepressed mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, for the mRNAs harboring non-canonical miR-155 sites, the distribution of fold changes converged with the no-site distribution at the top of the curve (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), raising doubt as to whether non-canonical binding of these mRNAs mediates repression. To investigate these mRNAs further, we examined their response to the miR-155 loss in helper T cell subtypes 1 and 2 (T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2, respectively) and B cells, which are other lymphocytic cells in which significant derepression of miR-155 targets is observed in cells lacking miR-155 (<a href=\"#bib222\">Rodriguez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Eichhorn et al., 2014</a>). In contrast to mRNAs with canonical sites, the mRNAs with non-canonical sites showed no evidence of derepression in the knockout cells of each of these cell types, which reinforced the conclusion that non-canonical binding of miR-155 does not lead to repression of these mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

As previously observed, mRNAs with CLASH-identified non-canonical interactions involving miR-92 tended to be slightly up-regulated upon knockdown of miR-92 in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, a closer look at the mRNA fold-change distributions again revealed a pattern not typically observed for mRNAs with a functional site type, with convergence with the no-site distribution in the region expected to be most divergent. Therefore, we examined a second dataset monitoring mRNA changes after knocking down miR-92 and other miRNAs in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#bib83\">Hafner et al., 2010</a>). As reported recently (<a href=\"#bib246\">Wang, 2014</a>), the slight up-regulation observed for mRNAs with CLASH-identified non-canonical interactions in the original dataset was not reproducible in the second dataset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

However, in mammals, canonical sites to the same miRNA typically act independently (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib213\">Nielsen et al., 2007</a>), and we have no reason to think that non-canonical sites would behave differently. More importantly, although the non-canonical sites examined were in mRNAs that had no seed-matched 3\u2032-UTR site to the same miRNA, most were in mRNAs that had seed-matched 3\u2032-UTR sites to other miRNAs that were highly expressed in the cells.

Repeating this analysis, but focusing on only interactions without canonical sites, confirmed this result (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Applying this type of analysis to non-canonical interactions identified from miRNA\u2013mRNA chimeras in standard AGO CLIP datasets confirmed that these interactions are also enriched for pairing to the miRNA (<a href=\"#bib79\">Grosswendt et al., 2014</a>). As previously shown (<a href=\"#bib79\">Grosswendt et al., 2014</a>), these interactions were more specific to the seed region than were the CLASH-identified interactions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Comparison of all the chimera data with all the CLASH data showed that a higher fraction of the chimeras captured canonical interactions and that a higher fraction captured interactions within 3\u2032 UTRs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results, implying that the chimera approach is more effective than CLASH at capturing functional sites that mediate repression, motivated a closer look at the chimera-identified interactions that lacked a canonical site, despite our finding that these interactions do not mediate repression. In the human and nematode datasets (and less so in the mouse dataset), these interactions were enriched for motifs that corresponded to non-canonical sites that paired to the miRNA seed region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Inspection of these motifs revealed that the most enriched nucleotides typically preserved Watson\u2013Crick pairing in a core 4\u20135 nts within the seed region, with tolerance to mismatches or G:U wobbles observed at varied positions, depending on the miRNA, potentially reflecting seed-specific structural or energetic features, or perhaps context-dependent biases in crosslinking or ligation."

However, despite identification of this miR-124 interaction in datasets from two methods and two species, this style of bulged pairing was not detected for any other miRNA. Interestingly, for all other cases in which a bulge in the recognition motif was observed (human miR-33 and miR-374, and <i>C. elegans</i> miR-50 and miR-58), the bulge was between the nucleotides that paired to miRNA nucleotides 4 and 5 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). A bulge is observed between the analogous nucleotides of validated targets of <i>Arabidopsis</i> miR398 (<a href=\"#bib110\">Jones-Rhoades and Bartel, 2004</a>), whereas single-nucleotide bulges between other seed-pairing positions have not been reported in other validated plant targets. A bulge between these nucleotides is also observed in the first <i>let-7</i> site in the <i>C. elegans lin-41</i> 3\u2032 UTR, one of the archetypal 3\u2032-compensatory sites (<a href=\"#bib218\">Reinhart et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bartel, 2009</a>).

We suspect that many of the interactions lacking the top-scoring motifs also involve non-canonical binding sites, some of which might function through degenerate versions of the motif that happened to have scored highest in the MEME analysis. Nonetheless, some interactions or CLIP clusters lacking the top-scoring motifs might represent background (<a href=\"#bib57\">Friedersdorf and Keene, 2014</a>), and indeed a few with the motif or even with a canonical site might represent background."

Despite this ability to bind the miRNA in vivo and to function in the sense that they contribute to cellular TA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Denzler et al., 2014</a>), we classify the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites as non-functional with respect to repression because they showed no sign of mediating repression and no signal for miRNA-dependent conservation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20135</a>). Thus, the only known non-canonical site types that mediate repression are the 3\u2032-supplementary, centered, and cleavage site types, which together comprise &lt;1% of the effective sites that currently can be predicted (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib229\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that additional types of functional non-canonical sites might exist but have not yet been characterized to the point that they can be used for miRNA target prediction (<a href=\"#bib138\">Lal et al., 2009</a>), our analysis of the CLIP results justified a focus on the abundant site types that are predictive of targeting and are at least marginally functional, that is, the canonical seed-matched sites, including 6mer and offset-6mer sites."

Indeed, when considering mRNAs without a canonical site to the transfected sRNA, we found that 3\u2032-UTR AU content often correlated with mRNA fold changes. Moreover, the extent and direction of the correlation was similar for different datasets from the same publication but differed when comparing to datasets from other publications (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). A second parameter that helped explain the correlated sRNA-independent effects for related datasets was 3\u2032-UTR length (<a href=\"#bib223\">Saito and Satrom, 2012</a>), which exhibited patterns of correlation similar to those observed for 3\u2032-UTR AU content (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

Moreover, our technique eliminated the signal for derepression of endogenous miRNA targets (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), suggesting that it did the same for any other biases unrelated to the sequence of the transfected sRNA that have yet to be identified.

This function uses stepwise regression to build models with increasing numbers of features until it reaches the optimal Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. The AIC evaluates the tradeoff between the benefit of increasing the likelihood of the regression fit and the cost of increasing the complexity of the model by adding more variables. For each of the four seed-matched site types, models were built for 1000 samples of the dataset. Each sample included 70% of the mRNAs with single sites to the transfected sRNA from each experiment (randomly selected without replacement), reserving the remaining 30% as a test set. Compared to our context-only and context+ models (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Garcia et al., 2011</a>), the new stepwise regression models were significantly better at predicting site efficacy when evaluated using their corresponding held-out test sets, as illustrated for the each of four site types (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

Other features were frequently selected for only one site type (e.g., ORF 7mer-A1 sites, ORF 7mer-m8 sites, and 5\u2032-UTR length; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Presumably these and other features were not robustly selected because either their correlation with targeting efficacy was very weak (e.g., the 7 nt ORF sites) or they were strongly correlated to a more informative feature, such that they provided little additional value beyond that of the more informative feature (e.g., 3\u2032-UTR AU content compared to the more informative feature, local AU content)."

The resulting models, one for each of the four site types, were collectively called the context++ model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). For each feature, the sign of the coefficient indicated the nature of the relationship. For example, mRNAs with either longer ORFs or longer 3\u2032 UTRs tended to be more resistant to repression (indicated by a positive coefficient), whereas mRNAs with either structurally accessible target sites or ORF 8mer sites tended to be more prone to repression (indicated by a negative coefficient). Based on the relative magnitudes of the regression coefficients, some newly incorporated features, such as 3\u2032-UTR length, ORF length, and SA, contributed similarly to features previously incorporated in the context+ model, such as SPS, TA, and local AU (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). New features with an intermediate level of influence included the number of ORF 8mer sites and site conservation as well as the presence of a 5\u2032 G in the sRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), the latter perhaps a consequence of differential sRNA loading efficiency. The weakest features included the sRNA and target position 8 identities as well as the number of offset-6mer sites. The identity of sRNA nucleotide 8 exhibited a complex pattern that was site-type dependent. Relative to a position-8 U in the sRNA, a position-8 C further decreased efficacy of sites with a mismatch at this position (6mer or 7mer-A1 sites), whereas a position-8 A had the opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Similarly, a position-8 C in the site also conferred decreased efficacy of 6mer and 7mer-A1 sites relative to a position-8 U in the site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Allowing interaction terms when developing the model, including a term that captured the potential interplay between these positions, did not provide sufficient benefit to justify the more complex model."

To test the performance of the included methods, we used the results of seven microarray datasets that each monitor mRNA changes after transfection of a conserved miRNA into HCT116 cells containing a hypomorphic mutant for Dicer (<a href=\"#bib183\">Linsley et al., 2007</a>). These datasets differ from those used during development and training of our model with respect to both the cell type and the identities of the sRNAs. To prevent our model from gaining an advantage over methods that used standard 3\u2032-UTR annotations, we used RefSeq-annotated 3\u2032 UTRs (rather than 3P-seq\u2013supported annotations) to generate the context++ test-set predictions. For genes with multiple annotated 3\u2032 UTRs\u00a0we chose the longest isoform because the microarray probes of the test set often matched only this isoform.

The two algorithms achieving any semblance of prediction accuracy did so by predicting some of the canonical interactions with known marginal efficacy. These were DIANA-microT-CDS, which captured modest effects of canonical sites in ORFs (<a href=\"#bib217\">Reczko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib190\">Marin et al., 2013</a>), and the context++ model, which captured the modest effects of canonical 6mers in 3\u2032 UTRs (as modified by the 14 features, which included offset 6mers and 8mer ORF sites) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The algorithms designed to identify many non-canonical sites performed much more poorly in this test (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.004), consistent with the idea that the vast majority of mRNAs without canonical sites either do not change in response to the miRNA or change in an unpredictable fashion as a secondary effect of introducing the miRNA."

Compared to the <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> test, this approach does not penalize efforts that either impose more stringent cutoffs to achieve higher prediction specificity or implement scoring schemes that are not designed to correlate directly with site efficacy. Perhaps most importantly, this approach aligns with the goals of a biologist considering the top-ranked predictions in an attempt to focus on those most likely to undergo substantial repression. When choosing an average of 16 predicted targets for each of the seven test-set miRNAs, we found that these top 112 predictions of the context++ model were significantly more repressed than the top predictions from earlier versions of TargetScan (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and the top predictions of the other algorithms (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

In principle, these mRNAs could still be authentic targets that are repressed in these cells but nonetheless had increased expression values because either experimental noise or secondary effects of introducing the miRNA overwhelmed the signal for miRNA-mediated repression. Alternatively, some or all of these mRNAs could be false-positive predictions. Because only half of the false-positive predictions would be expected to have positive fold changes in the presence of the miRNA, our best estimate of the upper limit on the false-positive predictions was 2 \u00d7 8%, or 16%, at this cutoff (for which an average of 16 top predictions per miRNA is considered).

When doing this comparison we took care to evaluate sets of predictions that each were the same size as the cognate set of CLIP-supported targets, whereas some previous analyses compare expansive sets of computational predictions (e.g., all mRNAs with a 6mer site) to relatively small sets of biochemically supported predictions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Chi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib184\">Lipchina et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib186\">Loeb et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Grosswendt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib236\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). mRNAs with expression signals approaching the array background were not considered. This exclusion was particularly important when comparing to CLIP results; CLIP can only evaluate mRNAs expressed in the cells, which would impart a trivial relative advantage if the computational predictions included targets that appeared unresponsive because they were expressed below the array background. The non-canonical CLIP-supported targets were also not considered, as we had already shown that they do not respond to the miRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20134</a>), and we did not want the inclusion of these easily recognized false positives to impart a disadvantage to CLIP. Regardless of the set of canonical CLIP-supported targets examined, we did not find a setting in which they responded significantly better than did the cohort of TargetScan7 predictions, and in some cases, the TargetScan7 predictions performed significantly better (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013J</a>). Similar results were observed when comparing the repression of our predictions to that of mRNAs identified biochemically without crosslinking, using either pulldown-seq or IMPACT-seq (<a href=\"#bib236\">Tan et al., 2014</a>), again focusing on only mRNAs with canonical sites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K,L</a>). Thus, for identifying consequential miRNA\u2013target interactions, the TargetScan7 model is not only more convenient than experimental determination of binding sites, it is also at least as effective. The analogous conclusion was reached from analyses that used the context++ model without using the improved annotation and quantification of 3\u2032-UTR isoforms (data not shown)."

However, other work addressing this question shows that after accounting for the different cellular repertoires of expressed mRNAs, the target response is remarkably consistent between different cell types, with alternative usage of 3\u2032-UTR isoforms being the predominant mechanism shaping cell-type-specific differences in miRNA targeting (<a href=\"#bib198\">Nam et al., 2014</a>).

The challenge has been to predict and score site accessibility in a way that is informative after controlling for local AU content, which is important for speaking to the importance of less occlusive secondary structure as opposed to involvement of some AU-binding activity (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>). The selection of the SA feature in all 1000 bootstrap samples of all four site types showed that it provided discriminatory power apart from that provided by local AU content and other correlated features, which reinforced the idea that the occlusive RNA structure does indeed limit site efficacy. This being said, local AU content, minimum distance of the site, and 3\u2032-UTR length were each also selected in nearly all 1000 bootstrap samples for most site types (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which suggests that either these features were selected for reasons other than their correlation with site accessibility or the definition and scoring of our SA feature has additional room for improvement."

In analyses not described, we evaluated the utility of other types of regression (e.g., linear regression models with interaction terms, lasso/elastic net-regularized regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forest, boosted regression trees, and iterative Bayesian model averaging) and found their performance to be comparable to that of stepwise regression but their resulting models to be considerably more complex and thus less interpretable."

Because sites under selective pressure preferentially possess molecular features required for efficacy, inclusion of the site-conservation feature indirectly recovers some of the information that would otherwise be lost when informative molecular features are missing or imperfectly scored. As more informative molecular features are identified and included in a model, less information remains to be captured, and thus the site-conservation feature cannot contribute as much to the performance of the model. The site-conservation feature (<i>P</i><sub>CT</sub>) was chosen in all 1000 bootstrap samples of each of the three major site types, which showed that the molecular features of our model still do not fully capture all the determinants under selective pressure. However, <i>P</i><sub>CT</sub> was not one of the most informative features (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Moreover, when tested as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, a model trained on only site type and the other 13 molecular features performed nearly as well as the full context++ model (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> of 0.126, compared to 0.139 for the full model).

Its general applicability to all canonical sites is useful for evaluating not only nonconserved sites to conserved miRNAs but also all sites for nonconserved miRNAs (e.g., <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K,L</a>), including viral miRNAs, as well as the off-targets of synthetic siRNAs and shRNAs."

Although CLIP approaches can identify non-canonical sites that bind the miRNA with some degree of specificity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), these non-canonical binding sites do not function to mediate detectable repression. Thus far, the only functional non-canonical sites that can be predicted are 3\u2032-compensatory sites, cleavage sites, and centered sites, which together comprise only a very small fraction (&lt;1%) of the functional sites that can be predicted with comparable accuracy (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib229\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). The failure of computational methods to find many functional non-canonical sites cannot rule out the possibility that many of these sites might still exist; if such sites are recognized through unimagined determinants, computational efforts might have missed them. CLIP approaches, on the other hand, provide information that is independent of proposed pairing rules or other hypothesized recognition determinants. Therefore, our analyses of the CLIP results, which detected no residual repression after accounting for canonical interactions, provide the most compelling evidence to date on this issue. Unless there is a substantial technical bias in the CLIP approach (such as a large unanticipated disparity in the propensity of non-canonical interactions to crosslink), the inability of current CLIP approaches to identify non-canonical targets that are repressed more than control transcripts argues strongly against the existence of many functional non-canonical targets."

Perhaps these sites are ineffective because perfect seed pairing is required for repression. For example, perfect seed pairing might favor binding of a downstream effector, either directly by contributing to its binding site or indirectly through an Argonaute conformational change that favors its binding. However, this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the activity of 3\u2032-compensatory and centered sites, which can mediate repression despite their lack of perfect seed pairing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib229\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), and the activity of Argonaute artificially tethered to an mRNA, which can mediate repression without any pairing to the miRNA (<a href=\"#bib214\">Pillai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Eulalio et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, a more plausible explanation is that the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites bind the miRNA too transiently to mediate repression. This explanation for the inefficacy of the recently identified non-canonical sites in the 3\u2032 UTRs resembles that previously proposed for the inefficacy of most canonical sites in ORFs: in both cases the ineffective sites bind to the miRNA very transiently\u2014the canonical sites in ORFs dissociating quickly because of displacement by the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib78\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Gu et al., 2009</a>), and the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites in 3\u2032 UTRs dissociating quickly because they lack both seed pairing and the extensive pairing outside the seed characteristic of effective non-canonical sites (3\u2032-compensatory and centered sites) and thus have intrinsically fast dissociation rates."

The answers to these questions partially hinge on the realization that the transcriptome has many more non-canonical binding sites than canonical ones. The motifs identified in the non-canonical interactions have information contents as low as 5.6 bits, and thus are much more common in 3\u2032 UTRs than canonical 6mer or 7mer sites (12 bits and 14 bits, respectively). This high abundance of the non-canonical binding sites would help offset the low occupancy of individual non-canonical sites, such that at any moment more than half of the bound miRNA might reside at non-canonical sites, yielding more non-canonical than canonical sites when using experimental approaches with such high specificity that they can identify a site with only a single read (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Some non-canonical sites in the CLASH and chimera datasets are supported by multiple reads, and all the dCLIP-identified non-canonical sites of the miR-155 study (<a href=\"#bib186\">Loeb et al., 2012</a>) are supported by multiple reads. How could some CLIP clusters with ineffective, non-canonical sites have as much read support as some with effective, canonical sites? Our answer to this question rests on the recognition that cluster read density does not perfectly correspond to site occupancy (<a href=\"#bib57\">Friedersdorf and Keene, 2014</a>), with the other key factors being mRNA expression levels and crosslinking efficiency. In principle, normalizing the CLIP tag numbers to the mRNA levels minimizes the first factor, preventing a low-occupancy site in a highly expressed mRNA from appearing as well supported as a high-occupancy site in a lowly expressed mRNA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Chi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Jaskiewicz et al., 2012</a>). Accounting for differential crosslinking efficiencies is a far greater challenge. RNA\u2013protein UV crosslinking is expected to be highly sensitive to the identity, geometry, and environment of the crosslinking constituents, leading to the possibility that the crosslinking efficiency of some sites is orders of magnitude greater than that of others. When considered together with the high abundance of non-canonical sites, variable crosslinking efficiency might explain why so many ineffective non-canonical sites are identified. Overlaying a wide distribution of crosslinking efficiencies onto the many thousands of ineffective, non-canonical sites could yield a substantial number of sites at the high-efficiency tail of the distribution for which the tag support matches that of effective canonical sites. Similar conclusions are drawn for other types of RNA-binding interactions when comparing CLIP results with binding results (<a href=\"#bib139\">Lambert et al., 2014</a>)."

Although this challenge is mitigated in the CLASH and chimera approaches, which provide unambiguous assignment of the miRNAs to the sites, the ligation step of these approaches occurs at low frequency and presumably introduces additional biases, as suggested by the different profile of non-canonical sites identified by the two approaches (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). For example, CLASH identifies non-canonical pairing to the 3\u2032 region of miR-92 (<a href=\"#bib91\">Helwak et al., 2013</a>), whereas the chimera approach identified non-canonical pairing to the 5\u2032 region of this same miRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The requirement of so much additional pairing to make up for a single mismatch to the seed is proposed to arise from several sources. The advantage of propagating continuous pairing past miRNA nucleotide 8 (as occurs for centered sites) might be largely offset by the cost of an unfavorable conformational change (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bartel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib226\">Schirle et al., 2014</a>). Likewise, the advantage of resuming pairing at the miRNA 3\u2032 region (as occurs for 3\u2032-compensatory sites) might be partially offset by either the relative disorder of these nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bartel, 2009</a>) or their unfavorable arrangement prior to seed pairing (<a href=\"#bib226\">Schirle et al., 2014</a>).

Unless pre-processed microarray data were provided by previous studies (as indicated in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), raw data were processed using Bioconductor release 2.14 in the R programming language v3.1.1 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Gentleman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Development Core Team, 2014</a>). Affymetrix data were first background-corrected with the \u2018gcrma\u2019 R package (<a href=\"#bib248\">Wu et al., 2004</a>), whereas Illumina BeadArray data from the miR-302 knockdown and miR-522 transfection datasets (<a href=\"#bib184\">Lipchina et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib236\">Tan et al., 2014</a>) were processed and background-corrected using the \u2018lumiR\u2019 and \u2018lumiExpresso\u2019 functions in the \u2018lumi\u2019 R package (<a href=\"#bib46\">Du et al., 2008</a>). A robust linear regression model was then used to fit to the probe intensities using the \u2018lmFit\u2019 function (parameter \u2018method = \u2018robust\u2019\u2019) in the \u2018limma\u2019 R package v3.6.9 (<a href=\"#bib231\">Smyth, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib232\">2005</a>), computing differential expression information with the provided eBayes function. Probe IDs were then converted to RefSeq or Ensembl IDs (e.g., using the hgu133plus2ENSEMBL and IlluminaID2nuID/lumiHumanAllENSEMBL functions to convert Affymetrix and BeadArray probe IDs, respectively), and the fold change for each mRNA was computed as the median fold change for all probes corresponding to the mRNA. Finally, because about half of the genes in the genome were either not expressed in the cell type examined, or were expressed at a level that was so close to the background that they were prone to have noisy fold-change measurements, the following filters were applied:"

We used only 84 of the 100 species because, with the exception of coelacanth (a lobe-finned fish more related to the tetrapods), the fish species were excluded due to their poor quality of alignment within 3\u2032 UTRs. Likewise, we updated the mouse scores using: (i) 3\u2032 UTRs derived from 19,699 mouse protein-coding genes annotated in Ensembl 77 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Flicek et al., 2014</a>), and (ii) 3\u2032-UTR MSAs across 52 vertebrate species derived from the 60-way multiz alignments in the UCSC genome browser, which used the mouse genome release mm10 as a reference species (<a href=\"#bib113\">Kent et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Karolchik et al., 2014</a>).

We then fit trees for each bin using the \u2018phyloFit\u2019 utility in the PHAST package v1.1, utilizing the generalized time-reversible substitution model and a fixed-tree topology provided by UCSC (parameters \u2018-i SS--subst-mod REV--tree $tree\u2019, where $tree is the Newick format tree of the placental mammals) (<a href=\"#bib230\">Siepel and Haussler, 2004</a>). <i>P</i><sub>CT</sub> parameters and scores were then calculated as described, estimating the signal of conservation for each seed family relative to that of its corresponding 50 control <i>k</i>-mers, matched for <i>k</i>-mer length and rate of dinucleotide conservation at varying branch-length windows (<a href=\"#bib58\">Friedman et al., 2009</a>).

For each bootstrap sample, stepwise regression, as implemented in the <i>stepAIC</i> function from the \u2018MASS\u2019 R package (<a href=\"#bib243\">Venables and Ripley, 2002</a>), was used to both select the most informative combination of features and train a model. Feature selection maximized the Akaike information criterion (AIC), defined as: \u22122 ln(<i>L</i>) + 2<i>k</i>, where <i>L</i> was the likelihood of the data given the linear regression model and <i>k</i> was the number of features or parameters selected. The 1000 resulting models were each evaluated based on their <i>r</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> to the corresponding test set. To illustrate the utility of adding features not included in our previous models, these <i>r</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> values were compared to those obtained when re-training the multiple linear regression coefficients on each bootstrap sample using only the features of either the context-only or the context+ model, and computing <i>r</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> values on the corresponding test sets. The stepwise regression was implemented independently for each of the site types, and a final set of features was chosen as those that were selected for at least 99% of the bootstrap samples of at least two site types. Using this group of features and the entire compendium of 74 datasets as a training set, we trained a multiple linear regression model for each site type (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). As done previously for TargetScan6 predictions, scores for 8mer, 7mer-m8, 7mer-A1, and 6mer sites were bounded to be no greater than \u22120.03, \u22120.02, \u22120.01, and 0, respectively, thereby creating a piece-wise linear function for each site type."

                                "text": "To build databases of human and mouse 3\u2032-UTR profiles, we began with the \u2018basic\u2019 set of protein-coding gene models deposited in Gencode v19 (human hg19 assembly) and Gencode vM3 (mouse mm10 assembly), respectively (<a href=\"#bib88\">Harrow et al., 2012</a>). For each unique stop codon in each set of gene models, we selected the transcript with the longest 3\u2032 UTR as its representative transcript. If other datasets indicated that the 3\u2032 UTRs of these representative transcripts have longer tandem isoforms, we extended them accordingly, using additional annotations provided by (i) the \u2018comprehensive\u2019 set of Gencode gene models (<a href=\"#bib88\">Harrow et al., 2012</a>), (ii) all mRNAs in the RefSeq database (<a href=\"#bib215\">Pruitt et al., 2012</a>), downloaded from the refGene database through the UCSC table browser (<a href=\"#bib113\">Kent et al., 2002</a>), and (iii) 3\u2032-UTR extensions supported by RNA-seq evidence (<a href=\"#bib195\">Miura et al., 2013</a>), after transforming mm9 to mm10 coordinates using liftOver (<a href=\"#bib92\">Hinrichs et al., 2006</a>). We then used 3P-seq clusters from human and mouse (<a href=\"#bib198\">Nam et al., 2014</a>) (again after transforming coordinates with liftOver) to further extend 3\u2032 UTRs when possible, searching within a 5400 nt region downstream of the stop codon (excluding the regions containing annotated introns) for a cleavage and polyadenylation site supported by at least one 3P-seq cluster, prohibiting the search to extend beyond the start position of any annotated downstream exon. The 5400 nt window was chosen because the 99th percentile of the lengths of previously annotated mouse and human 3\u2032 UTRs was \u223c5400 nt. Zebrafish 3\u2032 UTRs for TargetScanFish were identical to those annotated previously (<a href=\"#bib241\">Ulitsky et al., 2012</a>). For each representative transcript, 3P-seq clusters mapping within the extended 3\u2032 UTR were used to quantify the relative levels of alternative tandem isoforms, thereby generating a 3\u2032-UTR profile. For human and mouse transcripts, all 3P-seq datasets for cell lines/tissues of each species were combined, after normalizing for the sequencing depth (i.e., number of uniquely mapping tags) of each dataset, to generate meta profiles. To perform this normalization, the number of tags overlapping the 3\u2032 UTR of each annotated transcript was first summed. A matrix of summed tag counts for each cell line/tissue and for each transcript was then compiled, removing transcripts with no tags in any cell type. This matrix was then upper-quartile normalized by calculating the 75th quantile of counts in each cell type, using the calcNormFactors function (parameter \u2018method = \u2018upperquartile\u2019\u2019) in the \u2018edgeR\u2019 R package (<a href=\"#bib221\">Robinson et al., 2010</a>). These scaling factors were then applied to all tags, and the normalized tag counts corresponding to each 3P-seq cluster from different cell lines/tissues were summed. A pseudocount of 0.1 tag was assigned to the longest tandem 3\u2032-UTR isoform, which accommodated cases in which the longest annotated 3\u2032 UTR did not have tag support. In addition, 5 pseudocounts were assigned to the longest Gencode 3\u2032-UTR isoform, which gave preference to this Gencode annotation if the UTR had poor 3P-seq coverage. The 3\u2032-UTR profiles were then generated and used to compute the affected isoform ratio (AIR) and weighted context++ score for each predicted target site as depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A, 3A</a>, respectively, of <a href=\"#bib198\">Nam et al. (2014)</a>. For zebrafish transcripts, profiles were generated for each developmental stage with a 3P-seq dataset.
