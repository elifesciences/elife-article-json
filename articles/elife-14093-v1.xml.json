Whether disorders induced by biological noise may carry information on building principles of developmental systems is an important debated question. Here, we addressed theoretically this question using phyllotaxis, the geometric arrangement of plant aerial organs, as a model system. Phyllotaxis arises from reiterative organogenesis driven by lateral inhibitions at the shoot apex. Motivated by recurrent observations of disorders in phyllotaxis patterns, we revisited in depth the classical deterministic view of phyllotaxis. We developed a stochastic model of primordia initiation at the shoot apex, integrating locality and stochasticity in the patterning system. This stochastic model recapitulates phyllotactic patterns, both regular and irregular, and makes quantitative predictions on the nature of disorders arising from noise. We further show that disorders in phyllotaxis instruct us on the parameters governing phyllotaxis dynamics, thus that disorders can reveal biological watermarks of developmental systems."

Whether disorders induced by biological noise may carry information on building principles of developmental systems is an important debated question. Here, we addressed theoretically this question using phyllotaxis, the geometric arrangement of plant aerial organs, as a model system. Phyllotaxis arises from reiterative organogenesis driven by lateral inhibitions at the shoot apex. Motivated by recurrent observations of disorders in phyllotaxis patterns, we revisited in depth the classical deterministic view of phyllotaxis. We developed a stochastic model of primordia initiation at the shoot apex, integrating locality and stochasticity in the patterning system. This stochastic model recapitulates phyllotactic patterns, both regular and irregular, and makes quantitative predictions on the nature of disorders arising from noise. We further show that disorders in phyllotaxis instruct us on the parameters governing phyllotaxis dynamics, thus that disorders can reveal biological watermarks of developmental systems."

In this case, disorders observed during development could be informative not only on the origin of noise but also on the underlying developmental mechanisms that propagate the noise. Here we address this question theoretically using phyllotaxis, the remarkably regular geometric organization of plant aerial organs (such as leaves and flowers) along the stem, as a model system (Appendix section 1)."

Rooted in early works of pioneers such as (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bonnet, 1754</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Braun, 1831</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bravais and Bravais, 1837</a>) and after decades of research, the idea that phyllotactic patterns emerge from simple physical or bio-chemical lateral inhibitions between successive organs produced at the meristem has become largely prevalent, (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jean, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kuhlemeier, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pennybacker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Reinhardt, 2005</a>). Microscopic observations and modeling led to propose that this self-organizing process relies on five basic principles: <i>i</i>) organs can form only close to the tip of growing shoots, <i>ii</i>) no organ can form at the very tip, <i>iii</i>) pre-existing organs prevent the formation of new organs in their vicinity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hofmeister, 1868</a>), forming altogether an inhibitory field that covers the organogenetic zone, <i>iv</i>) due to growth, organs are progressively moved away from the organogenetic zone, <i>v</i>) a new organ is formed as soon as the influence of the inhibitory field produced by the existing organs fades away at the growing tip, (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schoute, 1913</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Snow and Snow, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Turing, 1952</a>). Computer simulations were used to analyze the dynamical properties of an inhibitory field model relying on these assumptions (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mitchison, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Thornley, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Veen and Lindenmayer, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Young, 1978</a>) and many others after them, including (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chapman and Perry, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Douady and Couder, 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Green et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Meinhardt, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schwabe and Clewer, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Smith et al., 2006b</a>). In a detailed computational analysis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Douady and Couder, 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">1996b</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">1996c</a>), Douady and Couder demonstrated the ability of such models to recapitulate a wide variety of phyllotactic patterns in a parsimonious way and that these patterns are under the control of a simple geometric parameter corresponding to the ratio between the radius of organ inhibitory fields and the radius of the central zone (area at the very tip where no organ can form). This modeling framework thus provides a deterministic theory of self-organizing patterns in the meristem characterized by a global geometric parameter, capturing macroscopic symmetries and orders emerging from lateral inhibitions, e.g. (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adler, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Atela, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Newell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Smith et al., 2006b</a>).

They mainly rely on distribution in the meristem of the plant hormone auxin, a central morphogenetic regulator. Auxin is actively transported at the meristem surface, notably by both PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) polar efflux carriers and non-polar influx carriers (AUX/LAX family). These transporters form a dynamic network that permanently reconfigures and that periodically accumulates auxin at specific locations on the meristem flanks (the organogenetic domain), initiating organ primordia (<a href=\"#bib50\">Reinhardt et al., 2003</a>). By attracting auxin, the growing primordium depletes auxin in its vicinity, thus preventing organ formation in this region. This mechanism is now thought to be at the origin of the predicted inhibitory fields in the meristem (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barbier de Reuille et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brunoud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">J\u00f6nsson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Smith et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stoma et al., 2008</a>). The range of this inhibition corresponds to one of the two key parameters of the classical model: as primordia get away from the tip, inhibition is relaxed and auxin can accumulate again to initiate new primordia. For the\u00a0second key parameter, i.e. the size of the apical domain in which no organ can form, it has been suggested that the very tip of the meristem contains significant quantities of auxin but is actually insensitive to auxin due to a down-regulation of the effectors of transcriptional auxin signaling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barbier de Reuille et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Vernoux et al., 2011</a>). A low auxin sensitivity then participates in blocking organ initiation in the central domain (where the stem cells are located) of the meristem. These molecular insights support the hypothesized structure of the classical model."

In some cases, the departure from any known regular pattern is so strong that plant phyllotaxis is considered random, e.g. (<a href=\"#bib27\">Itoh et al., 2000</a>). Recently, strong disorders have been observed and quantified in spiral patterns of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> wild-type and <i>arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer protein (ahp6</i>) mutants (<a href=\"#bib6\">Besnard et al., 2014</a>), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.

Live-imaging of meristems showed that organs are sometimes co-initiated in the meristem, leading randomly to post-meristematic organ order permutations in around half of the cases. This phenomenon showed that, while the azimuthal directions of the organs are highly robust, the time between consecutive organ initiation (or plastochron) is variable, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>. Taken together, these observations called for revisiting in depth models of phyllotaxis to account for disorders in this self-organizing developmental system."

Building on this observation, we developed a stochastic model of organ initiation that is fully local and relies on a stochastic modeling of cell responses to inhibitory fields. Our stochastic model fully and precisely captures the observed dynamics of organogenesis at the meristem, recapitulating both regular and irregular phyllotactic patterns. We show that the stochastic model also makes quantitative predictions on the nature of the perturbations that may arise due to different genetic and growth manipulations. Most importantly, we demonstrate that disorders in phyllotactic patterns instruct us on the parameters governing the dynamics of phyllotaxis. Disorders can thus provide access to the biological watermarks corresponding to the parameter values of this self-organizing system, providing a striking example where disorders inform on mechanisms driving the dynamics of developmental systems."

For this, we kept from the classical deterministic model the assumptions related to the movement of primordia at the meristem through growth and to the definition of inhibitory fields.

It relies on the assumption that the perception sites, corresponding to the cells surrounding the central zone periphery, are stochastically independent of each other. Decisions regarding primordium initiation are taken in a cell-autonomous manner, thus reflecting more realistically the outcome of the initiation signaling pathway in each cell. At a macroscopic level, in each inhibition valley several cells may trigger primordium initiation. The probability to trigger an initiation increases in SMPmacro with the size of the valley when more than one founder cell are likely to contribute to initiation. A variant of this upscaled model consists of defining the probability for a valley to initiate a primordium by the probability of the cell with lowest level of inhibition in this valley.

The authors hypothesized that this change affected the size of the central zone only and not the size of primordia inhibitory fields. Corresponding changes in \u0393 were observed to positively correlate with the frequency of organ permutations and negatively correlate with plastochron, as predicted by our model.

As discussed above, this change in disorder intensity could theoretically be due to an alteration of initiation perception in the mutant. However, the stochastic model suggests that it is not the case.

A stochastic process models the perception of inhibitory fields by individual cells of the organogenetic domain and, at a higher scale, the initiation of primordia (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This process is continuous in essence and its results are independent of the time discretization chosen for the simulation. In contrast to previous models, the stochastic model does not use any inhibition threshold to decide either to produce an initiation or not. Instead, at each moment there is a non-zero probability to trigger initiation in any cell but this probability depends on the inhibition level in that cell, providing a realistic abstraction of the underlying signaling mechanism (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>)."

These alterations take the form of permutations of the order of organ initiation in the meristem. If the plastochron is small as frequently observed in real sequences of permuted organs, permutations in the model can be considered equivalent to co-initiations that have been identified in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> meristem as the main source of permutations observed on the inflorescence stem. Less frequently, simulated permutations can have longer plastochrons. In this case, they can be interpreted as true permutations of the order of organ initiation in the meristem, consistently with the low frequency of such meristematic permutations observed also in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Besnard et al., 2014</a>). These results are in line with a previous attempt at introducing stochasticity in the classical deterministic model that could also induce permutations (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mirabet et al., 2012</a>). However in this latter work only a limited frequency of defects could be induced (even when the noise was fixed at high levels), while requiring time discretization and post-meristematic randomization of organ order when more than one organ initiation were detected in the same simulation time step. By contrast, the capacity of the stochastic model to reproduce faithfully perturbed sequences as observed in Arabidopsis indicates that the model captures accurately the dynamics of the phyllotactic system. Taken with the fact that permutations are observed in a variety of species and genotypes from a given species, our theoretical results identify noise on the plastochron as a common characteristic of phyllotaxis systems\u00a0that may generate disorders in these developmental systems."

A major contribution of stochasticity in signaling is supported by the robustness of the model to changes in different assumptions and parameters. However we have observed that spatial discretization for example can modify the frequency of permutations in the model, although this effect is limited (see Appendix section 6.2). A possible interpretation is that changes in the size of cells could also contribute to a certain point to noise on the plastochron, an idea that could be further explored."

Our work thus suggests that a robust self-organization of a 3D developmental system driven by lateral inhibition depends both on the geometr of inhibitory fields in a tissue but also on the signaling capacities of cells in tissues. These theoretical observations are consistent with the key role of signaling in phyllotaxis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vernoux et al., 2011</a>), and with the setting of patterning dynamics in animal systems, downstream of morphogenetic signals (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kutejova et al., 2009</a>). This pinpoints the interplay between global information provided by signal distribution and local interpretation of the information as a general principle for patterning emergence. In addition, we predict that due to pre-specification of initiation sites, noise in phyllotaxis is expected mainly on the timing of patterning. This might explain the selection through evolution of genetic mechanisms, such as the one recently described implicating the AHP6 protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Besnard et al., 2014</a>), to diminish noise on plastochron and disorders in phyllotaxis."

Here we show that biological noise at microscopic scale may be revealed at macroscopic scale in the form of organ disorders, the permutations. Our stochastic model of phyllotaxis suggests that these disorders bear information on the more profound, hidden variables that control the phyllotaxis patterning. Much like digital watermarks that represent a copyright or any information to be hidden in images or audio signals, the actual variables (<math id=\"inf262\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>,</mo><msup><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2217</mo></msup></mrow></mstyle></math>) representing the state of the phyllotaxis system are not directly apparent in the plant phenotype (i.e. in the sequence of lateral organ\u00a0angles and\u00a0its\u00a0dynamics).

Movement of AHP6 from organs has been proposed to generate secondary inhibitory fields that filter co-initiation at the meristem, decreasing the frequency of permutations. Based on permutation modifications, our theoretical framework suggests that AHP6 effect on the phyllotactic system does not need to be viewed as an additional specific mechanism acting on plastochron robustness but could be simply interpreted as a mechanism increasing <math id=\"inf268\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi></mrow></mstyle></math> slightly. As no differences in auxin-based inhibitory fields could be detected between <i>ahp6</i> mutant and wild-type plants (<a href=\"#bib6\">Besnard et al., 2014</a>) (Appendix section 4.2), our model thus leads to a vision with composite inhibitory fields resulting at least from the combined effect of auxin-based and AHP6-based subfields.

This provides a reasonable abstraction of local stochastic fluctuations in <i>i</i>) hormonal concentrations related to inhibition produced by each primordium <i>ii</i>) in the activity of the signal transduction pathway leading to initium creation. The detailed molecular mechanisms controlling organ initiation are for the moment only partially known. However the capacity of the stochastic model to capture accurately phyllotaxis suggests that it also captures plausible emergent properties of the underlying molecular mechanisms. This model thus not only provides a framework to understand the dynamics of patterning in the meristem but also the properties of the signaling mechanisms that process the different signals involved. Note also that the predictive capacities of our model suggest that noise on perception could be the most influential source of noise in the system. However demonstrating this would require further exploration of other potential sources of stochasticity acting at different scales, such as growth variations, spatial\u00a0discretization of the peripheral zone (to account for the real\u00a0size of plant\u00a0cells), in order to assess their relative contribution to disorders. Moreover, similarly to the classical deterministic model of phyllotaxis, our stochastic model does not explicitly account for the cascade of molecular processes that participate to the establishment of new inhibitory fields at the location of incipient primordia. This might limit the ability of these models to fully capture the dynamics of the self-organization of the system. To do so, more mechanistic versions of this stochastic model could be developed in the future, combining more detailed cellular models of hormone-based fields, e.g. (<a href=\"#bib32\">J\u00f6nsson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Smith et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stoma et al., 2008</a>), and stochastic perception of these hormonal signals in 2D or 3D models with cell resolution."

As this algorithm is central to the identification of permutations, we additionally tested its ability to detect correctly permutations on synthetic data in which known permutation patterns were introduced (Appendix section 5). Results show that the algorithm is able to detect permutations with a success rate of 98% on average."

If the artificially created \u201cinitial condition\u201d lies outside the basin of attraction of the current pattern, we expect to observe a change of phyllotactic pattern in the subsequent simulation.

(<b>b</b>) When primordia are introduced near the highest or second highest local maxima, the system returns to its previous pattern. Near the third maximum or the third minimum, the system changes pattern, in the shown simulation it converges to a spiral oriented in the opposite direction to the previous spiral (i.e. <math id=\"inf724\"><mrow><mi>\u03c6</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>137.5</mn></mrow></mrow></math> instead of <math id=\"inf725\"><mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>137.5</mn></mrow></math>); a 2-permutation can be seen in the new spiral for the third maximum. New primordia introduced far from any maximum or minimum (black headed arrows) tend to disrupt the phyllotactic mode more significantly, converging to whorled patterns (primordia forced near 0 or near 290), or patterns involving high numbers of successive permutations (primordium forced near 150)."

They suggest that the analysis of the mistakes can help us to understand the mechanism, and they give us an example, the <i>ahp6</i> mutant, that their analysis shows is more likely the result of a reduction in size of the inhibitory field about primordia, rather than a change in meristem size. This would allow us to distinguish between these two choices. This is not really proof that this is the case, but rather a proof of principle that the idea has discriminating power. In this case there are other possibilities that would need to be excluded, such as increased/decreased noise in location selection due to changes in cell size, or any other input that could affect noise in the system."

The submitted manuscript, however, shows that \"the other side\" of real phyllotactic patterns, namely their perturbations, can also be informative in terms of shoot development regulation. The authors present two models of phyllotactic pattern generation: in the first model the \"classical\" assumptions often used in phyllotactic pattern models are employed; in the second one stochastic factors are added. Patterns generated with the aid of two models are compared with one another as well as with the empirical data, mainly on Arabidopsis inflorescence phyllotaxis (wild type and mutants). I would like to point several advantages of the presented stochastic model: it accounts for expansion (growth) of the apex surface; primordia simulated in the model are generated by groups of \"cells\" which all contribute to the pattern formation; the model reproduces real phyllotactic patterns as shown by comparison of pattern parameters, in particular the disorders in the patterns; the biological meaning of the variables used in the model is thoroughly and critically discussed, and those that can have the biological meaning assigned are recognized."

Nevertheless, the relative size of primordia in Arabidopsis is large, and they are not densely packed around its SAM (low numbers of contact parastichies), while in other species primordia are relatively small and densely packed. I understand that the phyllotaxis parameters used for comparison with model generated phyllotaxis, are not available for these species, but these cases could be to larger extent referred to. For example, shoots with relatively small primordia and short plastochrons (conifer twigs, Asteraceae capitulum) would support the model conclusion on relationships between plastochron duration and frequency of permutations (Results); just have a look on the already dead Christmas tree thicker twigs or trunk, and you will most likely find some permutations in support of the model."

From what I understand of the model in this paper (and I may be wrong) this fundamental property is not a feature. The ability of the system to form patterns dynamically from random starting points is however captured by less abstracted models based on polarity feed-back from auxin concentrations (Jonsson et al., 2006)."

Auxin is dynamically distributed over time to create spacing similar to a Turing mechanism. Again, the spacing process for all auxin peaks occurs spontaneously and dynamically. From the supplied description I am still not convinced this model captures this dynamic. In other words, in current models based on auxin transport (e.g. Johnson et al. (2006), an inhibitory field isn't specified only after a primordium is specified (as seems to be the case here), it is being generated dynamically during the process of specification i.e. auxin build-up. Hence the whole process can adjust to changing conditions as they occur \u2013 it is dynamic. In contrast, in the whorl simulations here, it seems an initial position is specified by noise and then others are specified in quick succession at a spacing that allows several to form around the apex in the same plastochron but not really in a spontaneous manner."

Appendix, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), different initial conditions can lead to different phyllotactic patterns (the branches of the bifurcation diagram), each pattern having a basin of attraction composed of those initial conditions that converge to the corresponding phyllotactic pattern. From this general principle, we expect that forcing a primordium at an arbitrary position may lead to a permanent change of phyllotaxis (if the artificially created initial condition lies outside the basin of attraction of the current pattern). This expected behavior is exactly what we observed and in fact we were able to classify the initial conditions that typically lead to a change of phyllotactic mode and those that did not (including the previously treated case of a primordium introduced at the second local minimum), as reported in Appendix, Section 6.7 and Appendix <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and we mentioned this control experiment in the main text."

I understand that the phyllotaxis parameters used for comparison with model generated phyllotaxis, are not available for these species, but these cases could be to larger extent referred to. For example, shoots with relatively small primordia and short plastochrons (conifer twigs, Asteraceae capitulum) would support the model conclusion on relationships between plastochron duration and frequency of permutations (Results); just have a look on the already dead Christmas tree thicker twigs or trunk, and you will most likely find some permutations in support of the model.</i>"
