To address this issue, we have developed long-term, continuous, fast and high-resolution imaging of growth cone dynamics from axon growth to synapse formation in cultured Drosophila brains. Using R7 photoreceptor neurons as a model we show that &gt;90% of the growth cone filopodia exhibit fast, stochastic dynamics that persist despite ongoing stepwise layer formation. Correspondingly, R7 growth cones stabilize early and change their final position by passive dislocation. N-Cadherin controls both fast filopodial dynamics and growth cone stabilization. Surprisingly, loss of N-Cadherin causes no primary targeting defects, but destabilizes R7 growth cones to jump between correct and incorrect layers. Hence, growth cone dynamics can influence wiring specificity without a direct role in target recognition and implement simple rules during circuit assembly."

The function then calculates for each TrackID the number of extension and retraction events it experienced during that filopodium's lifetime, as well as the mean and standard deviation for extension, retraction and combined speeds. The user is asked for an input (in \u03bcm) defining the amount of extension/retraction length (default=0.3 \u03bcm) that will be considered insignificant, i.e. the filopodium will be assumed static for that 1 minute step. The function then outputs the number of extension and retraction events above that threshold (\"filtered\"), as well as speeds calculated from only these (above-threshold) events. The function also calculates the mean and standard deviation of a filopodium's length (\u03bcm) during its lifetime. These parameters are written in a new Excel file. Finally, the function creates the heat-maps used (and explained) in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

To address this issue, we have developed long-term, continuous, fast and high-resolution imaging of growth cone dynamics from axon growth to synapse formation in cultured Drosophila brains. Using R7 photoreceptor neurons as a model we show that &gt;90% of the growth cone filopodia exhibit fast, stochastic dynamics that persist despite ongoing stepwise layer formation. Correspondingly, R7 growth cones stabilize early and change their final position by passive dislocation. N-Cadherin controls both fast filopodial dynamics and growth cone stabilization. Surprisingly, loss of N-Cadherin causes no primary targeting defects, but destabilizes R7 growth cones to jump between correct and incorrect layers. Hence, growth cone dynamics can influence wiring specificity without a direct role in target recognition and implement simple rules during circuit assembly."

The function then calculates for each TrackID the number of extension and retraction events it experienced during that filopodium's lifetime, as well as the mean and standard deviation for extension, retraction and combined speeds. The user is asked for an input (in \u03bcm) defining the amount of extension/retraction length (default=0.3 \u03bcm) that will be considered insignificant, i.e. the filopodium will be assumed static for that 1 minute step. The function then outputs the number of extension and retraction events above that threshold (\"filtered\"), as well as speeds calculated from only these (above-threshold) events. The function also calculates the mean and standard deviation of a filopodium's length (\u03bcm) during its lifetime. These parameters are written in a new Excel file. Finally, the function creates the heat-maps used (and explained) in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

However, most previous studies have relied on identifying mutant flies with disrupted brain wiring and studying them using still images. Now, \u00d6zel et al. have developed a new imaging method that has enough resolution and speed over sufficiently long periods to track the growing nerve endings in a developing fly brain. The method was applied to a model nerve cell in the fly\u2019s visual system. This revealed that most of this nerve\u2019s dynamic changes are short-lived and random, and appear to help to stabilize the developing nerve ending, rather than guide it to a target. \u00d6zel et al. also found that a protein called N-Cadherin, previously thought to be required for the targeting of developing nerve endings, actually plays a role in their stabilization."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1i,l</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, the distance between the terminals of R7 and R8 axons increase significantly after 19 hr ex vivo and in vivo (blue and green arrows). In contrast, a prominent rearrangement of neuropils, where the lamina repositions itself around the medulla, appeared to occur only partially ex vivo (red arrows <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1k\u2013l</a>). We next compared 18 hr ex vivo and in vivo development of photoreceptor axon projections starting at P + 40%. We observed increases of both lamina and distal medulla thickness (between arrowheads) that occurred both ex vivo and in vivo, suggesting similar developmental progress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1m\u2013p</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These observations suggest that large-scale morphological rearrangement may require factors outside of the eye-brain complex but may have no obvious effects on axon targeting inside the brain."

However, this undercount affected filopodia of different lengths equally, resulting in the same mean lengths (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>).

Initial high filopodial activity coincides with the beginning of layer separation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, upper panel) as lamina neuron axons intercalate between R7 and R8 terminals (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ting, 2005</a>).

In addition, these late-stage filopodia often develop bulbous-like tips (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, arrows) unlike any of the earlier filopodia. These observations suggest previously undescribed filopodial dynamics that start after P + 55%. During and after this time the R7 terminal undergoes a transition from a morphologically distinct growth cone to an elongated structure with a branched axon shaft, reminiscent of previously observed axonal filopodia in spinal cord culture (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gallo and Baas, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Spillane, et al., 2012</a>) .However, we only observed filopodia within the medulla neuropil where active layer formation and synapse formation occurs, and not on the main axon leading to the medulla neuropil ( <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In summary, distinct growth cone structures accompany separate developmental events and suggest different roles of filopodia during columnar restriction, layer separation and synaptogenesis."

Transient filopodia constitute more than 90% of all filopodia at P + 28% and more than 70% of all filopodia at P + 60% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Remarkably, these filopodia exhibit indistinguishable dynamics throughout pupation. We measured no significant changes in their mean lengths (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>), average speed of extension and retraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), levels of inactivity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>) and the variance of these measurements (blue traces in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013f</a>). Hence, these dynamics do not correlate with any particular developmental time period or event. Instead, the transient filopodial extensions suggest a continuous function for the even spatial distribution of the columnar and layer structure throughout early developmental stages. The number of transient filopodia reduces increasingly with time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) while more cellular processes solidify the adult anatomy."

A first type of stable filopodia exists up to P + 35% and then rapidly vanishes before P + 50%. These filopodia are significantly longer than transient filopodia, with some exploring up to two columns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b, d</a>). Surprisingly, their average speed and inactivity (i.e. intervals with no significant extension or retraction) are not significantly different from transient filopodia at this stage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e, f</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This indicates that at early stages some filopodia appear stable only because they are longer. Unlike the earlier stable filopodia, those that emerge after P + 55% exhibit a significantly greater inactivity compared to both the transient filopodia at this stage as well as the filopodia in earlier stages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Combined with their peculiar bulbous tips (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), they define a distinct class of filopodia in both structure and dynamics. The two types of stable filopodia correlate with different developmental subprograms: The first type accompanies columnar stabilization and restriction of the growth cone, while more layers are being formed. In contrast, the second type of stable filopodia emerges after layers are defined and interactions with presumptive synaptic partners commence. The time period around P + 50% where stable filopodia are absent matches precisely the moment when the final R7 and R8 layers are defined."

At P + 30% the R7 growth cone exhibits a cone-shape that expands towards the terminal ending from its thin axonal process (triangle in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a> = 0). Over the next 18 hr we observed a gradual change of this shape, but no extension away from it (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). How does the R7 axon accommodate new layer formation in the expanding distal medulla without extension? As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a> new varicosity emerges distally on the axon shaft of the cone-shaped growth cone (t = 5 hr, arrow). This varicosity expands to give the entire terminal a bipartite structure (t = 5\u201314 hr); these observations suggest the intercalation of a new layer and support the passive model. Importantly, the continuous observation of the same growth cone and its dynamics (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) unequivocally reveals the lack of active extension without the need for a stationary landmark that is necessary in fixed images to verify movement."

At the 2.5\u2009hr mark a varicosity starts to develop from the axon shaft and expands over the next 15\u2009hr, contributing to the elongation of the R7 axon. Note that being able to follow the same growth cone tip based on its unique filopodial structure allows us to verify lack of active extension without a stationary landmark. (2) R7 and R8 photoreceptors were sparsely labeled with CD4-tdGP using hs-FLP. Imaging started at P42% and continued for 21\u2009hr. We used an alternating slow (30\u00a0min intervals) imaging of the general structure and fast (1\u00a0min interval) imaging of two neighboring R7 and R8 growth cones at higher resolution at different time points. R8 axon relocates to its final layer by sending a single filopodia proximally, which is initially very dynamic but later stabilizes and expands in the new layer, forming the new R8 terminal. In contrast, R7 terminal elongates along the axon shaft, but no directed extension activity is observed on the growth cone."

For example, the homophilic adhesion molecule N-Cadherin (CadN) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hatta et al., 1985)</a>has emerged as a major regulator of synaptic layer specificity and its loss of function causes R7 mistargeting to the R8 layer\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Ting, 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee, et al., 2001)</a>.

We used this system to investigate the role of R7 growth cone dynamics during layer formation throughout a 3-day developmental period. Our findings provide new insights into a major role of filopodia during column- and layer-specific growth cone stabilization.

Instead, other axons and dendrites intercalate while R7 growth cones define the most proximal boundary of the distal medulla. Hence, R7 must stably maintain their position while active intercalation of other neurons, e.g. R8 extension, pushes the R7 layer proximally (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). This stabilization is consistent with continued filopodial extension/retraction dynamics that are decreasingly required as the final adult column and layer organization solidifies.

Filopodia on this extended R7 axon are reminiscent of axonal filopodia observed in spinal cord culture (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gallo and Baas, 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib38\">Spillane, et al., 2012</a>), but restricted to the axon shaft inside the medulla neuropil where layer formation and synaptogenesis occur (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b, c</a>). Before P + 40%, we only observe filopodia at the axon tips as in classical growth cones. Therefore, we suggest these structures are still growth cones although they appear to use filopodia as a means to stabilize rather than as a substrate for migration. We think that the subsequent transition morphologies could reasonably be interpreted as an extended growth cone or a distinct and short part of the proximal axon that got recruited to new active functions during layer formation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>)."

Instead, growth cones fail to stabilize and engage in an aberrant process of \u2018jumping\u2019 between incorrect and correct layers. Remarkably, CadN-deficient R7 growth cones retain the ability to jump between distal medulla layers for days after their normal targeting should have been concluded and stabilized, presumably through the filopodial dynamics described here. CadN has been shown to localize to the filopodia of R1-6 photoreceptor axons in the lamina neurpil (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schwabe et al., 2013</a>); we speculate that R7 growth cones could use the surface area of their filopodia to form stabilizing adhesions through CadN. Consistent with this interpretation, loss of CadN reduces filopodial extension/retraction dynamics and \u2018jumps\u2019 between medulla layers are preceded by a slow, several hours-long filopodial retraction process."

This finding is consistent with a growth cone stabilization function via interactions with many different medulla cells, independent of the correct synaptic partners. This idea is further consistent with the widespread expression of CadN in many cell types. In sum, our data together with previous observations support a \u2018non-guidance cue\u2019 function for CadN in stabilizing the positions and contacts of neurites once the targeting is complete. Indeed, several cell adhesion molecules previously thought to function as guidance cues have recently been shown to exert \u2018non-cue\u2019 functions cell-autonomously\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Petrovic and Schmucker, 2015)</a>\u00a0and through implementing simple developmental rules\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Hassan and Hiesinger, 2015</a>). Initial R7 targeting to the correct layer could be achieved by other molecules or by a developmental rule such as <i>'stop at the first target layer encountered past the pioneer R8 axon, and then stabilize'</i>. It is possible that such a rule could result in the correct initial targeting of R7 and L-cell axons simply by their arrival order (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), requiring no layer-specific molecular code (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hassan and Hiesinger, 2015</a>)."

We compared the images of R7 growth cones of a P + 27% brain acquired by above setup with those acquired by a conventional Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope with a resonant scanner, using a 63X Glycerol objective (NA = 1.3). A resonant scanner provides superior scan speeds compared to standard two-photon systems. However, we observed a decrease in signal intensity and quality with the confocal microscope at tissue deeper than 60 \u03bcm from the coverslip (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2i</a>). Even at moderately deep tissue, the laser power required on the confocal system to acquire images with comparable quality to the two-photon system is too high to take advantage of the higher scan speeds for extended periods (data not shown). Nevertheless, the resonant scanner would still be the preferred option for imaging at low depths when speed is the most important factor."

Heat maps of lengths versus time for all filopodia in a growth cone were also generated. In those, filopodia were sorted by the angle of their orientation at the time of their initial formation. We did not find any overall, significant difference between the average speeds of extension and retraction on any growth cone; so they were combined to calculate a single average speed for all further analysis. We considered any changes in length less than 0.3 \u03bcm between consecutive time points as zero movement or 'static' periods because manual segmentation cannot be precise enough to reliably account for such a small retraction or extension. Average speeds were therefore calculated only from the points that had a change in length greater than 0.3 \u03bcm. We used the ratio of static time points to the lifetime of a filopodium to calculate 'inactivity' <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>."

Where needed statistical differences were calculated with unpaired, parametric t-tests. Filopodia number percentages over time in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a> were fitted with second order polynomials to generate curves. For inactivity measurements, we generated two different graphs. Due to their short lifetimes, many transient filopodia have zero inactivity by definition; resulting in drastically lower average inactivity for transient filopodia compared to other filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2g\u2013i</a>). This may unfairly imply an intrinsic difference of dynamics between transient and stable filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2j</a>). Indeed, when the filopodia with \u2018zero inactivity\u2019 are excluded, their average inactivity is statistically identical with the early-stage stable filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2k</a>).

It has long been known that insect head and compound eye development can proceed in culture and some acute imaging of the windowed or dissected brain has been performed previously (e.g. Medioni et al., 2015; Rabinovich et al., 2015) but the current study takes this simple system to a new and exciting level. The authors use this system in combination with MARCM clones to define the temporal periods and spatial properties of R-cell filopodial dynamics during target acquisition and stabilization in the optic lobes. Through careful comparison between fixed tissue and live imaging, they argue that many, if not most, features of R-cell connectivity are recapitulated in culture. This analysis of wild type genotypes reveals different phases of filopodial exploratory behavior in R cell growth cones. Moreover, analysis of <i>CadN</i> mutants also illustrates the value of live imaging, as some aspects of CadN function that have been speculated based on end-point or static analysis can be demonstrated. This is a very clear and well-documented methods paper with significant potential for future applications and for use of molecular markers and antibodies to define cell biological mechanisms underlying these dynamic processes. The reviewers agree that the work is of high quality (the movies are remarkable) and appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>. However, there are a few issues that authors should address, most of which are textual."

As new layers form, the R7 growth cone undergoes shape changes that include a more typical growth cone morphology early on (see P+20-P+30% in new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>), a bipolar structure with an added density in a newly forming layer (P+50%; red arrow in new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>), thickening of the axon shaft and formation of extensions in layers where synapse formation occurs (P+60%-80% in new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>). Before P+40%, we only observe filopodia at the axon tips as in classical growth cones. Therefore, we suggest these structures are still growth cones although they appear to use filopodia as a means to stabilize rather than as a substrate for migration. We think that the subsequent transition morphologies could reasonably be interpreted as an extended growth cone or a distinct and short part of the proximal axon that got recruited to new active functions during layer formation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>)."

We find these late filopodia more comparable to the axonal filopodia described by the Gallo group (e.g. Spillane et al., 2011 and 2012). However, the axonal filopodia observed in their ex vivo culture of the spinal cord appear to us more regularly spaced along long stretches of axon. In contrast, the filopodia we observed are extending only from specific regions of the axon-growth cone structure within the medulla neuropil, and never on the main axon leading to the neuropil. These filopodia are characteristic for the corresponding developmental processes in these layers, both spatially and temporally, as described in detail throughout the revised manuscript. We now provide a more detailed description of growth cone and filopodial dynamics and the Spillane et al. citations in the Results section 3 and in a separate paragraph in the Discussion section entitled \u2018The role of filopodia\u2019."

First, CadN is present on numerous non-target cells throughout layer formation (e.g. Nern et al. 2008) and the R7 <i>CadN</i> mutant phenotype does not exhibit a selective reduction of specific filopodial contacts that could become nascent synapses, but really only a general slowdown of <i>all</i> filopodia throughout the entire layer formation process.

However, at this point we cannot distinguish between an active signaling role and a \u2018persistent state of plasticity/receptivity\u2019, partly because we have not yet localized specific signaling receptors into the dynamic map.

Only live imaging of the dynamics could reveal that the mutant termini did not have a primary targeting defect, but are in fact destabilized after reaching to the correct target.
