RecJ is the only 5\u00b4 nuclease involved in the RecF recombination pathway. Here, we report the crystal structures of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> RecJ in complex with deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), ssDNA and the C-terminal region of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB-Ct). A terminal 5\u00b4-phosphate-binding pocket determines the 5\u00b4-3\u00b4 polarity of the deoxy-exonuclease of RecJ; a helical gateway at the entrance to the active site admits ssDNA only; and the continuous stacking interactions between protein and nine nucleotides ensure the processive end resection. The active site of RecJ contains two divalent cations that coordinate the nucleophilic water. The C-terminal domain of RecJ binds the SSB-Ct, which explains how RecJ and SSB work together to efficiently process broken DNA ends for homologous recombination."
