A recent NMR study was unable to detect the <i>trans</i> clamping interaction of complexin and therefore questioned the previous interpretation of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer and isothermal titration calorimetry data on which the <i>trans</i> clamping model was originally based. Here we present new biochemical data that underscore the validity of our previous interpretation and the continued relevancy of the <i>trans</i> insertion model for complexin clamping."

A recent NMR study was unable to detect the <i>trans</i> clamping interaction of complexin and therefore questioned the previous interpretation of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer and isothermal titration calorimetry data on which the <i>trans</i> clamping model was originally based. Here we present new biochemical data that underscore the validity of our previous interpretation and the continued relevancy of the <i>trans</i> insertion model for complexin clamping."

Genetic and physiological studies in a number of model systems show that CPX inhibits the spontaneous release of neurotransmitters and is also essential for synchronous exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Maximov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). CPX \u2018clamps\u2019 the SNARE assembly process to prevent the continuous release of neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib6\">Giraudo et al., 2006</a>). It does so by stabilizing the SNAREs in an otherwise unavailable \u2018intermediate\u2019 energetic state in which the four helix bundle is about 50% zippered (<a href=\"#bib15\">Li et al., 2011</a>)."

We found that the CPX central helix (CPX<sub>cen</sub>, the SNARE-binding domain) binds one SNAREpin while the accessory helix (CPX<sub>acc</sub>, the clamping domain) extends away and bridges to a second SNAREpin. The CPX<sub>acc</sub> interacts with the t-SNARE in the second SNAREpin, occupying the v-SNARE binding site, thus inhibiting the full assembly of the SNARE complex.

                                "text": "In our earlier paper we used ITC experiments to confirm that the CPX<sub>acc</sub> interacts with the t-SNARE in the truncated pre-fusion SNARE complex (SNARE\u039460) as predicted by the X-ray crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). To measure this interaction, we blocked the central helix binding site by pre-binding the SNARE\u039460 complex with a truncated form of CPX (CPX-48; residues 48\u2013134) before titration. In the recent report by <a href=\"#bib24\">Trimbuch et al. (2014)</a> the authors suggest that the 1.5 molar excess of the CPX-48 that was used to block the CPX<sub>cen</sub> binding does not saturate the central helix binding site and the heat observed upon addition of CPX to blocked SNARE\u039460 arises from the completion of CPX<sub>cen</sub> binding rather than from interactions involving the CPX<sub>acc</sub>. This was primarily based on their ITC data which showed that CPX-47 (CPX47\u2013134) binds to truncated complex SNARE\u220660 with an affinity constant (K<sub>d</sub>) = 2.39 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b5M and to non-truncated SNARE complex with K<sub>d</sub> = 339 \u00b1 9 nM (<a href=\"#bib24\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>). The binding constant for full-length CPX and a non-truncated SNARE complex is reported to be \u223c20 nM (<a href=\"#bib19\">Pabst et al., 2002</a>) and, given that CPX-48 has an intact central helix including all SNARE-interacting residues (residues 48, 52, 69, and 70) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2002</a>), the expectation would be that CPX-48 and full-length CPX bind to the non-truncated SNARE complex with similar affinities. This discrepancy prompted us to repeat their ITC experiments and, under our experimental conditions, the K<sub>d</sub> for CPX-48 binding to the post-fusion SNARE complex was 43 \u00b1 7 nM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), much closer to the value reported for the full-length CPX (<a href=\"#bib19\">Pabst et al., 2002</a>). We found further that CPX-48 bound the pre-fusion SNARE\u039460 with a K<sub>d</sub> = 457 \u00b1 47 nM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), or about five times more tightly than reported by <a href=\"#bib24\">Trimbuch et al. (2014)</a>. These binding constants ensure the near saturation (\u223c96%) of the central helix binding site under the conditions (1.5 molar excess of CPX-48) reported in <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al. (2011)</a>. Thus, with the blocked SNARE\u039460, only the interaction between CPX<sub>acc</sub> and t-SNARE would be measured. This is supported by the fact that the interaction affinity could be modulated by the mutations in CPX<sub>acc</sub>. Hydrophobic mutations (D27L, E34F, R37A) increased the binding affinity (approximately eightfold stronger than the wild-type, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), while the introduction of charged residues (A30E, A31E, L41E, A44E) abolished the interaction (<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>)."

We note that in these experiments as well as those reported in K\u00fcmmel et al. we titrated full-length CPX (residues 1\u2013134) into the blocked SNARE\u039460, and not the minimal functional domain (residues 26\u201383) as we had implied (\u201cwe used a complexin construct comprising both the central and accessory helices [residues 26\u201383]\u201d [<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>]), and we apologize for this reporting error.

The latter is of particular significance since the quantitation of small proteins/peptide (&lt;7 kDa) is highly dependent on the method used. However, we are unable to pinpoint the differences in protocol between the two studies since several relevant experimental details (e.g., whether affinity tags were present or what method was used for protein quantification) are not described in Trimbuch et al. Another discrepancy with regard to the ITC measure may derive from the way the blocked SNARE\u039460 complex was assembled. In our experience, assembly of SNARE complex with VAMP60 or similarly truncated VAMP using only the concentration\u2013dilution cycles as carried out in the Trimbuch et al. report results in heterogeneous samples, with non-productive aggregates and un-assembled components not very effectively removed by the concentration cycle. In our experimental regimen we always purified the truncated SNARE complex on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column to ensure good quality of the assembled complexes. Column-purified SNARE\u039460 complexes were subsequently incubated with gel-filtration purified CPX-48 to form the blocked SNARE\u039460 complex used in the ITC experiments. We also note that <a href=\"#bib19\">Pabst et al. (2002)</a> used a more stringent purification protocol (Mono-Q purification) even though they used a different SNAP25 construct for the preparation of the SNARE complexes for their ITC studies and report K<sub>d</sub> values similar to our findings (<a href=\"#bib19\">Pabst et al., 2002</a>). The samples used by Trimbuch et al. for the NMR analysis appear to be homogeneous, however."

We placed the donor probe on SNAP25, acceptor probe on CPX<sub>acc</sub>, and used donor quenching to track the positioning of the CPX<sub>acc</sub> in the pre- and post-fusion SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). The FRET data were consistent with the CPX<sub>acc</sub> locating parallel to the SNARE complex in the fully-assembled SNARE complex, but moving away from the SNAREs in the pre-fusion half-zippered complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). In <a href=\"#bib24\">Trimbuch et al. (2014)</a>, based on NMR analysis, it was stated that the CPX<sub>acc</sub> helix is poorly structured even when bound to the SNARE complex and exhibits higher flexibility with c-terminal truncation of VAMP. The authors therefore suggested that the low FRET state we observed in the pre-fusion SNAREpin and assign to the \u2018angled\u2019 conformation can be explained by the enhanced flexibility of the CPX<sub>acc</sub> in this complex. Even though this is not in contradiction to the <i>trans</i> clamping model we have proposed, there are several lines of evidence (<a href=\"#bib12\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>) arguing against this interpretation. (1) We observe a well-defined \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 FRET state for CPX bound to the post- and pre-fusion SNARE using two different FRET pairs with different R<sub>0</sub> values (Stilbene/Bimane, R<sub>0</sub> \u223c27\u00c5 and Bimane/Oregon Green, R<sub>0</sub> \u223c38\u00c5), and the FRET distances in these CPX\u2013SNARE complexes match very well with the predicted distance in the pre- and post-fusion crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). Further, a study by Choi et al. suggests that a completely unstructured CPX would result in a higher FRET signal than a more structured form (<a href=\"#bib4\">Choi et al., 2011</a>), so the decrease in FRET efficiency for CPX bound to SNARE\u039460 is not consistent with increased disorder. (2) For both the FRET pairs tested, acceptor placed at residue 31 on CPX<sub>acc</sub> shows weaker FRET compared with residue 38, consistent with the idea that the CPX<sub>acc</sub> extends away from the pre-fusion SNARE complex, with dye on residue 31 locating further away from the donor (on SNAP25) than the dye on residue 38 (<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). (3) In the accompanying paper (<a href=\"#bib12\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>), we tested the effect of VAMP truncation on the orientation of CPX<sub>acc</sub> and observed the same well-defined low FRET state (\u223c15% FRET) for CPX bound to SNARE\u220669, SNARE\u220665, or SNARE\u220660 complexes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). But NMR analysis for same or similarly truncated SNARE complexes showed equally dramatic enhancement of local flexibility in CPX<sub>acc</sub> with increasing truncation on the VAMP c-terminus (SNARE\u220668 versus SNARE\u220662 versus SNARE\u220660 in <a href=\"#bib24\">Trimbuch et al. (2014)</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>). (4) Finally, the FRET signal we observed in the \u2018low\u2019 FRET state is higher than the FRET signal obtained when we used a CPX construct with enhanced flexibility (CPX\u2013GPGP) in which a helix-breaking GPGP linker was inserted between the central and accessory helices of CPX for either SNARE\u220660 or the post-fusion SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Trimbuch et al. argued that, since we observe only a small change in FRET signal for CPX\u2013GPGP compared with CPX\u2013SNARE\u220660, the results obtained with the GPGP mutant are not conclusive. To address this concern we tested CPX\u2013GPGP bound to SNARE\u220660 and SNARE complex using the medium range Bimane/Oregon green FRET pair (R<sub>0</sub> \u223c38\u00c5). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the GPGP insertion results in a dramatic decrease in the FRET signal, with the CPX<sub>acc</sub> locating further away from both SNARE\u220660 and the SNARE complex. These data suggest that the increased flexibility does not explain the decreased FRET signal in the pre-fusion truncated SNARE complex."

We note that the prediction from our model is that the <i>trans</i> CPX<sub>acc</sub>\u2013t-SNARE interactions would lead to the formation of CPX/SNARE\u039460 polymers, which would not be visible in NMR studies due to line broadening. Thus, if there is a <i>trans</i> interaction, then the NMR technique may not be well suited for its interrogation. This cross-linked high-order oligomeric state is evident qualitatively in the ITC experiments where we titrated full-length CPX into unblocked SNARE\u039460 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, black circles) similarly suggests that CPX26\u201383/SNARE\u039460 complexes begin to oligomerize at the concentration regime used in Trimbuch et al.

The DLS data are consistent with a model predicting the size of the oligomers (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details on the model, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, black line) which incorporates the K<sub>d</sub> of \u223c25 \u00b5M obtained from our ITC analysis of the CPX26\u201383 and blocked SNARE\u039460 interaction. In contrast, we observe only a small change in the apparent size if we disrupt the binding of CPX<sub>acc</sub> to t-SNARE either by introducing non-clamping mutations (ncCPX26\u201383; A30E, A31E, L41E, A44E) in CPX<sub>acc</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, blue circles) or by blocking the t-SNARE groove using a fully assembled ternary SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, green circles). Based on our oligomerization model, this small change in the particle size could only be fitted by assuming a very low affinity interaction (K<sub>d</sub> \u2265 250 \u00b5M) such as might arise from non-specific aggregation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, blue and green lines)."

Because small proteins are difficult to quantitate and because our K<sub>d</sub> values, which depend on concentration measurements for their accuracy, are only approximate, it is plausible that, under the NMR conditions of Trimbuch et al., most of the CPX\u2013SNARE\u039460 complexes were monomeric, with only a small fraction in an oligomeric form. Thus, under the experimental conditions used by Trimbuch et al., CPX<sub>acc</sub> might not have an appreciable interaction with the t-SNARE groove, and the minor bound fraction would not be visible in NMR spectra owing to the large size of the cross-linked oligomers, assuming that there is no exchange between the monomeric and oligomeric forms of CPX\u2013SNARE\u039460.

Specifically, the inhibitory function of CPX has not been observed in the autaptic system: that is, both evoked and spontaneous release are reduced in CPX TKO mice (<a href=\"#bib21\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Xue et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, other preparations like rodent mass cultured neurons with reduced CPX expression and invertebrates lacking CPX exhibit reduced evoked release and enhanced spontaneous release (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, these systems may be more relevant to examine the mechanism of CPX function in regulating vesicle fusion, particularly in its ability to inhibit and regulate spontaneous release. In rescue experiments with rodent mass cultured neurons in which CPX was knocked down, CPX mutants that either enhanced or disrupted the CPX<sub>acc</sub>\u2013SNARE interactions (super-clamp and poor clamp, respectively) resulted in corresponding reductions and enhancements in spontaneous release compared with wild-type CPX controls (<a href=\"#bib29\">Yang et al., 2010</a>). Recent experiments at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction, which in the absence of CPX exhibits large increases in spontaneous release, directly examined the role of a CPX zig-zag array in regulating spontaneous release. Using genetic rescue approaches, CPX mutants predicted to prevent the formation of the zig-zag array (CPX\u2013GPGP) disrupt the ability of CPX to clamp spontaneous release, while mutations predicted to enhance the CPX<sub>acc</sub>\u2013t-SNARE interaction (super-clamp mutation) exhibit a strong clamping ability (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). These results taken together are consistent with a CPX cross-linking model mediating the CPX clamping function to regulate spontaneous release, even though recent reports suggest that the inhibitory and activating functions of CPX may be separable (<a href=\"#bib29\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Lai et al., 2014</a>).

This was based on the finding that increasing or decreasing the net negative charge on CPX<sub>acc</sub> inhibits or stimulates neurotransmitter release, respectively (<a href=\"#bib24\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>). We note that a number of both in vitro and in vivo studies on CPX<sub>acc</sub> modification argue strongly against the electrostatic hindrance model (<a href=\"#bib29\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Radoff et al., 2014</a>). Introducing two (L41E, A44E) or four (A30E, A31E, L41E, A44E) negatively charged mutations in the mammalian CPX<sub>acc</sub> has been shown to entirely abolish or severely diminish the interaction of CPX<sub>acc</sub> with the mammalian or <i>Drosophila</i> t-SNARE, respectively (<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>).

Specifically, ITC binding experiments with blocked SNARE complexes, where a 2.5\u20133-fold excess of blocking peptide was present, have corroborated the interaction of CPX<sub>acc</sub> with the t-SNARE groove in a pre-fusion (truncated) SNARE complex as observed in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, titration of scCPX into unblocked truncated SNARE complex revealed multiple binding sites consistent with independent binding sites for CPX<sub>cen</sub> and scCPX<sub>acc</sub>, thus describing the essential feature of the <i>trans</i> clamping interaction of CPX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). FRET analysis (using two FRET pairs with different R<sub>0</sub> values) with \u2018flexible\u2019 CPX construct (CPX\u2013GPGP) has clearly demonstrated that the low FRET state corresponding to the angled conformation, which describes the <i>trans</i> clamping interaction, is due to discrete conformational change and not because of increased CPX flexibility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). Lastly, the physiological relevance of the insertion model was established by independent genetic rescue experiments in the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction, wherein mutations in CPX that are predicted to prevent the formation of the SNAREpin array were found to disrupt the ability of CPX to clamp spontaneous release (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "All of our data are consistent with a model in which CPX<sub>acc</sub> from one SNAREpin interacts in <i>trans</i> with the t-SNARE groove of a second SNAREpin. As we emphasized in K\u00fcmmel et al., we do not propose that the interactions are necessarily exactly as observed in a single crystal structure for which scCPX was used and where hydrophobic accessory helix residues (which are hydrophilic in wild-type CPX) interact with hydrophobic residues in a partially assembled SNARE complex. Details of the interaction between wild-type CPX<sub>acc</sub> and t-SNARE must be different (they are also weaker, explaining why the wild-type CPX clamps less well), and we can well imagine a scenario in which wild-type CPX<sub>acc</sub> interacts with a slightly different surface of the assembling SNARE complex. In fact, we found that a single mutation in the CPX<sub>acc</sub> (F34M) results in two distinct binding interfaces for scCPX, but both giving rise to the same zig-zag topology. Both interactions involved the same face of CPX<sub>acc</sub> and t-SNARE, although the binding site on t-SNARE was extended by two helical turns for the mutant (<a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). The consideration that interactions of wild-type and scCPX and the SNARE complex are not identical does not, however, exclude the possibility that a <i>trans</i> interaction of some sort is responsible for clamping. We also suspect that yet unknown additional interactions in the pre-fusion complex, which are not represented in our crystal structure, may further stabilize the <i>trans</i> clamping interaction (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Radoff et al., 2014</a>). We do not consider the <i>trans</i> clamping model proven, but it remains the most well-defined model for which a good amount of evidence is available."

To assemble the post-fusion and pre-fusion SNARE\u039460 complex, Syntaxin 1a, SNAP25N, SNAP25C, and VAMP2 or VAMP\u039460 were mixed (molar ratio of 1:1.2:1.2:1.2 for the post-fusion complex and 1:1.2:1.2:1.6 for pre-fusion SNARE\u039460 complex) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The assembled complexes were purified from non-productive aggregates and unassembled components by gel filtration (High-load Superdex 75 16/60, GE Healthcare). To form the blocked SNARE\u039460 complex, purified SNARE\u039460 complex was mixed with 2.5 molar excess of CPX-48 and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C to ensure complete binding. To ensure buffer uniformity to measure the weak interactions, CPX variants and the different SNARE complexes were extensively dialyzed (4 L for 4 hr followed by another 4 L overnight) into the same phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 2 mM potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.25 mM TCEP) before the ITC analysis. The concentrations of dialyzed proteins were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific; Waltham, Ma) and/or Bradford assay (Bio Rad; Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. ITC experiments were performed with a Microcal ITC200 (Malvern Instruments, UK). Typically, \u223c200 \u00b5l of SNARE solution was loaded into the sample cell and \u223c60 \u00b5l of CPX solution was loaded into the syringe.

The heat change from each injection was integrated and then normalized by the moles of CPX in the injection. The thermographs were analyzed by non-linear least squares fit with the one-set-of-sites-model in Microcal Origin ITC200 software package to obtain the stoichiometric number (N), the molar binding enthalpy (\u0394H), and the association constant (K<sub>a</sub>). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>), the binding free energy (\u0394G), and the binding entropy (\u0394S) were calculated using the thermodynamic equations:"

This r<sub>0</sub> value is reasonable considering the dimensions of the CPX\u2013SNARE\u039460 unit within the zig-zag array. Hence, the oligomerization we observe by DLS is consistent with the K<sub>d</sub> values we measured by ITC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In support of the idea that the CPX<sub>acc</sub>\u2013t-SNARE clamping interaction results in the oligomeric state, CPX\u2013SNARE complexes containing either ncCPX26\u201383 (A30E, A31E, L41E, A44E) or the full ternary SNARE complex show only a small change in the average particle radius. This behavior can be modeled using <a href=\"#equ10\">Equation 8</a> with r<sub>0</sub> = 3.8 nm and only if we assume a very low affinity interaction, namely K<sub>d</sub> = 250 \u00b5M for ncCPX into SNARE\u039460 and K<sub>d</sub> = 300 \u00b5M for CPX into the full ternary SNARE complex. This suggests that this change in particle size might be a result of non-specific aggregation. Note that r<sub>0</sub> values for specific and non-specific oligomerization are not necessarily expected to be identical."

Most importantly, the authors measure a ten times higher affinity between the complexin accessory helix and blocked SNARE complex by ITC, and another ITC experiment provides evidence for multiple binding sites of complexin to SNARE complex. The authors speculate that the higher affinity is due to better homogeneity of their purified SNARE complexes, and argue that lower affinity (presumably caused by heterogeneity) of the Trimbuch et al. complexes combined with the high mobility of the side-chains (as determined by the K\u00fcmmel et al. crystal structure) would explain why Trimbuch et al. could not detect an interaction between the complexin accessory domain and SNARE complex by ITC and NMR. The authors also provide arguments that the neuronal culture by Trimbuch et al. may represent a special case, and that the electrostatics hindrance model is in disagreement with other data."

However, the NMR spectra by Trimbuch et al. appear to argue against this possibility (see point 2 below). The increased ITC affinity data for binding of complexin to the truncated SNARE complex compared to the data by Trimbuch et al. is compelling.

We note that other potential differences could be: presence or absence of tags (apparently all tags in the present work have been removed, but there is no information in the paper by Trimbuch et al), the concentration used in the various experiments (there is no information about the protein concentration used for the ITC experiments in the present work), the buffer conditions, and the possibility of oligomers of the various SNARE complexes."

For example, the statement that \u201cthe NMR spectra similarly speak to this flexibility as opposed to complete unfolding\u201d, for example, is not warranted. If the backbone were even somewhat ordered, one would expect substantial chemical shift changes upon interaction, as well as broadening due to the increased spectral density at zero frequency (J(0)), even if the backbone order parameter, S^2, were as low as, say, 0.5. The fact that CPX26-48 shows considerably less helicity (by CD) than CPX(26-83) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) is a valid criticism, as apparently a high degree of alpha helicity of residues 30-48 requires the presence of residues 49-65. However, considering that the accessory helix is clearly in a dynamic equilibrium between transient helix and coil, and this equilibrium is shifted from perhaps 60% helicity (based on 13Ca shifts in Pabst, JBC 2000, to perhaps \u223c10-20% (?) based on the CD data of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) one would still expect to see this interaction as NMR is incredibly sensitive to even very weak binding. So, even while shortening the accessory helix indeed is expected to weaken the affinity, it would not explain the complete absence of an interaction, seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> of Trimbuch or even in the superclamp CPX <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> spectrum of their supplement 2. Even if the affinity were as weak as \u223c1 mM, one would still expect to see the onset of peak shifting and broadening in such spectra."

The NMR spectra presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> of Trimbuch et al. of the full-length and truncated SNARE complex show no sign of heterogeneity of the SNARE complexes themselves. Morever, Trimbuch et al. also do not see any evidence for such an interaction in SCdelta(68) or for the full length complex, and not even for the superclamp-Cpx, whereas comparison of the interactions/shift changes observed for the central helix point to a tight complex for full length SC, with progressively less tight (fast exchange) binding for CPX residues in the \u201clinker region\u201d of complexin (residues 58-69). Notably, more C-terminal CPX resonances (73, 80, 82, 83) are completely unaffected by SCdelta68 and SCdelta62 mutations, and assuming these residues make authentic interactions in the full length complex, these still must be present in the truncated complexes. So, the fact that Trimbuch's central helix residues adopt unique chemical shifts with rather uniform line widths effectively rules out the possibility of a heterogeneous (truncated, 2:1 or otherwise) distribution of truncated SNARE complexes. Other explanations must be provided in the present work in order to criticize the NMR data by Trimbuch et al."

The response of the current paper is to include new data with a FRET pair having a longer Rzero, showing more substantial elimination of FRET due to the GPGP insertion, for which the small but possibly detectable FRET change in the previous experiments with the shorter Rzero dye pair. Despite the fact that the new longer-Rzero, GPGP-insert data support K\u00fcmmel's interpretation that complexin angles away modestly, not totally flexible, the reviewers don't view these FRET experiment as conclusive evidence of either static or dynamic configurations. They don't have the distance or time resolution needed. Rather, they are useful observations that can be consistent with models derived from aggregating several other experiments."

Thus, if the unbound part of complexin were completely unstructured when bound to the truncated SNARE complex, one would expect actually higher FRET efficiency to the label site on the SNARE complex. In contrast, a lower FRET efficiency is observed, consistent with the notion that complexin is in an angled conformation when bound to truncated SNARE complex. However, the mutation shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> induces a further decrease of FRET efficiency, a result that is incompatible if complexin were unstructured (in the subsection headed \u201cFRET Analysis\u201d). Rather, this insertion probably introduces a hinge between the core and accessory domains, which may explain the decreased FRET efficiency. A discussion of these points should be included."

The latter is of particular significance since concentration determination of small proteins/peptide (&lt;7 kDa) are highly dependent on the method used.

For example, the statement that</i> \u201c<i>the NMR spectra similarly speak to this flexibility as opposed to complete unfolding</i>\u201d<i>, for example, is not warranted. If the backbone were even somewhat ordered, one would expect substantial chemical shift changes upon interaction, as well as broadening due to the increased spectral density at zero frequency (J(0)), even if the backbone order parameter, S^2, were as low as, say, 0.5. The fact that CPX26-48 shows considerably less helicity (by CD) than CPX(26-83) (</i><a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5</i></a><i>) is a valid criticism, as apparently a high degree of alpha helicity of residues 30-48 requires the presence of residues 49-65. However, considering that the accessory helix is clearly in a dynamic equilibrium between transient helix and coil, and this equilibrium is shifted from perhaps 60% helicity (based on 13Ca shifts in Pabst, JBC 2000, to perhaps \u223c10-20% (?) based on the CD data of</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5</i></a><i>) one would still expect to see this interaction as NMR is incredibly sensitive to even very weak binding.

Upon further reflection, we note that the prediction from our model is that in-<i>trans</i> CPX<sub>acc</sub>-SNARE\u039460 interactions would lead to the formation of CPX-SNARE 60 polymers at the concentration range used by Trimbuch et al. (\u223c25-50 \u03bcM), and these polymers would not be visible in NMR studies due to line broadening. This cross-linked higher-order oligomeric state is evident qualitatively in the ITC data shown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We have now also observed by DLS that CPX/SNARE60 complexes begin to oligomerize at concentrations of 10-35 \u03bcM (new data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), in the expected range, if there is a in-trans interaction between CPX<sub>acc</sub> and SNARE\u039460 with K<sub>d</sub>\u223c25 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> with CPX26-83,). We suspect that the concentrations used in the Trimbuch et al. NMR studies (25-50 \u03bcM), which are at the lower end of the concentration range used for NMR studies, were adjusted to avoid oligomerization and line broadening effects. Because protein concentrations are difficult to measure accurately, especially for small proteins, and our binding constants (K<sub>d</sub>\u223c25 \u03bcM) are calculated based on the protein concentration, it is plausible that at the concentrations used in the NMR experiments, the complexes were mostly monomeric, with only a small fraction in oligomeric form. Especially if there is no exchange between the monomeric and oligomeric forms of CPX-SNARE\u039460 complexes, then the small fraction of CPXacc/SNARE\u039460 in the oligomers, which would be invisible by NMR, would not be evident from the NMR spectra. Our ITC and the NMR data of Trimbuch et al. are therefore reconcilable, and the NMR data do not necessarily preclude the <i>trans</i> interaction observed by ITC."

Although, it is not entirely clear to us why CPX26-48 does not interact with SNARE\u039460, the CPX26-48 construct clearly behaves very differently in solution from the full length CPX protein. We show data that even CPX26-83 has significantly more helical character than the CPX26-48 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

The response of the current paper is to include new data with a FRET pair having a longer Rzero, showing more substantial elimination of FRET due to the GPGP insertion, for which the small but possibly detectable FRET change in the previous experiments with the shorter Rzero dye pair. Despite the fact that the new longer-Rzero, GPGP-insert data support K\u00fcmmel's interpretation that complexin angles away modestly, not totally flexible, the reviewers don't view these FRET experiment as conclusive evidence of either static or dynamic configurations.

Thus, if the unbound part of complexin were completely unstructured when bound to the truncated SNARE complex, one would expect actually higher FRET efficiency to the label site on the SNARE complex.
