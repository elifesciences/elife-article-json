Yet, statistical artifacts commonly plague the analysis of relative abundance data. Here, we introduce the PhILR transform, which incorporates microbial evolutionary models with the isometric log-ratio transform to allow off-the-shelf statistical tools to be safely applied to microbiota surveys. We demonstrate that analyses of community-level structure can be applied to PhILR transformed data with performance on benchmarks rivaling or surpassing standard tools. Additionally, by decomposing distance in the PhILR transformed space, we identified neighboring clades that may have adapted to distinct human body sites. Decomposing variance revealed that covariation of bacterial clades within human body sites increases with phylogenetic relatedness. Together, these findings illustrate how the PhILR transform combines statistical and phylogenetic models to overcome compositional data challenges and enable evolutionary insights relevant to microbial communities."

Yet, statistical artifacts commonly plague the analysis of relative abundance data. Here, we introduce the PhILR transform, which incorporates microbial evolutionary models with the isometric log-ratio transform to allow off-the-shelf statistical tools to be safely applied to microbiota surveys. We demonstrate that analyses of community-level structure can be applied to PhILR transformed data with performance on benchmarks rivaling or surpassing standard tools. Additionally, by decomposing distance in the PhILR transformed space, we identified neighboring clades that may have adapted to distinct human body sites. Decomposing variance revealed that covariation of bacterial clades within human body sites increases with phylogenetic relatedness. Together, these findings illustrate how the PhILR transform combines statistical and phylogenetic models to overcome compositional data challenges and enable evolutionary insights relevant to microbial communities."

With next generation sequencing, the number of reads per sample can vary independently of microbial load (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lovell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tsilimigras and Fodor, 2016</a>). In order to make measurements comparable across samples, most studies therefore analyze the relative abundance of bacterial taxa. Analyses are thus not carried out on absolute abundances of community members (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), but rather on relative data occupying a constrained geometric space and represented in a non-Cartesian coordinate system (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Such relative abundance datasets are often termed compositional. The use of most standard statistical tools (<i>e.g.,</i> correlation, regression, or classification) within a compositional space leads to spurious results (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>). For example, three-quarters of the significant bacterial interactions inferred by Pearson correlation on a compositional human microbiota dataset were likely false (<a href=\"#bib22\">Friedman and Alm, 2012</a>), and over two-thirds of differentially abundant taxa inferred by a t-test on a simulated compositional human microbiota dataset were spurious (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mandal et al., 2015</a>).

This approach is attractive because of its efficiency: the vast toolbox of existing statistical models can be applied without re-derivation. Normalization methods, for example, have been proposed to modify count data by assuming reads follow certain statistical distributions (<i>e.g.,</i> negative binomial) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Paulson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>). Alternatively, the field of Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) has focused on formalizing methods for transforming compositional data into a simpler geometry without having to assume data adhere to a distribution model (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bacon-Shone, 2011</a>). Previous microbiota analyses have already leveraged CoDA theory and used the centered log-ratio transform to reconstruct microbial association networks and interactions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kurtz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2014</a>) and to analyze differential abundances (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fernandes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gloor et al., 2016b</a>). However, the centered log-ratio transform has a crucial limitation: it yields a coordinate system featuring a singular covariance matrix and is thus unsuitable for many common statistical models (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>). This drawback can be sidestepped using another CoDA transform, known as the Isometric Log-Ratio (ILR) transformation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egozcue et al., 2003</a>). The ILR transform can be built from a sequential binary partition of the original variable space (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), creating a new coordinate system with an orthonormal basis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2005</a>). However, a known obstacle to using the ILR transform is the choice of partition such that the resulting coordinates are meaningful (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>). To date, microbiota studies have chosen ILR coordinates using ad hoc sequential binary partitions of bacterial groups that are not easily interpreted (<a href=\"#bib21\">Finucane et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">L\u00ea Cao et al., 2016</a>). Alternatively, external covariates have been used to pick groups of bacterial taxa to contrast (<a href=\"#bib54\">Morton\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017</a>)."

Analyses of neighboring clades offer the opportunity for biological insight: clade analyses have linked genetic differentiation to ecological adaptation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunt et al., 2008</a>), and the relative levels of sister bacterial genera differentiate human cohorts by diet, geography, and culture (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Filippo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</a>).

Using published environmental and human-associated 16S rRNA datasets as benchmarks, we found that simple Euclidean distances calculated on PhILR transformed data provided a compositionally robust alternative to distance/dissimilarity measures like Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, and Unifrac. In addition, we observed that the accuracy of supervised classification methods on our benchmark datasets was matched or improved with PhILR transformed data relative to applying the same models on untransformed (raw) or log transformed relative abundance data. Decomposing distances between samples along PhILR coordinates identified bacterial clades that may have differentiated to adapt to distinct body sites. Similar decomposition of variance along PhILR coordinates showed that, in all human body sites studied, the degree to which neighboring bacterial clades covary tends to increase with the phylogenetic relatedness between clades. Together, these findings demonstrate that the PhILR transform can be used to enhance existing microbiota analysis pipelines, as well as enable novel phylogenetic analyses of microbial ecosystems."

The second goal is to conduct this transform using phylogenetic information. To achieve these dual goals on a given set of <math id=\"inf2\"><mi>N</mi></math> samples consisting of relative measurements of <math id=\"inf3\"><mi>D</mi></math> taxa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), we transform data into a new space of <math id=\"inf4\"><mi>N</mi></math> samples and <math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2212</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></math> coordinates termed \u2018balances\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egozcue et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2005</a>).

The balance represents the log-ratio of the geometric mean relative abundance of the two clades of taxa that descend from <math id=\"inf9\"><mi>i</mi></math> (Materials and methods). Although individual balances may share overlapping sets of leaves and thus exhibit dependent behavior, the ILR transform rescales and combines leaves to form a coordinate system whose basis vectors are orthonormal and the corresponding coordinates are Cartesian (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egozcue et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2005</a>). The orthogonality of basis vectors allows conventional statistical tools to be used without compositional artifacts. The unit-length of basis vectors makes balances across the tree statistically comparable even when they have differing numbers of descendant tips or exist at different depths in the tree (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>). In addition, the unit-length ensures that the variance of PhILR balances has a consistent scale, unlike the variance of log-ratios originally proposed by Aitchison (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aitchison, 1986</a>) as a measure of association, in which it can be unclear what constitutes a large or small variance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Friedman and Alm, 2012</a>)."

Because zero counts cause problems when computing logs or performing division, zeros are often replaced in microbiota analyses with small non-zero counts. However, to avoid excess zero replacement that may itself introduce bias, stringent hard filtering thresholds are often employed (<i>e.g</i>. removing all taxa that are not seen with at least a minimum number of counts in a subset of samples). Still, hard filtering thresholds may remove a substantial fraction of observed\u00a0taxa and do not account for the low precision (or high variability) of near-zero counts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gloor et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Good, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">McMurdie and Holmes, 2014</a>). We therefore developed a \u2018taxon weighting\u2019 scheme that acts as a type of soft-thresholding, supplementing zero replacement methods with a generalized form of the ILR transform that allows weights to be attached to individual taxa (<a href=\"#bib17\">Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2016</a>). Weights are chosen with a heuristic designed to down weight the influence of taxa with many zero or near-zero counts (Materials and methods)."

For example, because related bacteria may be more likely to share similar traits (<a href=\"#bib48\">Martiny et al., 2015</a>), it may be desirable to consider communities differing only in the abundance of closely-related microbes to be more similar than communities differing only in the abundance of distantly-related microbes. Because of the one-to-one correspondence between PhILR balances and internal nodes on the phylogenetic tree, evolutionary information can be incorporated into the PhILR transform by scaling balances using the phylogenetic distance between their direct descendants (Materials and methods). We note that we employ both branch length weighting and taxon weighting throughout our following analyses except where noted; still, these weights should be considered optional additions to the core PhILR transform."

Microbiota analyses commonly compute the dissimilarity or distance between pairs of samples and use these computed pairwise distances as input to a variety of statistical tools. We investigated how Euclidean distances calculated on PhILR transformed data compared to common ecological measures of microbiota distance or dissimilarity (UniFrac, Bray-Curtis, and Jaccard) as well as Euclidean distance applied to raw relative abundance data in standard distance-based analysis. We chose three different microbiota surveys as reference datasets: Costello Skin Sites (CSS), a dataset of 357 samples from 12 human skin sites (<a href=\"#bib12\">Costello et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Knights et al., 2011</a>); Human Microbiome Project (HMP), a dataset of 4743 samples from 18 human body sites (<i>e.g</i>., skin, vaginal, oral, and stool) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</a>); and, Global Patterns (GP), a dataset of 26 samples from nine human or environmental sites (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caporaso et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Balance variance is a measure of association between neighboring bacterial clades. When the variance of a balance between two clades approaches zero, the mean abundance of taxa in each of the two clades will be linearly related and thus covary across microbial habitats (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lovell et al., 2015</a>). By contrast, when a balance exhibits high variance, related bacterial clades exhibit unlinked or exclusionary patterns across samples. Unlike standard measures of association (<i>e.g.,</i> Pearson correlation) balance variance is robust to compositional effects (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>)."

To determine if this observed pattern was not the result of technical artifact, we took the following three steps. First, we omitted branch length weights from the transform as we anticipated that branch lengths may vary non-randomly as a function of depth in the phylogeny. Second, we anticipated that balances near the tips of the phylogeny would be associated with fewer read counts and thus would be more biased by our chosen heuristics for taxon weighting and zero replacement. We therefore omitted taxon weighting, employed more stringent filtering thresholds, and conditioned our calculation of balance variance on non-zero counts rather than using zero-replacement (Materials and methods). Third, we combined regression and a permutation scheme to test the null hypothesis that the degree to which neighboring clades covary is independent of the phylogenetic distance between them (Materials and methods). By permuting tip labels on the tree, our test generates a restricted subset of random sequential binary partitions that still maintains the count variability (and potential biases due to our zero handling methods) of the observed data."

We also observed that the relationship between balance variance and phylogenetic depth varied at different taxonomic scales.

In fact, in the absence of branch length weights, any random ILR partition would yield equivalent results on our benchmark tasks. Instead, what distinguishes the PhILR transform from other ILR transforms is the interpretability of the transformed coordinates. Balances in PhILR space correspond to speciation events, which can be a source for biological insight."

These balances may reflect functional specialization, as ecological partitioning among recently differentiated bacterial clades could be caused by genetic adaptation to new environments or lifestyles (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunt et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, among oral body sites, we observed consistent site specificity of neighboring bacterial clades within the genera <i>Actinomyces</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) and <i>Streptococcus</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Species within the <i>Actinomyces</i> genera have been previously observed to partition by oral sites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mager et al., 2003</a>). Even more heterogeneity has been observed within the <i>Streptococcus</i> genus, where species have been identified that distinguish teeth, plaque, mucosal, tongue, saliva, and other oral sites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mager et al., 2003</a>). This partitioning likely reflects variation in the anatomy and resource availability across regions of the mouth (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aas et al., 2005</a>), as well as the kinds of surfaces bacterial strains can adhere to (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mager et al., 2003</a>)."

Precisely linking individual <i>Corynebacterium</i> species or strains to body sites is beyond the scope of this study due to the limited taxonomic resolution of 16S rRNA datasets (<a href=\"#bib31\">Janda and Abbott, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">V\u011btrovsk\u00fd and Baldrian, 2013</a>).

We observed that balances between more phylogenetically related clades were significantly more likely to covary than expected by chance. This pattern could reflect evolutionary and ecological forces structuring microbial communities in the human body. Related bacterial taxa have been hypothesized to have similar lifestyle characteristics (<a href=\"#bib48\">Martiny et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zaneveld et al., 2010</a>), and may thus covary in human body sites that favor their shared traits (<a href=\"#bib36\">Levy and Borenstein, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Faust et al., 2012</a>). An alternative explanation for the balance variation patterns we observed is that sequencing errors and read clustering artifacts are likely to produce OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) with similar reference sequences and distributions across samples. While we cannot conclusively rule out this alternative hypothesis, we note that it would not explain why signal for taxa co-variation is weakest for balances at higher taxonomic levels and appears to plateau for balances near or below the species level. A biological explanation for the plateauing signal would be that lifestyle characteristics enabling bacteria to persist in human body sites are conserved among strains roughly corresponding to the same species. Follow-up studies are needed to more conclusively understand how balance variance patterns across the phylogenies can be interpreted from an evolutionary standpoint."

Specifically, we highlight issues relating to our choice of weights, the handling of zero values, and information loss during count normalization. Both the taxa weights and the branch lengths weights we introduce here may be viewed as preliminary heuristics; future work will likely yield additional weighting schemes, as well as knowledge for when a given weighting scheme should be matched to an analysis task. In the case of supervised machine learning, weighting selection could be optimized as part of the training process. Additionally, if it is important that the transformed data has meaningful numerical coordinates, such that one desires to interpret the exact numerical value of a given balance in a sample, we suggest that neither branch length weights nor taxa weights be used as these weights can complicate this type of interpretation. Concerning our handling of zero values, this model design choice confronts an outstanding challenge for microbiota and compositional data analysis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tsilimigras and Fodor, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mart\u0131n-Fernandez et al., 2011</a>). Part of this challenge\u2019s difficulty is whether a zero value represents a value below the detection limit (rounded zero) or a truly absent taxon (essential zero). Here, we employ zero replacement, which implies an assumption that all zero values represent rounded zeros. New mixture models that explicitly allow for both essential and rounded zeros (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bear and Billheimer, 2016</a>), as well as more advanced methods of zero replacement (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mart\u0131n-Fernandez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Martin-Fernandez et al., 2015</a>), may enable us to handle zeros in a more sophisticated manner. Lastly, in regards to informational loss caused by normalization, it is known that the number of counts measured for a given taxon influences the precision with which we may estimate its relative abundance in a sample (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gloor et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Good, 1956</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">McMurdie and Holmes, 2014</a>). While our taxa weights are intended to address this idea, a fully probabilistic model of counts would likely provide more accurate error bounds for inference. We believe it would be possible to build such a model in a Bayesian framework by viewing the observed counts as multinomial draws from a point in the PhILR transformed space, as has been done for other log-ratio based spaces (<a href=\"#bib6\">Billheimer et al., 2001</a>)."

                        "text": "Beyond refining the PhILR transform itself, future effort may also be directed towards interpreting the transform's results at the single taxon level. Microbiota studies frequently focus on individual taxa for tasks such as identifying specific bacteria that are causal or biomarkers of disease. Log-ratio approaches can provide a compositionally robust approach to identifying biomarkers based on changes in the relative abundance of individual taxa. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between CLR coordinates and individual taxa, the CLR transform has been used previously to build compositionally robust models in terms of individual taxa (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mandal et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kurtz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fernandes et al., 2014</a>). However, CLR transformed data suffer from the drawback of a singular covariance matrix, which can make the development of new models based on the CLR transform difficult (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>). ILR transformed data do not suffer this drawback (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>) and moreover, can be analyzed at the single taxon level. To do so, the inverse ILR transform can be applied to model results generated in an ILR coordinate system, yielding analyses in terms of changes in the relative abundance of individual taxa (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>). The use of the inverse ILR transform in this manner is well established (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">van den Boogaart and Tolosana-Delgado, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib57\">Pawlowsky-Glahn and Buccianti, 2011</a>) and the inverse transform is provided in the <i>Methods</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Egozcue and Pawlowsky-Glahn, 2016</a>)."

We foresee the PhILR transform being used as a default transformation prior to many microbiota analyses, particularly if a phylogenetic perspective is desired. For example, the PhILR transform could be used in lieu of the conventional log transform, which is often the default choice in microbiota analysis but\u00a0is not robust to compositional effects. Substituting PhILR into existing bioinformatics pipelines should often be seamless and we emphasize that all statistical tools applied to PhILR transformed data in this study were used 'off-the-shelf' and without modification. Importantly, such a substitution contrasts with the alternative approach for accounting for compositional microbiota data, which is to modify existing statistical techniques. Such modification is often challenging because many statistics were derived assuming an unconstrained space with an orthonormal basis, not a constrained and over-determined compositional space. Therefore, while select techniques have already been adapted (<i>e.g</i>. distance measures that incorporate phylogenetic information (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lozupone and Knight, 2005</a>) and feature selection methods that handle compositional input (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Li, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2014</a>)), it is likely that certain statistical goals, such as non-linear community forecasting or control system modeling, may prove too complex for adapting to the compositional nature of microbiota datasets. Finally, beyond microbiota surveys, we also recognize that compositional metagenomics datasets are generated when studying the ecology of viral communities (<a href=\"#bib13\">Culley et al., 2006</a>) or clonal population structure in cancer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Britanova et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yuan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Roth et al., 2014</a>).

Our choice of taxa weights is a heuristic that combines two terms multiplicatively: a measure of the central tendency of counts, such as the mean or median of the raw counts for a taxon across the <math id=\"inf51\"><mi>N</mi></math> samples in a dataset; and, the norm of the vector of relative abundances of a taxon across the <math id=\"inf52\"><mi>N</mi></math> samples in a dataset. We add this vector norm term to weight taxa by their site-specificity. Preliminary studies showed that the geometric mean of the counts (with a pseudocount added to avoid skew from zero values) outperformed both the arithmetic mean and median as a measure of central tendency for the counts (data not shown). Additionally, while both the Euclidean norm and the Aitchison norm improved preliminary benchmark performance compared to using the geometric mean alone, in one case (classification using support vector machine on the global patterns dataset), the Euclidean norm greatly outperformed the Aitchison norm (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Taxonomic identifiers were assigned to the two descendant clades of a given balance separately using a simple voting scheme and combined into a single name for that balance. The voting scheme occurs as follows: (1) for a given clade, the entire taxonomy table was subset to only contain the OTUs that were present in that clade (2) starting at the finest taxonomic rank the subset taxonomy table was checked to see if any species identifier represented\u00a0\u226595% of the table entries at that taxonomic rank, if so that identifier was taken as the taxonomic label for the clade (3) if no consensus identifier was found, the table was checked at the next most-specific taxonomic rank."

In this interesting manuscript, Silverman et al. suggest taking ratios on a bifurcating phylogenetic tree. In their approach, the dependent variable for each node of the tree is a \"balance\", which is a normalized ratio of all the nodes beneath each node (with the ratio of all the left descendant nodes over all the right descendant nodes). The paper explores the consequences of this normalization showing reasonable performance when used for classification or machine learning. The authors provide an implementation in R and this approach may be of utility for analysts looking for a novel way to analyze microbial data in ratio space."

There was some discussion among the reviewers about whether a comparison to random binary partitions would be appropriate since this could reflect your null model (that phylogenetic binary partition is superior). Reviewer #2 was not enthusiastic about this idea and argued that a change on a tree does not alter (Aitchison) distances between data points. Therefore, results would likely not change no matter which tree has been selected for defining ILR coordinates."

We leave it up to the authors as to whether they feel such an inclusion would improve their paper or be worth the effort. However, all reviewers felt that paper would be improved by more discussion of how to tell when one normalization procedure is superior to another. It seemed to reviewer #1 that it might be adequate to say that the proposed transformation appears to be doing no harm relative to weighted Unifrac but was providing some compositional safeguards. Reviewer #2 argued that the main benefit of the proposed procedure was in interpretability in yielding a phylogenetically aware transformation that could be utilized for test-statistics."

As such, the proposed method will be of interest to researchers interested in how best to approach the challenging problem of compositional analyses of microbial datasets."

There is nothing inherent to the balancing algorithm that can deal with this problem (the sum in the denominator of the balance obviously can't be zero). The authors therefore require some kind of pseudo-count scheme and they have settled on one (given in the equation in subsection \u201cAddressing sparsity through weighting taxa\u201d) which is a function of the number of samples. If I am reading their formula correctly, the weight given to a taxa with 1 read in one sample and zero in all others would be very close to the sqrt(number of samples). The authors might consider giving this as an example and explicitly noting that their method has some similarity to adding the sqrt(number of samples) as a pseudo-count."

In the second paragraph of the subsection 2Balance variance and microbiota assembly\u201d it is argued that \"When the variance of a balance between two clades approaches zero, the mean abundance of taxa in each of the two clades will be linearly related and thus exhibit shared dynamics across microbial habitats\". While this is true (and must be true mathematically as when the variance approaches zero, the ratio of the two normalized abundances of the clades is constant, which means they will become perfectly linearly related with a positive slope), it's not clear to me that a high variance necessarily means \"exclusionary dynamics across samples\". I don't see how a high variance in this number indicated anything about how direct or indirect the interactions are within the tree. There are lots of reasons two clades could lack perfect linear correlation with a positive slope from direct competition to being completely unrelated biologically with abundances just shifting due to stochastic variation. Also, wouldn't variance have to be lower closer to the tips of the phylogenetic tree as the number of sequences is lower, so the pseudo-count has more of an effect depressing overall variance? Doesn't that explain <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D-F</a>? And if I am reading these graphs correctly, below the species level there are not enough datapoints to support modeling via localized regression one way or another. Although not central to the arguments of the paper, I found <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> to be less convincing than other sections of the paper."

(We believe this new paragraph also has the benefit of reducing confusion regarding how our zero handling and the use of weights differs from prior sections.) We believe one of the steps to avoid bias that we now detail, which is a permutation-based hypothesis test, accounts for many of the potential technical artifacts that the reviewers alluded to. Histograms from the null distributions for each body site (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) are symmetric about zero, suggesting that any bias introduced by our handing of zero values or stochastic sampling was likely minimal. Still, we do acknowledge that we cannot completely exclude the possibility that inefficient clustering of sequences into OTUs could add to the observed pattern between balance variance and phylogenetic depth. But, due to our observation that this relation appears to be stronger above the species level than below, we believe that inefficient clustering alone could not explain the pattern we observed.

In the second paragraph of the subsection 2Balance variance and microbiota assembly\u201d it is argued that \"When the variance of a balance between two clades approaches zero, the mean abundance of taxa in each of the two clades will be linearly related and thus exhibit shared dynamics across microbial habitats\". While this is true (and must be true mathematically as when the variance approaches zero, the ratio of the two normalized abundances of the clades is constant, which means they will become perfectly linearly related with a positive slope), it's not clear to me that a high variance necessarily means \"exclusionary dynamics across samples\". I don't see how a high variance in this number indicated anything about how direct or indirect the interactions are within the tree. There are lots of reasons two clades could lack perfect linear correlation with a positive slope from direct competition to being completely unrelated biologically with abundances just shifting due to stochastic variation. Also, wouldn't variance have to be lower closer to the tips of the phylogenetic tree as the number of sequences is lower, so the pseudo-count has more of an effect depressing overall variance? Doesn't that explain <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D-F</a>?

To account for phylogenetic distances, we simply scale balances by the phylogenetic distance between descendant clades. We do acknowledge that there is a deeper connection between these two sets of weights; that is, there is a close relationship between linearly scaling an ILR balance and changing the reference measure of the simplex (see (11), equation 18 in Appendix B); but for simplicity, we have not highlighted this connection in this manuscript.
