We found that PTBP1 binding in the flanking introns allowed normal U2AF and U1 snRNP binding to the target exon splice sites but blocked U2 snRNP assembly in HeLa nuclear extract. Characterizing a purified PTBP1-repressed complex, as well as an active early complex and the final EDC by SILAC-MS, we identified extensive PTBP1-modulated changes in exon RNP composition. The active early complex formed in the absence of PTBP1 proceeded to assemble an EDC with the eviction of hnRNP proteins, the late recruitment of SR proteins, and binding of the U2 snRNP. These results demonstrate that during early stages of splicing, exon RNP complexes are highly dynamic with many proteins failing to bind during PTBP1 arrest."

We found that PTBP1 binding in the flanking introns allowed normal U2AF and U1 snRNP binding to the target exon splice sites but blocked U2 snRNP assembly in HeLa nuclear extract. Characterizing a purified PTBP1-repressed complex, as well as an active early complex and the final EDC by SILAC-MS, we identified extensive PTBP1-modulated changes in exon RNP composition. The active early complex formed in the absence of PTBP1 proceeded to assemble an EDC with the eviction of hnRNP proteins, the late recruitment of SR proteins, and binding of the U2 snRNP. These results demonstrate that during early stages of splicing, exon RNP complexes are highly dynamic with many proteins failing to bind during PTBP1 arrest."

Splicing choices are directed by proteins of multiple classes and structural families that bind to the nascent pre-mRNA to alter spliceosome assembly (<a href=\"#bib66\">Lee and Rio, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Fu and Ares, 2014</a>). One family of related regulators is the <span class=\"underline\">s</span>erine-a<span class=\"underline\">r</span>ginine-rich proteins (SR proteins), which usually bind within an exon to stimulate its splicing (<a href=\"#bib37\">Fu and Ares, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Long and Caceres, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Busch and Hertel, 2012</a>). Other proteins are more generally classed as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP proteins) that belong to multiple structural families and bind to specific sites throughout the nascent pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Busch and Hertel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Dreyfuss et al., 1993</a>). Depending on the family and binding site location, hnRNP proteins can act to either repress or stimulate splicing of particular exons or splice sites (<a href=\"#bib37\">Fu and Ares, 2014</a>). The interactions of these pre-mRNA-bound regulatory proteins with the general splicing apparatus or spliceosome are largely unknown."

                        "text": "The pathway of spliceosome assembly has been determined for introns of yeast and for several unusually short mammalian introns (<a href=\"#bib107\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>). An early step in spliceosome assembly across a short intron is the formation of the prespliceosome or A complex that contains the U1 snRNP bound at the 5\u2019 splice site, the U2AF 35/65 heterodimer bound at the polypyrimidine tract and 3\u2019 splice site, and the U2 snRNP bound to the branch point. This A complex recruits the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP and other components of the full B complex spliceosome, before undergoing extensive rearrangements and compositional changes to form the catalytic spliceosome (called B<sup>act</sup>) with the intron splice sites assembled into the catalytic center of the structure (<a href=\"#bib107\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011</a>). In contrast to this pathway of intron assembly, a typical transcript in animal cells has very long introns, and the initial recognition of splice sites and prespliceosome assembly occur on the short exons to form <span class=\"underline\">e</span>xon <span class=\"underline\">d</span>efinition <span class=\"underline\">c</span>omplexes (EDCs) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berget, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">De Conti and Baralle, 2012</a>). These EDCs then interact across a long intron to form the catalytic spliceosome. The EDC contains the U1 snRNP, the U2 Auxiliary Factor (U2AF), and the U2 snRNP bound to the 5\u2019 splice site, the 3\u2019 splice site, and the branch point, respectively (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berget, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">De Conti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Robberson et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chiara and Reed, 1995</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib49\">Hoffman and Grabowski, 1992</a>). The EDC is sometimes called an A-like complex or an exon-defined A complex (EDA) because of its similar size and composition to an intronic prespliceosome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berget, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Schneider et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">House and Lynch, 2006</a>). Like an intronic prespliceosome, the binding of the U2 snRNP to the branch point in the EDC is preceded by U1 snRNP and U2AF binding and requires ATP\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib107\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berget, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">De Conti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Staknis and Reed, 1994</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib80\">Michaud and Reed, 1993</a>). Early steps in assembly of the EDC are poorly characterized. For example, the roles and fates of the hnRNP and SR proteins, which bind before EDC completion, are unknown. Elucidating the sequence of events leading to this intricate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is a prerequisite to understanding the mechanisms of splicing regulation."

                        "text": "One extensively studied splicing regulator is the polypyrimidine-tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1, also called PTB or hnRNP I). PTBP1 and its paralogs PTBP2 and PTBP3 control a variety of developmental splicing programs and have been particularly studied in neuronal, muscle, and testis development (<a href=\"#bib115\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Linares et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Keppetipola et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bland et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Hall et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib67\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Spellman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Zagore et al., 2015</a>). PTBP1 contains four RRM-type RNA binding domains, each binding a triplet of C and U nucleotides, giving the full protein a high affinity for runs of mixed pyrimidines (<a href=\"#bib83\">Oberstrass et al., 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib3\">Auweter and Allain, 2008</a>). Exons repressed by PTBP1 usually have multiple binding sites found in a variety of locations relative to the target exon (<a href=\"#bib69\">Linares et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Xue et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Llorian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Han et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</a>). The mechanism of PTBP1-induced exon skipping seems to vary with the location of the binding sites (<a href=\"#bib61\">Keppetipola et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Spellman and Smith, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Wagner and Garcia-Blanco, 2001</a>). A PTBP1-binding site within exon 6 of Fas pre-mRNA blocks the U1 snRNP-dependent recruitment of U2AF65 to the upstream 3\u2019 splice site (<a href=\"#bib51\">Izquierdo et al., 2005</a>). In other exons, including exon 6B of \u03b2-tropomyosin pre-mRNA and exon 10 of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor \u03b32 pre-mRNA, PTBP1 directly competes with U2AF65 for binding to the polypyrimidine tract of the 3\u2019 splice site (<a href=\"#bib91\">Sauli\u00e8re et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ashiya and Grabowski, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Singh et al., 1995</a>). Repression of the Src N1 exon requires two binding sites, one embedded in the polypyrimidine tract of the 3\u2019 splice site and one in the downstream intron (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chan and Black, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Chou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chan and Black, 1995</a>). These sites each bind a least one PTBP1 monomer. The upstream site binds with high affinity and appears to block U2AF binding similar to what is seen with \u03b2-tropomyosin exon 6B, but is not sufficient for full splicing repression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chan and Black, 1995</a>). The required downstream intronic site binds PTBP1 with lower affinity but is stimulated for binding by the upstream site, implying an interaction between the PTBP1 proteins bound at the two sites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</a>). An exon repressed by these two sites still recruits the U1 snRNP to its 5\u2019 splice site, but this U1 snRNP fails to interact with and splice to an EDC on exon 4 downstream (<a href=\"#bib94\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, the downstream PTBP1 directly contacts stem-loop 4 of the U1 snRNA bound to the N1 exon, and this interaction is proposed to block the interaction with the exon 4 complex further downstream (<a href=\"#bib95\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib96\">2014</a>)."

To examine individual exon complexes, we developed an in vitro <i>trans</i>-splicing assay for a model PTBP1-repressed exon that has distal flanking PTBP1-binding sites in both introns. We found that PTBP1 binding allows normal U2AF65 and U1 snRNP recruitment to this exon, but prevents U2 snRNP assembly and EDC formation. Using SILAC-MS, we identified extensive compositional differences between a PTBP1-repressed exon complex, an active early exon complex, and an EDC with bound U2 snRNP.

We replaced the polypyrimidine tract that contained this PTBP1 site with the 3\u2019 splice site of the Adenovirus Major Late first intron to allow efficient U2AF65 recruitment without competition with PTBP1. We previously showed that upstream PTBP1 could repress this splice site in an in vivo reporter transcript (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</a>). The 5\u2019 splice site at the downstream side of N1 was also modified to match the consensus splice site, which splices more efficiently than the native N1 site, and to remove potential cryptic sites nearby (<a href=\"#bib21\">Chou et al., 2000</a>). The sequence downstream from N1, which contains PTBP1-binding sites required for splicing repression, was left intact. The strong splice sites in the test exon allow for more efficient splicing in trans-splicing assays (see below), and we previously found that similar constructs containing these sites were indeed repressible by PTBP1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Chou et al., 2000</a>). PTBP1-mediated splicing repression of this test exon was confirmed in <i>in vitro</i> splicing assays using a two-exon substrate containing the N1 exon and the downstream constitutive Src exon 4, with either a wildtype or mutant PTBP1-binding site upstream.

We incubated the N1 exon transcripts containing either the wildtype or mutant upstream PTBP1-binding site in HeLa nuclear extract to pre-assemble exon RNP\u00a0complexes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>). In parallel reactions, transcripts containing portions of the first or the second exon of the Adenovirus Major Late pre-mRNA (AML), including either the 5\u2019 splice site or the 3\u2019 splice site, were also pre-incubated in the extract. To enhance splicing of these Adeno transcripts relative to the splicing of N1 to itself, the Adeno RNAs (50 nM) were in 25-fold excess over the N1 exon RNA (2 nM). This is lower than the RNA concentration used for many <i>trans</i>-splicing reactions and lower than the approximate concentration of the U1 snRNP (200 nM) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chiara and Reed, 1995</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib18\">Chen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Konarska and Sharp, 1987</a>).

The wildtype transcript bound by PTBP1 formed a typical heterogeneous complex accompanied by a small amount of a more slowly migrating complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> lane 1\u20134). In contrast, the mutant transcript that lacked the upstream PTBP1-binding site and was active for splicing formed much more of the larger exon complex. The mutant transcript initially formed the faster migrating complexes that were converted to the larger complex over time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> lane 5\u20138). This larger complex was ATP-dependent and required intact U1 and U2 snRNPs, confirming its identity as an exon definition complex (EDC) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> cf. lane 2 to lane 4 and 6; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further confirm that the lack of EDC formation on the wildtype transcript was due to PTBP1 binding, we immuno-depleted PTBP1 from the nuclear extract. Depletion of PTBP1 stimulated the assembly of the EDC on the wildtype exon, whereas mock-depleted extract remained inhibited (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> cf. lane 3 to 4). PTBP1 depletion or mock depletion did not affect formation of the EDC on the mutant substrate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> cf. lane 5 to 6)."

The gel system did not resolve differences between the repressed complex and the active early complex. The reactions were treated with heparin prior to gel separation to reduce aggregation and help material enter the gel.

They also contained the U2AF heterodimer (U2AF65 and U2AF35) bound to the polypyrimidine tract and AG di-nucleotide of the 3\u2019 splice site, as well as a large number of additional protein factors whose roles are less defined (<a href=\"#bib94\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Schneider et al., 2010</a>). To examine the composition of the three N1 exon complexes, we tagged the mutant and wildtype RNAs with the MS2 stem-loop to allow their purification (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). As described previously, the RNAs were pre-bound with the MS2 coat protein-maltose binding protein fusion (MS2-MBP), and then assembled into exon RNP complexes under standard splicing conditions (<a href=\"#bib94\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Jurica et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Das R, 2000</a>). Reactions were incubated for 30 min to allow isolation of both the active early and EDC complexes. Complexes were resolved by ultracentrifugation in glycerol density gradients. As seen on native gels, the RNAs generated the two complexes as separable peaks on the gradient (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). A larger percentage of the mutant RNA was converted to the EDC (and its aggregates at the bottom) compared to the wildtype RNA. Peak fractions for each complex were pooled and affinity purified on amylose resin. RNA from each complex was analyzed on urea-PAGE stained with SYBR Gold. As expected, the repressed and active early complexes contained only the U1 snRNA and the exon RNA substrate, and these were present in equimolar amounts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> lane 1, 2 and graph). This is in agreement with results showing that the U1 snRNP is bound to the repressed N1 exon, where it interacts with PTBP1 (<a href=\"#bib95\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the purified EDC contained both the U1 and U2 snRNAs in a precise 1:1 stoichiometry relative to the N1 exon RNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> lane 3 and graph). This is similar to the prespliceosomal A complex assembled onto an intron, but the splice sites flank an exon and thus the EDC has an inverted 5\u2019-3\u2019 orientation compared to the A complex. Similar to our previous observations with an EDC from Src exon 4, snRNAs of the U4/5/6 tri-snRNP were not observed in the (<a href=\"#bib94\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>). The U4/5/6 tri-snRNP was previously found in an EDC derived from an Adenovirus exon (<a href=\"#bib92\">Schneider et al., 2010</a>). It is possible that the tri-snRNP binds to the N1 exon in a later step, or that the N1 EDC and the Adeno EDC differ in their composition."

Similarly, PTBP1 bound within the polypyrimidine tract of the 3\u2019 splice site itself is thought to directly block U2AF binding. To examine this in an exon with distal PTBP1 binding sites, we measured the levels of U2AF65 within the MS2 affinity-purified exon complexes by immunoblot (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These were normalized to CBP80, which binds in equimolar amounts to the 5\u2019 cap of each RNA. Compared to PTBP1, which is expected to bind at higher levels to the wildtype RNA than the mutant RNA missing one of the PTBP1 binding sites, U2AF65 bound to the RNAs in equal amounts regardless of PTBP1 binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> cf. lane 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6).

In the second experiment, the proteins were assembled onto the wildtype RNA plus or minus PTBP1. Thus, proteins seen changing in both experiments are responding to the differential binding of PTBP1. Proteins observed in only one mass spectrometry experiment were not considered further. These results indicate that despite their similar gel mobility, the PTBP1-repressed complex and the active early complex, which can progress to the EDC, are very different. The binding of PTBP1 in conjunction with MBNL1 and RAVER1 prevented the binding of many other proteins, interestingly including many hnRNP proteins. The binding of U2 snRNP to form the EDC is preceded by extensive remodeling of the exon RNP from the repressed to active state."

PTBP1, RAVER1 and MBNL1, which were mostly lost between the repressed and active early complexes, declined even further in the EDC. Most hnRNP proteins, including hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1, declined with the formation of the EDC. Interestingly, proteins such as hnRNP C, K, U and Q that had substantially increased in the active complex relative to the repressed complex, were now dramatically reduced in the EDC. Conversely and as expected, the U2 snRNP proteins are recruited during this transition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> left panel and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> lane 3). Perhaps the most striking change upon EDC formation was a massive recruitment of SR proteins including SRSF3, 6, 7, 11, 12, and SR-related proteins, TRA2B (SFRS10), RBM39 and LUC7L2. TRA2B and SFRS3 increased 4-fold in the EDC over the active complex, while LUC7L2 went up 8-fold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> left panel; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Together, the data indicate extensive remodeling of exon complexes both between the PTBP1-repressed and active early complexes and then in the transition from the active early exon complex to the EDC.

To confirm the involvement of particular proteins in the splicing of the test exon in vivo, we performed RNAi knockdown experiments. These were performed on a HeLa cell line carrying an integrated splicing reporter that contained the same test exon flanked by \u03b2-globin exons and was induced with doxycycline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We focused on factors that changed in each of the complexes analyzed. MBNL1 and RAVER1 are bound only in conjunction with PTBP1 in the repressed complex. DDX5 and DDX17 bind in the active complex and are reduced as the EDC forms. TRA2B is increased in the active complex and highly enriched in the EDC. After RNAi knockdown and reporter induction, we isolated RNA from the cells and assayed exon inclusion by primer extension. Two siRNAs were tested for each protein and the efficiency of protein depletion was assessed by immunoblot (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In control siRNA-treated cells, the test exon exhibited ~40% inclusion in the reporter mRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As expected, depletion of PTBP1 stimulated splicing of the test exon to ~90%. Depletion of MBNL1 or RAVER1 alone increased exon inclusion to 50 or 55% respectively, confirming both proteins as negative regulators of the test exon. The more limited effect from depleting these factors compared to PTBP1 may indicate the presence of other redundant repressor proteins or that PTBP1 is more important to maintaining exon repression than these cofactors. Double depletion of RAVER1 and MBNL1 together did not further increase splicing indicating that the factors are likely not redundant with each other."

The ATP-dependent RNA helicases DDX5 and DDX17 associate with the early exon complex and may contribute to the protein rearrangements. In the presence of PTBP1 (below) the exon is sequestered in a repressed state that still allows U2AF and U1 snRNP assembly but not the association of many early factors including hnRNPs, RNA helicases, and early bound SR proteins.

Although not proven, this PTBP1-U1 snRNP interaction may be sufficient to inactivate the 5\u2019 splice site by blocking an interaction between the repressed U1 and the U2 snRNP of the downstream exon complex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib96\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>) . On the upstream side, it is possible that the bound PTBP1 allows normal U1-dependent U2AF assembly but blocks its further contact with the U2 snRNP.

The PTBP1-repressed complex contained several proteins whose binding was lost when PTBP1 was removed, either by binding site mutation or protein depletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The most notable changes were of MBNL1 and RAVER1, two proteins that are known to act as corepressors with PTBP1 on other exons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Gromak et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Gooding et al., 2013</a>). In RNAi depletion experiments, we find that RAVER1 and MBNL1 are both inhibitory for N1 splicing, although not as strongly as PTBP1. Work from the Smith and Curry labs has defined a precise interaction of a peptide in RAVER1 with RRM2 of PTBP1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Joshi et al., 2011</a>). The protein MATRIN3 has the same peptide and appears to make a PTBP1 interaction similar to RAVER1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Joshi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Coelho et al., 2015</a>). Although MATRIN3 is present in some of our complexes, its co-binding with PTBP1 was less clear than RAVER1 and MBNL1. The co-binding of RAVER1 and MBNL1 indicate that PTBP1 may nucleate the assembly of a larger inhibitory complex on the target exon. Early work by the Grabowski lab on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor \u03b32 exon 10 also indicated that PTBP1 induced assembly of a larger inhibitory complex and prevented formation of an EDC-like complex (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashiya and Grabowski, 1997</a>). The components of that complex could not be analyzed and the effect of PTBP1 binding could not be uncoupled from competition with U2AF since their binding sites overlapped."

In converse to RAVER1 and MBNL1, we found numerous factors that were absent from the repressed complex, but were recruited to the exon RNA if PTBP1 regulation was removed. Some of these are presumably needed for EDC assembly but bind much earlier than the U2 snRNP. We observed increased binding of the SR and SR-related proteins SFRS3 and TRA2B in the active early over the repressed complex. These proteins increased dramatically again in the EDC along numerous other SR proteins that were only observed in the EDC. Of interest, we found the ATP-dependent RNA helicases DDX5 (p68), DDX17 (p72) and DHX15 (PRP43) enriched in the active early complex. DDX5 and DDX17 showed substantial declines upon formation of the EDC, suggesting they act prior to its assembly and may be needed for remodeling the active early exon complex (see below) and are blocked from action by PTBP1. We are also interested in the role of ATP in active early complex assembly upon removal of PTBP1 repression. Determining this will require a more purified system, as we find that in crude extracts ATP alters the RNP assembled on nearly any RNA (data not shown)."

In contrast, House et al found that hnRNP L acted at a later step to prevent splicing of a CD45 exon through the hyper-stabilization of an assembled EDC containing the U1 and U2 snRNPs, and thus altering its transition to the full spliceosome (<a href=\"#bib50\">House and Lynch, 2006</a>). Here, we found that even though U2AF was recruited, a step between U2AF binding and U2 snRNP recruitment was blocked by PTBP1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>). It will be very interesting to apply comparative proteomics to other exons in states such the hyper-stabilized and permissive EDCs. This may identify common factors targeted by regulation and further elucidate the process of exon definition."

Using short model introns from yeast or mammalian cells, these analyses have defined an intricate series of binding steps and conformational rearrangements leading to intron excision (<a href=\"#bib107\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Hegele et al., 2012</a>). Relatively few studies have examined the exon complexes that are the necessary intermediate in the splicing of long metazoan transcripts (<a href=\"#bib94\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Schneider et al., 2010</a>). As the primary RNA transcript is synthesized, factors such as the hnRNP group of proteins and the U1 snRNP are thought to rapidly assemble with it (<a href=\"#bib33\">Dreyfuss et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Singh et al., 2015</a>). Some of these early recruited factors are required for the binding of subsequent spliceosomal components, including the U2 snRNP. Although the active early exon complex is heterogeneous in mobility, we found that it is fully bound by the known early factors U2AF and the U1 snRNP, as well as enriched for the DDX5/17 and TRA2B components needed for splicing, and it is efficiently converted to an EDC. This conversion requires more than the simple assembly of the U2 snRNP at the branch point sequence. The transition from the active early complex to an EDC was accompanied by a large-scale rearrangement of the exon RNP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). It is likely that there are many as-yet-undescribed steps leading to the assembly of an exon definition complex."

Abundant hnRNP and other RNA-binding proteins assemble into this early exon complex but are then removed during the transition to the EDC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), including hnRNPs C, Q, R and K, as well as the residual PTBP1, RAVER1 and MBNL1."

SR proteins were found to associate with the pre-mRNA and to stabilize the binding of the U1 snRNP and U2AF (<a href=\"#bib102\">Staknis and Reed, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Jamison et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wu and Maniatis, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Kohtz et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Krainer et al., 1990</a>). It is possible that these previously described interactions occur during the transition we observe after initial U1 snRNP and U2AF binding. On the other hand, some SR proteins are present in the active early exon complex along with the U1 snRNP and U2AF. These early-bound SR proteins may serve to initially stabilize U1 and U2AF binding, before a more substantial recruitment of SR proteins during EDC assembly. During this later step, several SR and SR-like proteins are increased 3 to 4 fold, a similar enrichment to the U2 snRNP proteins, and may serve to bridge components bound at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 splice sites as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib37\">Fu and Ares, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Long and Caceres, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Busch and Hertel, 2012</a>). Understanding the roles of these SR and SR-like proteins needs further dissection.

The observed rearrangements during EDC formation require ATP, but the number of steps involving ATP hydrolysis is not clear. ATP is needed for U2 snRNP recruitment to the branch point through the action of UAP56 (SUB2) and the U2 snRNP subunit DDX46 (PRP5) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Cordin et al., 2012</a>). DDX46 is strongly recruited into our isolated EDC, but detection of UAP56 in our complexes was inconsistent. Given the timing of their recruitment, their association with other exon complexes, and their implication in the splicing of multiple alternative exons including the exon examined here (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), DDX5 (p68) and DDX17 (p72) are good candidates for driving new rearrangement steps during EDC assembly (<a href=\"#bib94\">Sharma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Schneider et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Kar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dardenne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dardenne et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Camats et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Guil et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Liu, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Lin et al., 2005</a>).

The assembly of PTBP1 and several corepressors forms the repressed complex that contains the U1 snRNP and U2AF but excludes numerous other factors from the exon RNP. Removal of PTBP1 allows formation of an active early complex that contains new hnRNP proteins as well as the RNA helicases DDX5 and DDX17 and some early-bound SR proteins. This early exon RNP is efficiently converted to the EDC with the loss of hnRNP proteins, the gain of SR proteins and the binding of the U2 snRNP. This sequence of events raises many questions. How does PTBP1 block assembly of so many different proteins? Does the initial binding of certain hnRNP proteins such as hnRNP C in the active early complex allow for recruitment of factors needed for EDC formation, or are they inhibitory? What drives the loss of hnRNP proteins and the gain of SR proteins during EDC formation? Is this the role of DDX5 and DDX17? Can smaller steps be discerned within these major assembly transitions? Given that exon definition appears to be the major pathway for recognizing splice sites in vertebrates, and a target for the regulation of splicing choices, it will be important to gain further understanding of EDC structure and assembly."

Exons were chosen that both exhibited \u226515% increase in splicing after PTBP1 depletion by siRNA and contained nearby PTBP1 iCLIP clusters. Positions of iCLIP clusters were designated as in the upstream intron (a); in the BPS and polypyrimidine track (b); in the exon (c); or in the downstream intron (d), using the following criteria (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). iCLIP clusters located more than 100 nts upstream from the 3'ss AG were designated \u2018a\u2019; those in exons or downstream of the 5'ss were designated \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019, respectively. When iCLIP clusters were located within 100 nts from the 3'ss, the intron sequences were subjected to BPS prediction as described by Andr\u00e9 et (<a href=\"#bib25\">Corvelo et al., 2010</a>), to determine the potential BPS sites. If iCLIP clusters were located more than 25 nts upstream of the predicted BPS, they were designated \u2018a\u2019; otherwise, they were designated \u2018b\u2019. A list of PTBP1-repressed exons in mouse ESC with their PTBP1 binding site locations is shown in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>."

Strengths of this study are the quality of the data and the novelty and importance of characterizing such early complexes in spliceosome assembly. This is particularly timely given that we now have increasing detail regarding the later complexes in spliceosome assembly, but lack detail on earlier complexes where much of splicing regulation occurs. A short-coming of the study is that it is primarily descriptive, but the potential relevance of this data for other studies mitigates this concern \u2013 at least partially. It is true that the study raises more questions than it answers. The authors are well aware of this \u2013 they, in fact, list many of these questions at the end of the discussion.

The depleted extract did show a small decrease in EDC formation that could be restored with purified protein.
