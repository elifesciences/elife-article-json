The exact <i>modus operandi</i> of Prp43 and of all other spliceosomal DEAH-box RNA helicases is still elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of Prp43 complexes in different functional states and the analysis of structure-based mutants providing insights into the unwinding and loading mechanism of RNAs. The Prp43\u2022ATP-analog\u2022RNA complex shows the localization of the RNA inside a tunnel formed by the two RecA-like and C-terminal domains. In the ATP-bound state this tunnel can be transformed into a groove prone for RNA binding by large rearrangements of the C-terminal domains. Several conformational changes between the ATP- and ADP-bound states explain the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation, mainly mediated by a \u03b2-turn of the RecA1 domain containing the newly identified RF motif. This mechanism is clearly different to those of other RNA helicases."

The exact <i>modus operandi</i> of Prp43 and of all other spliceosomal DEAH-box RNA helicases is still elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of Prp43 complexes in different functional states and the analysis of structure-based mutants providing insights into the unwinding and loading mechanism of RNAs. The Prp43\u2022ATP-analog\u2022RNA complex shows the localization of the RNA inside a tunnel formed by the two RecA-like and C-terminal domains. In the ATP-bound state this tunnel can be transformed into a groove prone for RNA binding by large rearrangements of the C-terminal domains. Several conformational changes between the ATP- and ADP-bound states explain the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation, mainly mediated by a \u03b2-turn of the RecA1 domain containing the newly identified RF motif. This mechanism is clearly different to those of other RNA helicases."

Most members of the SF1 or SF2 are monomeric, in contrast to the members of SF3 to SF6 which assemble as hexamers (<a href=\"#bib43\">Singleton et al., 2007</a>). The latter are composed of either RecA- or AAA<sup>+</sup>-like domains, thus being distinct from the SF1 and SF2 helicases which are exclusively composed of two RecA-like domains in juxtaposition with each other."

The centerpiece of these helicases is formed by the two RecA-like domains, harboring conserved motifs which are crucial for these NTPase-dependent RNA helicases to accomplish their function. The motifs I, II, V and VI are required for nucleoside triphosphate binding and hydrolysis, motifs Ia, Ib and IV are involved in RNA binding and the motif III participates in coupling the NTPase and the unwinding activity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Caruthers and McKay, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cordin and Beggs, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cordin et al., 2012</a>). Most SF2 helicases exhibit extensions at the N- and C-termini of the helicase core, which is also true for the DEAH-box proteins, a subfamily of the DEAH/RHA family. The C-terminal extension is highly conserved in DEAH-box helicases and is composed of three domains: a winged helix (WH), a ratchet and an oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold (<a href=\"#bib51\">Walbott et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">He et al., 2010</a>). The ratchet domain was originally named according to the homologous domain of the DNA helicase Hel308 (<a href=\"#bib12\">B\u00fcttner et al., 2007</a>), but recent studies on MLE suggested that this domain has no ratcheting function and should be renamed (<a href=\"#bib37\">Prabu et al., 2015</a>). Therefore it is hereinafter referred to as ratchet-like domain. In DEAH-box proteins the degrees of freedom of the helicase core are reduced by the interactions between the C-terminal domains and the two RecA-like domains in comparison to those DEAD-box proteins lacking such C-terminal domains. The conservation of the N-terminal extension is distinctly lower and they dramatically differ in length between the members of this subfamily. Reported functions for this N-terminal extension are, among others, the involvement in the recruitment as shown for Prp16 (pre-mRNA processing factor 16) as well as for Prp22 or for the subcellular targeting to the nucleus as elucidated for Prp43 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wang and Guthrie, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schneider and Schwer, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fouraux et al., 2002</a>)."

The first reported function of Prp43 is its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing. In the course of this process, Prp43 acts at the latest stage of the splicing cycle and it is required to dismantle the intron-lariat spliceosome into the excised lariat and the U2\u2022U5\u2022U6 snRNPs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Arenas and Abelson, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fourmann et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2016a</a>). Recently, the target substrate of Prp43 during this process was revealed which is the RNA network between the U2 snRNP and the branch site of the intron (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fourmann et al., 2016b</a>). Indeed, in the spliceosome, Prp43 was crosslinked exclusively to the pre-mRNA and not to any snRNAs. Furthermore, Prp43 is also a key player for the disassembly of stalled spliceosomes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pandit et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Semlow\u00a0and\u00a0Staley, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Koodathingal et al., 2010</a>). During these spliceosomal processes, Prp43 binds RNA in a sequence-independent manner. Prp43 action is also essential for ribosome biogenesis. Here, it is involved in the maturation of 18S and 25S rRNAs with several reported binding sites on intermediates which vary in sequence and thus make a sequenced-based binding mechanism unlikely for Prp43 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lebaron et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bohnsack et al., 2009</a>). Lately, the involvement of Prp43 in a third distinct cellular function was illuminated and it was unraveled that Prp43 is also involved in the promotion of apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heininger et al., 2016</a>)."

These cofactors belong to the family of G-patch proteins, which share an intrinsically disordered glycine-rich region, the G-patch motif (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aravind et al., 1999</a>). Apart from being involved in recruitment, these G-patch proteins also increase the NTPase and stimulate the helicase activity of Prp43. To date, in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> five G-patch proteins were identified out of which four interact with Prp43. In the context of splicing, Prp43 function is modulated by Ntr1 (Nineteen complex-related proteins 1) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tanaka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tsai et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Boon et al., 2006</a>). During rRNA maturation, Prp43 is associated with Pfa1 (Prp forty-three associated 1) or Gno1 (G-patch nucleolar protein 1) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lebaron et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bohnsack et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, its apoptotic function is implemented by the interaction with Cmg1 (Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial G-patch protein 1) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heininger et al., 2016</a>). The remaining G-patch protein from yeast is Spp2 (Suppressor of PRP protein 2) which interacts with another spliceosomal DEAH-box helicase, Prp2 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Warkocki et al., 2015</a>)."

This is primarily attributable to a lack of crystal structures of members of the DEAH-box subfamily in an active state and with bound interaction partners. Recently, the crystal structure of the related DExH-box helicase MLE (Maleless), which belongs to another DEAH/RHA subfamily, provided a first insight into how this helicase might function. The complex of MLE with a U<sub>10</sub>-RNA and ADP\u2022AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> led to a proposed mechanism of how RNA is translocated through its interior tunnel driven by conformational changes of a Hook-Loop in the RecA2 domain (<a href=\"#bib37\">Prabu et al., 2015</a>)."

The latter mentioned organism might be a valuable alternative for structural studies on DEAH-box proteins, since several crystal structures of spliceosomal RNA helicases from this thermophilic fungus were solved only recently (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tauchert et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tauchert and Ficner, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Absmeier et al., 2015</a>). Owing to this, intensive crystallization trails with Prp43 from <i>C. thermophilum</i> were performed leading to three new crystal structures. All three structures show Prp43 in an active state, since it was crystallized with a non-hydrolysable ATP-analog (ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) as well as one of these structures show Prp43 with an additional U<sub>7</sub>-RNA. The Prp43\u2022U<sub>7</sub>-RNA\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>complex unveils the structural basis of why Prp43 can bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner. The Prp43\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> structures illustrate how Prp43 binds and releases complex RNA substrates due to massive rearrangements of the C-terminal domains which affect an opening of the interior RNA-binding tunnel which is formed by the two RecA-like and the C-terminal domains. The hydrolysis of an ATP molecule induces conformational rearrangements of the RecA-like domains which, in turn, allow the translocation of the RNA through the interior tunnel <i>via</i> the so far unrecognized RF motif present in a \u03b2-turn of all DEAH-box helicases. According to our results, the translocation mechanism of MLE is very unlikely to be compatible for Prp43. All proposed functional mechanisms of Prp43 are strengthened by functional analyses of structure-based mutants in this study."

For these crystallization approaches, an N-terminally truncated version of Prp43 from <i>C. thermophilum</i> was used (ctPrp43\u0394N), which lacks the first 60 amino acids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Previously, we already demonstrated that this truncated ctPrp43 variant is fully capable of replacing its yeast ortholog in spliceosome disassembly assays (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tauchert et al., 2016</a>). Crystals of ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the presence of the U<sub>16</sub>-RNA were obtained in the space group P6<sub>1</sub>22 and diffracted up to 2.62 \u00c5. In addition to the ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and a central magnesium ion at the active site, seven out of the 16 nucleotides of the RNA as well as one additional phosphate group were traceable in the electron density (for an omit map of the RNA see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Hence, this complex is referred to here as ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022U<sub>7</sub>\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. The refinement of this complex converged at R<sub>work</sub> and R<sub>free</sub> values of 19.70% and 22.97% (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Depending on which of the two alternative RNA conformations is analyzed, only 11 or 13 hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions between the RNA and Prp43 can be detected (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c and e</a>). Most of these interactions are formed between the sugar-phosphate backbone of the RNA and the RecA1, RecA2 or the ratchet-like domain. On the contrary, the uracil moieties do not interact with the helicase with the exception of a hydrogen bond of U3 with the Ser 555 main-chain carboxyl group from the ratchet-like domain and a base stack between the U1 and Arg 562 which only occurs in one of the two alternative conformations. These Prp43-RNA interactions are, however, by far not enough for sequence-specific binding of a substrate RNA to Prp43. In addition to the unspecific RNA-binding mode of Prp43, RNA binding appears to be transient, as only four nucleotides are more tightly associated with Prp43. In the crystal structure presented, this corresponds to the nucleotides U4 to U7. At the 5\u2019 end, the first three nucleotides are weakly bound by Prp43 since only 2 (conf. B) and 3 (conf. A) interactions are detectable, respectively. The weak interaction is additionally highlighted by elevated <i>B</i>-factors for this RNA region compared to the four other nucleotides (see <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). After the first two nucleotides, a kink is introduced in the RNA backbone and the number of Prp43-RNA interactions gets more numerous and more intense. At the 3\u2019end, the RNA does not interact with Prp43 as soon as the end of the RNA-binding tunnel is reached. The phosphate group of the eighth nucleotide is exactly located at the end of this tunnel. Compared to the nucleotides U4 to U7, this phosphate exhibits elevated <i>B</i>-factors. The U8 nucleoside was not defined in the electron density map and thus might indicate the presence of multiple RNA conformations at this site out of which none is clearly favorable due the lack of interactions with Prp43."

In the context of pre-mRNA splicing or rRNA biogenesis, Prp43 has to bind to or to be released from short singled-stranded RNA stretches within larger folded RNAs or RNPs. In the light of the fact that the RNA-binding site of Prp43 is located inside a tunnel, RNA loading appears to be non-trivial and thus requires further illumination."

                                "text": "The opening of the RNA-binding tunnel appears to be the key mechanism allowing Prp43, and very likely numerous other DEAH-box helicases, to bind to complex folded RNA substrates. Thus, these rearrangements of the C-terminal domains are expected to be crucial for their unwinding function. The opening is feasible due to a large movement of the ratchet-like and the OB-fold domains. Rearrangements of the WH domain are less pronounced owing to the fact that the WH rather functions as a hinge region between the RecA2 and the ratchet-like domain. Comparison between the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022U<sub>7</sub>\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) complex structures after alignment of the RecA-like domains revealed that the center of mass of the ratchet-like domain is shifted by 16.2 \u00c5, and by 14.1 \u00c5 for the OB-fold domain. In the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(LR) complex structure, these values are equal to 17.0 \u00c5 (ratchet-like) and 11.7 \u00c5 (OB-fold), respectively. The ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) structure is in a marginally more closed conformation, hence the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structures are not completely identical. They represent two slightly different snapshots of Prp43 which both might exist in solution and presumably are favored by the different crystallization conditions or different crystal packing. These two states of ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> might also give a hint at how Prp43 switches into the closed conformation since in the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) complex structure one inter-domain contact is present between the RecA2 (Asp 486) and the ratchet-like domain (Lys 605). These interactions between sequentially distal residues might trigger the switching from the open into the closed conformation after the binding to RNA. The circumstance that both structures of the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex are in a similar, open conformation strongly suggests the possibility that the complex structures presented reflect the main conformation of Prp43 in an active state in solution. Owing to the fact that Prp43\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> crystallized in different space groups and in divergent crystallization conditions, the open conformation <i>in crystallo</i> is highly unlikely to be a crystallization artefact. This assumption is additionally supported by the low number of crystal contacts for the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) (355.3 \u00c5\u00b2 of buried surface/1.1% of the total surface) and the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(LR) (1524.3 \u00c5\u00b2/4.7%) complex structure."

For this purpose, one cysteine was introduced into the RecA1 domain and another one into the ratchet-like domain at exposed positions to maximize the number of formed disulfide bonds (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The functional impact of these mutations was analyzed by an ATPase assay, a fluorescence-based helicase assay and an intron-lariat spliceosome (ILS) disassembly assay. First of all, the percentage of formed disulfide bonds was experimentally estimated. The wild-type protein contains nine cysteines, the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant two additional ones. <i>Via</i> Ellman reaction, the number of cysteines was determined to be 8.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 (ctPrp43) and 9.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 (ctPrp43-IDSB), respectively. This allows us to conclude that the majority of ctPrp43-IDSB exhibits the internal disulfide bridge because oxidized cysteines cannot be detected by this method and only the nine cysteines, which are also present in the wild-type protein, were determined."

                                "text": "Having determined that ctPrp43-IDSB is mainly present in the oxidized and therefore closed state, this mutant was subsequently analyzed concerning its helicase activity using a synthetic dsRNA with a 3\u2019ssRNA overhang (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Since wild-type Prp43 exhibited a very low activity (0.54 nM of unwound RNA/min) in the absence of any stimulatory G-patch (GP) protein, we tested its activity in the presence of the ctNtr1-GP (1.98 nM/min) and the ctPfa1-GP (60.03 nM/min). Since the ctPfa1-GP could increase the Prp43 activity to a much higher level, the ctPfa1-GP was used for the <i>in vitro</i> helicase activity analysis of all Prp43 mutants. ctPrp43-IDSB exhibited an activity of 12.18 nM/min which equals about 1/5th of the wild-type Prp43 activity and thus is clearly impaired concerning its ability to unwind dsRNA. The remaining helicase activity of the mutant is most likely caused by the fraction of ctPrp43-IDSB which does not contain the internal disulfide bond. The activity of ctPrp43 and the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant were also analyzed for a physiological and more complex substrate RNP by using the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> ILS disassembly assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In previous work it was shown that ctPrp43 is capable of functionally replacing scPrp43 in the spliceosome (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tauchert et al., 2016</a>). ctPrp43 can release about 60% of intron-lariat RNA from scILS in the presence of ATP and scNtr(1\u20222) and dissociate the remaining spliceosomal RNP core into the free U6 snRNA, 18S U5 and 20S U2 snRNP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). This is close to the 65% efficiency of recombinant scPrp43 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). In case of the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant, these assays were performed in the presence and absence of DTT, which can reduce the disulfide bridge between the RecA1 and ratchet-like domain and thus free ctPrp43-IDSB from its locked conformation. Without DTT, the efficiency of ILS disassembly by ctPrp43-IDSB is clearly impaired compared to the wild-type protein since only 10% of all ILSs are dissociated which equals the amount of the negative control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a and d</a>). In the presence of DTT, the ILS dissociation efficiency of ctPrp43-IDSB can be fully restored to the wild-type activity level of 60% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). This clearly hints at the fact that locking Prp43 in the closed conformation distinctly influences its activity as deduced from the crystal structures of ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and thus proving the importance of adopting the open conformation for the helicase activity of Prp43 also in the spliceosome (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

Purified Bact\u0394Prp2 complexes were then incubated with recombinant Prp2 and Spp2, generating the B* spliceosome, and then Cwc25 was added to promote catalysis of step 1 of splicing and the formation of complex C. For catalysis of step 2, which generates post-catalytic spliceosomes (PCS), recombinant Prp16, Slu7 and Prp18 were added. Finally, for the purification of the ILS, the spliced mRNA was dissociated from the ILS by incubation of the PCS with Prp22 and ATP. Addition of ATP and recombinant Prp43, Ntr1 and Ntr2, leads to disassembly of the ILS into the intron-lariat, 20S U2 snRNP, 18S U5 snRNP and free U6 snRNA."

For all ctPrp43 variants, the ATPase activity was analyzed for ctPrp43 itself, after the addition of a GP, or U<sub>16</sub>-RNA or in the presence of both. Since this was the first enzymatic characterization of Prp43 from <i>C. thermophilum</i>, several general results are worth mentioning (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The basal ATPase activity of ctPrp43 (1.81 min<sup>\u22121</sup>) is very similar to its ortholog from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (2.43 min<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Christian et al., 2014</a>). ctPrp43 is stimulated by both, the ctNtr1-GP and the ctPfa1-GP, but the effect by the latter is more pronounced. A clear difference between <i>C. thermophilum</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Prp43 is that ctPrp43 does not exhibit RNA-stimulated ATPase activity in the absence of a GP. The ctPrp43 ATPase activity can only be induced by RNA if an additional G-patch protein is present."

These findings confirm that the difference in the helicase and the ILS disassembly assay between ctPrp43 and ctPrp43-IDSB is solely caused by the impairment of the unwinding capabilities. The RNA-induced stimulation of ctPrp43-IDSB in the trapped conformation might still be feasible due to the fact that a short single-stranded U<sub>16</sub>-RNA without any secondary structures was used for these assays. Binding to the entry or exit site of the RNA-binding tunnel, which does not require an opening of the tunnel, might be sufficient for the RNA-induced stimulation of the ATPase activity (see below). Furthermore, Prp43 in the trapped closed conformation appears to be more prone for the stimulation of the ATPase activity by RNA since the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant (24.99 min<sup>\u22121</sup>) is stimulated by U<sub>16</sub>-RNA while the wild-type protein is not (2.08 min<sup>\u22121</sup>). It is conceivable that the GP increases the number of Prp43 molecules in a closed conformation since in the presence of a GP also the wild-type protein is stimulated by RNA."

Superimposing the helicase cores consisting of both RecA-like domains shows that the RecA1 and RecA2 domains are rotated by ca. 4\u02da and ca. 14\u02da, respectively. There is also a slight translational displacement of the RecA2 domain by a 2.7 \u00c5 shift of its center of mass with regard to the RecA1 domain. Depending on the ADP/ATP state, conformational changes of several of the conserved SF2 helicase motifs, most strikingly of those in the RecA2 domain are observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The conformations of the motifs I, Ia, Ib and II, which are all located in the RecA1 domain, are similar between the ATP-bound and the ADP-bound state of Prp43. This ATP-bound state, mimicked by the bound ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, also allows to deduce how Prp43 does hydrolyze ATP. The Glu 219 of the eponymous DEAH-motif (motif II) binds a water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O 388) and positions it in close spatial proximity to the BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, which corresponds to the ATP \u03b3-phosphate. Presumably, this H<sub>2</sub>O 388 performs the nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom of the \u03b3-phosphate since it is in an almost perfect orientation for an S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution mechanism at 180\u00b0 to the leaving group. In the ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structure, this water molecule is additionally bound <i>via</i> the interactions with Gln 428 and Arg 435 from motif VI. The region containing the motif VI undergoes one of the most pronounced conformational rearrangements of the helicase core and it is shifted in the ADP-bound state 5.1 \u00c5 apart from the bound nucleotide. In the ATP-bound state, also interactions between Arg 432 and Arg 435 from motif VI and the phosphate(-mimic) groups are detectable. In the ADP-bound state, only Arg 435 of motif VI interacts with the 3\u2019OH of the ribose. Another noticeable rearrangement can be observed for Phe 360 which is not part of a classical SF2 helicase motif. In the ADP-bound state, the adenine moiety interacts with Phe 360 <i>via</i> \u03c0-electron stacking and by cation-\u03c0-interactions with Arg 162. In the ATP-bound state, Phe 360 is shifted 5.4 \u00c5 apart from the base which is now solely stabilized by Arg 162. The rearrangements of the other conserved motifs are less distinct but still notably. In the ADP-bound state, the motifs IV and V are shifted by 3.3 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively, apart from the C-terminal domains."

The transition of this motif might be required to induce the global conformational rearrangements leading to the rotation of the RecA domains. The rotation leads to a movement of a \u03b2-turn in the RecA1 domain and of a \u03b2-hairpin in the RecA2 domain, which both are directly located at the RNA-binding tunnel and thus might be involved in RNA translocation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The \u03b2-turn in the RecA1 domain consists of the amino acids Arg 180 and Phe 181, and the \u03b2-hairpin of the RecA2 domain is composed of the amino acids Tyr 348, Gly 349 and Thr 350. Interestingly, this second loop has previously been identified to be crucial for the helicase activity of the DExH-box helicase MLE (<a href=\"#bib37\">Prabu et al., 2015</a>). In this study by Prapu and co-workers, a triple-mutant of the MLE was generated in which all residues located in this loop were mutated to glycine residues. This loop was termed Hook-Loop as it hooks between the bases of the bound RNA. It was assumed that in the course of NTP hydrolysis the movement of this loop causes the translocation of the bound RNA. Replacing the wild-type Hook-Loop sequence by GGG led to a complete loss of the helicase activity of MLE. Notably, in contrast to MLE the corresponding residues of the Prp43 Hook-Loop do not contact the bound RNA. In order to analyze the impact of both \u03b2-hairpin loops on RNA unwinding, several mutants of Prp43 were generated. In the Hook-Turn mutant (ctPrp43-HT), the amino acids 180\u2013181 were mutated to GG and in the Hook-Loop mutant (ctPrp43-HL) the residues 348 and 350 were replaced by glycines. In addition to this, a double mutant in which both, the Hook-Turn and the Hook-Loop, contain the glycine substitutions (ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL;), was also analyzed."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, the ctPrp43-HT (0.68 nM/min) and the ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL; (0.88 nM/min) mutants exhibit a strongly impaired RNA unwinding activity compared with wild-type ctPrp43 (60.03 nM/min) which corresponds to an almost complete loss of function as seen for the negative control (0.46 nM/min). Intriguingly, the ctPrp43-HL (61.87 nM/min) mutant shows an activity being almost equal to the wild-type protein. This high helicase activity of the ctPrp43-HL mutant is in clear contrast to the results for MLE and thus indicates a different RNA translocation mechanism between the two subfamilies of DEAH-box and DExH-box helicases. This difference in the translocation mechanism is consistent with the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022U<sub>7</sub>\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> complex structure. An interaction between the Hook-Loop and the RNA, as seen in MLE, is unlikely in Prp43 because the Hook-Loop residues point at the opposite direction and do not contact the RNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). In contrast, Arg 180 and Phe 181 of the Hook-Turn directly point at the RNA, and after ATP-hydrolysis these residues are moving towards the RNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>) and presumably hook in between the bases. The Hook-Turn exhibits some flexibility since its main chain is present in two alternative conformations in the ctPrp43\u0394N\u2022ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(HR) complex structure. According to this structure, this \u03b2-turn is present as type I (47%) and type II (53%) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The increased activity of the HT mutant is presumably caused by the fact that the arginine from the Hook-Turn is involved in hydrogen-bonding which has to be disrupted in the course of ATP hydrolysis. In the corresponding Hook-Turn mutants these contacts are not present due to the substitution by glycines, and therefore less energy is consumed by the conformational rearrangements. Furthermore, all of the three Hook-Turn or\u00a0Hook-Loop mutants are stimulated by G-patch proteins, but it is remarkable that the ctPrp43-HT and ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL; mutants are not additionally stimulated by U<sub>16</sub>-RNA in contrast to the ctPrp43-HL mutant. The differences between the ATPase activity of ctPrp43-HT and ctPrp43-HT&amp;HL; in the presence of the G-patch protein and of the G-patch protein with RNA are not significant. The lack of RNA-induced stimulation for these two constructs might hint at the fact that the ATPase activity stimulation of Prp43 by RNA occurs at the interior tunnel <i>via</i> the interaction with the Hook-Turn."

However, this unselective and transient binding mode of RNA by Prp43 is perfectly in line with its molecular function. Prp43 helicase activity is required in several distinct cellular processes. Target sites in rRNA maturation and pre-mRNA splicing are very different and thus selective RNA binding would not be compatible with Prp43\u2019s mode of function.

Despite the fact that the architecture of the conserved domains is almost identical and the relative position of the bound RNA in the helicase is similar, MLE binds poly-uridine RNA in a sequence-dependent manner. Numerous bases are specifically recognized by MLE and a tighter and much more elaborated interaction network between MLE and the RNA is present. Nonetheless, there are also noticeable similarities concerning the RNA interactions. In Prp43, four main-chain amide interaction interactions between residues of the RecA1 or RecA2 domains and the RNA are present, one with each of the tightly bound nucleotides (U4-U7). Glu 316 interacts with U4, Gly 349 with U5, Arg 153 with U6 and Arg 180 with U7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). There are also two threonine residues of conserved motifs that interact with the RNA. Thr 195 from motif Ib and Thr 381 from motif V are involved in hydrogen bonding <i>via</i> their sides chains with the phosphates of the nucleotides U7 and U5, respectively. Interestingly, these main-chain amide interactions are completely conserved in MLE. Despite the fact that the residues themselves are not conserved in MLE, the position at which the interaction takes place is virtually identical (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The corresponding interacting residues and nucleotides in MLE are Trp 663-U6, Ser 692-U7, Arg 443-U8 and Arg 470-U9. Furthermore, the interactions with the conserved threonine residues are also present in MLE (Thr 486-U9 and Thr 717-U7). Moreover, there are three additional side chain interactions which are conserved between Prp43 and MLE. The interaction of Arg 201 (motif Ib) with the ribose of the U7, the hydrogen bonding of Asn 382 with the ribose of U4 and the interaction of Lys 403 with the phosphate moiety of U4 in Prp43 have identical counterparts in MLE.

Members of the NS3/NPH-II family also contain a helicase core composed of two RecA-like domains with the protruding \u03b2-hairpin in the RecA2 domain. In the NS3/NPHII helicase family there is only one C-terminal domain present, which is not homologous to any C-terminal domain of the DEAH/RHA helicases, and no RNA-binding tunnel is formed. Owing to the fact that numerous NS3 helicases are encoded by human pathogenic viruses, such as hepatitis C, Zika or yellow fever, these helicases have been subject of intensive studies and various crystal structures are available. The comparison with Prp43 was restricted to the NS3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, as NS3 HCV binds RNA also in a sequence-independent manner and a crystal structure with a bound ATP-analog (ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and U<sub>8</sub>-RNA is available making a direct comparison with Prp43 very feasible (PDBid: 3o8r) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Appleby et al., 2011</a>). The comparison between Prp43 and NS3 HCV revealed that the unspecific interactions between the RNA backbone and the main-chain amides as well as the two interactions with the conserved threonines from motif Ib and V are also present in NS3 HCV (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In NS3 HCV, the main-chain amides of the residues Lys 371, Arg 393, Val 232 and Gly 255 interact with the nucleotides U4-U7 and Thr 269 as well as Thr 411 are involved in hydrogen bonding <i>via</i> their site chains with U7 and U5, respectively. Hence, this RNA-binding mode appears to be conserved for the sequence-unspecific interaction of the RecA-like domains of several members of the DEAH/RHA and NS3 families. However, there are also differences in the RNA\u00a0binding between the DEAH/RHA and NS3 families, e.g. a functionally important tryptophan of NS3 members (Trp 501 in NS3 HCV), which stacks on the nucleotide at the 3\u2019 end, is not conserved in DEAH-box helicases."

Considering the fact that the RNA-binding site of Prp43 is in its interior tunnel and the circumstance that the substrates of Prp43 are highly folded RNA networks, RNA loading to Prp43 is not trivial. The Prp43 target sites in the spliceosome and in the pre-ribosomal subunits are surrounded by complex tertiary structures without single-stranded overhangs. Here, we could demonstrate that in the ATP-bound state Prp43 is capable of adopting an open conformation in which numerous interactions between the RecA-like domains and the C-terminal domains are disrupted converting the RNA-binding tunnel into a groove and thus enabling Prp43 to bind to single-stranded RNA regions within folded RNA stretches (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This rearrangement of the C-terminal domains of Prp43 with bound ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> has not been observed in any other crystal structure of a DEAH- or DExH-box helicase, which demonstrates that Prp43 exhibits a higher degree of flexibility as initially expected from the previously determined crystal structures of Prp43\u2022ADP complexes."

One can assume that these rearrangements almost exclusively occur after the release of the \u03b3-phosphate owing to the fact that the helicase cores of Prp43 with the ATP-analog ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and of MLE (chain A) with the transition state analog ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> superpose very well with an r.m.s.d. value of 0.70 \u00c5 for 235 C<sub>\u03b1</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). ATP hydrolysis causes the movement of one \u03b2-turn and one loop, located at the RNA-binding site of the RecA1 and RecA2 domain, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). The \u03b2-turn in the RecA1 domain, the Hook-Turn, was shown to be of crucial importance for Prp43\u2019s helicase activity, its capability to disassemble ILSs and also for its RNA-induced ATPase activity. In contrast to this, the Hook-Loop, located in the RecA2 domain, does neither affect the unwinding activity nor the ATPase activity of Prp43. Remarkably, the integrity of this Hook-Loop was known to be essential for the helicase activity of MLE and it was therefore proposed that the Hook-Loop is presumably required in all DExH- but also all DEAH-box helicases for the translocation of RNA (<a href=\"#bib37\">Prabu et al., 2015</a>). Unexpectedly, but according to our results, the difference in the mechanism of how DEAH-box and DExH-box helicases do translocate RNA through their interior tunnel seems to be tremendous. For Prp43, exclusively the interaction between the Hook-Turn and the RNA is required for successful translocation of the RNA. The mutation of the Hook-Loop, which is essential in MLE, is effectless in Prp43. Furthermore, the Hook-Turn is not required for RNA binding but it is involved in the RNA-induced stimulation of the ATPase activity. This is supported by the finding that the ctPrp43-IDSB mutant still exhibits RNA-stimulated ATPase activity. For this mutant, RNA binding in the tunnel is unlikely but the stimulation might be caused by the binding of the single stranded RNA only to the tunnel exit as this is formed, among others, by the Hook-Turn."

Between DEAH-box and DExH-box helicases, the Hook-Loop is not conserved (Yxx vs. Hxx), but conservation among the individual members is noticeable. These findings are perfectly in line with our interpretation of the activity of the Hook-Turn and Hook-Loop mutants, which clearly hint at the fact that the RNA-translocation mechanism between DEAH- and DExH-box helicases is strikingly different. The Hook-Turn is presumably the key feature of genuine DEAH-box helicases for RNA translocation through the interior binding tunnel and the Hook-Turn RF motif should be added to the list of conserved DEAH-box helicase motifs. Like for MLE, the structure of the Prp43-RNA complex does not provide any indication for a ratcheting function of the C-terminal helical-bundle domain, which supports the idea of renaming this domain."

Compared to a previously reported structure of Prpr43 with ADP (but without RNA), the new structure reveals a significant conformational change that is interpreted as facilitating RNA loading and movement of the RNA relative to the protein. The authors further identify a hairpin loop with a characteristic motif that is conserved among DEAH helicases. While the work focuses on structural data, the main structure-inspired claims are supported by biochemical and functional studies in yeast for several mutants."

Comparing their ground-state structure with a previous one of ADP-bound Prp43, the authors identify a new element (a hook-loop) that is important for the translocation. Although there is currently no structure for the transition-state of the reaction, the authors include biochemical studies with structure-based mutants that support their proposed mechanism (with the caveat that an important control is missing \u2013 see below)."

In general, I find interesting that two helicases that are thought to belong to the same family differ in mechanisms. Indeed, not only the translocation mechanism appears to be different, but also the unwinding mechanism and the RNA-binding specificity. Rather than playing down the previous work and boosting their own (with several inappropriate 'first' claims), the authors could elaborate positively on the different mechanisms of translocation, unwinding and specificity of the RHA-like and Prp43-like subfamilies of DEAH helicases."

In addition, to trapping with specific ligands, the authors captured different conformational states by observing the molecule in different crystal forms.

This negatively impacts the paper in several important ways: A) The paper consistently misrepresents the novelty of the findings, seeming to imply that this is the first time translocation has been structurally characterized for a motor protein in the DEXH family, including NS3 from HCV. B) Important similarities and differences from other motors are overlooked, leading to a missed opportunity for understanding the function of individual motor components. Adding to the issue of novelty is that nucleotide-bound Prp43 has been previously structurally characterized in the absence of RNA ligand. So, this is not the first time we have visualized this particular protein. In the opinion of this reviewer, it appears to bind ssRNA in a nonspecific manner not too dissimilar from other SF2 proteins, so it is not entirely clear what we have learned. Without any comparison to related proteins (other than MLE), the authors make it difficult for the reader to ascertain the structural significance of the reported findings."

Full-length HCV NS3 is in the same DEXH family and it has been the subject of two studies in which translocation was captured on polynucleotide substrates. Indeed, in Appleby (JMB, 2011), NS3 opening and closing, together with sequential translocation along polyuridine, was captured in an exhaustive series of crystal structures that provide a complete mechanistic picture of translocation by this family along RNA. Similar work was done by Gu and Rice, but using a DNA oligonucleotide bound to a truncated NS3 variant, which is less directly comparable with the present study. All of that work built upon incisive single molecule experiments that specifically monitored the translocation of NS3 (Myong, Science 2007, and subsequent work from the Bustamante lab) and showed that it follows a mechanistic paradigm originally elucidated by Hopfner for Hel308. Indeed, it has been known for about ten years that SF1 and SF2 helicases translocate by opening and closing the RecA1 and RecA2 domains as a function of ATP binding and release. There are probably 50 papers on this. While HCV NS3 is formally a DECH variant, the related and structurally-characterized Dengue and YFV NS3 proteins are DEAH \u2013 so the significance of the third amino acid is not relevant to the argument."

The <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> value for ATP is lower in the presence of RNA, which means that the affinity of ATP is increased, hence there is still a cooperative effect of RNA and ATP binding. The <i>K</i><sub>cat</sub> value of the ctPrp43-GP is lower in presence of RNA, which appears to be puzzling. It is very difficult to explain this effect by the currently known structures, due to the fact that the G-patch protein is missing in all structures. As a consequence, the structural basis for the stimulation of ATPase and helicase activities by the G-patch proteins in not understood at all. Hence, one possibility is that the stimulating effect of the G-patch is reduced in case of the double hook-loop mutant upon binding of the RNA. However, this is pure speculation as no corresponding structural or biochemical data are available, and has therefore not been included in the revised version of the manuscript."

This negatively impacts the paper in several important ways: A) The paper consistently misrepresents the novelty of the findings, seeming to imply that this is the first time translocation has been structurally characterized for a motor protein in the DEXH family, including NS3 from HCV. B) Important similarities and differences from other motors are overlooked, leading to a missed opportunity for understanding the function of individual motor components. Adding to the issue of novelty is that nucleotide-bound Prp43 has been previously structurally characterized in the absence of RNA ligand. So, this is not the first time we have visualized this particular protein. In the opinion of this reviewer, it appears to bind ssRNA in a nonspecific manner not too dissimilar from other SF2 proteins, so it is not entirely clear what we have learned. Without any comparison to related proteins (other than MLE), the authors make it difficult for the reader to ascertain the structural significance of the reported findings.</i>"

It is true that this is not the first crystal structure of Prp43, but all previous ones contained ADP. There was no structure of Prp43 with bound ATP and/or RNA. The conformation of Prp43 (especially of the C-terminal domains) in the ATP-bound state, which is presented in this study, is clearly different to that of the previously determined Prp43-ADP complexes. The conformational rearrangements of the C-terminal domains of Prp43 in the ATP-bound state have not been unraveled for any other family member of the DEAH/RHA-box family. The available structures of the Prp43-ADP complex (Walbott et al., 2010; He et al., 2010, Tauchert et al., 2016) or of the MLE-U<sub>10</sub>-ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub>- complex (Prabu et al., 2015) all exhibit a conformation of the C-terminal domains which is similar among each other but in striking contrast to that of our new Prp43-ATP-analog complexes."

Full-length HCV NS3 is in the same DEXH family and it has been the subject of two studies in which translocation was captured on polynucleotide substrates. Indeed, in Appleby (JMB, 2011), NS3 opening and closing, together with sequential translocation along polyuridine, was captured in an exhaustive series of crystal structures that provide a complete mechanistic picture of translocation by this family along RNA. Similar work was done by Gu and Rice, but using a DNA oligonucleotide bound to a truncated NS3 variant, which is less directly comparable with the present study. All of that work built upon incisive single molecule experiments that specifically monitored the translocation of NS3 (Myong, Science 2007, and subsequent work from the Bustamante lab) and showed that it follows a mechanistic paradigm originally elucidated by Hopfner for Hel308. Indeed, it has been known for about ten years that SF1 and SF2 helicases translocate by opening and closing the RecA1 and RecA2 domains as a function of ATP binding and release. There are probably 50 papers on this. While HCV NS3 is formally a DECH variant, the related and structurally-characterized Dengue and YFV NS3 proteins are DEAH \u2013 so the significance of the third amino acid is not relevant to the argument.</i>"
