For example, damage-associated molecular patterns activate an inflammatory cascade that leads to removal of cellular debris and promotion of healing. We demonstrate that lysis of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> cells triggers a program in the remaining population that confers fitness in interspecies co-culture. We find that this program, termed <i>P. aeruginosa</i> response to antagonism (PARA), involves rapid deployment of antibacterial factors and is mediated by the Gac/Rsm global regulatory pathway. Type VI secretion, and, unexpectedly, conjugative type IV secretion within competing bacteria, induce <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lysis and activate PARA, thus providing a mechanism for the enhanced capacity of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to target bacteria that elaborate these factors. Our finding that bacteria sense damaged kin and respond via a widely distributed pathway to mount a complex response raises the possibility that danger sensing is an evolutionarily conserved process."

For example, damage-associated molecular patterns activate an inflammatory cascade that leads to removal of cellular debris and promotion of healing. We demonstrate that lysis of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> cells triggers a program in the remaining population that confers fitness in interspecies co-culture. We find that this program, termed <i>P. aeruginosa</i> response to antagonism (PARA), involves rapid deployment of antibacterial factors and is mediated by the Gac/Rsm global regulatory pathway. Type VI secretion, and, unexpectedly, conjugative type IV secretion within competing bacteria, induce <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lysis and activate PARA, thus providing a mechanism for the enhanced capacity of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to target bacteria that elaborate these factors. Our finding that bacteria sense damaged kin and respond via a widely distributed pathway to mount a complex response raises the possibility that danger sensing is an evolutionarily conserved process."

A number of antagonistic strategies have been identified, including the production of diffusible factors such as small molecule antibiotics. It has been suggested that sub-inhibitory concentrations of these molecules induce specific changes in bacteria, including the production and distribution of resistance mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hoffman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Linares et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson and Hughes, 2014</a>). Other antagonistic pathways, such as contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) and the type VI secretion system (T6SS), require cell contact (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hayes et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Konovalova and Sogaard-Andersen, 2011</a>). Kin cells are protected from the toxic proteins delivered by these pathways by specific cognate immunity proteins; however, escape from or defense against these pathways by non-kin is not well understood (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hood et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Russell et al., 2011</a>)."

One of the best characterized bacterial targeting T6SSs is the Hcp Secretion Island I-encoded T6SS (H1-T6SS) of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hood et al., 2010</a>). The H1-T6SS transports a cargo of at least seven effectors, termed type VI secretion exported 1\u20137 (Tse1\u20137) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hachani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Whitney et al., 2014</a>). The outcome of intoxication by these proteins can be lysis or cessation of growth (<a href=\"#bib44\">LeRoux et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Like other species with interbacterial T6SSs, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> has the capacity to target cells of its own genotype with the H1 pathway. To inhibit self-intoxication, cognate type VI secretion immunity proteins (Tsi) are produced and localized to the cellular compartment that contains the target of the corresponding effector (<a href=\"#bib62\">Russell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Benz and Meinhart, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Durand et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Russell et al., 2014a</a>).

This global regulatory system impacts protein production via RsmA, a CsrA-type protein that binds to target mRNA molecules and generally acts to repress their translation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lapouge et al., 2008</a>). RsmA is modulated by levels of the small RNA (sRNA) molecules <i>rsmY</i> and <i>rsmZ</i>, which bind to and sequester it from its targets. Transcription of the sRNAs is promoted by phosphorylated GacA, the cognate response regulator of the sensor kinase GacS. Finally, two hybrid sensor kinases, RetS and LadS, acting through GacS, repress or stimulate GacA phosphorylation, respectively (<a href=\"#bib73\">Ventre et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodman et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with regulation of T6S by the Gac/Rsm pathway, many of its targets in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and related \u03b3-proteobacteria are involved in the production of social or antagonist factors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lapouge et al., 2008</a>). This theme of Gac/Rsm-dependent modulation of antibiotic activity is exemplified by the defect of <i>P. fluorescens gac</i> mutants in bacterial and fungal growth inhibition on plants (<a href=\"#bib42\">Laville et al., 1992</a>). Though the precise cues that activate the Gac/Rsm pathway are unknown, Haas et al. have found that one or more signals accumulate in spent bacterial culture supernatants deriving from both self and non-self organisms (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dubuis and Haas, 2007</a>)."

In this pathway, phosphorylation of a fork head-associated domain-containing protein, Fha1, triggers apparatus assembly and effector secretion (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mougous et al., 2007</a>). PppA, a phosphatase, opposes the activity of PpkA on Fha1, returning the system to the inactive state. Additional components of the TPP, encoded by type VI secretion associated genes Q-T (<i>tagQ-T</i>), act upstream of these proteins and are thought to be involved in signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hsu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Casabona et al., 2013</a>). Two signals of the TPP have been proposed: surface-associated growth and membrane perturbation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Silverman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basler et al., 2013</a>). The latter signal is thought to underlie the observation that organisms with active T6S or type IV secretion (T4S) are more efficiently targeted by the H1-T6SS than those without (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ho et al., 2013</a>). It was proposed that the activity of these apparatuses induces local membrane perturbations in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> that are sensed by the TPP, leading to posttranslational activation of the H1-T6SS and enhanced recipient cell death (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basler et al., 2013</a>). A caveat of these studies is that the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strain used bears an inactivating mutation in <i>retS</i>, which constitutively activates the Gac/Rsm pathway, potentially masking the contribution of this major regulatory mechanism to the defense mounted by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> against the antagonistic pathways of competing bacteria."

These findings provide a rationale for the regulation of promiscuous antibiotic mechanisms by a pathway that can respond to self-derived signals."

To quantify these observations, we performed bacterial growth competition experiments with wild-type (PAO1) and \u2206<i>retS</i> with both self- and non-self recipients under comparable conditions. <i>Burkholderia thailandensis</i> (<i>B. thai</i>) was used as the non-self competitor for these studies, while a <i>P. aeruginosa</i> background lacking four H1-T6SS effector\u2013immunity pairs (\u2206<i>tse1-4 \u2206tsi1-4</i>) was employed as the self recipient. T6S-dependent fitness was determined by comparing the competitive index of a wild-type donor to that of a donor strain lacking <i>tssM</i>, which encodes a core structural component of the T6S apparatus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Felisberto-Rodrigues et al., 2011</a>). We found that both <i>P. aeruginosa</i> wild-type and \u2206<i>retS</i> strains reduced populations of <i>B. thai</i> in a T6S-dependent manner by several orders of magnitude; however, only <i>P. aeruginosa</i> \u2206<i>retS</i> displayed T6S-dependent fitness in co-culture with self recipients (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This direct comparison of H1-T6SS-dependent antibiosis by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> wild-type and \u2206<i>retS</i> demonstrates that unlike self-intoxication, non-self targeting by the pathway does not require activation of the system by relief of negative regulation.

The fluorescence intensity of ClpV1\u2013GFP provides readout of H1-T6SS expression and the assembly of ClpV1\u2013GFP into punctate foci correlates with activity of the system (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mougous et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kapitein et al., 2013</a>). Surprisingly, we observed significantly elevated ClpV1\u2013GFP levels in <i>P. aeruginosa\u2013B. thai</i> co-cultures relative to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> monocultures, suggesting that <i>B. thai</i> stimulates H1-T6SS expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

To determine whether elevated H1-T6SS arises from increased expression throughout the population or from high expression within a subset of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, we examined ClpV1-GFP at the level of individual cells. Consistent with a population-wide, graded response, we found that ClpV1-GFP exhibits a normal distribution both in monoculture and when <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is co-cultivated with <i>B. thai</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

To investigate the generality of these effects on the H1-T6SS, we repeated our experiments using the \u03b3-proteobacterium <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> as the competing organism. <i>P. aeruginosa</i> co-cultivated with <i>E. cloacae</i> also displayed increased ClpV1\u2013GFP levels and higher foci frequency in comparison to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in monoculture, indicating that this response is not specific to <i>B. thai</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>)."

Though this behavior was shown for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> \u2206<i>retS</i>, and not wild-type cells, the apparent capacity of the organism to sense the T6SS of a recipient cell prompted us to test whether T6S in non-self competitors is involved in stimulation of the H1 pathway. Indeed, we found that <i>B. thai</i> and <i>E. cloacae</i> strains bearing in-frame deletions of the <i>tssM</i> genes associated with their known antibacterial T6S pathways, are unable to stimulate T6S in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#media1 media2 media3\">Videos 1\u20133</a>) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Schwarz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Koskiniemi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Whitney et al., 2014</a>). Changes in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> growth rate dependent upon recipient T6S could influence gene expression and protein accumulation, potentially accounting for altered expression and activity of H1-T6SS proteins. However, this possibility was excluded by our observation that the doubling time of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is insensitive to the activity of the bacterial cell-targeting T6SS of <i>B. thai</i> (T6S<sup>BT</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that co-cultivation of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> with a non-self organism possessing an active T6S apparatus leads to elevated expression and activity of the H1-T6SS.

To determine if PARA requires the TPP, we monitored the T6S-dependent response of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> bearing a deletion in <i>pppA</i>, which encodes a TPP-associated phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mougous et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, though this deletion was previously shown to abrogate the ability of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> \u2206<i>retS</i> to respond differentially to bacteria containing or lacking a functional T6SS, we found that in the wild-type background, \u2206<i>pppA</i> retains the capacity to respond to T6S<sup>BT</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). PppA is a negative regulator of the TPP; therefore, we sought to rule out the possibility that the remaining TPP components, TagQ-T and PpkA, are sufficient to mediate PARA. Inactivation of all known components of the TPP results in a failure to assemble an active T6S apparatus, which would confound our analyses. However, activity can be restored to TPP deficient strains by the deletion of a gene encoding an independent post-translational repressor of the H1-T6SS, TagF (<a href=\"#bib68\">Silverman et al., 2011</a>). As observed with \u2206<i>pppA</i>, the H1-T6SS of a <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strain lacking <i>tagF</i> and all known TPP components (<i>\u2206</i>TPP \u2206<i>tagF</i>) was activated by <i>B. thai</i> in a T6S<sup>BT</sup>-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Consistent with measurements of expression and activation, growth competition experiments revealed that wild-type, <i>\u2206pppA</i>, and \u2206<i>tagF \u2206</i>TPP strains of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> intoxicate <i>B. thai</i> and <i>E. cloacae</i> with active interbacterial T6SSs more efficiently than those without (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

First, PARA is accompanied by changes to T6S gene expression, whereas dueling is a posttranslational behavior thought to involve rapid changes in protein localization. Second, the TPP was found to be essential for T6SS dueling (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basler et al., 2013</a>); however, this pathway is dispensable for PARA. Finally, spatiotemporal coordination of ClpV1-GFP-containing foci forms the basis for T6SS dueling, while such paired focus events are not correlated with PARA (data not shown).

In control experiments with <i>B. thai</i> \u2206<i>tssM-1</i> as the competitor, we observed no enhancement of H1-T6SS expression. Based on these data, we hypothesized that PARA is driven by the Gac/Rsm pathway."

In <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, the output of the Gac/Rsm pathway is modulated by three sensor kinases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jimenez et al., 2012</a>). We began by investigating GacS, which directly phosphorylates GacA, the response regulator that activates <i>rsmY</i> and <i>rsmZ</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Consistent with our hypothesis that PARA requires Gac/Rsm mediated signaling, we found that a strain bearing an in-frame deletion of <i>gacS</i> fails to elevate H1-T6SS expression in response to T6S<sup>BT</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The remaining Gac/Rsm-associated sensor kinases, RetS and LadS, play accessory roles in the Gac/Rsm pathway by positively or negatively regulating GacS phosphorylation of GacA, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Our experiments showed that strains lacking <i>ladS</i> respond to T6S<sup>BT</sup> similarly to the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>); however, we found that PARA is abrogated in strains lacking <i>retS</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This finding suggests that the relief of RetS repression of GacS-catalyzed phosphorylation of GacA is important in PARA induction. This might occur through direct binding of RetS to a signal produced by the presence of the competitor organism, or, alternatively, RetS could transduce a signal from an upstream sensor. To investigate these possibilities, we generated a <i>P. aeruginosa</i> strain bearing a chromosomally-encoded RetS variant containing an amino acid substitution of a highly conserved residue in the predicted periplasmic signal binding pocket (W90A) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jing et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Vincent et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with RetS acting as the direct sensor for PARA, in the <i>retS</i><sup>W90A</sup> background, neither ClpV1 expression levels nor activity were affected by co-cultivation with <i>B. thai</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). A general disruption of RetS function cannot be excluded; however, the finding that H1-T6SS expression levels in <i>retS</i><sup>W90A</sup> do not approach those detected in a \u2206<i>retS</i> mutant demonstrates that this allele retains partial function. Altogether, our findings suggest that RetS functions upstream in the Gac/Rsm pathway to mediate PARA."

We reasoned that the fitness of cells undergoing PARA is derived not only from an increase in expression and activity of the H1-T6SS, but also from increased levels of these co-regulated factors. To test this, we used growth competition assays and TLFM co-cultures to compare the fitness of \u2206<i>gacS</i> to a strain lacking only the function of the H1-T6S pathway (\u2206<i>tssM1</i>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the fitness of <i>\u2206gacS</i> was reduced beyond that of \u2206<i>tssM1</i> only when in competition with either <i>B. thai</i> (34-fold reduction) or <i>E. cloacae</i> (15-fold reduction) bearing an active interbacterial T6S pathway (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>).

To examine this, we computationally sorted <i>P. aeruginosa</i> into populations contacting or not contacting <i>B. thai</i> during the course of TLFM experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Surprisingly, we found no significant difference in ClpV1-GFP levels between these populations of cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), suggesting that either PARA does not require immediate cell contact between <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and a competitor, or <i>P. aeruginosa\u2013</i>competitor contacts can be sensed by non-contacting cells. To differentiate between these possibilities, we employed a population-level approach in which we measured PARA-associated phenotypes in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> cells following cultivation on an agar plate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Consistent with our microscopy experiments, PARA was detected in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> cultivated in the presence of <i>B. thai,</i> but not in monoculture or with <i>B. thai \u2206tssM-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>; Condition 1)<i>.</i> We next measured PARA in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> cells separated by a membrane from either a <i>B. thai</i> monoculture or a <i>P. aeruginosa\u2013B. thai</i> co-culture.

To gain a more comprehensive view of the effects of self-derived lysate on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> physiology, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to measure changes in protein abundance at the proteome level. To our knowledge, the global impact of Gac/Rsm activation on the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> proteome has not been reported. In lieu of this, we utilized a microarray study published by Lory and colleagues (\u2206<i>retS</i> vs wild-type) in order to generate a list of proteins under Gac/Rsm control. Given the short time scale of our experiment and the relatively slow rate by which many proteins are recycled, we focused on factors positively regulated by Gac/Rsm. Remarkably, despite constituting only 4.5% of the proteins detected in our proteome, known Gac/Rsm targets accounted for 49% of proteins induced greater than twofold by the addition of lysate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). We performed a gene set enrichment analysis and found that both Gac/Rsm regulated proteins and H1-T6SS proteins are significantly enriched in cells treated with lysate (Gac/Rsm: NES, 2.1, FDR \u2264 0.2%, p &gt; 0.01; H1-T6SS: NES, 1.6, FDR \u2264 5.1%, p &lt; 0.01) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Mootha et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>). The remaining 51% of induced proteins could include novel Gac/Rsm targets and lysate-responsive factors outside of the Gac/Rsm regulon. Together, these data show that self-derived lysate activates the Gac/Rsm pathway and is sufficient to induce PARA."

To this end, we measured the effect of lysate-induced PARA on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> fitness in growth competition experiments with <i>B. thai \u2206tssM-1</i>.

In growth competition experiments, the capacity to mount this multifaceted response grants <i>P. aeruginosa</i> a significant fitness benefit. Our results suggest that similar to multicellular organisms, injury to a bacterial colony can trigger the release of danger signals that lead to a coordinated response against the threat (<a href=\"#bib51\">Matzinger, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kaczmarek et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we focused on offensive factors under control of the Gac/Rsm pathway; however, defensive factors are also likely to be elaborated. For example, a consequence of Gac/Rsm activation in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is the production of c-di-GMP, which activates exopolysaccharide production of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Irie et al., 2012</a>). This increases cellular adhesiveness, which facilitates multicellular aggregates that are more resistant than planktonic cells to an assortment of antibacterial molecules and environmental stresses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colvin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Billings et al., 2013</a>). In the context of an infection such as the chronic lung infections that occur in cystic fibrosis patients, host-induced cellular lysis could activate Gac/Rsm and inadvertently convert cells to a state that is more resistant to killing by antibiotics and the immune system."

However, previous studies have shown that <i>P. aeruginosa</i> \u2206<i>retS</i> retains some ability to differentially target T6S- and T4S-positive vs -negative cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">LeRoux et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basler et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the response of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to antagonism is comprised of a global response mediated by the Gac/Rsm pathway and a secondary T6S-specific element that is not fully understood. We speculate that this ability of a \u2206<i>retS</i> strain is related to coordinated spatiotemporal localization of the apparatus among adjacent cells, and that these two mechanisms operate in concert to hone the offensive response of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. PARA may constitute an initial adaptation in which cells perceive a threat in their proximity and increase expression of the H1-T6SS, followed by the orientation of effector translocation specifically toward aggressor cells."

This mechanism differs from the model put forth by the Mekalanos laboratory, which suggested that the TPP is required for the response of wild-type <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to an incoming conjugative apparatus (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ho et al., 2013</a>). A key finding in the prior study was that polymyxin B, an outer membrane-disrupting antibiotic, induces <i>clpV1</i> foci formation in wild-type <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, but not in a strain lacking <i>tagT.</i> This finding, among other data involving strains in the \u2206<i>retS</i> background of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, led the authors to propose that membrane perturbations caused by an incoming T4 apparatus are sensed by the TPP. A <i>tagT</i> deletion strain intrinsically lacks H1-T6SS activity; therefore, interpreting its inability to respond to the antibiotic as evidence of TPP involvement is problematic (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Casabona et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ho et al., 2013</a>).

An alternative explanation for the findings of Ho et al. is that the application of polymyxin B promotes cell lysis, leading to PARA induction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barrow and Kwon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ho et al., 2013</a>). Attempts to test the validity of this explanation were confounded by pervasive cell death at the antibiotic concentration reported by the authors (20 \u03bcg/ml, \u223c40-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barrow and Kwon, 2009</a>)."

This process could be an altruistic behavior of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> that both aborts the T4S-dependent transfer event and alerts surrounding kin, thus decreasing the probability of foreign DNA acquisition by the colony. However, a second possibility is that plasmids such as RP4 carry interbacterial antagonistic factors that provide fitness to their hosts under certain conditions. It is interesting to note that Ho et al. identified an RP4 transposon mutant that was not targeted by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> but retained a functional T4SS (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ho et al., 2013</a>). This insertion resides in <i>trbN</i>, a gene encoding a periplasmic transglycosylase. It is plausible given the requirement for both T4 structural genes and this peptidoglycan-degrading accessory factor, that the T4S apparatus facilitates the transfer of this protein to recipient cells, where it induces lysis. Alternatively, upon plasmid transfer, the product of <i>trbN</i> may stochastically trigger lysis in a small portion of recipient cells."

This organism is a close relative of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and the Gac/Rsm pathways of the two species share a number of characteristics including regulation of hydrogen cyanide production and an H1-T6SS-like pathway. Haas et al. have made a number of intriguing observations pertaining to the production and sensing of Gac/Rsm-stimulating signals in <i>P. fluorescens</i> that are consistent with our findings in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Most notably, they found that conditioned media extracts derived from dense cultures of <i>P. fluorescens</i>, and, to a lesser extent, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, are sufficient to activate the Gac/Rsm pathway (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dubuis and Haas, 2007</a>). In agreement with our results, this indicates that the signal can be self-produced; however, it also raises the intriguing possibility that the lysis of non-self bacteria may activate PARA. While we found that <i>B. thai</i>-derived lysate was not sufficient to stimulate PARA, it is possible that other organisms produce the signal. This could lead to a positive feedback loop by which killed competitor cells further stimulate <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to produce antibacterial factors."

Our own efforts to identify the signaling molecule(s) contained within <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lysate, which included assorted enzymatic treatments, have so far been unsuccessful. Structural studies of RetS revealed its periplasmic region bears a fold resembling known carbohydrate interaction domains. A similar domain is predicted in the ecto domain of LadS (<a href=\"#bib74\">Vincent et al., 2010</a>). Given that RetS is required for PARA transduction, it is tempting to speculate that cell-associated carbohydrate(s) are released upon lysis and serve as a signal that activates Gac/Rsm in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jing et al., 2010</a>). The additional observation that extracts derived from multiple bacterial species can stimulate Gac/Rsm in <i>P. fluorescens</i> suggests two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: that the molecule is broadly conserved or that the pathway has evolved to respond to a number of inputs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dubuis and Haas, 2007</a>). The existence of three sensor kinases that operate upstream in the Gac/Rsm pathway of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> supports the latter hypothesis."

Our study demonstrates that \u2018competition sensing\u2019 includes an antibacterial response to cellular damage in kin cells. While we found that T6S-dependent killing by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is part of an antagonistic response to lytic threats, Borgeaud et al. reported that in <i>V. cholerae</i>, T6S is co-regulated with competence machinery and utilized for obtaining access to exogenous DNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Borgeaud et al., 2015</a>).

Moreover, we find that the response to such signals includes the activation of factors that combat the threat\u2014akin to the stimulation of inflammation in eukaryotes. It remains to be determined whether danger sensing is common among bacteria. The Gac/Rsm pathway is conserved widely among Gram-negative \u03b3-proteobacteria; however, the variability of genes under its control confounds a prediction of its general involvement in danger sensing (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lapouge et al., 2008</a>).

A least-squares fit of a constant times the cell template was then performed to the observed cell image. The noise was computed as the standard deviation of the cell intensity after subtracting the fits of the cytoplasmic fluorescence and the fits of all potential foci. The signal to noise of a potential focus was computed as the intensity of the brightest pixel divided by the noise of that cell, and was defined as a focus if the value exceeded an empirically determined threshold.

There are 257 proteins negatively regulated by Gac/Rsm, which constitutes 4.5% of the proteome.
