The <i>Caenorhabditis elegans unc-13</i> gene is required for SV exocytosis, and encodes long and short isoforms (UNC-13L and S). Fast release was mediated by UNC-13L, whereas slow release required both UNC-13 proteins and was inhibited by Tomosyn. The spatial location of each protein correlated with its effect. Proteins adjacent to the dense projection mediated fast release, while those controlling slow release were more distal or diffuse. Two UNC-13L domains accelerated release. C2A, which binds RIM (a protein associated with calcium channels), anchored UNC-13 at active zones and shortened the latency of release. A calmodulin binding site accelerated release but had little effect on UNC-13\u2019s spatial localization. These results suggest that UNC-13L, UNC-13S, and Tomosyn form a molecular code that dictates the timing of neurotransmitter release."

A long form of UNC-13, which is also found in mammals, promotes fast release of transmitter vesicles. Slow release is mediated by an independent pathway that involves both long and short UNC-13 proteins, as well as a protein called Tomosyn. As in mammals, long UNC-13 is localized to the sites at which calcium ions enter neurons, whereas short UNC-13 is more widely distributed throughout neurons."

To become competent to undergo calcium-evoked fusion, SVs must first physically attach to the plasma membrane (termed docking), and then must undergo a second process that has been termed priming. Docking and priming are both promoted by UNC-13/Munc13 proteins, whereas Tomosyn inhibits both processes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Verhage and Sorensen, 2008</a>). Mammals express four Munc13 isoforms (Munc13-1, ubMunc13-2, bMunc13-2, and Munc13-3), while <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expresses two. It is not known if each Munc13 protein has distinct functions.

It is generally believed that distinct calcium sensors are utilized for fast and slow release. Many studies suggest that the calcium sensor for fast release is Synaptotagmin I that binds calcium with low affinity and rapid kinetics (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chapman, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pang and Sudhof, 2010</a>). A recent study proposed that the calcium sensor for slow release is Doc2\u03b1 that binds calcium with high affinity and slow kinetics (<a href=\"#bib36\">Yao et al., 2011</a>). Beyond the use of distinct calcium sensors, it is unclear if fast and slow release are distinguished by other exocytic proteins. Several important questions remain unanswered. Do SVs equilibrate between the slow and fast pools? Is there a molecular code that determines whether SVs enter the fast or slow pool? Are fast and slow SVs regulated by distinct mechanisms?"

Transmission at this synapse is mediated by graded release of neurotransmitter, whereby release varies with the strength of depolarization (<a href=\"#bib21\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). When activity is low, transmission consists of endogenous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that are evoked by fusion of a single SV (<a href=\"#bib20\">Liu et al., 2005</a>). Following forced depolarization of the motor neuron (with a brief current pulse), large evoked EPSCs are produced consisting of the synchronous release of several hundred SVs. The ultrastructure of this synapse has been extensively characterized using the high-pressure freeze preservation technique. Each synapse contains a single dense projection that is surrounded by a pool of docked SVs, where docking occurs over a 1-\u03bcm domain of the presynaptic plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib35\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>). In immunostained electron micrographs, UNC-2 calcium channels are enriched at dense projections, indicating that they are the sites of calcium entry (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gracheva et al., 2008</a>). The active zone proteins UNC-10/RIM and UNC-13 promote docking of distinct population of SVs. In mutants lacking UNC-10/RIM, there was a reduction of docked SVs within 50 nm of the dense projection while SVs docked more distally were unaffected (<a href=\"#bib35\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gracheva et al., 2008</a>). By contrast, in <i>unc-13</i> mutants, there was a uniform reduction of docked SVs across the entire 1-\u03bcm domain (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gracheva et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>). Corresponding patterns of docking defects were observed in mouse Munc13 and RIM knockouts (<a href=\"#bib32\">Siksou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Han et al., 2011</a>). UNC-10/RIM and UNC-13 immunostaining was also concentrated near dense projections in electron micrographs, consistent with their playing a relatively direct role in SV docking (<a href=\"#bib35\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>). These results suggest that different proteins promote docking and fusion of distinct SV subpopulations. The functional significance of this spatial SV docking pattern remains unclear. Do proximal and distally docked SVs represent functionally distinct populations of SVs? Do they mediate different forms of neurotransmitter release or different forms of synaptic plasticity? Although this synapse has been characterized electrophysiologically, the mechanisms regulating release kinetics have not been analyzed."

Slow release is mediated by two UNC-13 isoforms (UNC-13L and S) and is inhibited by a third priming protein, the syntaxin-binding protein Tomosyn.

This possibility seems unlikely because the UNC-13 transgenes are not expressed in muscles. Nevertheless, we did two experiments to test this possibility (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>). First, the kinetics of endogenous EPSCs were unaltered in UNC-13L and UNC-13S rescue, indicating that the intrinsic kinetics of muscle ACh responses were not affected (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>). Second, we analyzed the contribution of postsynaptic receptor composition to evoked EPSC kinetics (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1I,J</a>). Body muscles express two classes of nicotinic ACh receptors, homomeric ACR-16 receptors and heteropentameric levamisole receptors (LevRs), which have distinct kinetic properties. ACR-16 receptors exhibit fast desensitization, whereas LevRs desensitize slowly (<a href=\"#bib9\">Francis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Touroutine et al., 2005</a>). Evoked EPSC decay kinetics was slower in <i>acr-16</i> mutants and was unaltered in <i>unc-29</i> Lev mutants. Evoked EPSC activation kinetics were unaltered in both <i>acr-16</i> and <i>unc-29</i> Lev mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1J</a>). Thus, changes in postsynaptic receptor composition cannot account for the altered evoked EPSC kinetics observed in UNC-13L- and UNC-13S-rescued animals. Instead, these results suggest that the altered evoked EPSC kinetics observed in UNC-13 transgenic animals are caused by changes in the kinetics of ACh release."

Tighter coupling is expected when SVs are physically closer to calcium channels or when they have higher intrinsic calcium sensitivity. Thus, differences in evoked EPSCs kinetics could be mediated by differential coupling of primed SVs to the sites of calcium entry. To test this idea, we analyzed the effects of the calcium chelator EGTA on evoked responses. Because EGTA binds calcium slowly, it inhibits SV fusions that occur later in time, that is the SVs that are more loosely coupled with calcium entry (<a href=\"#bib1\">Atluri and Regehr, 1996</a>)."

We recorded evoked release after adding a membrane-permeant form of EGTA to the extracellular recording solution (40 \u03bcM EGTA-AM). EGTA-AM is loaded into both motor neurons and body muscles. In our experiments, body muscle EPSCs are recorded using patch pipettes containing 5 mM EGTA. Consequently, any effect of EGTA-AM on synaptic transmission must be caused by changes in presynaptic calcium. In wild-type animals, EGTA treatment significantly reduced the quantal content (56% decrease, p&lt;0.001) of evoked EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). EGTA treatment accelerated both the activation and decay of evoked EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), resulting in accelerated charge transfer during evoked responses (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). EGTA had no effect on the latency of evoked release (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

To address this question, we analyzed <i>unc-13</i> mutants containing mutations that selectively inactivate UNC-13L.

Inactivating Tomosyn in UNC-13S animals significantly increased the quantal content (263% increase, p&lt;0.001).

These results suggest that mutants lacking UNC-13L, or its binding partner UNC-10/RIM, should have slower release. To test this idea, we compared release kinetics in <i>unc-13</i>(<i>e1091)</i> [L<sup>\u2212</sup>S<sup>+</sup>] and <i>unc-10</i> RIM mutants. Because both mutations dramatically reduce release, we analyzed double mutants lacking TOM-1/Tomosyn to increase the sensitivity of our experiments. The activation kinetics of evoked EPSCs in <i>tom-1 unc-13(e1091)</i> and in <i>tom-1; unc-10</i> double mutants were significantly slower than those in <i>tom-1</i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). In particular, the lag between the stimulus and activation of evoked release was prolonged in both double mutants (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Evoked responses in <i>tom-1 unc-13(e1091)</i> and in <i>tom-1; unc-10</i> double mutants were also significantly less EGTA-resistant than those in <i>tom-1</i> single mutants (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C,E</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that UNC-13L and UNC-10/RIM are required for fast release. The role of RIM in promoting fast release is likely conserved, as mouse and fly RIM knockouts exhibit similar changes in release kinetics and calcium coupling (<a href=\"#bib14\">Han et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>). Mutants lacking RIM also have decreased calcium channel density and decreased calcium entry at active zones (<a href=\"#bib14\">Han et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kaeser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>).

Based on these results, it was proposed that calmodulin binding to Munc13 comprises a calcium sensor for short-term plasticity.

Thus, UNC-13L promotes but is not required for slow release.

Further experiments will be required to test these ideas."

In this manner, fast and slow release could be independently adjusted by modulatory pathways. It is intriguing that the fast and slow release components appear to function in parallel. We were able to construct mutants in which evoked release is mediated purely by either the fast or slow mechanism. Thus, both forms of release can occur in isolation. These results imply that fast SVs are not derived from maturation of slow SVs, and vice versa. Our results are more compatible with the idea that fast and slow release comprise independent exocytosis mechanisms that operate in parallel. Fast and slow release share a requirement for UNC-13L, which provides a potential mechanism for coordinately regulating changes in these two release pathways."

This could have several important consequences for circuit function. Prolonged EPSCs will result in increased integration of synaptic inputs, which could alter the rate of postsynaptic spiking. Shifting the kinetics of postsynaptic responses could also alter spike timing-dependent plasticity. In sensory circuits, prolonged postsynaptic responses could alter the temporal integration of sensory inputs, and may alter the kinetics of sensory evoked responses. All these changes could have profound effects on circuit development, cognition, and behavior. Consistent with this idea, we recently showed that mutations linked to Autism alter the kinetics of neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hu et al., 2012</a>). For these reasons, there is significant interest in identifying molecular mechanisms that adjust the kinetics of neurotransmitter release."

All these molecules are conserved across phylogeny, and orthologous proteins are found at both NMJs and central synapses. Thus, we propose that the basic mechanisms governing the kinetics of neurotransmitter release are ancient, and will apply to many synapses. Consistent with this idea, a recent study showed that Munc13 proteins that lack C2A domains (bMunc13-2 and Munc13-3) are located more distally and mediate slow release at the Calyx of Held (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

Integrated transgenes were obtained by UV irradiation of strains carrying extrachromosomal arrays. All integrated transgenes were out-crossed at least six times. UNC-13L and UNC-13S expression constructs contained full-length cDNAs, with the exceptions noted below. For UNC-13L, we utilized a full-length ZK524.2e cDNA (spanning exons 1\u201331, excluding exon 14), whose expression as an SL1 spliced mRNA we confirmed by qPCR. The ZK524.2e cDNA corresponds to the LR mRNA previously described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kohn et al., 2000</a>). For UNC-13S, we confirmed expression of an SL1 spliced mRNA containing exons 14\u201331, which corresponds to the MR mRNA previously described (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kohn et al., 2000</a>). We could not detect expression of ZK524.2c, a WormBase predicted short UNC-13 mRNA, by qPCR; therefore, we utilized the full-length MR cDNA for UNC-13S imaging and an MR minigene (<i>nuIs46</i>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nurrish et al., 1999</a>) for electrophysiological recordings and behavior. Other UNC-13 constructs are as follows (all residue coordinates refer to the ZK524.2e protein sequence): \u0394C2A (KP#1907), ZK524.2e cDNA lacking the C2A domain (residues 1\u201396); UNC-13R (KP#1908), cDNA containing exons 15\u201331 (residues 611\u20131816); C2AR (KP#1909), cDNA containing the C2A domain (residues 1\u201396) fused to the R domain; CaMR (KP#1910), and F574R (KP#1911), cDNAs containing the predicted CaM binding site (residues 556\u2013610) or a mutated binding site fused to the R domain. For electrophysiological recordings, transgenes were expressed by the downstream <i>unc-13</i> promoter (UNC-13S rescue) or the <i>snb-1</i> promoter (all others). For imaging experiments, UNC-13 (c-terminal mCherry-tagged) and UNC-10 (<i>nuIs165</i>, c-terminal GFP tagged) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ch\u2019ng et al., 2008</a>) transgenes were expressed in DA and DB neurons, using the <i>unc-129</i> promoter."

Briefly, worms were reared at 20\u00b0C and moved to room temperature 30 min before imaging. Young adult animals were picked to agar plates with no bacterial lawn (30 worms per plate). Locomotion was analyzed 10 min after the worms were removed from food. 30 s videos of individual animals were captured at 5\u00d7 magnification and 4 Hz frame rate on a Zeiss Discovery Stereomicroscope using Axiovision software. The center of mass was recorded for each animal on each video frame using the object tracking software in the Axiovision software. The trajectories were then analyzed using custom software written in Igor Pro 5.0 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR)."

GFP fluorescence was normalized to the absolute mean fluorescence of 0.5-mm FluoSphere beads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For dorsal cord imaging, young adult worms, in which the dorsal cords were oriented toward the objective, were imaged in the region midway between the posterior gonad bend at the tail.

All recording conditions were as described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hu et al., 2012</a>). Stimulus-evoked EPSCs were stimulated by placing a borosilicate pipette (5\u201310 \u03bcm) near the ventral nerve cord (one muscle distance from the recording pipette) and applying a 0.4 ms, 30 \u03bcA square pulse using a stimulus current generator (WPI). On average, this stimulus evoked \u223c85% of the charge evoked by hypertonic sucrose, suggesting that a large fraction of the primed pool was released. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test."

They use the <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junction, which displays two clearly distinct kinetic components of release and exploit the relative ease of genetic manipulations in this system to provide important new information regarding two sources of heterogeneity: localization of vesicles relative to Ca-sources and intrinsic \u201cwillingness\u201d of vesicles to fuse. They relate these aspects to the only two isoforms of the UNC-13 protein, which are present in <i>C. elegans</i>, suggesting roles of the C2A domain of UNC-13L in proper localization of vesicles relative to the dense projection and the calmodulin-binding domain of the same isoform in accelerating release. Furthermore, they describe an inhibitory/competitive role of Tomosyn, acting on UNC-13S mediated release. The data are of highest relevance for the understanding of synaptic function."

A high Ca<sup>++</sup> sensitivity of the diffusely distributed CamMR would result in prolonged, EGTA-sensitive release. A decreased Ca<sup>++</sup> sensitivity, on the other hand, would produce short-lived EGTA-insensitive release, since release would be restricted to the peak-Ca, both temporally and spatially, since release probability is low and a high-power function of local [Ca<sup>++</sup>]. It should also be noted that the UNC-13L rescue has very low quantal content (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), as does the CAMR under EGTA. The final word regarding the mechanistic interpretation will require quantitative modeling. This, however, clearly goes beyond the scope of a single paper, since it requires knowledge about pool sizes and release probabilities, which may be difficult to quantitate. The conclusion that the CaM-binding domain makes fusion EGTA resistant would seem to be a safe conclusion."
