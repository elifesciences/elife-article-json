Here we identify a novel role of Crumbs as a negative regulator of actomyosin dynamics during dorsal closure in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. Embryos carrying a mutation in the FERM (protein 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain-binding motif of Crumbs die due to an overactive actomyosin network associated with disrupted adherens junctions. This phenotype is restricted to the amnioserosa and does not affect other embryonic epithelia. This function of Crumbs requires <i>D</i>Moesin, the Rho1-GTPase, class-I p21-activated kinases and the Arp2/3 complex. Data presented here point to a critical role of Crumbs in regulating actomyosin dynamics, cell junctions and morphogenesis."

Epithelial cells have a property known as polarity; this means that they have two different poles, one of which is in contact with the environment. Midway through embryonic development, the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo is covered by two kinds of epithelial sheets; the epidermis on the front, the belly and the sides of the embryo, and the amnioserosa on the back. In the second half of embryonic development, the amnioserosa is brought into the embryo in a process called dorsal closure, while the epidermis expands around the back of the embryo to encompass it."

Detailed analyses showed that this failure of dorsal closure is due to the over-activity of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in the amnioserosa. This results in increased and uncoordinated contractions of the cells, and is accompanied by defects in cell-cell adhesion that ultimately cause the amnioserosa to lose integrity.

The power of <i>Drosophila</i> genetics and cell biological tools have contributed to understand how signalling pathways, cell polarity and cell adhesion regulate the coordinated movements of two epithelial sheets, the epidermis and the amnioserosa (AS), a transient extraembryonic tissue [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib135\">R\u00edos-Barrera and Riesgo-Escovar, 2013</a>)]. More recently, elaborate biophysical techniques combined with high resolution imaging have elucidated how contractile forces are coordinated between cells in order to drive coherent changes in tissue morphology (<a href=\"#bib145\">Sokolow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Jayasinghe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Fischer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib167\">Wells et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Eltsov et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib136\">Saias et al., 2015</a>). DC is a complex morphogenetic process taking about 2\u2009hr, during which the epidermis expands dorsally to encompass the embryo. The process can be subdivided into three phases: i) elongation of the dorsal-most epidermal cells (DME) along the dorso-ventral axis; ii) contraction of AS cells and migration of the lateral epidermal cells towards the dorsal midline; iii) \u201czippering\u201d, i.e. adhesion of the epidermal cells from both sides on the dorsal midline [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib43\">Gorfinkiel et al., 2011</a>)]. Several forces contribute to these processes. First, pulsed contraction of AS cells produces a pulling force. These pulsed contractions are correlated with dynamic apical actomyosin foci, which transiently form in the apical medial cytocortex (<a href=\"#bib70\">Kiehart et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Hutson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib146\">Solon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Gorfinkiel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Blanchard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Heisenberg and Bellaiche, 2013</a>). Cells delaminating from the AS contribute additional pulling forces (<a href=\"#bib108\">Muliyil et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib145\">Sokolow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib158\">Toyama et al., 2008</a>). Second, a supracellular actomyosin cable, formed in the DME cells, surrounds the opening and provides contractile forces (<a href=\"#bib62\">Hutson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib131\">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2008</a>). Finally, \u201czippering\u201d of the two lateral epithelial sheets occurs, mediated by dynamic filopodia and lamellipodia (<a href=\"#bib30\">Eltsov et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Jacinto et al., 2000</a>)."

Beside transcription factors, these include adhesion molecules and signalling pathways, a variety of cytoskeletal proteins and their regulators. Non-muscle myosin-II heavy chain (MHC) and the non-muscle myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), encoded by <i>zipper (zip</i>) and <i>spaghetti-squash (sqh</i>), respectively, are, together with the essential light chain, part of a force-producing molecular motor during DC [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib163\">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Liu and Cheney, 2012</a>)]. The small G-proteins of the Rho family, namely Rho1, Rac1, Rac2, Mtl, and Cdc42, regulate actomyosin activity and cell-cell adhesion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abreu-Blanco et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Magie et al., 1999</a>; 2002). These GTPases stimulate myosin contraction through Rho-kinase (Rok) (<a href=\"#bib105\">Mizuno et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Harden et al., 1999</a>) or p21-activated kinase (<i>D</i>Pak) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Harden et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Conder et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Hofmann et al., 2004</a>). They also modulate the Arp2/3 complex, which consists of seven subunits conserved in almost all eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib134\">Rotty et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib160\">Veltman and Insall, 2010</a>).\u00a0The Arp2/3 complex promotes the formation of densely branched, rapidly treadmilling actin filament arrays that, together with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and the WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE), coordinate membrane-cytoskeleton dynamics (<a href=\"#bib82\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Kurisu and Takenawa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Blanchoin et al., 2014</a>).

Moreover, the <i>Drosophila</i> WAVE homolog SCAR, the main activator of Arp2/3 in fly embryos (<a href=\"#bib177\">Zallen et al., 2002</a>), is a downstream effector of Rac, Cdc42 and <i>D</i>Pak (<a href=\"#bib82\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Kurisu and Takenawa, 2009</a>). <i>D</i>Pak, in turn, can also activate the Arp2/3 complex independently of SCAR (<a href=\"#bib82\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Kurisu and Takenawa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib177\">Zallen et al., 2002</a>).

This leads to a complete breakdown of tissue integrity due to failure in positioning and maintaining the ZA, followed by apoptosis in many tissues, e.g. the epidermis and the AS (<a href=\"#bib44\">Grawe et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib153\">Tepass and Knust, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib154\">1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib156\">Tepass, 1996</a>).

We also showed that a variant, in which the conserved tyrosine<sub>10</sub> in the FERM-domain binding motif (FBM) is replaced by an alanine (<i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> variant) does not rescue embryonic lethality. Interestingly, the fosCrb<sub>Y10A</sub> variant properly localises at the apical domain in most embryonic epithelia, which undergo normal morphogenesis (i.e. germ band elongation, salivary gland invagination). But later in development, germ band (GB) retraction, dorsal closure (DC) and head involution fail to occur properly (<a href=\"#bib72\">Klose et al., 2013</a>). This indicated that the FBM of Crb fulfils a tissue- and stage-specific morphogenetic function in the embryo. Moreover, these defects appear to be independent of a putative Tyr phosphorylation, because another variant, in which the Y10 is replaced by a phenylalanine (<i>foscrb<sub>Y10F</sub></i>), completely rescues the embryonic lethality of <i>crb</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib72\">Klose et al., 2013</a>).

In order to determine whether apoptosis contributes to the disruption of the AS, we used the apoptotic reporter Apoliner, an RFP-GFP fusion protein localising at cell membranes of live cells. Caspase activation releases the GFP moiety, which is relatively unstable after cleavage, so dying cells have a stronger red appearance (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bardet et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Kolahgar et al., 2011</a>). Apoliner expression in the AS (specifically driven by the line GAL4<sup>332.3</sup>) of <i>foscrb</i> embryos (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>) revealed some apoptotic cells at the posterior canthus at the end of GB retraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, arrow). In <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos developed for the same period of time, more apoptotic cells are visible, some of which detach (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, arrowheads), while others remain attached to the posterior edge of the remaining AS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, arrow). As DC progresses in <i>foscrb</i> embryos, some apoptotic cells delaminate from the AS and are easily distinguished (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, blinking arrows \u2013some of these cells could be hemocytes with engulfed apoptotic debris, as reported previously [<a href=\"#bib7\">Bardet et al., 2008</a>]). At this stage, almost all AS cells in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos are apoptotic (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, compare embryos at 210\u2009min). Finally, at the end of DC, the internalised AS cells are localised in a central rod-like structure in <i>foscrb</i> embryos and subsequently die by apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) [as has been reported for wild type embryos (<a href=\"#bib123\">Reed et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib142\">Shen et al., 2013</a>)], while in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos at this time point the remaining AS cells are completely disaggregated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). To summarise, the AS in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos breaks apart and undergoes premature apoptosis (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>), supporting the conclusion that an intact FBM is required for maintaining the integrity of the AS."

Because Yrt is a FERM protein that negatively regulates Crb by directly interacting with its FBM (<a href=\"#bib81\">Laprise et al., 2006</a>), Yrt appeared as a likely candidate in mediating the <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> mutant phenotype. Yrt localises at the lateral domain and concentrates towards the apical aspect in a Crb-dependent manner from stage 13 onwards (<a href=\"#bib81\">Laprise et al., 2006</a>). We found that independently of the fosmid genotype, Yrt concentrates correctly towards the apical aspect of the cells (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Moreover, embryos expressing <i>foscrb</i> and lacking zygotic <i>yrt</i> show defects in DC mainly after GB retraction, when a failure in the zippering at the posterior canthus is patent (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>, arrow in the upper embryo). Despite this, the overall AS integrity is preserved during DC and most of the zippering is completed, leaving a hole only at the posterior canthus. This phenotype is completely different from the phenotype of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos described above (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Significantly, embryos with both the zygotic <i>yrt</i> mutant allele and the <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> variant do not show amelioration of the <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> phenotype (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>, bottom embryo). These embryos show strong defects in GB retraction, and the integrity of the AS is lost as development progresses. These results show that the DC phenotype of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos starts earlier in development and is more complex than that in <i>yrt</i> mutants, as the former fail in germ band retraction, lose the AS and do not progress on the zippering process. Thus, Yrt seems not to be involved in the phenotype of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos."

The mutant phenotype described here is characterised by defects in both the AS and the DME cells. To assess whether defects in the DME observed in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos are the result of impaired JNK signalling, we used the reporter line <i>puc-lacZ</i> (<a href=\"#bib98\">Mart\u00edn-Blanco et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib128\">Ring and Martinez Arias, 1993</a>). At the beginning of DC, the DME cells of <i>foscrb</i> and <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos are \u03b2-gal positive (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), with few <i>lacZ</i>-positive nuclei in the row of cells ventral to DME cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>, arrowheads). At advanced DC, <i>foscrb</i> embryos still show a single row of \u03b2-gal positive cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), while in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos \u03b2-gal positive nuclei can also be found at positions more ventral to the DME cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, arrowheads). However, given that there is no significant difference in the number of \u03b2-gal positive nuclei along 50 \u03bcm of the dorsal epidermis between these genotypes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>, brackets and 4K), we suggest that this phenotype is the result of aberrant elongation of the DME cells in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos (see for example <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Accordingly, at the time when <i>foscrb</i> embryos complete DC, these embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>) and <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos exhibit a single row of \u03b2-gal positive cells on each side of the dorsal epidermis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). This is independent of whether the epidermis fuses on the dorsal midline (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>, encircled by dashed line), closes on the same side of the epidermis, thus causing bunching of the tissue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>, encircled by dotted line) or does not touch any contra-lateral epidermis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>, arrow). A normal activation of JNK signalling is also observed in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10F</sub></i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), showing that JNK signalling appears to be normal in the DME cells of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos."

These dynamics, which are evident in stage 13 <i>foscrb</i> embryos (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>) similar as in wild-type embryos, is characterised by pulsed contractions of the AS cells. In <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos, however, the pulsed contraction are difficult to follow, since individual cells can hardly be distinguished due to the highly disrupted ZA (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and 5B</a>). Pulsed-contraction of wild-type AS cells has been correlated with a regular appearance and disappearance of medial actomyosin foci (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blanchard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">David et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib146\">Solon et al., 2009</a>).

A similar behaviour was observed for F-actin (labelled with Utrophin::GFP (<a href=\"#bib121\">Rauzi et al., 2010</a>) -data not shown). Importantly, analysis of the periodicity of foci formation shows that <i>foscrb</i> and <i>foscrb<sub>Y10F</sub></i> embryos have similar pulsed contractions, while <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos have aberrant contractions, in that foci are more persistent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

Thus, if over-active actomyosin is responsible for the DC defects of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos, we expect that expressing Flapwing (<i>flw</i>), the major <i>Drosophila</i> Sqh phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib161\">Vereshchagina et al., 2004</a>), may suppress the DC defects. In fact, UAS-driven expression of Flw in the AS of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos leads to a suppression of the DC phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>), while it does not produce any evident dominant phenotype in <i>foscrb</i> or <i>foscrb<sub>Y10F</sub></i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In addition, impaired <i>D</i>E-cad localisation suggest impaired adhesion. Overall, our results define a novel role of the FBM of Crb as an essential negative regulator of actomyosin dynamics in the AS during DC in <i>Drosophila</i>. This function is not allele-specific, since embryos carrying a <i>crb</i> allele, in which Y10, P12 and E16 in the FBM are replaced by alanines (<a href=\"#bib60\">Huang et al., 2009</a>) develop a similar DC phenotype as <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos (data not shown). Genetic interaction studies revealed that this function of the FBM is mediated by <i>D</i>Moesin, members of the Rho family, the p21 activated kinase <i>D</i>Pak, and the SCAR-Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>)."

However, the multitude of phenotypes observed in the DME cells of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> mutant embryos, such as persistence of Crb<sub>Y10A</sub>, <i>D</i>Patj and Baz proteins and decrease of Ed expression at the LE, as well as disruption of the supracellular actomyosin cable and disorganised filopodia, suggest that Crb performs also specific functions in the DME. One possibility is that Crb influences actomyosin activity and filopodia formation in the DME cells by regulating the stability and localisation of Ena, the major regulator of protrusive activity at the LE (<a href=\"#bib113\">Nowotarski et al., 2014</a>). Another possibility is that Crb regulates the LE actomyosin by modulating the localisation of Baz. In wild-type embryos, the removal of Baz from the LE (<a href=\"#bib80\">Laplante and Nilson, 2011</a>) allows the relocation of the lipid phosphatase Pten, which, in turn, results in a localised accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate at the LE, promoting the formation of filopodia along the LE (<a href=\"#bib116\">Pickering et al., 2013</a>)."

In fact, cortical localisation of <i>D</i>Pak in the AS of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos appears to be increased in some cells (data not shown). In addition, over-expression of Pak-AID in the AS of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> suppresses the GB retraction and DC phenotypes. A similar degree of suppression was observed upon over-expression of Flw, a negative regulator of Sqh. Members of the Rho GTPase family are well-established upstream regulators of actomyosin dynamics. Our data suggest that Rho1 plays a crucial role downstream of Crb, since heterozygosity of <i>Rho1<sup>1B</sup></i> partially suppresses the DC phenotype of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos. Previous data showed that over-expression of the constitutively active or dominant-negative form of Rac1 in the AS of wild-type embryos results in AS disruption (<a href=\"#bib48\">Harden et al., 2002</a>). Our observation that the phenotype of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos is enhanced upon expression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 in the AS of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos suggests that Rac1 may act upstream of Crb or in a parallel pathway. Since the effects of dominant negative Cdc42<sup>N17</sup> could not be studied due to technical difficulties (see Materials and methods), we cannot exclude any contribution of Cdc42 in this process. Therefore, our data so far support a role of Rho1 in the Crb-mediated control of actomyosin dynamics in the AS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>)."

They go on to show that Baz and Par6-aPKC have opposite effects on foci duration, in that Baz promotes and Par6-aPKC complex inhibits the duration of foci. The interplay between these polarity complexes and the actomyosin system seems to establish a delayed negative feedback that promotes the cyclic contractions in the AS (<a href=\"#bib25\">David et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">2013</a>). In fact, Crb::GFP also exhibits a similar pulsation as Zip::GFP in the AS (own unpublished observations), so it will be important to analyse whether Crb<sub>Y10A</sub>::GFP mutant proteins have different dynamics in comparison to the wild type Crb."

Interestingly, <i>D</i>Pak is not only a regulator of actomyosin dynamics, but is also involved in supporting ZA stability, both in <i>Drosophila</i> and in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib92\">Lozano et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Braga et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Akhtar and Hotchin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Pirraglia et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Menzel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">2008</a>). The role of <i>D</i>Pak itself in DC morphogenesis is still controversial. Previous work showed that cell shape changes in the AS occur normally in embryos lacking maternal and zygotic <i>Dpak</i> and that inhibition of <i>D</i>Pak in the AS does not prevent apical constriction of amnioserosa cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Conder et al., 2004</a>). However, wild-type embryos expressing Pak-AID in the AS show defects in head involution and DC, which are stronger than those of embryos devoid of maternal and zygotic <i>D</i>Pak. This led the authors to suggest that Pak-AID may also affect the activity of a second kinase, Pak3, in the AS (<a href=\"#bib23\">Conder et al., 2004</a>). Thus, whether inhibition of <i>D</i>Pak, Pak3 or both upon expression of Pak-AID in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos accounts for the rescuing effect of the DC phenotype, including rescue of the ZA, remains to be clarified."

                                "text": "How can <i>D</i>Pak regulate ZA integrity? ZA remodelling is essential for morphogenesis, and this remodelling is driven by the endocytosis and recycling of junctional components (<a href=\"#bib50\">Harris, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Matsubayashi et al., 2015</a>). <i>D</i>Pak can activate the Arp2/3 complex directly or via the <i>Drosophila</i> WAVE homolog SCAR (<a href=\"#bib82\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Kurisu and Takenawa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib177\">Zallen et al., 2002</a>). Arp2/3, in turn, has been implicated in the regulation of ZA stability, e.g. in the <i>Drosophila</i> notum, where it maintains ZA stability by regulating the endocytosis of junctional components (<a href=\"#bib165\">Watanabe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib119\">Quiros and Nusrat, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Georgiou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Leibfried et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, reducing the activity of the Arp2/3-complex suppresses the DC phenotype of <i>\u03b1-Cat</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib137\">Sarpal et al., 2012</a>), and the Arp2/3\u2013WAVE/SCAR complexes associate with E-cad clusters and regulate their endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib162\">Verma et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Kovacs et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Lecuit and Yap, 2015</a>). In fact, <i>D</i>E-cad endocytosis is enhanced in a Rho1-dependent manner when junctions are under stress and <i>D</i>E-cad clusters are also down-regulated via inhibition of Par3 by Rok (<a href=\"#bib85\">Levayer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Lecuit and Yap, 2015</a>). Our results are in agreement with a role of Arp2/3 in regulating ZA stability in the AS. Heterozygosity of <i>SCAR<sup>\u220637</sup>, Arp1<sup>Q25st</sup></i> or <i>Arp3<sup>EP3640</sup></i> not only partially restored <i>D</i>E-cad::GFP localisation at the ZA in the AS of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos and suppressed DC defects, but even rescued the lethality of <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> flies. Fusion of abdominal segments in adult escapers suggest that Crb may also be involved in histoblast fusion during metamorphosis (<a href=\"#bib94\">Madhavan and Madhavan, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Ninov et al., 2007</a>). Myosin-II activity itself has also been shown to be essential for the maintenance of AJs in some cases. Mice ablated for NMHC II-A die by E7.5 due to massive defects in cell-cell contacts and epithelial multi-layering accompanied by loss of E-cad and \u03b2-catenin from adhesion sites (<a href=\"#bib24\">Conti et al., 2004</a>). Similarly, ZA stability in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic ectoderm depends on myosin-II contractility and requires interactions with actin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Engl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib159\">Truong Quang et al., 2013</a>). Finally, Rok and myosin-II activities participate in ZA remodelling in the <i>Drosophila</i> pupal eye by regulating the formation of <i>D</i>E-cad recycling endosomes (<a href=\"#bib174\">Yashiro et al., 2014</a>). Because the SCAR-Arp2/3 complex is an important enhancer of actin protrusions (<a href=\"#bib172\">Wood et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abreu-Blanco et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Georgiou and Baum, 2010</a>), it is also plausible that reducing its activity in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos stabilises the ZA indirectly."

During gastrulation in <i>C. elegans</i> a molecular clutch has been postulated to connect the myosin network with the adhesion sites to transmit the force generated by the actomyosin contractions (<a href=\"#bib133\">Roh-Johnson et al., 2012</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, the actomyosin contractions in the AS are initially uncoupled from apical contractions and hence the ZA (<a href=\"#bib146\">Solon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Gorfinkiel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Blanchard et al., 2010</a>). Successive rows of amnioserosa cells are then sequentially stabilised in a contracted state, driving further contraction of the tissue. The surface stabilization mechanism is not known, but is likely to involve an increase in cellular stiffness [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib114\">Paluch and Heisenberg, 2009</a>)]. In <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos the actomyosin foci in the AS emerge prematurely before the onset of germ band retraction, whereas in wild-type these foci are more abundant after the end of germ band retraction (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and data not shown). Thus, the early over-contraction of the actomyosin in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos may induce a premature coupling to the ZA, thus disrupting germ band retraction and DC. An interesting candidate for this coupling is the protein Canoe, which binds to \u03b1-catenin (<a href=\"#bib139\">Sawyer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Pokutta et al., 2002</a>), and whose absence results in a DC phenotype (<a href=\"#bib67\">J\u00fcrgens et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib150\">Takahashi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Boettner et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Choi et al., 2011</a>).

All genotypes (<i>foscrb;crb<sup>GX24</sup>, foscrb<sub>Y10F</sub>;crb<sup>GX24</sup></i> and <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub>;crb<sup>GX24</sup></i>) were collected under the same conditions, at the same time and during the same period (indicated in the respective figure legend). In this way, the comparison between <i>foscrb</i> or <i>foscrb<sub>Y10F</sub></i> and <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> mutant phenotypes show the differences observed at a specific time after egg laying. Embryos were collected on apple juice plates at 25\u00baC and then incubated for the appropriate times at 25\u00baC or 28\u00baC, dechorionated in 3% sodium hypochlorite for 3\u2009min, fixed for 20\u2009min in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution/heptane V/V 1:1. Vitelline membrane was removed by strong shaking in heptane/methanol v/v 1:1, except for the staining of actin in which the vitelline membrane was removed by strong shaking in 80% ethanol. Embryos were blocked for 2\u2009hr at room temperature in PBT (PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100) + 5% normal horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich H1270, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Embryos were incubated for 2\u2009hr at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00baC with primary antibodies (see <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). For analysis of Zipper localisation, we used the protein trap line <i>Zipper::GFP</i> (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and the staining was done using the anti-GFP antibody. Incubations with the appropriate secondary antibodies were performed for 1\u2009hr at room temperature. Stained embryos were mounted in glycerin propyl gallate (75% glycerol, 50 mg/mL propyl gallate) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 780 NLO confocal microscope (ZEISS Microscopy, Jena, Germany) with a C-Apochromat 40x/1.2W Corr objective with the correction collar at 0.18 (at this position the brightness and contrast was enhanced). To distinguish homozygous embryos, in all the stainings an anti-GFP antibody was included to stain for the balancer-provided GFP. All images for a given marker in different genotypes were taken under the same settings for laser power, PMT gain and offset. Maximal projections, merging and LUT-pseudocolor assignment was performed using Fiji (<a href=\"#bib140\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>). For the FIRE-LUT pseudocolor 0 is black and 255 is white. Mounting was done in Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.0.1 and when brightness and contrast was adjusted, the modifications were equally applied to all the set of images for a given marker."

The pinhole was adjusted for faster acquisition, so the step sizes correspond to 2.01 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">11, 13</a>, <a href=\"#media13\">14</a>), 2.3 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">6</a>), 1.2 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">12</a>), 1.46 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">9</a>). 4D-Hyperstacks were processed with Fiji (<a href=\"#bib140\">Schindelin et al., 2012</a>) and the movies were rendered with Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.0.1. Under these conditions we observed that <i>w;foscrb,DE-cad::GFP;crb<sup>GX24</sup></i> embryos imaged for &gt;7\u2009hr at 5\u2009min time lapse hatched and survived without showing any obvious damage (data not shown)."

The authors examine the role of this allele in relation to the major known mechanical and signaling pathways for dorsal closure: the DME supracellular actin cable, DME leading edge protrusions, contractions of the amnioserosa, and the JNK pathway. The authors find that JNK signaling is essentially intact, while the DME supracellular actin cable, and DME protrusions are disrupted, with mostly expected changes to proteins known to mediate these structures. In regards to the amnioserosa itself, the authors find that this structure has disrupted zonula adherens and, through a series of rescue experiments, conclude that the major defect is due to excessive Rho-mediated amnioserosa contractions."

The \"meat\" of the manuscript lies on the set of rescue experiments of dorsal closure, and particularly of amnioserosa morphogenesis. However, the authors make the analysis of the defects at the level of dorsal epidermal cells an important part of the work which then seems to be set aside. The inclusion of the section describing AS cells becoming migratory is not salient to the authors' major points, but is a bold statement with the data presented.

However, such movies and kymographs (of selected foci) do not give a sufficiently quantitative overview of the effect. The authors should quantify periods for randomly chosen foci in the wt, Y10F and Y10A cells. At least tens of foci should be analyzed, if not a hundred or so.

My interpretation of the first 3 rows of the table is that the expression of <i>UAS-Actin-RFP</i>, under the control of an amnioserosal driver (I shouldn't have to reference another table to figure out where Gal4-332.2 is expressed) substantially suppresses the most severe dorsal open phenotype (i.e., from 59.7 to 18.5), but the authors don't comment on that. Perhaps they want us only to focus on the penetrance of the wt-like phenotype? If so they should explicitly say so and they should consider pooling the defects into a single dorsal open category, perhaps relegating the more detailed panel to supplementary material). Moreover, where they do explicitly draw our attention to changes, the comparisons seem flawed. They ask us to compare row 4 to row 3 to show that <i>UAS-crb</i> expression increases the most severe dorsal hole, but the embryos in row 4 don't express <i>UAS-actin-RFP</i> and the expression of <i>UAS-actin-RFP</i> greatly affects the number of animals in the most severe category (compare row 3 to rows 1 and 2). Similarly, rows 9 and 10 are compared to 3, but 9 and 10 don't express <i>UAS-actin-RFP</i>.

The authors go on to write \"At the end of DC, the internalised AS cells are localised in a central rod-like structure in <i>foscrb</i> and foscrbY10F embryos and subsequently die by apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D, E</a>) [as has been reported for wild type embryos (Reed et al., 2004)], while in <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> embryos of similar age, the remaining AS cells have completely disaggregated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).\" What do they authors mean by \"a similar age\"?

And we know that mutation of this domain has no effect on the many other tissues where Crumbs has a role, but has lethal phenotype in the embryo, which this study shows to be due to an overactive actomyosin network. The live-imaging of Cadherins using <i>D</i>E-cad::GFP knock-in allele in a <i>crb</i> null background with formed introduced variants of crumbs is well-executed, systematic and key part of the study from which the conclusions are derived. The authors cleanly demonstrate a Yrt independent role and then show that <i>foscrb<sub>Y10A</sub></i> show defects in the establishment of the actomyosin apparatus cells in a situation where components of the Zonula Adherens are disturb or missing. Next the authors go on to show that the FBM of Crb is an important regulator of cytoskeletal activity and cell-cell adhesion of the amnioserosa and required for its proper morphogenesis. The next set of experiments are the 'meat' of the paper and they comprehensively address the role of Crumbs FBM in actomyosin dynamics and show that the FBM of Crb regulates actomyosin dynamics in the amnioserosa during dorsal closure by down-regulating the Rho1 pathway. Finally the authors show that the dorsal-closure phenotype of CrbY<sub>10A</sub> embryos also due to reduced adhesion. The authors have carefully dissected out Crumb function through the FBM. As they point out we do not yet know if the actomyosin phenotype and the reduced adhesion ones are linked or not. The phenotypes could result from defects in amnioserosa differentiation or in its attachment to the basal lamina. The authors raise this point themselves and have 'data not shown' to negate such conclusions. It will be good to see this data. While the work convincingly demonstrates a novel function of the FBM in cytoskeleton dynamics and also show that Crb regulation of amnioserosa morphogenesis involves <i>D</i>Moesin, Rho- GTPases, class-I Pak, and the SCAR-Arp2/3 complex, two questions remain. How does this regulation take place (three ways are suggested) and why other epithelia which require Crumbs does not seem to require this domain (while requiring the downstream partners). The key question then is whether the role of the FBM show is a peculiarity that details out an aspect of Crumbs or if it is telling us something broader about its role in epithelial morphogenesis. It will be good to see a discussion on this."

For a substantially revised manuscript to make a valuable contribution to</i> eLife <i>there are several major issues, including important controls that need to be addressed. The authors need to improve the delivery if they want this paper to have the impact they want it to have. As presented, it is difficult to read and experimentally incomplete. Part of the problem is that paragraphs are not very well structured and topic sentences don't adequately describe the topics addressed in the paragraph. Thus the reader is expecting to learn about one thing but data and details are presented regarding many others. Part of the problem may also be that the authors have presented a lot of material (too much material?) and as a consequence, the presentation is not as clear or complete as it might be. There are in addition some technical problems with the data as presented. The authors should focus on presenting their findings more clearly and more completely, potentially removing some findings in order to better document and provide appropriate controls on other findings.</i> We substantially modified the text and thus improved clarity. In addition, we removed some of the data (or present them as supplementary material). For example, the Y10F variant was used as a control to show that mutating the Y10 is not, by itself, destructive and that the defects in the Y10A variant are due to a conformational defect rather than a putative phosphorylation defect. Indeed, it was shown recently by Wei et al., (J Biol Chem 2015 290:11384) that the Y10A mutation in the FBM of Crb ablates the interaction with Moesin. We removed all results from the Y10F variant from the main figures, and added them as complementary when necessary. Also, we removed all the movies with the results of the Y10F variant. We modified the text accordingly, to improve the flow of the text."

Therefore the authors must with clarity establish that the phenotypes are due to the mutant domain (the authors still need to verify that the protein is properly folded and trafficked to conclude that the phenotypes are domain- and not simply crb- specific). Better showing the localization of the mutant protein at higher resolution and in all tissues would be valuable. Presumably, in tissues that are unaffected, it should look precisely like the wild type or the Y10F variant.</i> "

Nonetheless, in the first paragraph of the Results section we stress that the fosCrb<sub>Y10A</sub> protein localises apically in most embryonic epithelia, which also appear to have normal cell polarity (like the epidermis, for example). Besides this, in our current manuscript you can see the localisation of Crb and Crb<sub>Y10A</sub> in the embryonic epidermis (previously <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J, K, L</a>; now <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure1I, J</a>). The localisation of all these variants in the amnioserosa is very difficult to obtain in fixed samples, because it appears to be highly dynamic according to our observations with a <i>fosCrb::EGPF</i> version (D.F.B and E.K. unpublished observations)."

The \"meat\" of the manuscript lies on the set of rescue experiments of dorsal closure, and particularly of amnioserosa morphogenesis. However, the authors make the analysis of the defects at the level of dorsal epidermal cells an important part of the work which then seems to be set aside. The inclusion of the section describing AS cells becoming migratory is not salient to the authors' major points, but is a bold statement with the data presented.

Of course it is possible to gauge the intensity of <i>D</i>E-cad along the ZA in both <i>foscrb</i> and <i>foscrb<sub>Y10F</sub></i> embryos (for example with a line profile).

In particular, the model has Rok and</i> D<i>Pak as positive regulators of MLCK. My understanding is that MLCK, Rok and</i> D<i>Pak all phosphorylate sqh directly, so arrows from Rok and Pak to MLCK and not to sqh are at best misleading and more likely simply wrong (unless there are data in the literature that I simply don't know about). Second, Rok has an inhibitory connection to flapwing. Is that really the case? Does Rok phosphorylate Flapwing to inhibit its phosphatase activity or otherwise bind to Flapwing to sequester its activity?</i> "

We also added the definitions of the abbreviations to the figure legend."
