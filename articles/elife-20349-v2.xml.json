However, the mechanisms underlying the numerous and diverse experimentally observed properties of theta sequences remain poorly understood. Here we account for theta sequences using a novel model constrained by the septo-hippocampal circuitry. We show that when spontaneously active interneurons integrate spatial signals and theta frequency pacemaker inputs, they generate phase precessing action potentials that can coordinate theta sequences in place cell populations. We reveal novel constraints on sequence generation, predict cellular properties and neural dynamics that characterize sequence compression, identify circuit organization principles for high capacity sequential representation, and show that theta sequences can be used as substrates for association of conditioned stimuli with recent and upcoming events. Our results suggest mechanisms for flexible sequence compression that are suited to associative learning across an animal\u2019s lifespan."

In a given brain area, the electrical impulses at any particular moment can be thought of as forming a code that represents an aspect of the outside world. For example, groups of nerve cells in the hippocampus generate a type of code called a theta sequence, which represents a series of recent and upcoming events. The specific timing of electrical impulses within a theta sequence is crucial in creating certain types of memory."

Furthermore, the model shows how memory capacity depends on these connections."

The discovery that during movement hippocampal place cells fire action potentials with timing that precesses relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm (<a href=\"#bib61\">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</a>), and that time-compressed representations of behavioral sequences occur as spike sequences within each theta cycle (<a href=\"#bib71\">Skaggs et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Foster and Wilson, 2007</a>), suggests that hippocampal activity is organized so that computations on a millisecond neural timescale can address events on behavioral timescales. Thus, spike sequences within theta cycles may form a neuronal substrate for episodic and spatial memory (<a href=\"#bib62\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lisman and Redish, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Moser, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</a>). Nevertheless, the circuit mechanisms through which theta sequences are generated are unclear and the mechanisms by which they may contribute to learning have received relatively little attention."

                        "text": "Several features of theta sequences that may be important for their computational functions pose challenges to models attempting to explain their generation through biophysically constrained mechanisms. First, the rate at which action potentials precess relative to the theta rhythm depends on an animal\u2019s speed of movement (<a href=\"#bib25\">Geisler et al., 2007</a>). Second, phase precession occurs along arbitrary two-dimensional trajectories (<a href=\"#bib35\">Huxter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Climer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jeewajee et al., 2014</a>). Third, theta sequences emerge within theta waves that propagate along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Patel et al., 2012</a>). Fourth, while place cells across the dorsoventral axis have field sizes that vary over an order of magnitude, spike phase nevertheless usually advances by a maximum of a single theta cycle across their place field indicating that the rate of phase precession varies dorsoventrally (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kjelstrup et al., 2008</a>). Finally, to successfully distinguish behavioral episodes, distinct theta sequences must be generated for experiences over an animal\u2019s lifetime, implying that sequence generation must be both flexible and have a high capacity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chadwick et al., 2015</a>). We previously introduced a phenomenological model which demonstrates that experimentally observed theta sequences can be accounted for by phase precession in independent place cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chadwick et al., 2015</a>). This is in contrast to suggestions that synaptic coordination within and between cell assemblies is required to explain theta sequences (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tsodyks et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Harris et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Harris, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Maurer and McNaughton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lisman and Redish, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Several cellular mechanisms for independent phase precession have been proposed (<a href=\"#bib61\">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mehta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Harris et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lengyel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Leung, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chance, 2012</a>), but none appear able to account for the challenges above while maintaining consistency with the hippocampal circuitry (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> and Discussion). Thus, the biophysical mechanisms through which an independent phase coding scheme could be implemented within the CA1 circuitry while accounting for known computationally important properties of theta sequences are not clear."

CA1 pyramidal cells make few direct connections with one another (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anderson et al., 2007</a>) (but see <a href=\"#bib78\">Yang et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that phase precession in CA1 arises through some combination of intrinsic cellular properties, external inputs to the circuit and local interactions between pyramidal cells and interneurons. Major sources of input to CA1 include spatially modulated signals from CA3 and from the entorhinal cortex, and temporally patterned GABAergic inputs from the medial septum, which target hippocampal interneurons and act as a pacemaker to entrain theta oscillations in the circuit (<a href=\"#bib22\">Freund and Antal, 1988</a>). Previously proposed mechanisms for independent phase precession focus on integration of signals by place cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mehta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Harris et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lengyel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Leung, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chance, 2012</a>). However, many interneurons also fire spikes that precess in phase against the theta rhythm, with interneuron phase precession exhibiting strong functional coupling to individual pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Maurer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Geisler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2007</a>). Thus, we asked whether phase precession underlying sequence generation could originate from interneuron dynamics. To address this possibility we introduce a minimal circuit model in which phase precession and theta sequences are generated through interactions between place cells and interneurons driven by pacemaker inputs. In contrast to the view that phase precession in interneurons is inherited synaptically from phase precessing place cell assemblies (<a href=\"#bib52\">Maurer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Geisler et al., 2007</a>), interneuron phase precession in our model is crucial for the coordination of spike timing in place cells and for the generation of theta sequences. Due to the transient functional coupling between place cells and interneurons, phase precession occurs dynamically whenever a place cell is driven by external inputs. Consequently, phase precession and theta sequences are generated de novo within the network, and slow input sequences are automatically compressed into theta sequences in networks of interacting pyramidal cells and interneurons."

The proposed mechanism not only generates sequences encoding spatial trajectories, but can also function as a general purpose circuit with a remarkably high capacity for encoding temporally extended sequences of events. We show how such a compression of ongoing experience into theta cycles enables flexible learning of behavioral associations through spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Thus, CA1 may compress ongoing experiences during theta states into fast neural activity patterns suitable for online learning and decision making."

Whereas in many previous models precession is assumed to arise from oscillatory drive targeting place cells, the frequency of theta is established by septal GABAergic projections to hippocampal interneurons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Freund and Antal, 1988</a>), which in turn coordinate the spiking activity of local CA1 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Royer et al., 2012</a>). We therefore reasoned that phase precession could emerge from the dynamics of interneurons driven by pacemaker inputs and interacting with pyramidal cells. To explore this possibility we constructed a minimal network model containing a single interneuron and pyramidal cell, with synaptic connectivity based on this architecture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The interneuron is driven to fire tonically by a constant depolarizing current, while pacemaker drive from the medial septum to the interneuron is simulated by an 8 Hz oscillatory current, which is sufficient to fully entrain spiking activity of the interneuron when the pyramidal cell is inactive (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). In this case, output from the interneuron drives rhythmic subthreshold theta frequency inhibitory synaptic potentials in the pyramidal cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). When spatial input to the pyramidal cell is simulated by a suprathreshold external drive, the resulting synaptic drive to the interneuron initiates phase precession in the coupled pair of cells, causing their firing frequency to elevate above that of the\u00a0pacemaker theta and their firing phase to advance continuously over the place field (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>). When the pyramidal cell is transiently driven by slow depolarizing current, the phase of spikes fired by the interneuron and by the pyramidal cell advances through a full 360 degrees relative to the 8 Hz pacemaker input. Hence,\u00a0whenever pyramidal cells are activated by slow\u00a0depolarizing\u00a0drives, the basic architecture of the CA1 circuit, along with pacing inputs from the medial septum, is sufficient to generate phase precession in pyramidal cells and interneurons."

During injection of a constant input current the model generates either stable phase locking or phase precession at a constant rate against the pacemaker drive (\u2018frequency pulling\u2019) depending on the strength of depolarizing drive relative to the strength of pacemaker input (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Phase locking occurs for weak drives, where the interneuron becomes entrained to a fixed phase of the pacemaker input. Frequency pulling occurs for strong drives, in which case, for a given constant input current, the interneuron oscillates with a fixed frequency difference from the pacemaker, causing its phase to advance continuously relative to the pacemaker input. In the phase locking region, because the locking phase varies as a function of the input current, variation in the input current can be used to achieve variation through a maximum of 180 degrees of theta phases (\u221290 to 90 degrees, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

However, the underlying dynamics and mechanisms in our model are distinct from these schemes in several ways. First, the excitation-dependent locking of spike phase observed in our model for weak depolarizing drives (the phase locking regime) is the result of the active entrainment of an ongoing intrinsic cellular rhythm to a pacemaker drive, rather than a passive summation and thresholding of inputs to a silent pyramidal cell as in previous models. Moreover, the frequency pulling regime in our model, in which the external drive determines the <i>rate</i> of phase precession (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), is not generated by previous models. The dynamics inside the place field in our model take place almost entirely within this novel frequency pulling regime, with the phase locking regime instead governing the dynamics outside of the place field and therefore the alignment of spike phase at place field entry. Because our model relies on the frequency pulling rather than the phase locking regime to produce phase precession, continuous phase precession can be generated for arbitrary input profiles of sufficient strength, and does not require a monotonically increasing ramp input as in previous models (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, for symmetrical place fields previous schemes predict a phase advance towards the center of a place field, but a phase reversal as the input current is reduced on leaving the place field (<a href=\"#bib58\">Melamed et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, when input currents are sufficient to drive the neuron into the frequency pulling domain in our model, then phase advances continuously throughout the input field (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Provided that inputs are sufficiently strong and sustained, the phase of interneuron firing advances through a full 360 degrees, with the rate of phase precession determined by the strength of the injected current (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Hence, this reduced model explains the dynamics observed in the network simulation of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Specifically, the interneuron remains in a stable phase locking regime while the pyramidal cell is inactive, but enters the frequency pulling regime whenever the pyramidal cell provides sufficient synaptic input, producing phase precession. Phase precessing synaptic inputs from the interneuron coordinate the spike timing of the pyramidal cell and confer phase precession, but phase precession in the interneuron is relatively insensitive to the timing of pyramidal cell inputs, instead requiring only a sufficient increase in excitatory drive."

Because phase precession in our reduced model depends on pacemaker amplitude and excitatory drive, the precession frequency can be flexibly modulated by varying either parameter without needing to adjust the frequency of the pacemaker oscillation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, Materials and methods). We therefore used the minimal circuit model of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> to test whether variation of these inputs to the interneuron can account for the experimentally observed speed-dependence of phase precession in pyramidal cells and interneurons. The reduced model predicts that either a decrease in pacemaker amplitude or an increase in depolarizing drive to interneurons with running speed would generate an increase in the rate of phase precession with running speed. However, for stability the pacemaker amplitude must be small for low running speeds (see Materials and Methods). In this case the precession frequency can nevertheless be controlled independently through changes in the depolarizing drive with running speed. Indeed, we found that in the minimal circuit model a linear increase in pacemaker amplitude with running speed, combined with a linear increase in depolarizing current to interneurons with running speed, can generate an approximately linear increase in precession frequency while maintaining stable precession dynamics across running speeds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Hence, the dynamics required to maintain a fixed relationship between spike phase and place field position can be generated de novo in the local circuitry with inputs at a fixed theta frequency. Importantly, the predicted dependence on running speed\u00a0of current input to the interneuron is consistent with findings of a velocity-dependent depolarizing current from glutamatergic circuits in the medial septum to interneurons in CA1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fuhrmann et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, the predicted dependence of the pacemaker amplitude on running speed is consistent with the dependence on running speed of both the LFP theta amplitude in CA1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">McFarland et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Maurer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Patel et al., 2012</a>) and the activity of inhibitory circuitry in the medial septum (<a href=\"#bib39\">King et al., 1998</a>)."

This variation is difficult to account for by temporal delays in a common pacemaker drive, which has led to the suggestion that entorhinal-hippocampal or intrahippocampal interactions are required to account for dorsoventral phase offsets (<a href=\"#bib63\">Patel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Long et al., 2015</a>). We asked if the present model can account for these observations without the necessity for additional circuit components. In the reduced interneuron model, the range of phases that stably lock to pacemaker input is precisely 180 degrees, with locking phase depending on the strength of the excitatory current and pacemaker amplitude (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). All other spike phases are unstable. This suggests that a gradient in excitatory inputs to interneurons (or alternatively a gradient in input resistance or some intrinsic membrane current) along the dorsoventral axis might be sufficient to generate the observed dorsoventral phase gradient, despite a coherent pacemaker input."

To test whether our minimal circuit model could account for these observations in addition to the traveling wave dynamics, we simulated place cell/interneuron pairs at the ventral and dorsal pole of CA1, with place field sizes of approximately 10 meters and 0.3 meters respectively, and interneuron locking phases separated by approximately 180 degrees (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>).

Thus, our proposed mechanism predicts that depolarizing current input to interneurons (or their excitability), the strength of excitatory synaptic connections from pyramidal cells to interneurons and the amplitude of the septal pacemaker drive all decrease from the dorsal pole to the ventral pole of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

What happens when the synaptic drive is instead very large? We found that with strong and sustained inputs to place cells precession continues over multiple theta cycles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). However, the pacemaker drive to the interneuron confers robustness against this effect, as the interneuron can only precess through a discrete number of theta cycles and requires considerable additional input to precess through two cycles of theta rather than one. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> shows how the number of theta cycles precessed by the interneuron varies with the amplitude of the slow envelope. Over a broad range of input currents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), or more directly, a broad range of pyramidal cell spike counts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>), the interneuron will precess exactly one cycle over the place field. For the choice of parameters used here, robust phase precession through one cycle in the interneuron occurs provided the place cell fires between 10 and 25 spikes in its place field. Thus, phase precession is sufficiently robust to allow considerable rate remapping, but the mechanism nevertheless places constraints on the coexistence of phase precession and rate remapping within place cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2012</a>)."

                                "text": "Theta phase precession has also been shown to exhibit considerable robustness against experimentally induced circuit perturbations. For example, when CA1 is transiently silenced (for <math id=\"inf2\"><mo>\u223c</mo></math>200 ms) and the theta rhythm is simultaneously reset, phase precession resumes in CA1 unperturbed upon recovery (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zugaro et al., 2005</a>). We tested whether the model would exhibit similar robustness under such a perturbation by injecting a negative current into both place cells and interneurons to induce silencing while simultaneously resetting the phase of the external pacemaker drive. Indeed, we found that phase precession resumes upon recovery from this perturbation, as observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further robustness has been observed under optogenetic perturbations of the CA1 circuitry. Specifically, transient (1 s) silencing of somatostatin-positive (SOM) interneurons has almost no effect on spike phase, altering mainly the burst firing of place cells, while silencing of parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons appears to introduce a small shift in average spike phase without compromising phase precession overall (<a href=\"#bib67\">Royer et al., 2012</a>). We replicated this experimental protocol by injecting a 1 s negative current pulse into the interneuron as the animal crossed the place field. When analyzing the resulting data using the methods of Royer and colleagues, we found a shift in spike phase of a similar magnitude and direction to that reported in experimental data (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). These findings can be explained as follows. The interneuron coordinates the pyramidal cell\u2019s theta activity until place field entry so that pyramidal cell spike phase is correctly aligned at the start of the place field. Upon interneuron silencing, the pyramidal cell\u2019s activity becomes independent of the theta rhythm, and depends only on the slow depolarizing drive. Nevertheless, because the pyramidal cell continues to spike tonically at a frequency higher than the theta rhythm during interneuron silencing, its spikes shift in phase continuously (i.e., precess) against the theta rhythm over the place field. This precession within the place field, combined with the phase alignment at place field entry provided by the interneuron before the onset of optogenetic silencing, generates the apparent phase shift of <a href=\"#bib67\">Royer et al. (2012)</a> in the trial-averaged data. In contrast to this transient manipulation, we expect that phase precession would be severely disrupted in experiments where phase precessing interneurons are silenced over an entire lap, so that the phase at place field entry is not correctly aligned."

The large disparity between the number of place cells and interneurons demands that a single interneuron in the model must couple to multiple pyramidal cells and generate phase precession in each one. To test if this is possible, we first simulated a single interneuron coupled synaptically to two pyramidal cells. We find that, when each pyramidal cell receives a depolarizing drive at a different time, the interneuron can be recruited for phase precession independently by each pyramidal cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In this case, the interneuron shows two phase precession fields. As a direct consequence, and in contrast to the case in which there is just one active pyramidal cell per interneuron, the model predicts that outside of their suprathreshold firing fields place cells have subthreshold phase precession fields, characterized by transient increases in the frequency of their theta-modulated inhibitory input when the other place cell is active (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). However, if the pyramidal cells have overlapping place fields, these dynamics may be disrupted. In this case, the stronger synaptic input to the interneuron from two active place cells may increase its precession frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), causing it to precess over multiple cycles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Moreover, as synaptic output from the same interneuron coordinates the theta activity of both place cells, their spiking may become synchronized. Thus, a single interneuron can support phase precession by more than one place cell, but overlap between the firing fields of place cells coupled to the same interneuron may disrupt precession-based codes by shifting the phase of coding relative to position and by causing multiple cycles of phase precession within a single firing field."

In these networks each pyramidal cell couples to only one interneuron, and these connections are bidirectional, so that each interneuron couples to multiple pyramidal cells (see Materials and methods). This can be viewed as a simplified description of the interactions underlying phase precession, with other circuit interactions removed. These larger networks successfully compress slow input sequences into fast theta sequences when place field maps are sparse with low overlap (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> top).

We call these the single-cycle theta sequence metric and the population phase precession metric (see Materials and methods for details). The single-cycle theta sequence metric measures the similarity between slow input sequences and individual theta sequences (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, solid red line). The population phase precession metric measures the robustness and coherence of phase precession in a population of cells, and therefore serves as an averaged measure of sequence compression over a dataset (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, solid blue line). For these metrics, correlations close to zero imply a lack of sequential organization and therefore poor performance, while strong (positive or negative) correlations signify the presence of sequential representations within theta cycles. Using these metrics, we tested how sequence compression varies depending on the properties of the place field map within the network. We observed decreases in the strength of both individual theta sequences and population phase precession with increasing place field density on the track (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Strikingly, this quantitative analysis also revealed that with random place field mappings network performance degrades continuously with increasing place field density, whereas with optimal place field mappings designed to minimize overlap in the place fields of cells coupled to the same interneuron (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), high performance is maintained over a wider range of place field densities (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, dashed red and blue lines)."

For example, on the first lap of a novel linear track place cells exhibit phase precession, in that their spikes advance continuously in phase against the theta rhythm, but the phase lags between cells are initially uncoordinated and do not generate population theta sequences until after further experience (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feng et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, when input from CA3 is permanently absent, robust phase precession is observed in each cell while spatially organized theta sequences fail to emerge (<a href=\"#bib59\">Middleton and McHugh, 2016</a>). To test whether such a dissociation of phase precession and theta sequences is consistent with our model, we asked whether the changes in sequence compression observed in the simulations of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> are caused by changes in the robustness of phase precession in individual place cells, or whether they result from changes in the timing relationships between groups of place cells (i.e., a decoherence of phase precession in neuronal populations). When we quantified the fidelity of phase precession for individual cells on single laps (see Materials and methods) we found that robust single-unit phase precession persists as place field overlap is increased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, gray line), despite the disruption of single-cycle theta sequences and population phase precession. Thus, sequence disruption is caused by a decoherence of phase precession within the population. This decoherence is caused by indirect interactions amongst place cells with overlapping place fields and shared interneurons (e.g. see <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This is distinct from increasing place field overlap, which disrupts population sequences but not single-cell phase precession. In contrast, increasing noise injected into interneurons disrupts population sequences while leaving phase precession intact at the single trial level, revealing an additional mechanism for dissociating phase precession from population sequences (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>).

Our model suggests two potential mechanisms. First, plasticity between place cells and interneurons could adjust synaptic weights such that place cells with overlapping place fields no longer couple strongly to the same interneurons (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Second, the slow envelope inputs to place cells could rapidly reorganize in order to minimize the overlap of place fields of cells coupled to the same interneurons (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). If a plasticity mechanism were in place, synaptic changes which allow sequential activity in a new environment would cause disruption in previously stored maps. In contrast, place field reorganization could enable multiple stable maps to be formed without disruption or interference between different representations. Experimental evidence suggests that place field activity is indeed reorganized upon exposure to a novel environment, including a sparsification of the CA1 place code and a decrease in the number of active place cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Frank et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Karlsson and Frank, 2008</a>). Whether such a reorganization mediates removal of unwanted place field overlap as we predict here is yet to be determined. Further evidence suggests that such a mechanism may depend crucially on plasticity in CA3 to CA1 connections (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</a>). Hence, permanent silencing of CA3 would be expected to disrupt CA1 theta sequences without affecting phase precession in our model, as observed by <a href=\"#bib59\">Middleton and McHugh (2016)</a>."

The above inequality gives a bound on the density of the spatial representation. It implies that spatial maps generated by this network must be sparse and that the required sparsity depends on the ratio of pyramidal cells to interneurons, and on the size of the place fields. If the network is close to this upper bound, there will be a high density of subthreshold phase precession fields in place cells and interneurons will phase precess over most of the environment. If instead the network is operating well below this upper bound, so that the representation is sparser than the minimum requirement, there will be only occasional interneuron and subthreshold phase precession fields. While subthreshold phase precession fields have not yet been investigated, the density of reported interneuron phase precession fields can be high (see Figure 2 of <a href=\"#bib52\">Maurer et al., 2006</a>), suggesting that CA1 networks may operate close to this bound."

For example, assuming a population of 10,000 pyramidal cells of which 20% are active in each map, 1000 interneurons, an exclusion zone between place fields of 1 meter, a linear track of length five meters and that place field locations can be distinguished with a spatial resolution of\u00a010\u00a0cm (a conservative estimate), the number of spatial maps in which coherent theta sequences are generated is greater than <math id=\"inf8\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>5000</mn></msup></math>.

This circuit therefore implements associative learning, forming an association between the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. In contrast, if the downstream cell were to lock to a theta phase other than the trough, this would introduce a temporal shift to behavioral time lags at which potentiation and depression of synapses occurs. For example, a downstream neuron which fires at the peak of the theta oscillation will cause a <i>decrease</i> in synaptic strength from neurons representing past locations and an <i>increase</i> in synaptic strength from CA1 pyramidal cells representing the future locations (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Thus, sequence compression with theta oscillations allows locations, or events, occurring in the past or future to be flexibly and selectively associated with a particular outcome by varying the spike phase of the downstream cell.

This network architecture implements a novel mechanism for phase precession based on the\u00a0dynamic integration of pacemaker and spatial signals by spontaneously active interneurons. Our model accounts for phase precession along arbitrary two-dimensional trajectories and across the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus, and predicts tuning required to maintain phase precession with variation in running speed and spatial scale. It reveals that the\u00a0phase precession of interneurons, previously assumed to be an epiphenomenon resulting from synaptic inputs from phase precessing place cell assemblies, may instead coordinate phase precession in pyramidal cells. A striking feature of this network is its large capacity for sequence generation. We also show how STDP mechanisms can implement classical conditioning of sequences encoding future or recent trajectories. Thus, the flexible sequence compression mechanism that we identify here may be a substrate for forms of associative learning that store relationships between conditioning stimuli and previous or future experiences. Our analysis indicates that sequence generation through single-cell phase precession would endow these learning mechanisms with sufficient capacity to operate across an animal\u2019s lifetime."

This is in contrast to previous models for phase precession which focus on place cells. A key difference is that interneurons generally exhibit ongoing rhythmic spiking activity throughout an environment, whereas place cells are typically silent across most of an environment, showing sustained firing activity only within spatially localized place fields. In our model phase precession requires entrainment of spontaneous spiking by a pacemaker input and acceleration of spiking due to further excitatory spatial input. The dynamics of our proposed model account for phase precession through a full 360 degrees, and suggest mechanisms for speed tuning and dorsoventral organization of phase that are consistent with experimental observations. We discuss below how the distinct dynamics of pyramidal cells lead to models of phase precession with different properties."

An initial model for phase precession was based on interference between oscillations with different frequencies (<a href=\"#bib61\">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</a>). This model can account for phase precession observed through the full 360 degrees of a theta cycle. However, because it generates repeated spatial firing fields its predictions map more closely onto the properties of entorhinal grid cells than place cells in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib60\">O'Keefe and Burgess, 2005</a>). Moreover, to account for phase precession in two dimensions interference models require heading modulated speed-dependent oscillatory signals, but experimental evidence for signals with the required properties is so far quite limited (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harvey et al., 2009</a>; but see <a href=\"#bib75\">Welday et al., 2011</a>). Other models rely on interactions between slow depolarizing inputs to place cells and oscillatory inputs to their soma and / or dendrites. These models generate a unidirectional phase advance over the place field using either an asymmetric ramp drive (<a href=\"#bib57\">Mehta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Losonczy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Magee, 2001</a>) or using spike train adaptation so that firing ceases at the peak of a symmetric place field drive (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harris et al., 2002</a>). However, these models appear able to achieve phase advances over the place field of only 180 degrees. Moreover, to avoid phase reversal in later parts of the firing field these models rely on sustained depolarization and elevated firing of place cells to maintain an advanced phase, whereas for many place cells phase continues to advance after the center of their firing field while firing rate and membrane potential depolarization drop (<a href=\"#bib34\">Huxter et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Harvey et al., 2009</a>). In contrast to these previous models, the network architecture we propose here is able to account for phase precession through 360 degrees, does not require sustained depolarization following the place field center, is compatible with single rather than regularly repeating firing fields and does not rely on tuning of upstream velocity controlled oscillators."

These can be grouped into core predictions of the model, and ancillary predictions that follow from constraining the model parameters to account for experimentally observed features of phase precession and to maximize the quality of sequence compression performed by the network. The core predictions are as follows. (1) Silent or inactive pyramidal cells should demonstrate subthreshold phase precession fields resulting from inhibitory input when their primary interneuron is activated by another place cell. This prediction should be testable through patch clamp recordings in awake animals (<a href=\"#bib31\">Harvey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Epsztein et al., 2011</a>). (2) Groups of pyramidal cells which precess in tandem with a particular interneuron should have non-overlapping place fields, and if not will exhibit disrupted theta compression. This prediction may be testable with high density electrical recordings or advanced imaging methods. (3) Artificially depolarizing a place cell to generate a firing rate field should automatically produce phase precession. This requires that the interneuron driving phase precession is active, but otherwise should also be testable through awake patch-clamp recordings. (4) Phase precession in place cells should be accompanied by the presence of strong, phase precessing inhibitory synaptic inputs. (5) Entrainment of septal GABAergic inputs should set the basal theta frequency, but precession of CA1 interneurons and place cells against this basal theta should remain intact over a range of frequencies. (6) Phase precessing interneurons should show reciprocal synaptic connections onto pyramidal cells, and the interneuron to pyramidal cell synapse should be sufficiently strong to synchronize theta activity. (7) Sustained inactivation (e.g., over an entire lap) of phase precessing interneurons should abolish pyramidal cell phase precession."

(1) Stable phase precession across different running speeds emerges when phase precessing interneurons receive a velocity-modulated excitatory drive and a pacemaker drive with velocity-dependent amplitude. (2) A dorsoventral gradient in excitation to phase precessing interneurons, alongside a gradient in pacemaker amplitude and excitatory synaptic strength, simultaneously generates dorsoventral traveling theta waves and changes in precession slope across the dorsoventral axis. We note that these ancillary predictions pertain only to the specific implementations that we have considered, and that alternative mechanisms are possible within the model circuitry. For example, dorsoventral traveling waves could equally emerge from a gradient in the phase of pacemaker input within our model, and alternative mechanisms for generating velocity-dependence of phase precession may also be possible within the circuit."

For successful sequence generation pyramidal cells which couple to the same interneuron must have largely non-overlapping place fields. This constraint leads to predictions for network topographies that support and determine the quality of sequence compression. (1) For randomly organized place field maps, reducing the density of firing rate fields in the pyramidal cell population increases the quality of the sequence-compressed representation of behavioral events. (2) Sequence compression can be maintained with maximal performance at far greater place field densities when these place fields are organized so as to minimize coactivity of pyramidal cells which precess with the same interneuron. Interestingly, this implies that CA1 does not exhibit topographically organized place field maps. This is consistent with an apparent lack of anatomical organization of place cells (<a href=\"#bib64\">Redish et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dombeck et al., 2010</a>). (3) Because the maximum place field density is determined by the ratio of phase precessing interneurons to pyramidal cells, and because experimentally observed coding densities appear to increase along the dorsoventral axis, either: there are more phase precessing interneurons per pyramidal cell in the ventral hippocampus, the fraction of silent pyramidal cells in the ventral hippocampus is higher, or sequences are disrupted in the ventral hippocampus. When the constraint underlying these predictions is violated population theta sequences can be disrupted despite the presence of single-cell phase precession on individual laps. This may explain the dissociation of phase precession and theta sequences during exploration of novel environments (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feng et al., 2015</a>) and when CA3 is silenced (<a href=\"#bib59\">Middleton and McHugh, 2016</a>). In order to avoid such disruption of sequential activity, our model requires that CA1 networks can learn to decorrelate spatial maps following global remapping, most likely via a reorganization of firing rate fields in order to remove disruptive place field overlap. Understanding the learning rules and circuit mechanisms underlying such a decorrelation poses an interesting challenge, and points towards the importance of investigating the initial reorganization and stabilization of place field maps in novel environments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Frank et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Karlsson and Frank, 2008</a>), with a particular focus on the emergence of spatiotemporally structured representations within theta cycles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Feng et al., 2015</a>)."

This mechanism could in principle be implemented in parallel with some previously proposed mechanisms for phase precession. For example, in addition to inputs from local interneurons considered here, dendritic and somatic interference in pyramidal cells might also contribute to the phase advance over the first half of the place field (<a href=\"#bib50\">Magee, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Losonczy et al., 2010</a>), and oscillatory or phase precessing inputs from CA3 and entorhinal cortex might contribute to membrane phase in CA1 place cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chance, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jaramillo et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, additional architectures could extend our proposed model. For example, in brain areas such as CA3 and entorhinal cortex, attractor mechanisms may generate the firing rate fields through local circuit interactions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997</a>), such that the circuit mechanism proposed here generates theta phase precession when excitatory neurons are driven by slow depolarizing inputs arising from within the local circuitry."

Our analysis suggests a scenario in which, during theta oscillations, CA1 provides a time-compressed ongoing narrative of behavioral episodes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). This enables downstream STDP mechanisms to form associations between ongoing behavioral events and specific outcomes such as reward or punishment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). During sharp wave ripple events the CA1 network can then explore its state space and thereby test outcomes of different behavioral choices based on associations stored during theta activity (e.g.,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib70\">Singer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gomperts et al., 2015</a>). This allows a form of mental exploration in which possible behavioral sequences can be simulated and the likely outcomes determined based on associations learned during theta states (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hopfield, 2010</a>).

First, we predict that, during theta states, the spiking of downstream neurons encoding unconditioned stimuli is locked to the theta rhythm, but is not strongly influenced by the activation of specific cell assemblies in CA1. During sharp wave ripple events that take place following learning, we predict that activation of these same downstream neurons can be driven by cell assemblies in CA1 whose outputs were previously associated with the conditioned stimulus. In line with these predictions, reward responsive neurons in the VTA lock more strongly to the hippocampal theta rhythm than non-reward responsive neurons, and VTA neurons that lock more strongly to the hippocampal theta rhythm exhibit greater coordination with CA1 cell assemblies representing reward locations during awake sharp wave ripple events (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gomperts et al., 2015</a>). Second, to form associations between conditioned stimuli and rewards occurring in the future, present or past on behavioral timescales, the proposed learning mechanism predicts that the timing of downstream reward-encoding neurons relative to the theta rhythm should shift, firing near the peak for future rewards and near the trough when rewards have been obtained. This behavior has been observed in reward-encoding neurons in the ventral striatum, which precess in phase relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm as the animal approaches a reward site (<a href=\"#bib73\">van der Meer and Redish, 2011</a>). Hence, during theta states a primary function of interneurons in CA1 and other hippocampal structures may be to support compression of ongoing events into neuronal sequences in order to store associations in synaptic projections to downstream brain areas, which may then be utilized during sharp wave ripple events for mental exploration, planning and decision making."

First, the injected current into the place cell depends on running speed according to <a href=\"#equ14\">Equation (17)</a>, where the width of the Gaussian in time varies with running speed. In addition to the temporal duration of current injection (as determined by the trajectory <math id=\"inf95\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi id=\"XM151\">t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>), the amplitude of current input <math id=\"inf96\"><msup><mi>I</mi><mi>E</mi></msup></math> was varied with running speed. In addition, the noise to the place cell was varied with running speed. The amplitude and noise term were varied so that the width of the place field (measured as the distance from first to last spike on a single lap) and the number of spikes fired during a pass through a place field were constant across running speeds. Increasing noise tends to spread out the place field, whereas increasing the input current amplitude tends to increase both the number of spikes fired and the width."

By lowering the pacemaker amplitude, the range of input currents over which phase locking occurs is reduced, but the nonlinear transition from phase locking to phase precession is less severe. This effectively allows a wider range of currents over which slow phase precession can be achieved and increases the stability of phase precession within this range. For these reasons, we reduced the pacemaker amplitude at lower running speeds and also reduced the baseline current so as to allow a slow precession frequency."

They advance a model for phase precession in which interneurons receive theta-frequency inputs and pyramidal cells receive a driving Gaussian envelope. Their model distinguishes itself from others by having interneurons (PV) play a critical role. Specifically, the theta rhythm is input via medial septal GABAergic input to interneurons that are coupled with pyramidal (place) cells. This is different from any existing models (as nicely summarized in a table overview (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). The authors describe experimental phenomenon that have been traditionally difficult for other models to capture."

We find that the phase precession and sequences continue to be robustly generated when several millivolts of noise is injected into pyramidal cells. Interneuron noise has a similar effect to the disruptive place field overlap we considered previously, causing a disruption of sequences but not single-trial pyramidal cell phase precession. In contrast, the disruption observed when large amplitude noise is injected into pyramidal cells involves a decrease in the strength of single-trial pyramidal cell phase precession as well as population sequences. These findings are now described in the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cNetwork reconfiguration can dissociate single-trial phase precession and theta sequences\u201d."

(compare this figure to their <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B and C</a>). However, the reviewer is correct that when we tested a second, more detailed stimulation protocol, the shift appears to go in the opposite direction, as well as decreasing in magnitude. As we noted in the original manuscript, theta coordination of pyramidal cells is entirely absent during periods of interneuron inactivation in the model. Thus, while we do observe a phase shift in the averaged data, this is actually caused by a shift in the firing frequency of the pyramidal cell during interneuron silencing. The details of how this frequency shift translates into a phase shift in the averaged data are sensitive to specific details of the stimulation protocol, such as the timing and duration of inactivation within the place field. Thus, while our model can reproduce both the magnitude and the direction of the phase shifts reported by Royer et al., our results suggest that the phase shift they reported does not reflect the fundamental role of PV neurons in generating pyramidal cell phase precession. We have now clarified this point in the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cRobust phase precession is generated along two-dimensional trajectories\u201d, third paragraph)."
