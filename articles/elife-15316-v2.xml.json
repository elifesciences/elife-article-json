To gain insight into nucleosome dynamics, and to follow how dynamics change during differentiation, we used a technique called time-ChIP to quantitatively assess histone H3.3 turnover genome-wide during differentiation of mouse ESCs. We found that, without prior assumptions, high turnover could be used to identify regions involved in gene regulation. High turnover was seen at enhancers, as observed previously, with particularly high turnover at super-enhancers. In contrast, regions associated with the repressive Polycomb-Group showed low turnover in ESCs. Turnover correlated with DNA accessibility. Upon differentiation, numerous changes in H3.3 turnover rates were observed, the majority of which occurred at enhancers. Thus, time-ChIP measurement of histone turnover shows that active enhancers are unusually dynamic in ESCs and changes in highly dynamic nucleosomes predominate at enhancers during differentiation."

To gain insight into nucleosome dynamics, and to follow how dynamics change during differentiation, we used a technique called time-ChIP to quantitatively assess histone H3.3 turnover genome-wide during differentiation of mouse ESCs. We found that, without prior assumptions, high turnover could be used to identify regions involved in gene regulation. High turnover was seen at enhancers, as observed previously, with particularly high turnover at super-enhancers. In contrast, regions associated with the repressive Polycomb-Group showed low turnover in ESCs. Turnover correlated with DNA accessibility. Upon differentiation, numerous changes in H3.3 turnover rates were observed, the majority of which occurred at enhancers. Thus, time-ChIP measurement of histone turnover shows that active enhancers are unusually dynamic in ESCs and changes in highly dynamic nucleosomes predominate at enhancers during differentiation."

Previous studies examining nucleosome turnover genome-wide have made use of two main strategies \u2013 induction of epitope-tagged histone transgenes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kraushaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yildirim et al., 2014</a>) and metabolic labeling of histone proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deal et al., 2010</a>). These have yielded a number of insights into the genome-wide pattern of nucleosome turnover in Drosophila and mammalian systems. Such insights include high nucleosome turnover at gene bodies, regulatory elements and replication origins in Drosophila cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deal et al., 2010</a>) and, in mouse cells, rapid deposition of H3.3-containing nucleosomes at enhancers and promoters associated with active histone modification marks and the histone variant H2A.Z (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kraushaar et al., 2013</a>). However, each set of techniques has limitations. For example, systems based on inducible histones have a lag time after induction before histones are synthesized and incorporated into chromatin. In addition, they mainly look at where newly synthesized histones are deposited rather than disruption of existing histones. A TET-OFF system examining dissociation of tagged histones has recently been described although a significant proportion of tagged histone is observed up to 12\u2009hr after addition of doxycycline, limiting the sensitivity of this technique (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ha et al., 2014</a>). Metabolic labeling methods such as 'CATCH-IT', on the other hand, are not specific for particular histone variants and have limited resolution at the level of individual genes. CATCH-IT analyzes incorporation rates rather than existing histones and cannot be employed for long chase times."

Time-ChIP is based on SNAP technology (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bodor et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Keppler et al., 2003</a>), where histones are tagged with the suicide enzyme SNAP. Pulse labeling with a SNAP-tag specific biotin moiety leads to covalent biotinylation of the SNAP-tagged histone pool. Histone dynamics can then be determined by following the loss of biotin-labeled histones over time as nucleosomes are disrupted and replaced with nucleosomes comprised of newly synthesized unlabeled histones. Sequencing of the DNA associated with these biotinylated histones allowed us to quantify relative histone turnover genome-wide. Previous studies using SNAP-tagged histones suggest that they are recognized by the correct chaperone proteins and incorporated into chromatin at the appropriate cell cycle stage (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bodor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dunleavy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Foltz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jansen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</a>)."

We found that time-ChIP could be used a priori to identify regions important for gene regulation; specifically,\u00a0enhancer regions stood out for their rapid turnover. In ESCs, consistent with previous work, we found high H3.3 turnover at active enhancers (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ha et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kraushaar et al., 2013</a>) with even higher rates of turnover observed at super-enhancers. We also observed high turnover of histone H3.1 at these regions. Regions bound by Polycomb-group proteins, which are involved in developmental gene repression, showed H3.3 enrichment in ESCs but low turnover compared to active regions. Upon differentiation to NSCs, many changes in H3.3 turnover were observed, with ESC and NSC enhancers overrepresented in the set of regions showing changes. We corroborated our time-ChIP findings by correlating H3.3 turnover with DNA accessibility measured by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) titration (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mieczkowski et al., 2016</a>) and found good correlation at enhancers and other active regions. Our findings demonstrate the utility of time-ChIP for profiling H3.3 turnover during differentiation, for determining relative rates of turnover at regulatory elements, and for characterizing known and potentially novel regulatory regions."

After inducing tagged H3.3 for 48\u2009hr, H3.3_SNAP was biotin labeled in intact cells by adding the cell permeable molecule chloropyrimidine biotin (CP-biotin) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Correa et al., 2013</a>) to the media for 40 min followed by a wash step to remove unbound substrate. A portion of the labeled cells was harvested immediately representing the 0\u00a0hr time point and the remaining cells were re-plated for harvest at 3\u00a0hr, 6\u00a0hr and 12\u00a0hr post-labeling. Nuclei were isolated from these cells, chromatin liberated by MNase digestion and biotin labeled H3.3 recovered by streptavidin pull-down. DNA was purified from the recovered nucleosomes, quantified and prepared for sequencing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As expected, decreasing amounts of DNA were recovered over time as biotin labeled H3.3_SNAP was replaced by newly synthesized H3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Approximately the same number of reads was sequenced from each time point. A spike-in control was added when preparing the sequencing libraries to verify that the proportion of reads resulting from pull-down of SNAP-tagged histones was consistent with expectation for each time point. Later time points in each experiment had fewer fragments associated with tagged histones compared to spike-in fragments and thus were consistent with the expected overall H3.3 turnover rate in the genome (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and Materials and methods)."

To ensure that the biotin labeling of H3.3 was representative of all tagged H3.3, we compared the enrichment profiles for the H3.3 0\u00a0hr\u00a0sample to those generated by performing HA ChIP for transgenic H3.3_SNAP_HA and the two correlated well (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We plotted H3.3 time-ChIP data for the 0\u00a0hr, 3\u00a0hr, 6\u00a0hr and 12\u00a0hr time points over the transcription start sites (TSSs) of active genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As MNase was used to digest the chromatin, a characteristic MNase digestion pattern was observed consisting of a nucleosome 'depleted' region at the TSS and a well-positioned +1 nucleosome. As time progressed, labeled H3.3 was lost from these TSSs at an appreciable rate, particularly upstream of the TSS, as indicated by the fact that the profiles for each time point were well spaced apart. In contrast, at the TSSs of silent genes, H3.3 was less enriched and the profiles for each time point were closer together indicating slower H3.3 turnover compared to active promoters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Fast H3.3 turnover at the TSSs of active genes was evident at the level of individual loci as well as when average behavior was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). H3.3 enrichment and rapid turnover was also observed at the 3\u2019 ends of expressed genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). These observations are consistent with the displacement of nucleosomes by the transcription machinery and the enrichment of the replacement H3 variant, H3.3, at sites of active transcription as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Goldberg et al., 2010</a>). The timeframe for turnover of H3.3_SNAP is concordant with previous estimates based on incorporation of H3.3 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kraushaar et al., 2013</a>)."

Regions of high turnover will have fewer reads in later time points than regions with slower turnover when compared to the number of reads seen for these regions at 0\u00a0hr. To examine how turnover compared between different regions, it was necessary to develop a method to quantify turnover rate. To do this we used data from the 0\u00a0hr, 3\u00a0hr, 6\u00a0hr and 12\u00a0hr time points to calculate a 'turnover index'. The genome was divided into 1\u00a0kb bins and, for each bin, signal from each time point was fitted to a simple linear regression model. The slope of the linear regression was weighted to account for significance of the data fit by the linear model and multiplied by minus 1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and Materials and methods). The resulting value was taken as the turnover index (TI) such that regions with fast H3.3 turnover had higher positive TI values. Indeed, at the TSSs of active genes, TI was highest upstream of the TSS reflecting what we observed when individual time points were examined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We calculated TI for three individual biological replicates and these samples correlated well with each other having R values of 0.67\u20130.82 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, for subsequent analyses, we used the mean TI of the three replicates as the TI measurement. This TI reflects relative H3.3 turnover between different genomic sites and, by its nature, is internally comparable across the genome."

The majority of these (approximately 77%) were located in at least one annotated regulatory region such as a promoter, gene body, TTS or enhancer. High TI regions were overrepresented, as compared to the occurrence of the features in the genome, at promoters, the 5\u2019 end of genes, TTSs, and enhancers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In particular, high H3.3 enrichment and TI occurred at TTSs, often at those close to other transcription units, (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and at enhancers and super-enhancers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We examined the high TI regions that did not correspond to annotated genomic features in more detail. Some of these overlapped with a larger UCSC gene set, leaving 146 high TI regions in truly unannotated locations. It is likely that a portion of these represents unidentified regulatory regions or regions with regulatory functions in differentiated cells (see example in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Indeed, 95 of these 146 unannotated regions were located within 50\u00a0kb of genes robustly expressed (FPKM\u00a0&gt;\u00a09.5) in ESCs (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.001) suggesting potential regulatory roles for\u00a0them\u00a0in ESCs. Thus, without prior assumptions, time-ChIP identifies known regulatory, and also potential novel regulatory regions.

TI in fact did correlate with gene activity and was higher over the promoters, bodies and TTSs of highly expressed genes compared to genes with little or no expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

This was consistent with their overrepresentation in the set of regions with the highest TI in ESCs, and further indicated that enhancers are especially dynamic."

Plotting average TI profiles over conventional ESC enhancers and ESC super-enhancer constituents revealed higher H3.3 TI over the constituent enhancers that make-up super-enhancers domains compared to conventional enhancers despite the fact that these regions are similar in size (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). When TI was calculated using a smaller 300\u00a0bp bin size, exceptionally high H3.3 turnover was still evident at super-enhancers (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also examined turnover of histone H3.1 at ESC enhancers and super-enhancers by performing H3.1 time-ChIP in the same manner as was done for H3.3. Although the depth of sequencing required to interrogate H3.1 limits the resolution of H3.1 time-ChIP, we clearly saw elevated TI over enhancers\u00a0compared to randomized regions in two seperate\u00a0biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, super-enhancer constituents showed higher H3.1 turnover than conventional enhancers, consistent with the results for H3.3. The high H3.1 and H3.3 TI observed at super-enhancers suggests that nucleosomes are more frequently disrupted at these regions regardless of which H3 variant they contain. We conclude that TI offers a metric for identifying enhancers and super-enhancers, and that super-enhancers have an unusually dynamic nucleosome population."

We wished to test this hypothesis by measuring the accessibility of DNA to enzymatic access genome-wide.

We examined H3.3 turnover over previously annotated DNase hypersensitive sites in mouse ESCs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Vierstra et al., 2014</a>) and found that TI was indeed high over these sites in ESCs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). TI over ESC DNase sensitive regions was reduced in NSCs consistent with regulatory changes during differentiation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To expand upon this analysis, we used MNase, which is capable of measuring accessibility more broadly than these aforementioned technologies. It is established that nucleosomes have differential accessibility to MNase, with some nucleosomes liberated at low MNase and some requiring high MNase (<a href=\"#bib23\">Knight et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Xi et al., 2011</a>)."

When the magnitude of TI and MACC at ESC enhancers was assessed, both had values well above the genome average in ESCs but not in NSCs, consistent with their regulatory role in pluripotent cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As well as being evident on a global scale, the relationship between TI and MACC at enhancers was also apparent at the level of individual loci. For example, the <i>Oct4/Pou5f1</i> super-enhancer shows high TI and high MACC in ESCs while both TI and MACC are decreased upon differentiation to NSCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These findings indicate that, at enhancers, increased turnover of nucleosomes might account for increased accessibility to the DNA sequence. This is consistent with increased transcription factor binding at these sites."

Notably, the clustered enhancers that make up super-enhancer domains were more rapidly turned over than conventional ESC enhancers. Measurement of H3.1 turnover showed the same phenomenon. These observations are consistent with the notion that nucleosomes must be disrupted in order to allow transcription factor binding and are consistent with increased DNA accessibility\u00a0at\u00a0enhancers. Notably, our data suggest that nucleosomes are frequently disrupted at enhancers regardless of which H3 variant they contain. Nucleosomes containing H3.3 predominate at these regions due to the high levels of nucleosome disruption but both H3.1 and H3.3 show rapid turnover. A variety of mechanisms might be used to generate high turnover in enhancers. Pioneer transcription factors such as Oct4 and Sox2 occupy these sets of ESC enhancers and super-enhancers and can bind partial motifs on the nucleosome surface (<a href=\"#bib36\">Soufi et al., 2015</a>). These factors might contribute to nucleosome turnover, either directly through their binding or by recruiting remodeling complexes that facilitate turnover. Transcription through enhancers might also contribute (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). It is intriguing that super-enhancers show significantly higher turnover than enhancer elements. This could reflect a synergistic interaction between adjacent enhancer modules, or might indicate that the individual enhancer modules within super-enhancers each have intrinsically high turnover. In either case, the ability of turnover to identify these regions is striking and is likely to be related to their potency."

There were significant changes in where high turnover occurred in NSCs due to the activation of a distinct set of enhancers. In broad classifications, regions with rapid turnover were in general similar between ESCs and NSCs, except that gene bodies were overrepresented in high turnover regions in the differentiated cells but not in ESCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). Increased turnover in gene bodies might reflect widespread transcriptional activation and consequent histone turnover in differentiated cells. Alternatively, it might be that pluripotent cells have a plastic chromatin structure at the promoters of genes poised for activation in future lineages, increasing turnover relative to gene bodies at those locations."

To begin to analyze whether this is true, we measured accessibility genome wide using MNase, which is able to probe accessibility everywhere in the genome, and compared the resultant accessibility metric to turnover index. At ESC enhancers, both TI and MACC had high values and the two metrics were highly correlated. Similarly at the TSSs of expressed genes, TI and MACC had higher than average values while at repressed PcG targets both turnover and accessibility were reduced. These data thus cross validate these two distinct metrics and support the hypothesis that regions of high turnover correspond to regions of high DNA\u00a0accessibility."

We have extended these observations by also showing high turnover of H3.1 at enhancer regions and in demonstrating more rapid turnover of both H3.3 and H3.1 at super-enhancers compared to conventional enhancers. Notably, we also observed high H3.3 turnover around the transcription termination sites of expressed genes with our sets containing the (1000) highest TI regions showing a large overrepresentation of TTSs. RNA Polymerase II occupancy or transcription itself could contribute to nucleosome displacement at these regions. Indeed, enrichment of RNA Pol II and nascent transcription at the 3\u2019 end of genes has been reported to be widespread (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anamika et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Core et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>)."

Labeling of SNAP-tagged histones for time-ChIP takes approximately one hour meaning that very rapid turnover might be missed and consequently turnover underestimated for some regions. Nevertheless, labeling time is relatively short compared to the cell cycle time of ESCs (12\u2009hr) and NSCs (18\u2009hr) and most H3.3 enriched loci are still detectable at the first time point as evidenced by the strong correlation between ChIP for H3.3_SNAP_HA and the H3.3 0\u00a0hr time-ChIP sample (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We are therefore confident that we accurately quantify relative turnover for the vast majority of H3.3-enriched regions. In this study, H3.3 turnover was assessed because of its enrichment at regions important for gene regulation. In theory, however, time-ChIP can be applied to study the dynamics of any core histone or histone variant. We performed time-ChIP for H3.1 but a comprehensive assessment of its turnover, and that of other broadly distributed histones, is currently limited by the depth of sequencing required. Measuring nucleosome dynamics provides a distinct measure of chromatin characteristics that can help identify and functionally characterize regulatory elements."

Data for each time point was then input subtracted. For each 1\u00a0kb bin, TI was calculated by fitting the number of reads for each time point to a simple linear regression model. A Kendall rank correlation test was used to assess how well points fit the linear model. The slope of the line fitted by linear regression was weighted by multiplying by 1-p-value from the Kendall test. Such weighting was introduced to reduce the TI values for the bins where the statistical significance of the fit was low, and thus it ensures a conservative estimation of TI (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abubucker et al., 2012</a>). Finally, the sign of the slope was reversed such that positive TI values represented high turnover. As data for individual biological replicates correlated well (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the mean of these replicates was used for further analysis.

Statistical significance of enrichment of ChIP vs input was estimated using negative binomial distribution, with the estimate of the mean based on the tag counts in input, and the size parameters selected based on manual inspection of resulting peak calls. Regions of significant enrichment were generated by merging adjacent significantly enriched windows separated by 1\u00a0kb or less. In ESCs, PcG targets were defined as having overlapping peaks of Ring1b Cbx2, Cbx7, Ezh2 and H3K27me3. For NSCs, PcG\u00a0targets were defined as having overlapping peaks of Ring1b and H3K27me3."

Expression data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a> is from RNA-seq data performed on J-1 ESCs and NSCs differentiated in vitro from these cells. RNA-seq tags were aligned to the mouse genome (mm9) using the Tophat software package with default parameters (<a href=\"#bib39\">Trapnell et al., 2009</a>). FPKM values and differential gene expression between ESC and NSC were calculated using Cufflinks (<a href=\"#bib40\">Trapnell et al., 2010</a>) and Cuffdiff (<a href=\"#bib38\">Trapnell et al., 2013</a>) packages respectively. Genes changing expression between ESCs and NSCs were defined as those showing at least a three-fold (for comparison with unannotated regions changing turnover during differentiation) or a four-fold change (MACC analysis) in FPKM value."

They correlate such turnover with ESC promoters, with gene expression and with other metrics that allow regulatory region identification (i.e., H3K27ac and enhancers). The authors also employed their newly developed method called time-ChIP to assess histone turnover genome-wide after differentiation of mESCs to neural stem cells (NSCs), albeit differentiation occurred in mouse embryo brains. The authors found high histone turnover in the regions that are involved in gene regulation particularly, enhancers and super-enhancers. The turnover is quantitated by a turnover index (TI) in those regions. The results were further corroborated by MNase accessibility metric (MACC), a measure of chromatin/DNA accessibility. The overall approach is solid but we did not see a significant advantage over previously published approaches, i.e., the TET-OFF approach to H3.3 turnover by Zhao's lab. Also, the authors claim that their dual approach would be useful in identifying novel regulatory regions, but they did not pursue this avenue of investigation in a tangible way."

The authors point out that much of the data of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> are as expected based on previous studies of H3.3 and known histone turnover in active regions vs. less turnover in inactive. The conclusions are compatible with the work from Henikoff, Allis and specifically Zhao's 2014 Epigenetics Chromatin paper on H3.3 turnover in mESC using a TET-OFF strategy. The study does not consider the presence of fragile nucleosomes. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> shows turnover correlates with gene activity, promoters and enhancers, particularly super-enhancers. The analysis here was a bit deeper than in the Zhou paper but also with a slightly different emphasis. The authors then concentrated on polycomb-repressed genes in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and show a lower turnover, again, as expected. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> revealed a whole new set of genes that are activated upon neural differentiation, which had lost polycomb (PcG) binding, but again as expected these data showed a dramatic increase in H3.3 enrichment and histone turnover, whereas regions that are still bound by PcG in NSCs, were no longer enriched in H3.3 as they were in ESCs. Interestingly, gene bodies showed high turnover in NSC vs ESC. Remarkably, the NSC lines derived from embryos had rather rapid cell cycles vs. some generated in culture. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> is an ESC-NSC comparison but we found nothing striking."

Since Zhao has already shown this then they should acknowledge it in the Abstract and Introduction, i.e., \"As previously shown, we found high H3.3 turnover at active regulatory regions including enhancers. However, we also find that even higher turnover occurs at super-enhancers [\u2026]\".</i>"
