By selectively reducing responses to frequently, but not rarely, occurring sounds, auditory cortical neurons are thought to enhance the brain's ability to detect unexpected events through stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). The majority of neurons in the primary auditory cortex exhibit SSA, yet little is known about the underlying cortical circuits. We found that two types of cortical interneurons differentially amplify SSA in putative excitatory neurons. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) amplify SSA by providing non-specific inhibition: optogenetic suppression of PVs led to an equal increase in responses to frequent and rare tones. In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOMs) selectively reduce excitatory responses to frequent tones: suppression of SOMs led to an increase in responses to frequent, but not to rare tones. A mutually coupled excitatory-inhibitory network model accounts for distinct mechanisms by which cortical inhibitory neurons enhance the brain's sensitivity to unexpected sounds."

By selectively reducing responses to frequently, but not rarely, occurring sounds, auditory cortical neurons are thought to enhance the brain's ability to detect unexpected events through stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). The majority of neurons in the primary auditory cortex exhibit SSA, yet little is known about the underlying cortical circuits. We found that two types of cortical interneurons differentially amplify SSA in putative excitatory neurons. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) amplify SSA by providing non-specific inhibition: optogenetic suppression of PVs led to an equal increase in responses to frequent and rare tones. In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOMs) selectively reduce excitatory responses to frequent tones: suppression of SOMs led to an increase in responses to frequent, but not to rare tones. A mutually coupled excitatory-inhibitory network model accounts for distinct mechanisms by which cortical inhibitory neurons enhance the brain's sensitivity to unexpected sounds."

For example, stepping out onto a busy street, you may at first be very aware of the noise of traffic. Later, you may start to ignore the din and instead only notice sounds that break the monotony: a honking car horn or maybe a stranger's voice. This is because the neurons in the auditory pathway respond differently to common and rare sounds. In particular, excitatory neurons in the region termed the \u2018auditory cortex\u2019 send fewer nerve impulses in response to frequent sounds, but respond vigorously to rare sounds. This phenomenon is called \u2018stimulus-specific adaptation\u2019, but it is not known exactly which neurons in this brain region enable this process to occur."

On the other hand, the second kind of inhibitory neuron, called \u2018somatostatin-positive interneurons\u2019, only reduced the excitatory neurons' responses to frequent sounds; these neurons had no effect on responses to rare noises."

Adaptation to stimulus context is thought to increase efficiency of sensory coding under the constraints of limited resources (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barlow, 1961</a>). Yet, the neuronal-circuit mechanisms that facilitate adaptation in the cortex remain poorly understood. In the primary auditory cortex (A1), the vast majority of neurons exhibit stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). When presented with a sequence of two tones, one of which occurs frequently (termed \u2018standard\u2019) and another rarely (termed \u2018deviant\u2019), the neuron's response to the standard tone becomes weaker, but the response to the deviant tone remains strong (<a href=\"#bib88\">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Szymanski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Farley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Fishman and Steinschneider, 2012</a>). Whereas SSA has also been found in sub-cortical structures e.g. in the auditory midbrain (<a href=\"#bib57\">Malmierca et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Thomas et al., 2012</a>) and the auditory thalamus (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kraus et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Antunes et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bauerle et al., 2011</a>), it is weak in the lemniscal areas of the auditory pathway, which project to A1, and stronger in those non-lemniscal areas which receive feedback from A1 (<a href=\"#bib89\">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">Duque et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, cortical circuits are proposed to contribute to and amplify SSA in A1 (<a href=\"#bib88\">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib82\">Szymanski et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">Bauerle et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">Fishman and Steinschneider, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">Escera and Malmierca, 2014</a>), through a combination of plastic modulation of thalamocortical inputs and intra-cortical inhibitory circuits, which would allow for selective suppression of neuronal responses to specific stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">Nelken, 2014</a>). Our study tests whether and how inhibitory neurons contribute to cortical SSA."

While different interneuron types have been hypothesized to carry out specialized complementary functions in sensory processing (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeFelipe, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Markram et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Marlin et al., 2015</a>), their function in driving changes in dynamic auditory processing has not been previously established. We hypothesized that the two most common types of interneurons in the cortex, parvalbumin- (PVs) and somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOMs) (<a href=\"#bib94\">Xu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Rudy et al., 2011</a>), facilitate SSA in excitatory neurons of A1 in a complementary fashion. PVs, a subset of which receive direct thalamic inputs (<a href=\"#bib80\">Staiger et al., 1996</a>), may amplify SSA in excitatory neurons by providing a constant inhibitory drive; equally strong inhibitory drive would attenuate the weak response to standard tones relatively more than the strong response to deviant tones, leading to a greater differential between standard vs deviant tone spiking response. SOMs, which target distal dendrites of pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">McGarry et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gentet et al., 2012</a>), have excitatory synapses that exhibit facilitation upon repetitive stimulation (<a href=\"#bib75\">Reyes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</a>). Therefore, inputs from SOMs may exert a stimulus-specific increase in suppression of excitatory neurons that is selective to the standard tone and does not generalize to the deviant tone. Alternatively, they may contribute to selective adaptation in excitatory neurons through differential post-synaptic integration."

We used a linear probe to record LFPs using electrodes spaced 50 microns apart inserted perpendicularly to brain surface in the primary auditory cortex. The multi-electrode probe is 775-\u00b5m long, spanning layers 1\u20136 of mouse A1. CSD is computed as the second spatial derivative of the LFPs across the depth of the cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, 20 sessions, 15 mice). Typically, in response to tones, CSD exhibits a negative basin, termed sink, within a short delay of tone onset, localized to electrodes in thalamo-recipient layer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kaur et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Szymanski et al., 2009</a>).

This finding supports the \u2018adaptation in narrowly tuned inputs\u2019 model, which postulates that SSA in broadly tuned neurons in A1 reflects adaptation in either thalamocortical inputs or at the stage of integration of thalamocortical inputs, specific to inputs tuned to the standard tone (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mill et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Taaseh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Nelken, 2014</a>).

A modified adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding anti-sense code for Arch and a fluorescent reporter, under the FLEX cassette, was injected into PV-Cre or SOM-Cre mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boyden et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cardin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Deisseroth, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). 2 weeks following virus injection, Arch was expressed selectively in PVs or SOMs in auditory cortex at expected levels (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> PV-Cre: N = 250 neurons in 4 mice, specificity = 92 \u00b1 1%, efficiency = 73 \u00b1 5%. SOM-Cre: N = 149 neurons in 5 mice, specificity = 95 \u00b1 2%, efficiency = 86 \u00b1 5%). To activate Arch, a light guide was positioned to cast 180 mW/mm 532-nm light onto A1 surface, perpendiular to cortical layers. In vitro intracellular recordings from optically identified PVs or SOMs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) demonstrate that light cast over the auditory cortex in vitro drives a strong suppressive current (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1C,D, 2C,D</a>) and hyperpolarizes the membrane potential in these neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1B, 2B</a>). Assuming a 100-fold attenuation of light over 1 mm of brain tissue (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aravanis et al., 2007</a>), the estimated irradiance in the deepest cortical layer (1.8 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was strong enough to induce hyperpolarizing current in neurons in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In vivo, in both PV-Cre and SOM-Cre mice, illuminating the auditory cortex suppressed spiking activity in a small subset of recorded neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>, left, putative inhibitory neurons) and increased activity in a great majority of recorded neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a> right, putative excitatory neurons). Shining light over A1 increased spontaneous neuronal activity in the majority of the recorded neurons in both PV-Cre mice (N = 115 neurons, 102 increased, 0 decreased, in 10 mice) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) and SOM-Cre mice (N = 104 neurons, 61 increased, 3 decreased, in 9 mice) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>).

To directly test the effect of interneuron suppression, we computed the SSA index separately on light-on and light-off trials for neurons responsive to both tones A and B (SSA was found in 63 out of 67 tone-responsive neurons in PV-Cre mice, 42 out of 43 tone-responsive neurons in SOM-Cre mice). Photosuppression of either PVs or SOMs affected the responses of neurons to the tones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), resulting in a significant reduction in SSA index across the population (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, PV-Cre: \u0394 = \u221241%, p1 = 1e<sup>\u221212</sup>, t(66) = 8.6.

Photo-manipulation-affected responses only to the tone during which it was presented, but not to subsequent tones (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, photo-manipulation was limited to cortex since it did not affect thalamo-recipient layer CSD tone responses and SSA (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In a control group of PV-Cre or SOM-Cre mice (6 mice), we injected a modified AAV, which encoded anti-sense fluorescent reporter alone under the FLEX cassette, and computed the effect of casting light on SSA (SSA was found in 33 out of 37 tone-responsive neurons in control mice). In this control group, SSA was not affected by light (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,G</a>, p &gt; 0.05, t(36) = \u22122.0), confirming that Arch expression was required for the effect of the light. Therefore, the effects of interneurons are specific to intra-cortical mechanisms. These results demonstrate that both types of interneurons contribute to the reduction of the response of the neuron to the stimulus during SSA."

In control mice, the SSA index was not different compared to T<sub>3</sub> for any tone position, even T<sub>0</sub> (p2 &gt; 0.05, t(106) &lt; 1.8, C = 4).

Deviant: \u0394 = 26%, p2 = 0.039, t(159) = \u22122.4, C = 2), indicating that the change in tone-evoked FR was similar regardless of tone probability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, bottom panel). Because an equal increase in the FR produces a weaker <i>relative</i> effect on the response to the deviant (which is higher than to the standard), PV inactivation decreases SSA index (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

In addition, cortical extracellular recordings may be biased toward neurons in granular and infra-granular layers, precluding adequate sampling of activity in superficial layers.

Alternatively, the difference might be attributable to the morphological or functional differences between SOMs and PVs. To address this confound, we selected tone responses that exhibited matched difference in standard tone-evoked FR between light-on and light-off trials (N = 66, <a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Within these matched subpopulations, PV and SOM photosuppression exhibited differential effects similar to those of the whole population. The change in FR due to PV suppression was not significantly different between responses to the standard and deviant (p2 &gt; 0.05, t(65) = \u22120.3, C = 3). By contrast, the change in deviant tone-evoked FR due to SOM suppression was significantly weaker than that for the standard tone (\u0394 = \u221278%, p2 = 0.003, t(3.5), C = 3). By the design of the analysis, the effect of PV or SOM suppression on standard tone-evoked FR was nearly identical (p1 &gt; 0.05, t(65) = \u22120.1, C = 3). However, the change in deviant tone-evoked FR was greater for PV photosuppression than SOM photosuppression (\u0394 = 404%, p1 = 0.029, t(65) = 2.4, C = 3). Since the observed differential effects of PV and SOM suppression persisted in subsets of neurons that were matched for photosuppression-induced change in standard tone-evoked FR, these differences are unlikely due to differential expression or efficacy of Arch in the PV-Cre and SOM-Cre mice, but rather reflect functional differences between the two types of interneurons."

However, the cortical mechanisms involved in the production and stimulus-specificity of SSA within the auditory cortex are not well understood. Here, we found that, in addition to adaptation at the level of thalamocortical inputs, two distinct types of interneurons, PVs and SOMs, differentially contributed to SSA in the primary auditory cortex. Optogenetic suppression of either PVs or SOMs led to a reduction in SSA in putative excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Suppression of PVs led to an equal increase in the FR of the putative excitatory neurons in response to the standard tone and the deviant tone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). By contrast, suppression of SOMs significantly increased the response to the standard tone but lacked a significant effect on the response to the deviant tone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This series of findings expands on the \u2018adaptation in narrowly tuned units\u2019 model, which proposes that repeated presentation of the standard stimulus drives adaptation within more narrowly tuned inputs, such as thalamocortical inputs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mill et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Taaseh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Nelken, 2014</a>). Our data indicate dual effects of cortical inhibition on SSA: (1) PVs contribute to SSA by providing a constant level of inhibition, resulting in a <i>relatively</i> higher inhibitory drive during the presentation of the standard, as compared to the deviant. Taking into account the non-linear synaptic input to FR output function of a typical pyramidal neuron, the constant inhibition amplifies the effect of thalamocortical depression in suppressing the response of the neuron to repeated stimulus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). (2) The selective increase of the inhibitory drive from SOMs for standard stimulus as compared to the deviant stimulus responses might be explained by a shift in the non-linear transfer function between inputs to SOMs and their outputs to excitatory neurons, possibly due to facilitation of SOM-to-excitatory neuron synapses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beierlein et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)."

This finding is consistent with previous results that found that thalamocortical synapses onto inhibitory neurons and synapses from inhibitory neurons to excitatory cells can be depressing (<a href=\"#bib84\">Tan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ma et al., 2012</a>). How does suppression of these interneurons result in differential reduction in SSA in excitatory neurons? Our model provides an intuition for this effect: the mutually coupled excitatory\u2013inhibitory network model demonstrates that the observed differential effects of PV and SOM suppression may be due to their differential action on excitatory neuronal responses in the unadapted and adapted state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Tone-evoked responses of PVs would fall on the linear portion of the transfer function between PV activity and excitatory neuron depolarization, while the same tones maximally affect inputs from SOMs onto excitatory neurons, with SSA shifting the inputs to the linear, more sensitive range of inputs from SOMs. Thus, SSA may serve an additional function: to adjust the responses of neurons in a range that is more sensitive to small changes in the inputs from both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. More generally, the simulation demonstrates that a circuit element, such as PVs or SOMs, that itself adapts may further amplify adaptation in the excitatory neurons."

                        "text": "To estimate the differential contribution of PVs or SOMs inputs to the excitatory neurons, we measured the difference in the FR of neurons due to optogenetic partial suppression of their firing. This measurement provides an estimate of the change in the FR of the putative excitatory neurons with the change in combined inputs to the inhibitory neurons, thereby allowing estimation of the synaptic transfer function (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, insets). A simple biologically plausible network incorporating these transfer functions can reproduce the observed responses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). There are several caveats to this interpretation. First, the FR may not linearly translate onto synaptic input strength because of the spiking non-linear rectification between the inputs and outputs of the putative excitatory neuron: a small change in FR in the low-FR regime might correspond to a greater change in the synaptic drive than a similar-sized change in FR in the high-FR regime. However, our findings would still hold were this the case: in examining the effect of SOM suppression on response to the deviant, the actual difference in the synaptic drive between the deviant and the standard would then be even greater than observed. At the other end of the non-linearity, the analysis of neuronal responses sorted based on their FR to the standard tone and the deviant tone revealed that the \u2018ceiling effect\u2019 would not contribute to a decreased effect of photostimulation on the response to the deviant in SOM-Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 4\u20137</a>). Second, PVs and SOMs may inhibit not only the excitatory neurons, but also each other. SOMs make synapses onto PVs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ma et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cottam et al., 2013</a>), thereby potentially suppressing them with repeated presentation of the standard. Therefore, when SOMs are suppressed, some PVs may be disinhibited and provide a stronger suppression of excitatory neurons. The null effect on responses to the deviant tone during SOM suppression could result from a combination of increase in inhibition from disinhibited PVs in addition to reduced inhibition of SOMs onto excitatory neurons. Including inhibition from SOMs to PVs in the proof-of-principle model supported experimental findings (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Third, other interneuron types, such as vasopressin-positive interneuron may be involved in the circuit (<a href=\"#bib73\">Pi et al., 2013</a>), and the changes that we observe may reflect several inhibitory stages of processing."

Nonetheless, our results are likely to extend for awake mice, since isoflurane anesthesia-induced effects on neuronal activity decrease as the concentration of isoflurane is reduced to the levels used in our recordings (<a href=\"#bib50\">Land et al., 2012</a>). In addition, all recordings and manipulations were performed under identical anesthetic conditions, and our conclusions are based on the relative comparison of the effects of suppressing PVs and SOMs, which are expected to hold under awake conditions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Centanni et al., 2013</a>)."

By suppressing the responses to a frequently presented tone, the responses of neurons to a rare stimulus become relatively enhanced. However, whether and how modulating SSA in the auditory cortex affects auditory behavior has not yet been tested. Inhibitory interneurons may prove to have a complementary role in shaping auditory perception in addition to receptive field reorganization driven by synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Froemke et al., 2013</a>). The use of optogenetic methods to test the function of inhibitory interneurons in SSA overcomes the limitations of lesion or pharmacological studies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Elliott and Trahiotis, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Duque et al., 2014</a>), which only allow for prolonged, non-selective inactivation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Moore et al., 2001</a>). By combining optogenetic manipulation of interneuron activity with behavioral measurements, future experiments will explore whether interneuron-mediated SSA indeed affects the auditory behavior of the subject, such as enhanced ability to detect unexpected events."

Mice were placed in the recording chamber, anesthetized with isoflurane, and the headpost secured to a custom base, immobilizing the head. After drilling a craniotomy and creating a durotomy exposing auditory cortex, a silicon multi-channel probe (A1x32-Poly2-5mm-50s-177 [Poly-2] or A1x32-tri-5mm-91-121-A32 [Triode], Neuronexus Ann Arbor, MI, United States) was slowly lowered to between 750 \u00b5m and 1 mm into the cortex, perpendicular to the cortical surface and used to record electrical activity. Raw signals from 32 channels were bandpass filtered at 600\u20136000 Hz and thresholded for spike analysis, or at 10\u2013300 Hz for LFP and CSD analysis (Poly-2 probe only), digitized at 32 kHz and stored for offline analysis (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, United States). Common-mode noise was removed by referencing a probe inserted in the brain outside the auditory cortex. On the Poly-2 probe, two rows of 16 electrodes each on a single shank were arranged such that each electrode site was 50 \u00b5m away from all three closest neighbors. This arrangement allowed us to record densely across depth, that is, one electrode for every 25 \u00b5m in depth. On the triode, electrodes were arranged in groups of three equidistant sites, forming an equilateral triangle (25-\u00b5m separation).

The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PV (PV 25 rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Swant, Switzerland) or anti-SOM (AB5494 rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States). After incubation, sections were washed in blocking solution (three washes, 5 min), incubated for 2 hr at room temperature with secondary antibodies (Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG; for PV 1:1000 and SOM 1:400), and then washed in PBS (three washes, 5 min each). Sections were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, United States) and confocal images were acquired (Leica SP5). Cells were identified in independent fluorescent channels and subsequently scored for co-localization by hand using ImageJ's cell counter plug-in. Transfection efficiency is the percent of antibody-labeled neurons, which are co-labeled with GFP. Transfection specificity is the percent of GFP-expressing neurons, which are co-labeled with the antibody."

For each identified interneuron, FRs were measured 100 ms pre- and post-tone onset. FR was measured separately for each tone, A and B, as standard, deviant, and equal probabilities, and for light-off and light-on trials. FR normalization was carried out separately for each tone, A and B, for each neuron by dividing the response under all conditions by the maximum FR (across 5-ms bins) of the deviant tone, light-off condition. Performing this normalization by dividing response in all conditions by the mean, rather than maximum FR of the deviant tone, light-off condition did not alter significant results (<a href=\"#fig4s8\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). For all FR analyses, each neuron's responses to tones A and B were treated separately, and each was only included if the light-off deviant tone-evoked FR was significantly greater than the spontaneous FR (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p &lt; 0.05). Further, tone responses were only included in analysis if the neuronal FR during each oddball stimulus exceeded 0.02 Hz, and the neuron was significantly tuned to the tone. Tuning was considered significant if the spike count in response to a tone (A or B) was significantly higher than the pool of spike counts across all tones outside one octave band centered on tones A and B (N = 42, t-test, p1 &lt; 0.05). Population responses in each condition were measured as the mean and standard error of FRs across tone responses in each experimental group."

Consequently, investigating the cortical circuitry that gives rise to this phenomenon is an important and largely unexplored question."

More interestingly, this work also shows that optogenetic suppression of somatostatin-positive (SOM) cortical interneurons specifically augments cortical responses to standard over deviant tones, and therefore reduces SSA. These results therefore suggest that PV cells contribute to SSA only through non-specific inhibition of responses to both deviant and standard tones, but that SOM cells selectively reduce cortical responses to frequently repeated standard tones and specifically amplify SSA."

There is a reference in the third paragraph of the Discussion, to direct estimation of the synaptic transfer function for PV and SOM cells, but it is not evident what data were used for this estimation (and the referenced insets in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> have no quantitative axis labels). Justification for the parameters and sigmoid functions used needs to be provided. Also the model assigns equivalent connectivity patterns between PV, SOM and excitatory neurons. Although both types of interneuron receive local excitatory inputs, only PV interneurons receive thalamocortical and feedforward corticocortical inputs and PV neurons provide largely unidirectional inhibition of SOM neurons. This should be taken into account in the model. At the very least, the authors should discuss this issue as a major limitation of the model (along with the fact that there is no attempt made to model differences in the location of PV versus SOM synaptic connections of the proximal versus distal parts of the excitatory cell's dendritic tree). While it is interesting that differences in the operating ranges for PV versus SOM synaptic transfer functions might in principle explain the observed differences in their impact on SSA, the model does not \u201creveal\u201d mechanisms by which the different interneuron types exert their effects \u2013 and could not do so unless the underlying parameter choices were independently validated experimentally.

The hypothesis put forward in the Introduction that SOM neurons show facilitation to repetitive stimulation \u2013 and are therefore likely to have a greater suppressive effect on the response of excitatory neurons to the frequently presented standard tones \u2013 implies that this effect would be mediated at the level of the synaptic inputs to the SOM neurons. Consequently, SOM neurons should respond differently from PV neurons to repeated stimulation. Moreover, if, as suggested in the subsection \u201cPVs and SOMs differentially suppress putative excitatory neuron responses to standard and deviant tones\u201d, SOM neurons are firing at saturation to deviant tones, the authors should have the data to show this. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could show that SOM neurons eventually facilitate with repetitive stimulation, and that SOM cell responses are saturated for deviant tones."

PVs, a subset of which receive direct thalamic inputs(<a href=\"#bib80\">Staiger et al., 1996</a>), may amplify SSA in excitatory neurons by providing a constant inhibitory drive; equally strong inhibitory drive would attenuate the weak response to standard tones relatively more than the strong response to deviant tones, leading to a greater differential between standard versus deviant tone spiking response. SOMs, which target distal dendrites of pyramidal cells(<a href=\"#bib60\">McGarry et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gentet et al., 2012</a>), have excitatory synapses that exhibit facilitation upon repetitive stimulation(<a href=\"#bib75\">Reyes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</a>).

Justification for the parameters and sigmoid functions used needs to be provided. Also the model assigns equivalent connectivity patterns between PV, SOM and excitatory neurons.

This should be taken into account in the model. At the very least, the authors should discuss this issue as a major limitation of the model (along with the fact that there is no attempt made to model differences in the location of PV versus SOM synaptic connections of the proximal versus distal parts of the excitatory cell's dendritic tree). While it is interesting that differences in the operating ranges for PV versus SOM synaptic transfer functions might in principle explain the observed differences in their impact on SSA, the model does not \u201creveal\u201d mechanisms by which the different interneuron types exert their effects \u2013 and could not do so unless the underlying parameter choices were independently validated experimentally.
