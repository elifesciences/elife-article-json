However, factors that underlie A\u03b2 deposition are incompletely understood. One proposed model suggests that synaptic activity leads to increased A\u03b2 deposition. More specifically, hyperactivity in the hippocampus may be detrimental and could be one factor that drives A\u03b2 deposition. To test this model, we examined the relationship between hippocampal activity during a memory task using fMRI and subsequent longitudinal change in A\u03b2 using PIB-PET imaging in cognitively normal older adults. We found that greater hippocampal activation at baseline was associated with increased A\u03b2 accumulation. Furthermore, increasing A\u03b2 accumulation mediated the influence of hippocampal activation on declining memory performance, demonstrating a crucial role of A\u03b2 in linking hippocampal activation and memory. These findings support a model linking increased hippocampal activation to subsequent A\u03b2 deposition and cognitive decline."

However, factors that underlie A\u03b2 deposition are incompletely understood. One proposed model suggests that synaptic activity leads to increased A\u03b2 deposition. More specifically, hyperactivity in the hippocampus may be detrimental and could be one factor that drives A\u03b2 deposition. To test this model, we examined the relationship between hippocampal activity during a memory task using fMRI and subsequent longitudinal change in A\u03b2 using PIB-PET imaging in cognitively normal older adults. We found that greater hippocampal activation at baseline was associated with increased A\u03b2 accumulation. Furthermore, increasing A\u03b2 accumulation mediated the influence of hippocampal activation on declining memory performance, demonstrating a crucial role of A\u03b2 in linking hippocampal activation and memory. These findings support a model linking increased hippocampal activation to subsequent A\u03b2 deposition and cognitive decline."

Although we don\u2019t understand the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we know that at early stages of the disease a protein known as beta-amyloid becomes deposited in the brain in the form of plaques. Evidence suggests that this beta-amyloid is harmful to brain cells. Although we don\u2019t know why amyloid is deposited, research in animal models suggests that the activity of the brain cells themselves may lead to its deposition."

Studies using in vivo microdialysis with concurrent field potential recordings have shown that A\u03b2 levels are directly influenced by synaptic activity, in which increases in neuronal activity are sufficient to modulate A\u03b2 levels and plaque growth in a local, region-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cirrito et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bero et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, using an acute brain slice model, rapid effects of synaptic activity on A\u03b2 levels have been shown to be primarily linked to synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cirrito et al., 2005</a>). There is evidence that hyperactivity in the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus in aged rodents may underlie memory deficits associated with aging (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wilson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">El-Hayek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haberman et al., 2013</a>). This hyperactivity has been regarded as epileptiform in nature in rodents (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koh et al., 2010</a>) and AD transgenic mouse models (<a href=\"#bib37\">Palop et al., 2007</a>). A reversal of memory impairment has been shown with a reduction of hippocampal hyperactivity (via a low-dose of an anti-epileptic drug) in age-impaired rodents, AD rodent models, and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bakker et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sanchez et al., 2012</a>). There are at least two proposed hypotheses regarding increased hippocampal activation. It has been suggested that hyperactivity within the hippocampus may occur over the course of normal aging, but hyperactivity may eventually lead to the secretion of A\u03b2 more quickly than would otherwise occur. Alternatively, some have suggested that A\u03b2 may lead to increased neuronal activity. These explanations are not mutually exclusive; both may be occurring leading to a vicious cycle of A\u03b2 production."

High-resolution fMRI during memory task performance has localized hyperactivity to the dentate gyrus/CA3 subregions of the hippocampus, which has also been linked to memory deficits in aging and MCI (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yassa, 2011</a>). Cognitively normal older adults with high A\u03b2 have increased hippocampal and default mode network (DMN) activation during episodic memory processing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mormino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sperling et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vannini et al., 2012</a>).

A recent study found that older adults with A\u03b2 deposition had increased memory task-related neural activation in the parietal and occipital cortex that was linked to more detailed memory encoding (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elman et al., 2014</a>), suggesting the activation increases were compensatory. Other studies have discovered links between A\u03b2 and the DMN such that A\u03b2 aggregates in areas of high intrinsic connectivity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Myers et al., 2014</a>) and that there is high connectivity between the posterior DMN and hubs of high frontal lobe connectivity that are associated with A\u03b2 accumulation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jones et al., 2016</a>). High A\u03b2 deposition has been found in locations of cortical hubs, such as posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial prefrontal cortices (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buckner et al., 2009</a>). It remains unclear as to whether local amyloid deposition is driving local hyperactivity, if region-specific hyperactivity is linked to global amyloid deposition, or both may be occurring. Previous studies have shown that hyperactive neurons were typically found near amyloid plaques in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Busche et al., 2008</a>), however, increased hippocampal activity occurred before transgenic mice began to deposit amyloid plaques. Hippocampal hyperactivity can occur independent of plaque deposition, while increased activity in cortical neurons is more directly linked to the presence of amyloid plaques. This may be due to a difference in local concentrations of amyloid, different vulnerabilities of cortical versus hippocampal neurons, or both (<a href=\"#bib9\">Busche et al., 2012</a>). Another possibility is that hippocampal hyperactivity may drive increased cortical activity in downstream regions that are more directly linked to amyloid deposition or that hippocampal hyperactivity is driving tau deposition in the MTL, which then leads to A\u03b2 deposition."

Time of PIB was determined as relative to baseline MRI. The interaction between hippocampal activation and time of PIB (hippocampal activation \u00d7 time) was the primary effect of interest because it represented the relationship between hippocampal activation and longitudinal PIB DVR change. Results revealed that hippocampal activation at baseline was positively associated with longitudinal amyloid accumulation such that PIB DVR increased at a rate of 0.001 units per year for every one hippocampal activation unit [interaction, p=0.004, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>]. To visualize this, we plotted the relationship between PIB slope from the model and hippocampal activation contrast values at baseline (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), which showed a positive correlation between PIB slope and hippocampal activation."

Thus, we examined whether the increased longitudinal A\u03b2 deposition associated with baseline hippocampal activation was linked to memory decline. We tested this relationship using a mediation model, where PIB slope (mediator, M) may mediate the relationship between hippocampal activation at baseline (predictor, X) and CVLT slope (outcome, Y), with age, sex, and education as covariates. Step 1 tested the effect of X on Y, not including M. Step 2 tested X predicting M, and Steps 3 and 4 tested M|X significant predictor of Y and X|M not a significant predictor of Y. In Step 1 of the model, the regression of hippocampal activation on memory performance, ignoring PIB slope, was not significant [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.005, t\u00a0=\u00a00.473, p=0.641]. In Step 2, the regression of hippocampal activation on PIB slope was significant [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.0005, t\u00a0=\u00a02.26, p=0.034]. In Step 3, the regression of PIB slope, controlling for hippocampal activation, on memory performance was significant [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u221225.75, t\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.91, p=0.008]. In Step 4, when controlling for PIB slope, hippocampal activation was not a significant predictor of memory performance [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.018, t\u00a0=\u00a01.76, p=0.094]. There were no significant effects of age, sex, or education. The bootstrapped unstandardized indirect effect was \u22120.016 and significantly differed from zero, as revealed by a 95% bootstrap confidence interval that was entirely below zero (confidence interval: \u22120.031 to \u22120.002). Thus, longitudinal amyloid accumulation mediated the relationship between increased baseline hippocampal activation and greater memory decline over time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

                                "text": "Since prior studies have noted increased A\u03b2 accumulation over time in those with elevated baseline A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Villemagne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sojkova et al., 2011</a>) and because we previously found a relationship between baseline A\u03b2 and activation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mormino et al., 2012</a>), we analyzed the relationship between baseline PIB, hippocampal activation, and PIB slope to ensure that our effects on longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation were not being driven solely by elevated baseline A\u03b2. To determine whether increased baseline amyloid levels led to increased baseline hippocampal activation, which led to greater longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation, we conducted a mediation analysis, with age, sex, and education as covariates. We found no evidence of mediation, as revealed by a 95% bootstrap confidence interval that included zero (confidence interval: \u22120.004 to 0.044). Thus, baseline amyloid levels did not lead to greater baseline hippocampal activation to influence longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation, suggesting the effect of hippocampal activation on A\u03b2 accumulation does not solely rely on baseline amyloid levels. Furthermore, by including random intercepts into our linear mixed models, we accounted for initial differences in amyloid. We then conducted a moderation analysis using hierarchical linear regression to determine if baseline amyloid levels influenced A\u03b2 accumulation, but depended on the level of hippocampal activation. The two predictors (hippocampal activation and baseline PIB) were first entered into the regression analysis to determine each predictor\u2019s effect on PIB slope and then the interaction term was added. Results indicated that baseline hippocampal activation [b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.004, p=0.034] but not baseline PIB [b\u00a0=\u00a02.01, p=0.608] was associated with PIB slope and accounted for a significant amount of variance in PIB slope [<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.524, F(6,20) = 3.67, p=0.013]. The interaction between hippocampal activation and baseline PIB explained a significant increase in variance in PIB slope [\u0394<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.15, F(1,20) = 6.32, p=0.021]. Thus, the influence of baseline amyloid levels on longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation depends on hippocampal activation at baseline. To further characterize the nature of this interaction, we used the Johnson-Neyman technique to identify at which point in the range of hippocampal activation contrast values where the effect of the predictor on the outcome transitions from being statistically significant to non-significant (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayes, 2013</a>). We found that when hippocampal activation was greater than or equal to a contrast value of 12.18, higher baseline amyloid led to greater A\u03b2 accumulation. This suggests that while baseline amyloid levels do not directly lead to greater levels of hippocampal activation, baseline amyloid\u2019s relationship with A\u03b2 accumulation may depend on higher levels of hippocampal activation at baseline."

While the amyloid hypothesis places A\u03b2 deposition as the earliest event in a pathological cascade, why A\u03b2 accumulates in the first place is not known. Although A\u03b2 can induce structural and functional alterations to synapses and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Selkoe, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Almeida et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Coleman and Yao, 2003</a>), the reverse relationship also exists such that early synaptic activity can influence A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nitsch et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kamenetz et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cirrito et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bero et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brody et al., 2008</a>). A recent mouse model of AD found that hyperactivity of hippocampal neurons precedes A\u03b2 plaque formation, suggesting that hippocampal hyperactivity is one of the earliest dysfunctions in the pathophysiological cascade of AD (<a href=\"#bib11\">Busche and Konnerth, 2016</a>). This indicates that a major target of A\u03b2 itself, synaptic activation, can control A\u03b2 levels."

Although previous studies have shown that baseline PIB is associated with the rate of longitudinal amyloid accumulation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Villemagne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sojkova et al., 2011</a>), our results are not simply dependent on baseline PIB for several reasons. First, we included random slopes and random intercepts in our linear mixed models to account for baseline PIB and different PIB slopes for each participant. Second, we performed a mediation analysis to determine if baseline PIB acted through baseline hippocampal activation to lead to increased longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation, which was revealed not to be the case. Finally, a moderation analysis showed that baseline PIB predicted increased longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation, but only when baseline hippocampal activation was high. These data suggest that while baseline amyloid may be linked to increased A\u03b2 accumulation, this did not drive the relationships between baseline hippocampal activity and longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation."

                        "text": "Previous studies have described increased brain activity in those at risk for AD in different regions: the dentate gyrus/CA3 region of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yassa, 2011</a>), the entire hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mormino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dickerson et al., 2005</a>), the MTL more broadly (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dickerson et al., 2004</a>), or neocortex (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mormino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Elman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jones et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Myers et al., 2014</a>). These studies suggest that increased activation during memory performance is linked to risk for AD in older adults with memory impairment, MCI, ApoE4+, or those who are A\u03b2+. Our data support a role for task-related brain activation in the hippocampus that is linked to global A\u03b2 deposition. Indeed, we found that only hippocampal activation at baseline and not non-hippocampal cortical activation was linked to increased longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation, suggesting regional specificity in these relationships. The regional pattern of relationships between cortical activation, hippocampal activation, and AD-related pathology may appear perplexing. Cross-sectional neuropathological data suggest that A\u03b2 is first deposited in the cortex and then spreads to the MTL (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thal et al., 2002</a>), while tau deposition in the form of neurofibrillary tangles deposit in the MTL initially with later spread to neocortex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Braak and Braak, 1995</a>). We find that activation in the hippocampus predicts cortical A\u03b2 while cortical activation does not. There are a few possible explanations for this. Hippocampal hyperactivity may be more indicative of pathological effects in those at risk for AD, while cortical activation may reflect other processes. For example, we previously reported that increased cortical activity, but not hippocampal activity appeared to be compensatory during memory encoding (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elman et al., 2014</a>). This is consistent with data associating increased hippocampal activation with memory deficits (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yassa et al., 2011</a>), and with the findings that reversing hippocampal hyperactivity rescues memory deficits (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakker et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2015</a>). Another possibility is that increased hippocampal activation is driving neuronal activity elsewhere, in cortical regions such as retrosplenial cortex and precuneus with strong hippocampal connectivity and early A\u03b2 deposition. Another possibility is that hippocampal activation is driving tau deposition in the MTL, which then leads to A\u03b2 deposition. In fact, preclinical data suggest a crucial role for tau accumulation in producing aberrant neural hyperactivity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Roberson et al., 2011</a>). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and will be important to examine in the future."

Not all subjects had the same number of PIB scans (each subject had two or three scans), which may influence the accuracy of PIB slope, however, linear mixed models are equipped to handle missing data. We found that there was no significant difference in PIB slope between participants with two or three scans or a relationship between years followed and PIB slope (p\u2019s\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05). Sample size was relatively small and we did not have a large enough number of subjects to fully examine sex or ApoE4 carrier differences adequately. Absence of association may be due to lack of power rather than absence of a relationship, such as the absence of ApoE4 effect and absence of mediation through baseline A\u03b2. However, to determine if the effects of hippocampal activity on amyloid accumulation was driven by ApoE4 carriers, we removed them from the sample and re-ran the linear mixed model only in ApoE4 non-carriers. We found the interaction between hippocampal activation and amyloid accumulation remained significant [p\u00a0=\u00a00.018]. Thus, it appears the effect of hippocampal activation on increased amyloid accumulation is not specific to those who are ApoE4 carriers, but is also occurring in ApoE4 non-carriers that are also accumulating amyloid."

As tau PET imaging is still relatively novel, future studies can incorporate tau into these models to determine if hippocampal activation at baseline influences longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation alone or if it influences how A\u03b2 and tau interact during the progression of AD. It will also be important to include longitudinal fMRI data in addition to longitudinal PIB-PET data to measure how longitudinal change in hippocampal activation tracks longitudinal A\u03b2 accumulation. One would expect that as hippocampal activation decreases over time (<a href=\"#bib12\">Celone et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">O'Brien et al., 2004</a>), increases in A\u03b2 accumulation will taper off, as this would indicate later stages of AD. In fact, data suggest that late in disease stage, A\u03b2 deposition slows or even reverses, consistent with the idea that declining brain activity affects late-stage A\u03b2 deposition (<a href=\"#bib45\">Villemagne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jack et al., 2013</a>). While we find that baseline amyloid levels did not drive our findings of hippocampal activation in predicting A\u03b2 accumulation, it will be important for future studies to track those with little baseline amyloid deposition to determine if they eventually display a pattern of increased hippocampal activity followed by increased amyloid deposition."

Scans were broken into four sessions, with 50 scenes and 185 TRs per session. Zero to 5 TRs of fixation (green crosshair on black background) were randomly intermixed between scenes to allow separation of individual trials (average inter-stimulus interval\u00a0=\u00a03.46 s). After the scan, a surprise recognition task including all stimuli presented during encoding as well as 100 novel stimuli (foils) was used to assess performance and sort fMRI data. There was a 15 min delay between the last stimulus encoded and the start of the memory test. For each image, subjects were asked if they had seen the image before and were allowed to respond with 1 of 4 responses: high-confidence yes, low-confidence yes, high-confidence no, and low-confidence no. The task was self-paced and subjects were encouraged to be as accurate as possible. For the current study, we examined task activation (mean contrast values: hits &gt; misses) from task-positive regions of interest (ROIs), which included the right hippocampus, bilateral occipital cortex, and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, as described in <a href=\"#bib32\">Mormino et al. (2012)</a>. MP-RAGE scans were processed using FreeSurfer version 5.3 (<a href=\"https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu\">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</a>) to derive ROIs in each subject\u2019s native space.

We conducted a series of linear mixed models. All models included age, sex, and education as covariates, as well as a random intercept to account for individual variability in initial PIB DVR or CVLT scores and random slopes to account for individual variability in PIB DVR or CVLT slopes. We also employed an autoregressive covariance structure to account for correlations between consecutive PIB DVR or CVLT values over time. Initial models also included ApoE4 carrier (+/\u2212) and scanner type (ECAT HR, BIOGRAPH) as covariates, but effects were not significant so we removed them to simplify the model. Age was mean-centered at 76.5 years, education was mean-centered at 17.4 years, and females were the reference group, so that resulting parameter estimates could be interpreted as representing an example 76.5-year-old female with 17.4 years of education. While PIB and CVLT were both time-varying measurements, we did not have the statistical power to include both as time-varying measurements in our mixed effects model testing change in PIB predicting change in memory performance over time, since visits did not coincide in many cases, making modeling with a single time challenging. We therefore used PIB slope as an alternative, but note that this is a limitation as it does not precisely capture PIB change relative to CVLT change."

For mediation analysis, unstandardized indirect effects were computed for each of 1000 bootstrapped samples, and the 95% confidence interval was computed. For the mediation model, Step 1 tested the effect of X on Y, not including M. Step 2 tested X predicting M, and Steps 3 and 4 tested M|X significant predictor of Y and X|M not a significant predictor of Y. For moderation analysis, the module employs hierarchical regression analysis to first test the relationships between the predictor and the outcome and the moderator and the outcome (conditional effects) and to then test the interaction between the predictor and the moderator (i.e. how the effect of the predictor on the outcome changes as the moderator changes). Furthermore, it provides data to probe the interaction further by determining where in the distribution of the moderator the predictor is related to the outcome to better discern the interpretation of the interaction (i.e. Johnson-Neyman technique). Statistical values were considered significant at a final alpha level of. 05 to prevent Type I error inflation."

Specifically, they assessed hippocampal activity using fMRI during a memory task which included encoding and recall of visual images, and determined how this baseline hippocampal activity was associated with amyloid deposition over time, which was measured by 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) PET neuroimaging. Long-term memory changes were also measured by a verbal learning long-delay free recall test (CVLT). The authors report a significant, positive association between baseline hippocampal activation and longitudinal PIB changes. This association appeared to be specific to the hippocampus, as occipital cortex and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus did not show any association with PIB change over time. There was also no association between hippocampal activity and longitudinal memory changes, but longitudinal amyloid accumulation mediated the relationship between these two variables. There was also an association between A\u03b2 accumulation and CVLT decline over time. The authors point out that they have previously found baseline alterations in brain activity due to the presence of amyloid plaques, but they did not see a connection between PIB levels and hippocampal activity at baseline suggesting that hippocampal activity was influencing A\u03b2 deposition independent of amyloid levels at baseline."

We found a marginal interaction [p=.056] between baseline hippocampal activation and hippocampal amyloid accumulation over time, suggesting that in addition to the effect of hippocampal activation on global amyloid accumulation, there appears to be a local relationship as well, although not quite significant. A\u03b2 first accumulates in the neocortex in phase 1, followed by medial temporal lobe regions including the hippocampus in phases 2-3 (Thal et al., 2002). This may explain why the relationship is stronger for global amyloid measures rather than local hippocampal amyloid measures, especially given that our subject population is comprised of healthy cognitively normal older adults. Furthermore, the hippocampus is a brain region where A\u03b2 is difficult to measure, because its small volume and adjacent white matter and CSF makes quantification problematic. Because of these issues, PET studies rarely report hippocampal A\u03b2 accumulation."
