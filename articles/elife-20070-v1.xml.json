Prior to export through the nuclear pore, mRNPs undergo several obligatory remodeling reactions. In yeast, one of these reactions involves loading of the mRNA-binding protein Yra1 by the DEAD-box ATPase Sub2 as assisted by the hetero-pentameric THO complex. To obtain molecular insights into reaction mechanisms, we determined crystal structures of two relevant complexes: a THO hetero-pentamer bound to Sub2 at 6.0 \u00c5 resolution; and Sub2 associated with an ATP analogue, RNA, and a C-terminal fragment of Yra1 (Yra1-C) at 2.6 \u00c5 resolution. We found that the 25 nm long THO clamps Sub2 in a half-open configuration; in contrast, when bound to the ATP analogue, RNA and Yra1-C, Sub2 assumes a closed conformation. Both THO and Yra1-C stimulated Sub2\u2019s intrinsic ATPase activity. We propose that THO surveys common landmarks in each nuclear mRNP to localize Sub2 for targeted loading of Yra1."

TREX travels along actively transcribed genes with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meinel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Str\u00e4sser et al., 2002</a>). Mature nuclear mRNPs, which have undergone capping, splicing and polyadenylation, are potential \u2018substrates\u2019 for TREX. In essence, TREX-mediated remodeling yields a targeted deposition of Yra1 on nuclear mRNP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abruzzi et al., 2004</a>), which in turn serves as a platform to bind hetero-dimeric Mex67\u2022Mtr2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Str\u00e4sser and Hurt, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zenklusen et al., 2001</a>). The latter, being capable of binding to Phe-Gly (FG) repeat regions of nucleoporins, provides access to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fribourg et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Segref et al., 1997</a>). Although Mex67\u2022Mtr2 is not a bona\u00a0fide member of the TREX complex, Mex67 binds via its ubiquitin-associated (UBA) module to the Hpr1 subunit of THO (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gwizdek et al., 2006</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that TREX-mediated reactions yield a targeted and concerted deposition of both Yra1 and Mex67\u2022Mtr2 on nuclear mRNP in preparation for its export through the NPC."

In addition, Sub2 and Mex67\u2022Mtr2 bind to the same regions of Yra1, suggesting that Sub2 could recruit Yra1 onto mRNP and then be displaced by Mex67\u2022Mtr2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Str\u00e4sser and Hurt, 2001</a>).

First, a 6.0 \u00c5 resolution structure of a 360 kDa THO complex bound to Sub2 revealed that THO clamps the two lobes of Sub2 in a half-open configuration, in the middle of its 25 nm elongated structure. Second, a 2.6 \u00c5 structure of Sub2 bound to an ATP analogue, poly (U) RNA, and a C-terminal fragment of Yra1 showed the two lobes of Sub2 in a closed configuration. We suggest that THO serves to survey features of mature nuclear mRNP to mediate an ATP-dependent targeted deposition of Yra1 and Mex67\u2022Mtr2, thereby initiating a series of reactions that are obligatory for export of nuclear mRNP across the NPC."

However, the molecular role of their interaction in mRNP remodeling is not clear. To characterize the THO-Sub2 interaction, we set out to assemble the yeast THO complex using an insect cell expression system. Previous studies showed that THO exists as a robust structural and functional unit in vivo, and knockdown of individual subunits causes down-regulation of the other subunits (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huertas et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with this, we could only obtain THO by means of co-expression. Because of the low yield of full-length THO, we removed potentially disordered regions based on secondary structure prediction, and replaced the <i>Saccharomyces cerevesiae</i> Tex1 subunit with <i>Saccharomyces bayanus</i> Tex1, to assemble a stable core module of THO (denoted by THO*). The purified THO* showed stoichiometric amounts of each subunit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>)."

Although the resolution is not high enough to trace individual residues, it allows us to characterize secondary structures. In this structure, two RecA domains of Sub2, Sub2-N and Sub2-C, are modeled separately using the Sub2 structure reported in this study; a polyalanine model of Tex1 is derived from WDR5, which shares 41% sequence homology with Tex1 for the residue range 50\u2013344; and the remainder of THO is built with polyalanine \u03b1-helices. The THO*\u2022Sub2 model presented here reveals the overall architecture of THO and, more importantly, the interaction between THO and Sub2."

Interestingly, the middle region of THO* makes contact with both the Sub2-N and Sub2-C lobes and induces a semi-open conformation. DEAD box ATPases like Sub2 exhibit distinct conformations during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. In the absence of nucleotide and RNA, the two RecA domains are separated, representing an \u2018open\u2019 conformation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Caruthers et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shi et al., 2004</a>).

The semi-open conformation of Sub2 in the THO*\u2022Sub2 complex is close to its ATP/RNA-bound active state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Indeed, we found that THO* accelerated the ATPase activity of Sub2 by\u00a0~3.5-fold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The Sub2 stimulating activity of THO* is similar to that of full-length THO, indicating that THO* maintains the full stimulatory effect of THO (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Collectively, our results demonstrate that THO is a previously uncharacterized regulator of the Sub2 ATPase."

Yra1 contains two conserved motifs at both termini (N-box and C-box), which are involved in Sub2 binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The two motifs of Yra1 are joined to the central conserved RRM domain through variable regions (N-vr and C-vr), which are implicated in RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hautbergue et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zenklusen et al., 2001</a>).

The RNA is sharply bent between U4 and U5, as observed in structures of other RNA-bound DEAD-box ATPases (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Sub2 is recognized by the conserved C-box of Yra1 (a.a. 208\u2013226), which folds into a helix that fits in the groove formed by two helices of Sub2-N (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Likely due to flexibility, electron density of the C-vr region and 9-nt of RNA is missing in the crystal structure.

To test whether this mechanism is conserved in yeast, we examined the effect of Yra1-C on the ATPase activity of Sub2. We found that Yra1-C is capable of accelerating Sub2 ATPase activity by\u00a0~2 fold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which is comparable to the reported\u00a0~3 fold UAP56 stimulation by full length Alyref. Since Yra1-C interacts with both Sub2 and RNA within the Sub2\u2022Yra1-C\u2022RNA complex, we next assessed the contribution of each interaction to Sub2 stimulation. L215D or D216K mutation was introduced on Yra1 to, respectively, disrupt the hydrophobic or polar interactions at the Sub2-Yra1 interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We found that both mutations abolished the stimulatory effect of Yra1-C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Similarly, C-box alone, lacking the C-vr RNA binding region, showed no stimulation of Sub2. Taken together, we conclude that Yra1-C exhibits a bipartite interaction, with the C-box binding to Sub2-N and the C-vr binding to RNA, both of which contribute to Sub2 activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

At this stage, Yra1 is engaged with the transcript via the C-vr region. ATP hydrolysis would then trigger release of Sub2, whose position on the mRNP might be taken by other RNA binding regions (N-vr and RRM) embedded in Yra1.

UAP56 could use the same mechanism to load these factors, in addition to Alyref, onto mRNPs. Like Sub2 and Yra1, a similar mode of interaction has been reported for the translation initiation factor eIF4A and its activators eIF4B and eIF4H (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rozovsky et al., 2008</a>). eIF4B and eIF4H bind to the same region of eIF4A, which includes the analogous region of Sub2 recognized by Yra1. Furthermore, eIF4B and eIF4H make additional transient interactions with RNA, and so contribute to RNA affinity of their complexes with eIF4A. The mechanism by which eIF4B and eIF4H stimulate eIF4A could resemble that of Sub2 stimulation by Yra1. Thus, C-box containing proteins, together with eIF4B and eIF4H, likely represent a new class of DEAD-box ATPase regulators in addition to the MIF4G domain-containing activators."

In doing so, THO would bring Sub2 into spatial proximity to an elongating mRNA transcript. Our studies indicate that THO binding serves as more than a physical attachment. In the complex with THO, Sub2 assumes a semi-open conformation, which is similar to its catalytically active state. Interestingly, we found that THO stimulates the ATPase activity of Sub2. Our data support a view that THO, by configuring a semi-open conformation of Sub2, primes it for engaging with mRNA. The mechanism that restricts the activity of TREX to properly processed transcripts is currently not clear. Potentially, THO could deposit Sub2 upon recognizing a certain feature of an mRNP. Previous studies have shown that TREX functions genome-wide, for both intronless and intron-containing genes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abruzzi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lei et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Masuda et al., 2005</a>).

Our biochemical and structural analyses revealed the presence of a stable Sub2\u2022Yra1-C\u2022RNA complex, suggesting that the ATP-dependent binding of Sub2 to an mRNP is coupled to Yra1 loading. Since THO and Yra1 cumulatively stimulated Sub2 ATPase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), THO and Yra1 could act together to load Sub2 and Yra1 onto the mRNP. THO likely stays on site as it assists in loading of Mex67\u2022Mtr2 in subsequent remodeling reactions (see discussion below). Previous studies indicated that TREX function is connected to pre-mRNA 3\u2019-end processing through the interaction between Yra1 and Pcf11, the Pol II CTD binding subunit of cleavage-polyadenylation factor CF1A (<a href=\"#bib18\">Johnson et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2011</a>). It has been suggested that Yra1 is recruited to the transcription machinery by Pcf11, and then undergoes a concerted deposition with Sub2 onto the mRNP. The precise mechanism of this cross-talk between pre-mRNA 3\u2019-end processing and TREX-mediated mRNP assembly awaits further studies. It should also be noted that the C-box of Yra1, which mediates Sub2 binding, has been found in other mRNA binding proteins, including Uif, Chtop, and Luzp4, all of which interact with the UAP56 ATPase, RNA, and the export receptor TAP\u2022p15 (Mex67\u2022Mtr2 in yeast) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hautbergue et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Viphakone et al., 2015</a>).

In addition, THO is also implicated in Mex67\u2022Mtr2 loading via the Hpr1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gwizdek et al., 2006</a>). Consistently, studies on the human TREX complex showed that both Alyref and Thoc5 (a subunit of human THO) make contacts with TAP\u2022p15, and promote RNA binding to TAP\u2022p15 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Viphakone et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, TREX functions as a recruitment platform to bring export factors in spatial proximity to nascent transcripts, and coordinates multiple steps of mRNP assembly. Our current work provides a starting point for future investigations of TREX-mediated mRNP remodeling prior to nuclear export."

Eleven rigid bodies were defined, including Sub2 N-terminal domain, Sub2 C-terminal domain, Tex1, as well as eight THO domains. The map after refinement was highly similar to that from the experimental phases. Helices were trimmed/extended and/or centered to fit the <i>2Fo-Fc</i> map. The Sub2 N-terminal extension (residues 1\u201361) is likely disordered because no electron density was observed to connect to the existing N-terminus of the Sub2 model. It is not clear whether ADP is bound to Sub2, although it was required for obtaining the THO*\u2022Sub2 crystals. At this resolution, many of the loops connecting the helices are not visible, therefore the subunit identity is not defined other than for Sub2 and Tex1. To validate the model, we generated an omit map which showed electron density at the expected positions of omitted helices (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Many reported crystal structures at low resolutions are determined by molecular replacement and refined with existing atomic structures, while experimental phasing and ab initio modeling at similar resolutions usually generate very high R<sub>free</sub>. For example, the R<sub>free</sub> of a 6.6 \u00c5 poly-alanine model of the human DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is 44% (PDB ID 3KGV); the R<sub>free</sub> of the dynein motor domain structure at 6.0 \u00c5 resolution is 43% (PDB ID 3QMZ). Therefore, the R<sub>free</sub> of our THO*\u2022Sub2 model is comparable to previously reported structures determined by similar means.

Our studies have revealed two states of the Sub2 ATPase during its enzymatic cycle: 1) a half-open state stabilized by THO; and 2) a closed state when bound to RNA and Yra1-C. THO and Yra1-C could in principle bind to Sub2 simultaneously in the presence of RNA. Even if the closed state of Sub2 is not the preferred form bound by THO, THO may latch on to one of the Sub2 domains (presumably with a much lower affinity). We have been unable to obtain a stable complex of THO\u2022Sub2\u2022Yra1-C, but the presence of such a complex cannot be ruled out due to the difficulty in capturing weak/transient interactions. Notably, THO has been shown to interact with the export receptor both in yeast (Mex67\u2022Mtr2) and in humans (TAP\u2022p15), strongly suggesting that THO stays associated with Sub2 until Mex67\u2022Mtr2 is deposited by a yet-as-defined mechanism."
