                    "text": "PapC ushers are outer-membrane proteins enabling assembly and secretion of P pili in uropathogenic <i>E. coli</i>. Their translocation domain is a large \u03b2-barrel occluded by a plug domain, which is displaced to allow the translocation of pilus subunits across the membrane. Previous studies suggested that this gating mechanism is controlled by a \u03b2-hairpin and an \u03b1-helix. To investigate the role of these elements in allosteric signal communication, we developed a method combining evolutionary and molecular dynamics studies of the native translocation domain and mutants lacking the \u03b2-hairpin and/or the \u03b1-helix. Analysis of a hybrid residue interaction network suggests distinct regions (residue \u2018communities\u2019) within the translocation domain (especially around \u03b212\u2013\u03b214) linking these elements, thereby modulating PapC gating. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed functional roles for four of these communities. This study illuminates the gating mechanism of PapC ushers and its importance in maintaining outer-membrane permeability."

Their translocation domain is a large \u03b2-barrel occluded by a plug domain, which is displaced to allow the translocation of pilus subunits across the membrane. Previous studies suggested that this gating mechanism is controlled by a \u03b2-hairpin and an \u03b1-helix. To investigate the role of these elements in allosteric signal communication, we developed a method combining evolutionary and molecular dynamics studies of the native translocation domain and mutants lacking the \u03b2-hairpin and/or the \u03b1-helix. Analysis of a hybrid residue interaction network suggests distinct regions (residue \u2018communities\u2019) within the translocation domain (especially around \u03b212\u2013\u03b214) linking these elements, thereby modulating PapC gating. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed functional roles for four of these communities. This study illuminates the gating mechanism of PapC ushers and its importance in maintaining outer-membrane permeability."

P pili from uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> are specifically required for the colonization of the human kidney epithelium, a critical event in the kidney infection process (pyelonephritis) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Roberts et al., 1994</a>). P pili are assembled on the bacterial outer membrane (OM) via the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thanassi et al., 1998</a>), which is often used as a model system to elucidate the mechanism of pilus biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib64\">Waksman and Hultgren, 2009</a>)."

The chaperone protein (PapD) brings the pilins to the bacterial OM where they are assembled into a pilus at a transmembrane pore protein known as the usher (PapC). The usher (\u223c800 residues) is composed of five domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>): a periplasmic N-terminal domain (NTD), an OM central translocation domain (TD) that comprises a translocation pore domain (TP), interrupted by a conserved Ig-like plug domain (PD), and two domains at the periplasmic C-terminal end (CTD1 and CTD2) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Thanassi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ng et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Capitani et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Phan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Geibel et al., 2013</a>). The structure of the apo TD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>) consists of a 24-stranded kidney-shaped \u03b2-barrel where the PD is inserted into the loop connecting two \u03b2-strands (\u03b26\u2013\u03b27), occluding the luminal volume of the pore (<a href=\"#bib50\">Remaut et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2009</a>). In the activated form of another archetypal member of the usher family, FimD, the PD is located outside the pore lumen in the periplasm, next to the NTD (<a href=\"#bib49\">Phan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Geibel et al., 2013</a>). In addition to the PD, there are two secondary structure elements that uniquely characterize the large \u03b2-barrel structures of the usher TD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The first element is a <i>\u03b2-hairpin</i> that creates a large gap in the side of the \u03b2-barrel, a feature unprecedented in previously known OM \u03b2-barrel structures (<a href=\"#bib50\">Remaut et al., 2008</a>). This element (located between strands \u03b25 and \u03b26 of the barrel, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) folds into the barrel lumen and constrains the PD laterally inside the barrel pore. Mutants lacking the \u03b2-hairpin show an increased pore permeability suggesting that the \u03b2-hairpin has a role in maintaining the PD in a closed conformation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Volkan et al., 2013</a>). The second element is an <i>\u03b1-helix</i> (located on the loop between \u03b213 and \u03b214, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which caps the \u03b2-hairpin from the extracellular side. Mutants lacking the \u03b1-helix, or in which the interface between the helix and the PD is disrupted, present a remarkable increase in pore permeability, comparable with that of the mutant lacking the PD, suggesting a role for the helix in maintaining the PD in a closed state (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mapingire et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Volkan et al., 2013</a>)."

By combining sequence conservation analysis, mutual information-based coevolution analysis, and all-atom molecular dynamics (AA-MD), we modelled the interaction network within the native PapC TD as well as within different mutants lacking the \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-hairpin, and both. This unique computational approach allowed us to identify residues that are likely to be involved in the transmission of the allosteric signal between the \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-hairpin elements and the plug. These residues were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, functional studies, and planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology. The results confirmed the involvement of 4 of the 5 distinct communities of residues in modulating the usher's channel activity and gating, suggesting that they all participate in the allosteric mechanism controlling plug displacement."

The patterns of conservation in the TD using Consurf (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashkenazy et al., 2010</a>) analysis suggested that the highly conserved residues (score 9) tend to be clustered in two specific regions of the usher (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The first cluster mapped onto the PD and the P-linkers (P-linker1 residues 248\u2013263; P-linker2 residues 325\u2013335) connecting it to the TP. The second cluster (which included the majority of the highly-conserved residues) mapped onto one side of the TP (strand \u03b21\u201314 and \u03b224). It includes residues: (i) near the periplasmic side of the \u03b2-barrel within \u03b21\u20134 strands and \u03b224 strand; (ii) on the extracellular side of the barrel (within \u03b25\u201310); (iii) in the \u03b2-hairpin region (\u03b2-hairpin and \u03b27\u20139); and (iv) in the area of \u03b210\u201314 capped by the \u03b1-helix region, which comprises the \u03b1-helix and its linkers\u2014H-linker1 (residues 445\u2013450) and H-linker2 (461\u2013468, respectively). Surface representation of the TD reveals a continuous patch of conserved residues facing the lipid bilayer, including \u03b213, the extracellular half of \u03b214 and the periplasmic half of \u03b212 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

The OM of Gram-negative bacteria has low permeability to detergents such as SDS and to antibiotics such as erythromycin and vancomycin, providing resistance to these molecules. In its resting state, the usher TP is gated closed by the PD, preserving integrity of the OM. Mutations that disrupt channel gating by the PD will result in the opening of the large TD channel, leading to increased sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotics. Bacteria expressing five of the PapC substitution mutants (T331A, R237A, Y260A, F438A, and V327A) exhibited increased sensitivity to one or more of the tested molecules (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>).

We attempted to purify those mutants in view of examining their channel activity using planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology (which is a more sensitive assay). Unfortunately, only seven of these 10 mutants yielded protein stable enough (as wild-type) in detergent solutions to carry out the planned experiments (T331A in C1; R237A, S444A in C2; K427A, T437A, F438A in C3; and V327A in C4). During the OM extraction procedure, D249A, R442A, and Y260A were not stable enough due to the loss of the membrane bilayer environment and inability to maintain their native conformation in detergents. Insertion of PapC purified proteins (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) was promoted in planar lipid bilayers by clamping the membrane potential to \u221290 mV. As soon as channel activity was observed, the potential was briefly returned to zero and the chamber stirring stopped to minimize further insertions. 10-min long recordings of channel activity at + and \u221290 mV, and at + and \u221250 mV were performed."

As documented previously, the openings of the \u2018transient-mixed\u2019 behaviour appear rather small and may be due to the jiggling of the plug within the TP and/or the thermally induced mobility of various domains of the protein, such as the NTD and CTDs or loops (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mapingire et al., 2009</a>). Occasionally, and more so at higher membrane potential, very large and sustained openings (\u2018large-open\u2019 behaviour, LO) are observed in wild-type PapC usher (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These openings have a conductance of \u223c3\u20134 nS, which is similar to the monomeric conductance of the mutant lacking the PD (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mapingire et al., 2009</a>) and are interpreted as representing a full displacement of the PD from a single monomer.

The TD of PapC is formed by the largest \u03b2-barrel pore known to be formed by a single chain. The PD occludes the pore in an inactive state and maintains the permeability of the channel. As previously documented, the native PapC channel is highly dynamic and is characterized by spontaneous short-lived openings of various conductance levels (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mapingire et al., 2009</a>). Two distinct structural elements, the \u03b2-hairpin and the \u03b1-helix, play an important role in maintaining the PD in a closed conformation. In the absence of both elements the usher is defective for pilus biogenesis. Our analysis of the non-covalent interaction RIN in the native PapC TD shows that the interactions found between the TP and the PD are mostly weak, possibly to allow an easy release of the PD. This finding supports the idea that the highly dynamic behaviour of the native PapC channel is originated from the \u2018jiggling\u2019 of the PD within the TP (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mapingire et al., 2009</a>). On the other hand, we find that the interactions between the TP and the P-linkers, between the TP and the \u03b2-hairpin, and between the TP and the \u03b1-helix region are mainly stable, supporting their role in maintaining the PD in a closed conformation."

This feature suggests that the two elements are not independent and they are part of a complex allosteric process regulating the PD gating mechanism. It has been proposed that only a few residues play essential roles during allosteric processes and that perturbing the interactions between these residues can facilitate the population shift of the conformational ensembles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Del Sol et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, it has been shown that residues with a pivotal role in mediating such allosteric communications are also important in terms of evolution (both highly coevolved residues and conserved residues) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ferguson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Remarkably, we show here that PapC is characterised by an uneven distribution of the evolutionary important residues, clustered in the P-linkers, the PD, and the barrel wall capped by the \u03b1-helix, in close proximity to the \u03b2-hairpin. Another interesting finding is the presence of the \u2018\u03b213 conserved patch\u2019 that reaches the full height of the pore from the \u03b1-helix region to the loop located between \u03b212 and \u03b213 strands (\u03b212\u2013\u03b213_loop), which has been recently identified as important (<a href=\"#bib16\">Farabella, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Volkan et al., 2013</a>)."

This approach allows us to explore a large part of the protein, resulting in the detection of only 14% of all residues in the TD as potential candidates. It has been shown that detecting \u2018residue communities\u2019 in protein structure networks leads to the identification of key residues that are often part of a signal transduction pathway (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bode et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Del Sol et al., 2007</a>). The interconnection within and between the communities is pivotal for the flow of allosteric signalling. Residues in the same community are densely interconnected and have multiple routes to communicate with one another. However, the interconnections between communities involve only a few edges, which form the bottleneck for the flow of the signal in the network (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bode et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Del Sol et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sethi et al., 2009</a>). Here, all the identified communities (C1\u2013C5, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) comprise residues from multiple elements (e.g., the \u03b2-hairpin, P-linker1, P-linker2, and distinct part of the TP) of PapC TD, except C5 that is composed only by PD residues. Mutation of key residues linking elements within each of the communities C1\u2013C4 shows an altered antibiotic sensitivity phenotype, confirming a role of these communities in the pore-gating mechanism. Additionally, communities C1\u2013C3 are required for proper usher function (as estimated by the hemagglutination assay), suggesting dependency of the pore gating function and pilus assembly (based on some of the mutations). For example, mutations in \u03b212\u2013\u03b213_loop:K427 in C3 and \u03b213:S444 in C2, which lead to a drastic decrease in the frequency of plug displacement (stabilizing the closed state, based on channel activity analysis), also show defective pilus assembly (possibly due to their deficiency in relocating the plug in a functional conformation)."

This observation indicates that \u03b212\u2013\u03b213_loop has a pivotal role in the regulation of plug displacement by acting as a \u2018latch\u2019, as proposed previously (<a href=\"#bib16\">Farabella, 2013</a>) and was also shown by mutagenesis studies (<a href=\"#bib63\">Volkan et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, at the extracellular end of the \u03b213 conserved patch there is another mutation (\u03b213:S444) leading to a channel more reluctant to open, suggesting a regulatory role for the \u03b213 conserved patch (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) in modulating the latch."

For example, the functionally important latch (\u03b212\u2013\u03b213_loop) is shown to be in a different conformation in the open state (based on FimD:FimC:FimH structure [<a href=\"#bib49\">Phan et al., 2011</a>]) as well as other residues in C3 and C4 communities. As a result, some residues that are identified by our method, such as V327, could in principle be selected also by visual inspection for further experimental investigation. V327 (located on P-linker2 in C4 at interface with P-linker1 and the barrel wall) is found to have a different interaction pattern in the open state of the usher and is also shown to promote plug displacement. However, more importantly, the method is able to predict residues in regions that would not attract our attention at all but may contain important information in respect to the allosteric pathway. (This aspect can become even more significant in the absence of an alternative conformation.) For example, we predict two such residues to be functionally important\u2014T331 and S444. T331 is located on P-linker2 at the interface between P-linker2 and the barrel wall, which stays intact in the open conformation of the usher; S444 is located on \u03b213 at the base of the \u03b1-helix, that is, on the barrel itself, and it lacks any direct contact with the plug domain. Surprisingly, and in support to our prediction, both residues are found to have an effect on plug displacement. Thus, the main strength of our method is that the knowledge of the structure of the protein (in one conformation only) and enough sequence information (to extract evolutionary information) are sufficient for the detection of functionally important residues that are pivotal for transferring the regulatory information within the protein."

Using PapC TD as model system, we developed an integrative approach combining computational modelling, sequence conservation analysis, mutual information-based coevolution analysis and information from AA-MD simulations, to study the potential involvement of particular secondary structure elements (the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-hairpin) in the allosteric communication. The construction of a hybrid interaction network and the use of network analysis allowed us to identify communities of residues within the TD that potentially mediate this process. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed that residues located in the P-linkers, the \u03b2-hairpin, and \u03b213 conserved patch (part of four communities) alter channel gating and that residues located in P-linker2, \u03b212\u2013\u03b213_loop, and \u03b213 conserved patch (both periplasmic end and extracellular end) are sensitive to plug displacement. Therefore, we suggest that the \u03b213 conserved patch acts as a regulator of \u03b212\u2013\u03b213_loop (the latch), mediating channel opening. Furthermore, our study shows how the integration of different computational approaches based on evolution, structure, and dynamics of proteins, into a hybrid network can unveil communication pathways within proteins. Such an integrative approach can guide the experimental investigation by pinpointing key candidates involved in the transmission of the allosteric signal."

This sub-network was expanded by again adding only neighbouring residues connected by NCI score higher than 0.3. The procedure was repeated until no new residues could be added to the sub-network. A first set was generated by filtering the sub-network based on the evolutionary information. The filtering was done by selecting nodes with a conservation score of 9 (i.e., highly conserved) or nodes that are connected by an NMI edge (i.e., coevolved significantly). A second set was generated by filtering out the nodes that are not connected by a weakened interaction (\u0394NCI &gt; 0) in each of the mutant systems. Intersecting the identified sets resulted in a \u2018hot spots\u2019 sub-network. The \u2018hot spots\u2019 sub-network was then decomposed into communities using the edge-betweenness clustering algorithm (GLay) as implemented in clusterMaker (<a href=\"#bib19\">Girvan and Newman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Morris et al., 2010</a>).

Planar bilayers were made from a preparation of L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine Type II-S from Sigma (also known as asolectin) according to the Montal and Mueller technique (<a href=\"#bib40\">Montal and Mueller, 1972</a>) following a published protocol (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mapingire et al., 2013</a>). Protein aliquots were diluted 1:1 in buffer T (1 M KCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) containing either 1 or 2% <i>N</i>-Octyl-oligo-oxyethylene (octyl-POE, Axxora). Eight micrograms of protein from the diluted sample was added to the <i>cis</i> side of a planar lipid bilayer chamber containing \u223c1.5 ml of buffer T. Gentle stirring was applied to promote spontaneous insertions of the protein into the bilayer. Channel activity was monitored by measuring current under voltage clamp conditions using an Axopatch 1D amplifier with a CV4B headstage or an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The current was digitized (ITC-18; Instrutech) and stored on a PC computer using the Acquire software (Bruxton). 10-min long traces were sampled at 1.25 ms intervals and filtered at 500 Hz. Both chambers contained buffer T and Ag/AgCl electrodes with pellet. The <i>trans</i> side of the bilayer was set as ground. Insertions were typically performed at \u221290 mV. Data display and analysis were done with pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments)."

However, some PapC mutants behave well in their physiological environment within the membrane, but are unstable once extracted out of the outer membrane for purification. This is the case in 3 of the 10 purified mutants. Indeed, during the OM extraction procedure, D249A, R442A and Y260A mutants were not stable enough to maintain their native conformation in detergents, likely due to the loss of the membrane bilayer environment."

These are based both on evolutionary data and on the information regarding the dynamics of the protein (without the need for prior knowledge on large confrontational changes it may undergo). As shown in the new supplementary figure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>) only 14% of all the residues in the TD were selected as a result of our integrative method, filtering out a large portion of the residues. Thus, the main strength of our method is the ability to explore a large part of the protein. As a result, the method is able to predict not only residues that could in principle be identified by visual inspection (especially if a structure of another conformation is available) but also residues in regions that would not attract our attention at all although they may contain important information in respect to the allosteric network. For example, V327, which was picked by our method and was shown experimentally to have a functional effect on plug displacement, could potentially have been selected for mutagenesis studies by visual inspection. This residue, which is located on P-linker2 (following a proline that is at the border of the mobile part of the linker) as part of the interface with P-linker1 and the barrel wall, has a different interaction pattern in the open state of the usher (based on FimD:FimC:FimH structure (<a href=\"#bib49\">Phan et al., Nature 2011</a> Jun 2;474(7349):49-53). On the other hand, the method predicted, for example, two residues to be functionally important, T331 and S444, and it is extremely unlikely that they would have been selected as candidates for mutagenesis studies by visual inspection only (out of the 494 residues comprising the TD). T331 is located on P-linker2 at the interface between P -linker2 and the barrel wall, which stays intact in the open conformation of the usher) S444 \u03b213 is located on base of the \u03b1-helix, i.e. on the barrel itself, and it lacks any direct contact with the plug domain.
