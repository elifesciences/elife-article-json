H-NS filaments co-localize with sites of Rho-dependent termination in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, but their direct effects on transcriptional pausing and termination are untested. In this study, we report that bridged H-NS filaments strongly increase pausing by <i>E. coli</i> RNA polymerase at a subset of pause sites with high potential for backtracking. Bridged but not linear H-NS filaments promoted Rho-dependent termination by increasing pause dwell times and the kinetic window for Rho action. By observing single H-NS filaments and elongating RNA polymerase molecules using atomic force microscopy, we established that bridged filaments surround paused complexes. Our results favor a model in which H-NS-constrained changes in DNA supercoiling driven by transcription promote pausing at backtracking-susceptible sites. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for H-NS stimulation of Rho-dependent termination in horizontally transferred genes and during pervasive antisense and noncoding transcription in bacteria."

H-NS filaments co-localize with sites of Rho-dependent termination in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, but their direct effects on transcriptional pausing and termination are untested. In this study, we report that bridged H-NS filaments strongly increase pausing by <i>E. coli</i> RNA polymerase at a subset of pause sites with high potential for backtracking. Bridged but not linear H-NS filaments promoted Rho-dependent termination by increasing pause dwell times and the kinetic window for Rho action. By observing single H-NS filaments and elongating RNA polymerase molecules using atomic force microscopy, we established that bridged filaments surround paused complexes. Our results favor a model in which H-NS-constrained changes in DNA supercoiling driven by transcription promote pausing at backtracking-susceptible sites. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for H-NS stimulation of Rho-dependent termination in horizontally transferred genes and during pervasive antisense and noncoding transcription in bacteria."

However, the bridged filaments made by H-NS cause RNA polymerase to pause for longer periods of time.

However, our understanding of the impact of nucleoprotein on transcription in bacteria is more primitive, principally because the structures of nucleoprotein complexes formed from DNA and nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) are more heterogeneous in structure, more dynamic, and less stable than nucleosomes. The histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) is the principal NAP in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. H-NS binds DNA at high-affinity sites, spreads to form filaments on AT-rich DNA, bridges between filaments on different DNA segments, and inhibits transcription (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib3\">Ali et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dorman, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Navarre, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Navarre et al., 2007</a>)."

The loss of the \u223c0.45 Rf band in gels run at 37\u00b0C but not 20\u00b0C is consistent with a loss of bridging interactions at 37\u00b0C that occurred after the samples were loaded on the gels (which were pre-equilibrated to the running temperature). Weakened H-NS interactions at 37\u00b0C also were apparent in the loss of smearing at lower H-NS concentrations (0.1\u20130.4 \u00b5M).

At low DNA concentration (10 pM), we observed half-maximal retardation of radiolabeled DNA electrophoresis at \u223c2 nM H-NS, which we infer corresponds to either the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of H-NS nucleation on the high-affinity URE and DRE sites or the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> for filament extension. This affinity of H-NS is tighter than previously reported (<a href=\"#bib8\">Azam and Ishihama, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dole et al., 2004</a>), perhaps because prior measurements required &gt;2 nM H-NS to form stable filaments at the DNA concentrations used or because, to mimic in vivo conditions, we substituted glutamate for chloride often used previously. As the H-NS concentration was increased, we observed two distinct complexes at both 10 pM and 10 nM DNA. A slower migrating band was observed at 66 H-NS/kb (for 10 nM DNA). At higher concentrations of H-NS (80\u2013200 H-NS/kb), the complexes migrated more rapidly, producing a visible gel downshift. Both the faster and slower migrating species were detected at both low and high DNA concentrations; however, it took higher H-NS:DNA ratios to achieve the comparable protein\u2013DNA complex shifts at 10 pM DNA (333 H-NS/kb for the slower and 3.3 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> H-NS/kb for the faster migrating species). With 10 nM DNA, we found that the shift in gel mobility occurred at both low (2 mM) and high (8 mM) Mg<sup>2+</sup> when H-NS concentration was increased from 66 H-NS/kb to 200 H-NS/kb either using radiolabeled DNA alone or using DNA containing halted A26 ECs with radiolabeled RNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

To test this idea, we examined the filaments using AFM.

On linear filaments, H-NS spread over the entire DNA molecule but interactions between DNA segments or with another DNA molecule were not visible. Interwound complexes contained two DNAs, which were sometimes discernible as distinct filaments but generally exhibited increased height above the mica surface compared to linear filaments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Occasionally, linear and bridged filaments were observable in the same AFM field (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, third panel). Circular and hairpin complexes appeared to have similar bridging to the interwound filaments, but involved only one DNA.

The AFM images were mostly consistent with our hypothesis that the slower migrating band at 8 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the EMSA assays contained bridged filaments (either with or without RNAP), although the concentration requirements of AFM imaging precluded direct observations at 10 nM DNA. Additionally, the presence of RNAP in halted A26 ECs caused a shift in the conformation of bridged filaments from a near equal distribution of interwound, hairpin, and circular forms without ECs to predominantly interwound when ECs were present (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>)."

The presence of both slower and faster migrating complexes in EMSA assays of samples formed at 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, where AFM predicts mostly linear filaments, is an inconsistency in our results but could reflect formation of bridged filaments during electrophoresis in the altered environment of the gel.

Strikingly, transcript elongation at 8 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was dramatically slower on filaments formed at 66 H-NS/kb (conditions favoring bridged filaments) than on DNA alone, but returned to nearly the rate observed on DNA alone on filaments formed under conditions that favor linear filaments (200 H-NS/kb). We converted the gel images to plots of transcript length by densitometry and comparison to size standards, which allowed calculation of mean transcript lengths for each time point (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>).

Although it is possible that pure linear filaments inhibited transcript elongation to some extent, their effects were clearly less than those of bridged filaments. The inhibitory effect seen at 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 66 H-NS/kb monomer could reflect low or transient levels of bridging in these conditions that were not captured by AFM imaging. We conclude that bridged H-NS filaments dramatically slow RNAP by increasing pausing at a subset of sites and that linear filaments have lesser or no effects on elongating RNAP."

The effects of bridged filaments persisted to 28\u00b0C, but the effects of H-NS largely disappeared at temperatures over 30\u00b0C. Thus, H-NS alone inhibits transcript elongation in conditions found during free-living but not inter-host growth of enteric bacteria, consistent with observations that H-NS helps mediate the bacterial temperature response upon infection (<a href=\"#bib88\">Trachman and Yasmin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ono et al., 2005</a>). We also verified that the preferential effects of bridged vs linear filaments on ECs also occurred on a different template on which RNAP initiated transcription at the start site of the <i>bglF</i> antisense promoter (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

To determine whether bridged H-NS filaments readily re-formed upstream of ECs on recently transcribed DNA segments, we used AFM to examine the configuration of ECs and filaments after ECs had transcribed about half the DNA template (8 and 16 min at 30 \u00b5M NTPs; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

In general, the sites of pausing corresponded to the recently mapped consensus pause sequence for <i>E. coli</i> RNAP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Larson et al., 2014</a>), with pausing occurring just after pyrimidine addition and just prior to purine addition and with Gs at positions \u221210 or \u221211. H-NS increased pausing strongly at a subset of sites (e.g., C346, U588, and some others; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) but had less effect at other pause sites recognized in the absence of H-NS (e.g., at C370 and A746, and at U1079, the <i>ops</i> site present on the template). Interestingly, both H-NS-sensitive pauses occurred with Us at positions \u22122 and \u22123, whereas 2 of 3 H-NS resistant pauses lacked this feature (C370 and A593). The H-NS-resistant A746 pause containing a U-tract at these positions and the A593 pause were atypical, as they occurred with a 3\u2032 A. 3\u2032 A is known to be highly sensitive to a 1-nt backtrack conformation, which can be readily cleaved by intrinsic hydrolysis and re-extended (<a href=\"#bib83\">Sosunova et al., 2013</a>). The 3\u2032-proximal U-tracts observed in the H-NS-stimulated pause sequences should make paused ECs especially sensitive to &gt;1-nt backtracking (<a href=\"#bib41\">Komissarova and Kashlev, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Nudler et al., 1997</a>), suggesting that pauses sensitive to multiple-nt backtracking may be most strongly affected by H-NS."

Although scaffolds lack sufficient lengths of duplex DNA to form H-NS filaments, they proved highly informative about the nature of these pauses. The C346 was not detectable at 37\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C during active elongation (on the fly) but became a strong pause when RNAP was delayed at the C346 position by transiently withholding GTP (delay; <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C,E</a>). In contrast, the C370 pause was readily detectable on the fly and increased mostly in the fraction paused rather dwell time when delayed at the C370 position (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3D,F</a>). To understand whether pausing at C346 or C370 involved backtracking, we tested intrinsic cleavage of the nascent RNA in ECs halted at the pause sites. Intrinsic cleavage occurs at internal positions of backtracked transcripts that occupy the RNAP active site and can map the extent of backtracking. The C346 but not the C370 RNA was highly sensitive to intrinsic cleavage in halted ECs; the positions of cleavage suggested that halted C346 ECs spontaneously backtracked by 4\u20136 nt (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3G</a>). We confirmed this result by testing susceptibility to GreB cleavage. Again the C346 halted EC was more sensitive than the C370 halted EC (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3H</a>). Thus, pausing at a sequence significantly enhanced by H-NS (C346) occurred significantly only when delayed and then readily backtracked to create a long-lived pause, whereas pausing at a sequence much less affected by H-NS (C370) exhibited much less potential for backtracking."

Both the sequences of strongly H-NS-stimulated pauses and the stronger effects of GreB than RfaH-NTD are consistent with this hypothesis. The C370 pause that showed greater response to RfaH-NTD than either GreB or H-NS may reside mostly in the elemental pause state, entry to which may be suppressed by RfaH-NTD-induced forward translocation. This pause occurs at a relatively C-rich RNA:DNA hybrid, with both \u221210 G and \u221211 G present in the consensus pause sequence and is thus a strong candidate for a non-backtrack, elemental pause. Examination of the potential for backtracking at C346 and C370 sequences confirmed this interpretation."

To distinguish possible Rho stimulation of pausing from true Rho-dependent termination, we separated the RNAs after 32 min into an EC-bound fraction retained on beads via a His<sub>10</sub> tag on RNAP and a supernatant fraction containing the terminated RNAs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We observed significant termination only when Rho was present; bridged H-NS filaments alone did not cause RNA release (compare red and purple traces, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, Rho terminated ECs at earlier positions on DNA in bridged filaments than DNA lacking H-NS (compare blue and purple traces, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,E</a>). Strikingly, bridged H-NS facilitated Rho termination at sites poorly utilized by Rho alone and at which H-NS strongly stimulated pausing (e.g., C346 and C393, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The C346 and C393 pauses are strong candidates for backtrack pauses that were affected by both H-NS and GreB, whereas a site of Rho termination observed in both the presence and absence of H-NS (C370) is a candidate for a non-backtracked, elemental pause (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>; see above). This result suggests that non-backtracked pauses may be better natural substrates for Rho than backtracked pauses (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). However, strong H-NS stimulation of pausing may allow Rho termination at backtrack sites by increasing the kinetic window for Rho action at the sites as backtracked ECs are known to be poor substrates for Rho (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dutta et al., 2008</a>). An alternative hypothesis is that direct H-NS\u2013Rho interaction aids termination. However, H-NS in linear filaments did not synergize with Rho; the patterns of Rho termination on linear filaments vs DNA alone were almost identical (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that H-NS-stimulated pausing on bridged filaments increases the kinetic window for Rho action (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jin et al., 1992</a>), and the apparent preferential effect of Rho on backtrack pauses may allow Rho to terminate at otherwise suboptimal sites."

We found that NusG-enhanced Rho termination at H-NS-dependent pause sites that are strong candidates for backtracking. The addition of NusG robustly aided in Rho-dependent termination, consistent with previous reports. During transcription of bridged H-NS filaments, NusG stimulated termination of the C346 and C393 pauses more than the C370 pause and allowed termination at the upstream U169 pause (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). NusG also altered the preferred positions of termination at the U588 pause. These effects were exacerbated when bridged H-NS was present, inhibiting overall elongation and increasing termination relative to samples containing only Rho or both NusG and Rho. These results suggest that NusG, like H-NS, may aid Rho in terminating backtracked ECs. Synergy between the actions of NusG and H-NS at Rho terminators could play an important role in transcriptional silencing by H-NS in vivo (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

The existence of both H-NS-sensitive and largely H-NS resistant pause sites, both of which occur at sequences conforming to the recently described consensus pause sequence (<a href=\"#bib48\">Larson et al., 2014</a>), is consistent with the view that RNAP remains in a non-backtracked, elemental pause state at some sites and that such paused ECs are less susceptible to inhibition by H-NS. At least two hypotheses might explain the effects of H-NS at the class of sites more susceptible to backtracking: (1) bridged H-NS might create a physical barrier that blocks forward translocation and thus favors reverse translocation of RNAP (road-blocking model) or (2) the structure of the bridged filament entraps elongating RNAP in small, topologically fixed domains by binding both upstream and downstream of the EC (topological model; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>).

In contrast, linear H-NS filaments will allow either the EC or the upstream and downstream DNA to freely rotate as transcript extension occurs. Thus, the topological model readily explains why the shift to linear filaments at higher H-NS concentrations reverses the pause-stimulating effects of H-NS, whereas the road-block model must invoke a large change in H-NS affinity that, while possible, lacks obvious physical rationale."

In the absence of H-NS, Rho terminated apparent non-backtracked pauses more readily than apparent backtracked pauses. By increasing the time window for Rho action on backtrack pauses, H-NS may increase the sites at which Rho can dissociate a significant fraction of ECs. NusG, which exhibited a preferential effect on the apparent backtracked pauses, may be especially synergistic with H-NS because it both shifts ECs to less backtracked registers and directly aids EC dissociation by Rho, thus overcoming the apparently greater barrier for Rho dissociation at backtrack pause sites."

As H-NS levels saturate all available DNA binding sites, assuming a site size of \u223c5 bp/H-NS monomer, bridging becomes disfavored (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The simplest explanation for this effect is that bridging requires the interaction of an H-NS-free DNA segment with an H-NS bound segment to nucleate formation of a 2-duplex bridged structure such as that proposed by <a href=\"#bib5\">Arold et al. (2010)</a> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At high H-NS levels, all DNA segments may become occupied by H-NS even if bound by only one of the two available DNA-binding domains at each CTD\u2013CTD junction in the filament. At this point, linear filaments may become favored because no free DNA sites are sterically available, even if the intrinsic stability of the linear filament is less than that of the bridged filament structure."

However, many additional factors including sequestration of DNA by other proteins, low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, or elevated expression of H-NS could make the switch to linear filaments possible. If the topological model of H-NS action on ECs is correct, then one particularly interesting aspect of bridged-linear switching is that linear filaments might readily inhibit transcription initiation at promoters by interfering with RNAP binding with less effect on elongating RNAP, whereas bridged filaments might inhibit both initiation and elongation."

Much work remains to establish the mechanistic bases of the links between these effects and the repression of horizontally transferred genes, pathogenicity islands, and pervasive antisense and noncoding transcription.

The RNA was extended one nucleotide with [\u03b1-<sup>32</sup>P]CTP to form C346 scaffold (EC<sub>C342</sub>) or C370 scaffold (EC<sub>C368</sub>). On-the-fly transcription complexes were diluted 20-fold, and 10 \u03bcM CTP, UTP, and GTP (EC<sub>C346</sub>) or CTP, ATP, and GTP (EC<sub>C370</sub>) were added at either 37\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C. Samples were quenched by addition of an equal volume of 2\u00d7 stop dye (10 M urea, 50 mM EDTA, 90 mM Tris-borate buffer, pH 8.3, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol) at 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 s at 37\u00b0C, or 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 360 s at 20\u00b0C.

Dilution of the H-NS-DNA complexes was performed to lower H-NS background and aid identification of complexes in the higher undiluted samples. The remaining H-NS-ECs were used in transcription assays conducted in parallel (as described above). Images of samples were obtained with a MultiMode AFM (Digital Instruments NanoScope IV; now Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) in tapping mode in air using TESPA-V2 cantilevers (Bruker). Images were analyzed for changes in topology, changes in complex height and width with Gwyddion software.

The whole idea of the AFM experiments is to show that the 2 complexes seen in EMSA represent linear and bridge complexes.

This model might also suggest that H\u2013NS bridging promotes topological constraints behind the polymerase, which would be expected to reduce backtracking by multiple nucleotides. Yet, the data presented suggests that H\u2013NS promotes RNAP pausing by stimulating backtracking. The ability of H\u2013NS to increase backtracking needs to be confirmed more thoroughly. Immobilization of the reactions on beads (as in the Rho termination experiment) would allow isolation of paused ECs (as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, 16 min lane). Washing away NTPs and then analysis of the susceptibility of paused ECs to Gre (A and/or B) should be carried out. A fast disappearance of pause bands would unambiguously show that the corresponding complexes have backtracked."

It is estimated that \u223c50% of <i>E. coli</i> on earth is within hosts and 50% is in non-host environments (Winfield and Groisman, 2003, Applied Environ Micro, 69:3687; Savageau, 1983, Am Nat, 122:732), where cells can thrive at 28\u201330\u00b0C. Indeed, the shift from non-host to host temperatures is thought to be a major component of regulatory program controlling symbiosis and pathogenesis in enteric bacteria (<a href=\"#bib28\">Goransson et al., 1990</a>, Nature, 344: 682; Tagkopoulos et al., 2008, Science, 320: 1313). Thus, we disagree with the idea that reduced H\u2013NS effect upon shift from ambient to body temperatures may not be significant. Rather, this shift in the properties of H\u2013NS is already well established (e.g., <a href=\"#bib4\">Amit et al., 2003</a>, Biophys J, 84: 2467) and its role in genetic regulatory programs in <i>E. coli</i> is already well established (e.g., <a href=\"#bib70\">Ono et al., 2005</a>, Biochem J, 391: 203). Our results add a crucial mechanistic understanding to the basis for these temperature-dependent effects of H\u2013NS. We have revised the Introduction to highlight this point by adding the sentence: \u201cIn vivo assays also establish that the H\u2013NS block to transcription is greater in enterobacteria growing at 20\u201330\u00b0C outside hosts than at 37\u00b0C typical for symbiotic or pathogenic growth, and implicate H\u2013NS in switching gene expression upon host invasion (<a href=\"#bib28\">Goransson et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Trachman and Yasmin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ono et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Yang et al., 2005</a>).\u201d We also now highlight this point in the Discussion, by adding a paragraph on temperature regulation."

We were surprised by this request for multiple reasons. First, we employed biochemical methods to dissect H\u2013NS effects on transcript elongation and Rho-dependent termination in vitro because these temperature-dependent in vivo effects are already well established by an ample body of literature (e.g., <a href=\"#bib20\">Dole et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dole et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Peters et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Saxena and Gowrishankar, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ono et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Yang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tachman and Yasmin, 2004</a>, all cited in the revised manuscript). However, the complexity of multiple interacting regulators that govern these effects in cells make in vitro biochemical methods vastly more powerful to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. H\u2013NS filaments inhibit transcript elongation in vivo presumably by aiding Rho-dependent termination, including in the bgl operon that we use as a test platform (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dole et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Saxena and Gowrishankar, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Peters et al., 2012</a>; Chandraprakash et al., 2013). We may have failed to establish this key point clearly in the Introduction. We have revised the Introduction and Discussion to emphasize the pre-existing knowledge about effects of H\u2013NS on transcript elongation in vivo when we undertook this study (see point 1b). We think that it inappropriately discounts the enormous power of carefully designed biochemical experiments to request that they all be matched by parallel in vivo experiments attempting to show the same points."

A complete set of matching in vivo experiments would greatly lengthen the manuscript and could involve a lengthy investigation. Especially given the well-established in vivo precedence and the lack of precision possible with in vivo H\u2013NS experiments (see below), we question the need to test every point established with biochemical experiments with parallel in vivo experiments in the context of a single manuscript. Additional in vivo studies would, of course, be desirable."

To conduct the minimal experiment requested by the reviewers, we would need to develop an assay system in which a strong H\u2013NS filament-forming DNA was placed between an IPTG-inducible promoter and the <i>lacZ</i> gene on an assay plasmid, and then measure transcript elongation rates through it after induction of the promoter in wild-type and \u0394<i>hns</i> cells at 37\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C."

These complex genetics and phenotypes mean that we cannot simply study an <i>hns</i> deletion.

Increased Rho-dependent termination could reflect increases in pausing at a small subset of locations such that the contribution to overall elongation rate might not be as significant as the reviewers expect, even though the effects on Rho-dependent termination at specific sites could be large. We agree that such measurements would be interesting because they could help determine whether effects on a limited set of pauses or larger effects on elongation rate occur, but for the reasons explained above (see 1a) we were unable to complete such experiments in the time frame available.

We rely principally on the AFM results, not the EMSA, to assign the bridged filament; the fact that the shift in gel mobility occurs at H\u2013NS concentrations that correspond to the shift from bridged to linear filaments in AFM strongly suggests the changed gel mobility reflects the bridged to linear transition detected by AFM, although other explanations could be possible. The reviewers have not suggested an alternative explanation. We hypothesize that the bridged filaments are stabilized by caging effects in the gel and by the low temperature once the Mg<sup>2+</sup> is removed by electrophoresis. Such caging affects are known to stabilize protein-nucleic acid complexes during EMSA (Buratowski and Chodosh, 2001, Curr Protoc Mol Biol, 12.2; Fried &amp; Liu, 1994, NAR 22:5054)."

To provide new information of the type sought by the reviewers we have instead established definitively that a key H\u2013NS-stimulated pause, C346, arises by backtracking whereas a key pause not stimulated by H\u2013NS, C370, pauses without evidence of backtracking. We have included these new data as <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3</a>. To demonstrate backtracking at the H\u2013NS stimulated C346 pause vs lack of backtracking at the non-stimulated C370 pause, we examined pausing at the sequences using much shorter RNAs that could form ECs on DNA scaffolds of appropriate sequence (see <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). Strikingly, in the absence of H\u2013NS, no pausing is seen at C346 whereas pausing is seen as C370, especially at 20\u00b0C (panel A). Although it would be ideal to test effects of H\u2013NS on these scaffolds, H\u2013NS does not form filaments on these short scaffold DNAs even when high-affinity H\u2013NS sites are added (we have tested many variants of such scaffolds without success, but haven\u2019t included these results in the manuscript in the interest of brevity). Instead, we tested proclivity for backtracking by halting ECs at the C346 or C370 pause sites by NTP deprivation, and then tested for pausing by addition of NTPs, for intrinsic transcript cleavage by adjusting pH to 9 and Mg to 20 mM, and for GreB-stimulated cleavage by addition of GreB (as requested by the reviewers). The results were clear and striking. Halting ECs at the pause dramatically increased the C346 pause but had much less effect on the C370 pause (more EC entered the pause state, but the pause duration was unchanged). This dramatic increase in the C346 pause was accompanied by a significant potential for intrinsic cleavage of the C346 RNA (actually C21 on the scaffold) but not the C370 RNA, and increased potential for GreB-stimulated cleavage of C346 but not C370. By using short RNAs on scaffolds, we could readily detect the cleavage products, and it was clear the C346 pause backtracked by 4\u20136 nt in the absence of GreB and 4 nt in the presence of GreB (corresponding to 3\u2019 cleavage products of 5\u20137 nt)."
