In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> stomatal lineage, a transient self-renewing phase creates precursors that differentiate into one of two epidermal cell types, guard cells or pavement cells. We found that irreversible differentiation of guard cells involves RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) recruitment to regulatory regions of master regulators of stomatal initiation, facilitated through interaction with a terminal stomatal lineage transcription factor, FAMA. Disrupting physical interactions between FAMA and RBR preferentially reveals the role of RBR in enforcing fate commitment over its role in cell-cycle control in this developmental context. Analysis of the phenotypes linked to the modulation of FAMA and RBR sheds new light on the way iterative divisions and terminal differentiation are coordinately regulated in a plant stem-cell lineage."

In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> stomatal lineage, a transient self-renewing phase creates precursors that differentiate into one of two epidermal cell types, guard cells or pavement cells. We found that irreversible differentiation of guard cells involves RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) recruitment to regulatory regions of master regulators of stomatal initiation, facilitated through interaction with a terminal stomatal lineage transcription factor, FAMA. Disrupting physical interactions between FAMA and RBR preferentially reveals the role of RBR in enforcing fate commitment over its role in cell-cycle control in this developmental context. Analysis of the phenotypes linked to the modulation of FAMA and RBR sheds new light on the way iterative divisions and terminal differentiation are coordinately regulated in a plant stem-cell lineage."

GMCs are made in <i>fama</i> mutants, but they fail to progress into GCs and instead continue dividing while maintaining expression of earlier fate markers (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</a>) and (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, inset); this failure to make GCs results in seedling lethality (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</a>) and (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Overexpression of FAMA reprograms other cells into GC identity, while simultaneously repressing cell division to yield single-celled stomata (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</a>). The mechanisms by which FAMA regulates cell division and terminal differentiation are not known, but FAMA's direct targets include cell cycle regulators and genes associated with mature guard cell function (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hachez et al., 2011</a>). FAMA has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</a>) but can also participate in repression of certain cell cycle targets (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hachez et al., 2011</a>). Here we show that FAMA is required for the irreversible differentiation of GCs and that it fulfills this role through recruitment of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> Retinoblastoma homologue, RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR). Point mutations that disrupt FAMA-RBR interactions render FAMA capable of promoting initial GC identity, but unable to maintain commitment. By demonstrating FAMA-promoted binding of RBR to the regulatory regions of stomatal regulators whose genomic regions contain repressive chromatin marks, we define a molecular mechanism by which the ubiquitously expressed RBR is recruited to specific genomic contexts at specific times to regulate key developmental events."

Plants of genotype <i>fama;FAMApro:FAMA</i><sup><i>LGK</i></sup> (hereafter referred to as FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> plants) were recovered and were moderately healthy and fertile, though smaller than wild type, indicating that FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> was sufficient to rescue <i>fama</i> lethality (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). In the GCs of rescued FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> plants, however, we observed excessive cell divisions, changes in cell morphology, and, most strikingly, production of paired GCs inside of existing GCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013L</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, phenotypic classes 6\u201311)."

To improve phenotypic resolution, we characterized the expression patterns of cell fate and cell cycle markers in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> and <i>FAMAp:amiRBR</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This detailed analysis revealed clear phenotypic differences between reducing RBR levels in GMCs and reducing RBR's interaction with FAMA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Notably, the FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> phenotype results, not from chaotic or uncontrolled divisions and fate changes, but rather an orderly reiteration of stomatal lineage progression. This manifested itself as a progressive increase in phenotypic severity with age (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>) and by the appearance of stomatal lineage markers in patterns suggesting that the GCs reverted to MMC identity and proceeded through the intermediate stages of the pathway normally (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Expression of stomatal-promoting transcription factors (SPCH, MUTE, FAMA, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), stomatal-restricting signaling elements (TMM, EPF1, EPF2, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>), and general division reporters (<i>CDKA1;1</i>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>) followed the normal temporal patterns, and ectopic GC divisions appeared to follow early lineage division rules. For example, when a \u2018reprogrammed\u2019 GC produced two stomata, they were separated by a non-stomatal cell, indicating that spacing divisions occurred. Distinct cell orientations characteristic of amplifying divisions were also visible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Further evidence for normal asymmetric divisions is polarized localization of BASL (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dong et al., 2009</a>) in the larger daughter of a GC division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Based on the lack of expression of stomatal lineage markers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), we interpret the lobed GCs we observe at low, but significant, frequencies in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>, inset, and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>) as cells that are transdifferentiating into an epidermal pavement cell identity."

When expression of shoot meristem (<i>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS, STM</i>), root meristem (<i>WUS HOMEOBOX, WOX5</i>) or embryo genes (<i>WOX9, WOX2, FUSCA3 (FUS3), LEC1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Breuninger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">De Smet et al., 2010</a>) was monitored in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> plants, however, we found no evidence that cells were being reprogrammed into embryonic or other stem-cell-like fates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Analysis of chromatin states in maturing leaves revealed H3K27me3 (a chromatin mark associated with transcriptional repression) in the genomic regions of <i>SPCH, MUTE, FAMA, EPF1</i> and other stomatal genes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lafos et al., 2011</a>), and a recent report showed that manipulation of a member of the POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2) can alter developmental regulation of H3K27me3 deposition at <i>SPCH</i> and <i>MUTE</i> loci (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014b</a>). Animal and plant Rb/RBR proteins can serve as interaction bridges between chromatin modifying enzymes and specific genomic contexts (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gutzat et al., 2012</a>) and RBR was previously found to be associated with SPCH regulatory regions via ChIP in whole seedlings (<a href=\"#bib45\">Weimer et al., 2012</a>). Therefore it is plausible that, as the final master regulator bHLH in the stomatal pathway, FAMA (with RBR) ensures terminal differentiation of GCs by facilitating stable repression of early stomatal lineage genes. To test this model, we assayed the co-association of FAMA and RBR with regulatory regions of three key stomatal lineage genes that have significant H3K27me3 coverage (<i>SPCH, FAMA and EPF1</i>) and, as specificity controls, two cell cycle genes known to be RBR targets (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nowack et al., 2012</a>). Because RBR is essential and expressed in nearly all cells, to accurately assay its role as a potential partner of FAMA in the stomatal lineage, we generated a Myc-tagged version of RBR expressed under the FAMA promoter (<i>FAMAp:RBR-MYC</i>). We confirmed that expression of this transgene did not alter stomatal development and that we could effectively immunoprecipitate it from plants (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In ChIP assays, <i>SPCH</i>, <i>FAMA</i> and <i>EPF1</i> were all targets of FAMA and of stomatal lineage-expressed RBR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Further dissection of the binding regions at <i>SPCH</i> and <i>EPF1</i> indicates that FAMA and RBR are enriched in the same pattern, suggesting that they bind as part of the same complex (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We then tested the key prediction of our model\u2013that association of RBR with a stomatal target gene is dependent on its interaction with FAMA. ChIPs of FAMAp:RBR-MYC in a FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> background showed that RBR enrichment at the promoters of <i>SPCH</i> and <i>FAMA</i>, but not of the general RBR target gene <i>PCNA</i>, was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), consistent with our recruitment model. RBR enrichment at the promoter of a negative regulator of stomatal development, <i>EPF1</i>, was more variable in our assays, sometimes showing little change (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), but failing to associate with RBR in other replicates (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>)."

In theory, failure of FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> to stably repress <i>SPCH</i> expression could, by itself, be sufficient to reinitiate the stomatal lineage program. If this were true, ectopic expression of SPCH in GCs should recapitulate the FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> phenotype. Expression of FAMAp:SPCH-YFP (or its hyperactive variants FAMAp:SPCH1-4A or FAMAp:SPCH2-4A [<a href=\"#bib22\">Lampard et al., 2008</a>]) in an otherwise WT background, however, did not mimic FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This suggests that competence to reinitiate the stomatal pathway requires more than expression of a single \u2018trigger\u2019 gene, but rather a more generally permissive expression state, a fact supporting a broader chromatin regulating role for the FAMA-RBR complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

Both SCR and FAMA bind to RBR via an LxCxE motif, yet the consequences of these transcription factor/RBR interactions are different; RBR antagonizes SCR function in asymmetric division in the root stem cell compartment (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cruz-Ramirez et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2013</a>), whereas RBR and FAMA have similar functions promoting differentiation at the terminal stage of stomatal development. Yet, while different RBR/transcription factor complexes may be customized for unique developmental contexts, the underlying molecular mechanisms of gene regulation might be similar. As with FAMA targets, RBR is required for repression of SCR target genes and can associate with their promoter regions, but there have been no experiments addressing whether disrupting association of SCR and RBR affects either proteins' chromatin association. In this study, we provide key data in support of a specific molecular mechanism for transcriptional repression utilizing RBR in combination with cell-type specific transcription factors: first, we demonstrate, through cell-type specific ChIPs, that RBR is associated with the promoter of the stomatal lineage initiator <i>SPCH</i> in cells as they are committing to terminal fates and second, we show that this binding is reduced when RBR's interaction with FAMA is disrupted. Thus, our data provide strong support for RBR being recruited by cell-type specific transcription factors to lead to transcriptional repression of their targets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

These data complement ours in connecting chromatin modification to stable acquisition of terminal cell identities in the stomatal lineage. Additionally, (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014b</a>) report phenotypes, similar to, but milder than those seen in FAMA<sup>LGK</sup>, caused by prolonged expression of a C-terminal GFP-tagged version of FAMA (FAMA<sup>trans</sup>). In a timepoint and tissue common to their data and this study (12 day old cotyledons), FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> plants display reprogramming of \u223c80% guard cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>) compared with 10% of FAMA<sup>trans</sup>. Lee et al. interpret reinitiation of divisions in guard cells as resulting from a gain of FAMA function, however, this interpretation is at odds with previously published data that FAMA overexpression limits cell division (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hachez et al., 2011</a>) and is difficult to reconcile with most models of chromatin-mediated repression of transcription. In light of our data showing that a loss of a specific FAMA activity (RBR binding) produces strong lineage reprogramming, we think a more parsimonious explanation of the FAMA<sup>trans</sup>-induced phenotype is that blocking of the FAMA C-terminus by addition of GFP creates a protein that dominantly interferes with FAMA-RBR interactions."

Notably, depletion of RBR in many contexts leads to hyperproliferation and derepression of cell cycle promoting genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#bib1\">Borghi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wachsman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weimer et al., 2012</a>). This is in contrast to phenotypes that dominate when its association with FAMA is disrupted; namely that specific cell fates and division behaviors and their accompanying gene expression patterns re-emerge in an orderly pattern. RBRp:RBR-CFP itself becomes ectopically expressed in re-dividing FAMA<sup>LGK</sup> GCs. Were RBR to be playing its cell-cycle repressive role in this context, one would expect this ectopic expression might completely halt divisions. That the opposite occurs, however, suggests a qualitatively different role for RBR in combination with FAMA in these cells. Because <i>RBR</i> is expressed in all cells of the plant, it is difficult to measure whether our cell-type specific amiRNA completely eliminated <i>RBR</i> in guard cells, but our data suggest that RBR's cell-cycle repression activity is more sensitive to dosage than its activity modulating stomatal gene expression. Only by retaining RBR levels but disrupting the FAMA-dependent activity was a clear role for RBR in terminal differentiation unmasked."

Regulation of the stomatal lineage can parallel that of stem cell populations in animals at cellular, developmental and molecular levels. Both plant stomatal and mammalian myogenic lineages, for example, employ series of paralogous bHLHs during fate specification and differentiation, and activities of these bHLHs are regulated through conserved upstream kinases and by association with Rb/RBR (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib28\">Matos and Bergmann, 2014</a>). Bound by immobile cell walls, stomatal lineage cells leave a record of their fate and division history in their marker expression and spatial arrangement on the leaf surface. This plant model, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to dissect cell division and cell fate activities of Rb and other conserved proteins during programming and reprogramming and is a powerful comparative system for future discoveries of fundamental regulatory mechanisms of stem cell initiation, maintenance and termination."

Fold enrichment was calculated by dividing the normalized value of Myc-tagged with that of untagged Col. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Two biological replicates were assayed for each ChIP-qPCR experiment."

These calculations were new to us, so in our attempts to educate ourselves about statistical treatment of ChIP-PCR data, we consulted with colleagues and gathered information from publications. We found that statistical tests on ChIP-qPCR data are actually very uncommon (e.g. none performed in Sawa M et al., Science, 2007; Pruneda-Paz JL et al., Science, 2009; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weimer AK et al., Plant Cell, 2012</a>; and Yu T et al., eLife, 2013). One possible reason is that due to the \u201csticky\u201d nature of tagged samples, negative control regions may sometimes be called as significantly enriched (statistically) in ChIPed DNA from tagged samples when compared to WT samples, creating false-positives. Thus, most studies use enrichment level at the negative control regions as the baseline to assess binding events."

We think the additional ChIP data provided in this revision (at higher resolution and on neighboring regions, and with biological replicates) provide compelling data to support our conclusions about FAMA and RBR binding. We did include an expanded version for our ChIP-qPCR data analysis in the methods section: CT values were obtained for sonicated chromatin taken before (input) and after immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Three technical replicates were assayed for each sample. CT values for ChIP DNA were normalized to mean of CT values for input DNA (CT ChIP \u2013 \u03bcCT Input).

Although the reviewer suggested doing an ANOVA instead of a t-test, since we are comparing only two independent samples (tagged vs. untagged) and all of our readings indicated that ANOVA is used when comparing three or more means for statistical significance, we choose to use the two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test to determine whether normalized ChIP-qPCR values for MYC-tagged sample and untagged Col control were significantly different from one another.

Because many markers show dose sensitivity, we prefer crossing in a common marker, and introgressing new markers into this background in not a fast process when considering all of the genotypes. For these reasons we also optimized a qPCR experiment (using all of the markers we had already confirmed as positive controls) that would let us more easily monitor other genes.
