This process is regulated by the abscission checkpoint, a genome protection mechanism that relies on Aurora B and the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4C to delay abscission in response to chromosome missegregation. In this study, we show that Unc-51-like kinase 3 (ULK3) phosphorylates and binds ESCRT-III subunits via tandem MIT domains, and thereby, delays abscission in response to lagging chromosomes, nuclear pore defects, and tension forces at the midbody. Our structural and biochemical studies reveal an unusually tight interaction between ULK3 and IST1, an ESCRT-III subunit required for abscission. We also demonstrate that IST1 phosphorylation by ULK3 is an essential signal required to sustain the abscission checkpoint and that ULK3 and CHMP4C are functionally linked components of the timer that controls abscission in multiple physiological situations."

This process is regulated by the abscission checkpoint, a genome protection mechanism that relies on Aurora B and the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4C to delay abscission in response to chromosome missegregation. In this study, we show that Unc-51-like kinase 3 (ULK3) phosphorylates and binds ESCRT-III subunits via tandem MIT domains, and thereby, delays abscission in response to lagging chromosomes, nuclear pore defects, and tension forces at the midbody. Our structural and biochemical studies reveal an unusually tight interaction between ULK3 and IST1, an ESCRT-III subunit required for abscission. We also demonstrate that IST1 phosphorylation by ULK3 is an essential signal required to sustain the abscission checkpoint and that ULK3 and CHMP4C are functionally linked components of the timer that controls abscission in multiple physiological situations."

The process comprises several steps, including cleavage furrow ingression and abscission of the midbody\u2014the thin intercellular bridge connecting the nascent daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caballe and Martin-Serrano, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014</a>). Midbody abscission occurs adjacent to the Flemming body, a central protein complex, and is mediated by the ESCRT pathway (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Morita et al., 2007</a>). The ESCRT machinery performs topologically equivalent membrane fission events throughout the cell, including intraluminal vesicle formation at the multivesicular body, retroviral particle release, plasma membrane wound repair and abscission (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hurley and Yang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Henne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">McCullough et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jimenez et al., 2014</a>). The core ESCRT machinery comprises five different factors or complexes: ALIX, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT\u2013III, and VPS4. In most cases, location-specific adaptors initially recruit the early-acting ALIX and ESCRT-I/-II factors, which then recruit the late-acting ESCRT-III and VPS4 complexes to mediate membrane fission. In late stages of cytokinesis, the Flemming body protein CEP55 binds TSG101 (ESCRT-I) and ALIX, which leads to ESCRT-III subunit recruitment (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Morita et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carlton et al., 2008</a>). ESCRT-III-based helical filaments form on either side of the Flemming body and induce cortical constriction, thereby promoting abscission (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guizetti et al., 2011</a>). In addition to driving membrane scission mechanically, ESCRT-III proteins recruit cytokinetic cofactors that contain MIT (microtubule interacting and trafficking) domains. MIT domains bind short motifs within the C-terminal tails of ESCRT-III proteins called MIMs (MIT-interacting motifs), which become exposed and concentrated when the ESCRT-III proteins polymerize (<a href=\"#bib41\">McCullough et al., 2013</a>). MIT domain-containing proteins that participate in cytokinesis include the AAA-ATPase VPS4 and its activator LIP5, which remodel and recycle the ESCRT-III subunits (<a href=\"#bib6\">Babst et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hurley and Yang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lata et al., 2008</a>), Spastin, an AAA-ATPase that severs microtubules, and MITD1, a membrane-binding protein that stabilizes the intercellular bridge (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Connell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Skalicky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hadders et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Azmi et al., 2006</a>)."

When chromosomes persist within the midbody, the abscission checkpoint (also known as NoCut) inhibits abscission until chromatin has been cleared from the spindle midzone, thereby preventing aberrant segregation or cleavage furrow regression and tetraploidy (<a href=\"#bib46\">Norden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mendoza et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Steigemann et al., 2009</a>). Lagging chromosomes are sensed by the Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4C to delay abscission (<a href=\"#bib10\">Capalbo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carlton et al., 2012</a>). Defective nuclear pore complex assembly also triggers Aurora B-dependent abscission delays (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mackay et al., 2010</a>). The full signaling cascade that connects nuclear pores to abscission is not yet clear, but ESCRT proteins themselves are involved in the surveillance and clearance of defective nuclear pore complex assembly intermediates in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Webster et al., 2014</a>). Tension forces applied by dividing cells on the midbody also regulate cytokinesis, with high-tension delaying abscission, and tension release triggering ESCRT-III assembly and membrane scission (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lafaurie-Janvore et al., 2013</a>). How these different physiological inputs converge to influence abscission timing is not understood."

Live-cell imaging analysis revealed that ULK3 regulates abscission timing in response to lagging chromosomes, defects in nuclear pore complex assembly, and tension forces at the midbody. Furthermore, our biochemical and structural studies show that the ULK3 MIT domains bind tightly to IST1, an ESCRT-III subunit required for cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agromayor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bajorek et al., 2009a</a>). Finally, we show that ULK3 phosphorylates IST1 and other ESCRT-III proteins and that IST1 phosphorylation provides an essential inhibitory signal in the abscission checkpoint, thereby ensuring proper coordination of the final events in cell division."

These interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged ESCRT-III proteins from mixed 293T cell lysates that contained One-strep-flag (OSF)-tagged ULK3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, note interactions in lanes 2, 4, 6, and 14). This approach revealed that ULK3 also bound the ESCRT-III subunit IST1 (lane 26), an interaction not tested by Y2H because IST1 fusion constructs activated transcription non-specifically. Endogenous ULK3 also co-precipitated with overexpressed HA-tagged CHMP1A, CHMP1B, CHMP2A, or IST1, but not with CHMP2B (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Finally, endogenous IST1 was efficiently biotinylated in cells that expressed a biotin ligase BirA-ULK3 fusion protein, which promiscuously biotinylates proximal proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lane 4, bottom panel) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roux et al., 2012</a>).

We, therefore, focused on characterizing the IST1-ULK3 interaction. The IST1-binding site on ULK3 was mapped using co-precipitation experiments with Myc-tagged IST1 and different OSF-ULK3 deletion constructs. IST1 bound with similar efficiencies to full-length ULK3 (residues 1\u2013472) and to a minimal construct that spanned just the C-terminal tandem MIT domains (residues 277\u2013449, hereafter denoted ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, lanes 2 and 5, respectively), but did not bind to the isolated ULK3 kinase domain (residues 1\u2013270; lane 3). Thus, the ULK3 MIT domains form the primary IST1-binding site. As discussed below, co-expression of full-length ULK3 resulted in the appearance of lower mobility IST1 species, suggesting that the kinase can phosphorylate IST1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, lane 2)."

IST1 contains two different MIT interaction motifs, termed MIM1 (residues 352\u2013363) and MIM2 (residues 325\u2013329), that were included within a C-terminal IST1 peptide used in these experiments (IST1<sub>303-366</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agromayor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bajorek et al., 2009a</a>). Both MIMs exhibited backbone amide proton chemical shift perturbations upon titration of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled IST1<sub>303-366</sub> with ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub>, indicating that both IST1 MIMs can contact ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), whereas the upstream IST1 residues 303\u2013317 were not perturbed. To assess the binding contributions of each MIM and MIT element, we performed FP-binding experiments with fluorescently labeled peptides comprising either one or both of the IST1 MIM elements and one or both ULK3 MIT domains. The tightest interaction was observed for ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub> binding to a construct that spanned both IST1 MIMs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). However, nearly all of the binding energy was contributed by the IST1 MIM1 element, which bound ULK3 MIT2. Consistent with these experiments, IST1<sub>316-366</sub> binding to ULK3(MIT)<sub>2</sub> was reduced more than 100-fold by a single point mutation in the MIM1-binding site of ULK3 MIT2 (M434D), but not by an equivalent mutation in the MIM1-binding site of ULK3 MIT1 (residues 277\u2013358, V338D mutant; <twofold, <a=\"\" href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</twofold,> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

ULK3 residues 372\u2013446 form the characteristic MIT three-helix bundle, and the IST1 MIM1 helix binds parallel to MIT helix 3 in the groove between MIT helices 2 and 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

The additional binding energy appears to be contributed by N-terminal IST1 MIM1 residues I350 and F352, and by the central F359 residue, all of which make hydrophobic interactions that are absent in other MIM1-MIT complexes. Binding of the bulky hydrophobic IST1 MIM1 F352 and F359 residues is accommodated by complementary small ULK3 MIT2 interfacial residues A415 and G408, respectively. Charged or polar residues are found in equivalent positions of other MIT domains such as VPS4A (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) or ULK3 MIT1.

In addition, endogenous ULK3 protein was detected by immunofluorescence staining at the Flemming body, where it is positioned to function during cytokinetic abscission (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Based on these results, we tested whether ULK3 was required for abscission delays induced by the abscission checkpoint. One event that triggers the abscission checkpoint is the presence of defectively assembled nuclear pore complexes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mackay et al., 2010</a>). As expected, partial depletion of Nucleoporin 153 (NUP153) induced abscission delays that increased the number of midbody-connected cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, lane 1 vs 2). This phenotype was abrogated upon ULK3-depletion, despite comparable levels of NUP153 depletion (lane 2 vs 4). Active Aurora B (Aurora B pT232) is known to localize to the midbody of dividing cells both in control or NUP153-depleted cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mackay et al., 2010</a>). Immunofluorescence imaging of cells treated as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> revealed that ULK3 depletion did not alter the localization of phosphorylated Aurora B to the midbody in cells co-depleted of NUP153, indicating that ULK3 likely functions downstream of Aurora B in the abscission checkpoint (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). These results were confirmed by live-cell imaging experiments, which demonstrated that ULK3 depletion abolished the 30-min abscission delay triggered by nuclear pore disruption (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Furthermore, partial depletion of NUP153 in two different clonal ULK3-knockout cell lines, in which the endogenous ULK3 locus was removed using a lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 system (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ran et al., 2013</a>), also failed to sustain the abscission checkpoint, as seen by a lack of an increase in midbody-connected cells when compared to non-targeting (NT) siRNA transfection, or control cell lines lacking guide RNAs against ULK3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, lanes 8 and 10 vs lanes 2, 4, 6)."

The presence of chromatin bridges within the midbody was monitored by time-lapse microscopy in cells expressing YFP-tagged lamina-associated polypeptide 2\u03b2 (LAP2\u03b2) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Steigemann et al., 2009</a>). As described previously for CHMP4C-depleted cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlton et al., 2012</a>), LAP2\u03b2 bridges were also resolved more rapidly upon depletion of ULK3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4, 5</a>). In control cells, persisting chromosome bridges were resolved in 680 min, whereas in ULK3-depleted cells, this resolution time was dramatically reduced to 300 min. Thus, our experiments demonstrate that ULK3 plays an essential role in supporting the Aurora B-dependent abscission checkpoint in response to either defective nuclear pore assembly or lagging chromosomes. Besides delaying abscission, Aurora B activation also prevents cleavage furrow regression in cells that contain chromosome bridges (<a href=\"#bib57\">Steigemann et al., 2009</a>). As expected, the frequency of furrow regression increased in cells with lagging chromosomes, but ULK3 depletion did not change this proportion (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6, 7</a>). This result indicates that ULK3 does not control furrow regression, but instead likely functions downstream of Aurora B in delaying abscission in response to chromatin bridges."

We, therefore, asked whether ULK3 also plays a role in this largely unexplored regulatory mechanism. Abscission events from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> were stringently segregated into two extreme groups: those for isolated cells (low density) and those for closely packed cells (high density). As reported previously, low-density cells showed significant abscission delays as compared to high-density cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In contrast, ULK3-depleted cells showed similar rapid abscission times regardless of the cell density (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, lanes 3 and 4, <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8\u201311</a>). Thus, ULK3 is also required to delay abscission in response to midbody tension."

The faster abscission in ULK3-depleted cells was restored to control levels by stable expression of an siRNA-resistant wild-type ULK3 construct (ULK3<sup>R</sup> WT, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, lane 3), but not by expression of ULK3 proteins with inactivating mutations in the MIM1-binding sites of either (or both) MIT domains (ULK3<sup>R</sup> V338D, ULK3<sup>R</sup> M434D and ULK3<sup>R</sup> V338D, M434D; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, lanes 4\u20136) or with an inactivating mutation in the ATP-binding site (K44H) of the kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chan et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, lane 4 vs 3). Similarly, stable overexpression of these MIT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">Videos 12, 13</a>) or catalytic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, lane 3 vs 2, <a href=\"#media14\">Video 14</a>) mutants did not change the timing of abscission, whereas ULK3<sup>R</sup> WT overexpression induced abscission delays (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media15\">Videos 15\u201317</a>). The ULK3 MIT mutations did not alter ULK3 kinase activity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), and we, therefore, attribute their effects in abscission specifically to reductions in ESCRT-III binding. The efficacy of the K44H mutation was confirmed by the lack of auto-phosphorylation activity of GST-ULK3 K44H in an in vitro kinase assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and retention of ESCRT-III binding activity was confirmed by Y2H (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus, ULK3 modulates midbody resolution timing through both its kinase activity and ESCRT-III interactions."

ULK3 overexpression altered IST1 midbody localization significantly, as indicated by a 1.5-fold increase in the proportion of IST1 found at the midbody rings and a marked ninefold increase in the proportion of midbodies containing a single ring of IST1 at the Flemming body (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Importantly, HA-ULK3 was seen to co-localize with IST1 at this Flemming body ring (in 42% of observed midbodies) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Additionally, ULK3 and IST1 co-localized at midbody rings on both sides of the Flemming body (58% of cases) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which could be a transient ULK3 localization rarely observed in steady-state conditions exacerbated in the overexpression context (compare to endogenous staining of ULK3 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

As with IST1, the proportion of midbodies exhibiting single Flemming body rings of GFP-CHMP4B also increased 20-fold upon ULK3 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In contrast, overexpression of either ESCRT-binding deficient (M434D) or kinase-defective (K44H) ULK3 had no effect on GFP-CHMP4B localization (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, the ability of ULK3 constructs to induce aberrant ESCRT-III localization correlates with their ability to delay abscission. Both WT and K44H ULK3 co-localized with GFP-CHMP4B polymers at the intercellular bridge (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), while only ULK3 WT co-localized with GFP-CHMP4B at the Flemming body (39% vs 61% of ULK3/GFP-CHMP4B at the midbody rings) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), more closely reflecting the Flemming body localization observed for endogenous ULK3 in a context without overexpression (compare to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This observation suggests that ULK3 does not delay abscission by directly blocking or outcompeting ESCRT-III interactions required for polymerization. Instead, ULK3 apparently induces abscission delays and ESCRT-III mislocalization by phosphorylating substrates important for abscission completion. Taken together, these data show that catalytically active ULK3 changes the steady-state distribution of ESCRT-III proteins at the midbody, suggesting that the abscission delays induced by ULK3 are due, at least in part, to defective ESCRT-III polymerization."

To maximize IST1 phosphorylation, we co-overexpressed Myc-IST1 and OSF-ULK3 in 293T cells, affinity purified the IST1/ULK3 complexes, and determined the masses of intact IST1 proteins by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass-spectrometry. We observed four different IST1 species whose masses differed by \u223c80 Da, the mass change corresponding to phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The different masses corresponded to Myc-IST1 proteins with 1\u20134 phosphates (and N-terminal acetylation).

Nocodazole treatment induced accumulation of at least two different phosphorylated IST1 species (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). A similar banding pattern was observed when endogenous IST1 was depleted and replaced by an siRNA-resistant wild-type IST1 construct (IST1<sup>R</sup> WT, lane 2 vs 4). However, the lowest mobility IST1 species was eliminated when the four mapped phosphorylated serine residues were mutated to alanine (IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, lane 6). The IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA mutant still formed intermediate mobility species, which suggests that additional site(s) on IST1 may be phosphorylated by ULK3 or other mitotic kinases. Formation of the lowest mobility phosphorylated IST1 species was ULK3-dependent, as it was also eliminated by depletion of ULK3 from Nocodazole-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, lane 5 vs 4). Taken together, these results indicate that ULK3 phosphorylates endogenous IST1 during mitosis."

These experiments revealed that NUP153 depletion failed to trigger the abscission checkpoint when endogenous IST1 was replaced with IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lane 6 vs 2), whereas the checkpoint was fully functional when IST1<sup>R</sup> WT was used in this assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lane 4 vs 2). Similarly, intercellular chromatin bridges in cells depleted of endogenous IST1 but expressing IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA resolved significantly faster than chromatin bridges in control cells or cells that expressed IST1<sup>R</sup> WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Importantly, both IST1<sup>R</sup> WT and IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA were able to restore the abscission defects induced by IST1 depletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lanes 3\u20134 vs lane 2, and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), indicating that IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA is fully functional for cytokinesis under steady-state conditions. Similarly, IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA retained its interactions with all known IST1-binding partners in Y2H assays (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). It was notable that the IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA could also still support abscission delays when the checkpoint was induced by low-cell tension. Specifically, the effects on tension-mediated abscission regulation were similar when cells expressed IST1<sup>R</sup> WT or IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, the IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA protein did not support the abscission checkpoint in response to chromatin within the midbody and nuclear pore disruption but retained other IST1 binding and abscission functions, including regulation of abscission timing in response to midbody tension. In contrast, a phosphomimetic IST1 mutant (IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SE: S4E, S99E, S153E, S214E) failed to restore abscission in IST1-depleted cells, as reflected by the accumulation of multinucleated and midbody-arrested cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lane 5 and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, bottom panel). Furthermore, live-cell imaging confirmed that even when cells expressing IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SE did complete abscission, they did so more slowly than cells expressing IST1<sup>R</sup> WT or 4SA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#media18\">Videos 18\u201322</a>). Collectively, these experiments indicate that ULK3 phosphorylation of IST1 delays abscission as an essential component of the abscission checkpoint in the presence of chromatin bridges within the midbody or incomplete nuclear pore assembly."

These experiments revealed that the phosphomimetic mutations enhanced binding of YFP-IST1 4SE to both GST-VPS4 and GST-LIP5 as compared to YFP-IST1 WT and YFP-IST1 4SA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, lanes 20 and 24). In contrast, the interaction of YFP-IST1 4SE with GST-CHMP1B was unchanged (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, lane 12), and the interaction with GST-CHMP2A remained negative. Thus, the enhanced binding effects of the IST1 phosphomimetic mutations were specific for VPS4 and its co-activator LIP5. These results suggest that ULK3 phosphorylation of IST1 may delay abscission by regulating the interaction of IST1 with late-acting components of the ESCRT machinery."

This observation reveals a requirement for CHMP4C in IST1 phosphorylation and suggests a functional link between ULK3 and CHMP4C. To examine whether ULK3 and CHMP4C function in the same regulatory pathway, we tested whether ULK3 is required for the abscission delays induced by overexpression of GFP-CHMP4C (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlton et al., 2012</a>). GFP-CHMP4C overexpression increased the steady-state number of cells connected by midbodies, but ULK3 depletion reverted this phenotype to control levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, lane 5 vs 4). Comparable effects were observed for cells treated with CHMP4C siRNA, which depleted both endogenous and exogenous CHMP4C (lane 6). Interestingly, ULK3 depletion did not alter GFP-CHMP4C localization within the central region of the midbody (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that ULK3 is not required for transmission of the Aurora B signal that targets CHMP4C to the Flemming body (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlton et al., 2012</a>). Endogenous ULK3 did co-localize with GFP-CHMP4C at the Flemming body, however, further supporting a functional connection between these proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

In agreement with the fixed-cell data, ULK3 depletion reverted CHMP4C-induced delays in midbody resolution to control levels (defined by cells expressing GFP-CHMP4B, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, <a href=\"#media23\">Videos 23\u201325</a>). In a reciprocal experiment, CHMP4C depletion attenuated abscission delays imposed by ULK3 overexpression, although in this case the effect was incomplete (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, <a href=\"#media26\">Videos 26\u201328</a>). ULK3-induced abscission delays were abolished upon treatment of cells at midbody stage with an Aurora B inhibitor (ZM447439) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ditchfield et al., 2003</a>). ZM447439-treated cells rapidly underwent abscission, implying that Aurora B activity is required in order for ULK3 to delay abscission (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). These data indicate that ULK3 and CHMP4C act together in regulating abscission as part of the Aurora B-dependent abscission control pathway. The requirement for CHMP4C in abscission delay can be partially alleviated in cells overexpressing ULK3, however, suggesting that excess ULK3 can overcome upstream CHMP4C functions in regulating midbody resolution."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>, the lowest mobility IST1 species observed in mitotically arrested cells was eliminated upon treatment with Aurora B inhibitor (lane 4 vs 3), whereas the intermediate mobility species was not altered by this treatment. These effects are similar to those observed for the IST1<sup>R</sup> 4SA mutant or upon ULK3 depletion. These observations suggest that the low-mobility species is required for abscission checkpoint function and that additional site(s) on IST1 could be phosphorylated by ULK3 or other mitotic kinases in an Aurora B-independent manner. We, therefore, tested whether immunoprecipitated HA-tagged CHMP4 proteins could be phosphorylated by ULK3 in vitro. CHMP4C was phosphorylated by recombinant ULK3 in these experiments, whereas CHMP4A and CHMP4B were not (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). ULK3 phosphorylation was retained in a CHMP4C deletion mutant that lacked both the ALIX-binding site (<a href=\"#bib40\">McCullough et al., 2008</a>) and the C-terminal insertion that is phosphorylated by Aurora B<sup>23,24</sup> (CHMP4C 1\u2013200; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, lane 3). However, ULK3 phosphorylation was lost upon further deletion of the MIM2 element (CHMP4C 1\u2013184; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, lane 4). These results show that ULK3 and Aurora B target different residues in CHMP4C and indicate that ULK3-dependent phosphorylation requires the MIM2 region. In agreement with the in vitro data, CHMP4C phosphorylation was also observed in cells co-transfected with Myc-CHMP4C and OSF-ULK3 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) as was observed for other ULK3 ESCRT-III substrates."

This phosphorylation induces a mobility shift that can be followed by Western blot of cells expressing HA-CHMP4C at functional levels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlton et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, mitotic CHMP4C phosphorylation was also observed for a HA-CHMP4C mutant that lacked the Aurora B target residues (CHMP4C\u03b4INS) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, Aurora B-independent phosphorylation of CHMP4C occurs during cell division. Quantitative Western blot revealed that mitotic arrest increased the fraction of phosphorylated CHMP4C (P-CHMP4C) to 81% vs 7% in asynchronous cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>, lane 3 vs 1). However, depletion of ULK3 reduced the mitotic fraction of P-CHMP4C to just 30% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>, lane 4). These differences could not be attributed to gross changes in mitotic arrest because P-H3 levels remained constant upon ULK3 depletion. Similarly, the fraction of phosphorylated CHMP4C\u03b4INS increased in mitotic cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>, lane 7 vs 3), and phosphorylation levels were again reduced by ULK3 depletion, albeit not as dramatically as in the case of WT CHMP4C (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>, lane 8 vs 7 and 4). Hence, ULK3 contributes to mitotic CHMP4C phosphorylation, and ULK3-dependent phosphorylation and Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of CHMP4C are separate events."

Consistent with this model, we have identified a subset of ESCRT-III proteins, particularly IST1, which are bound and phosphorylated by ULK3. The MIT2 domain of ULK3 binds the MIM1 of IST1 with unusually high affinity. In contrast, both MIT domains contribute significantly to CHMP1A/B binding, suggesting that MIM1 elements of CHMP1 and IST1 proteins bind ULK3 in distinct ways. Both MIT domains contribute to ULK3 functions in the abscission checkpoint. These observations suggest that IST1 engages the ULK3 MIT2 domain, whereas the other MIT site is occupied by other ESCRT-III proteins and/or by yet unidentified binding partners."

Overexpression of catalytically active ULK3 induced both IST1 and CHMP4B to form single rings within the Flemming body, a phenotype rarely observed in control cells. Intriguingly, both endogenous ULK3 and functionally active CHMP4C also localize to the Flemming body (<a href=\"#bib10\">Capalbo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carlton et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that ULK3 may promote association of ESCRT-III subunits with abscission checkpoint regulators to form a cytokinetic inhibitory complex at the central region of the midbody. We also observed that phosphomimetic mutations enhanced IST1 interactions with the late-acting VPS4 protein and its activator LIP5 in cells. We speculate that these enhanced interactions are mediated by unidentified bridging factor(s) because the IST1 phosphorylation sites lie outside of the VPS4- and LIP5-binding sites. The Abscission/NoCut Checkpoint Regulator (ANCHR) protein delays abscission by retaining VPS4 at the Flemming body (<a href=\"#bib60\">Thoresen et al., 2014</a>), and it is, therefore, possible that phosphorylated IST1 may collaborate with ANCHR. Moreover, IST1 can also inhibit VPS4 ATPase activity by forming an inactive IST1-VPS4 heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dimaano et al., 2008</a>), and phosphorylated IST1 could, therefore, delay abscission by inhibiting VPS4 ATPase activity or by inhibiting productive VPS4 recruitment by ESCRT-III proteins, including CHMP1 and IST1, which help localize VPS4 to the midbody late in cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agromayor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bajorek et al., 2009a</a>)."

We favor a model in which ULK3 is activated during mitosis and functions downstream of Aurora B and CHMP4C. This would explain why mitotic phosphorylation of IST1 requires ULK3 and CHMP4C and why ULK3 overexpression can partially overcome the requirement for CHMP4C in abscission delay. Given that ULK3 phosphorylates multiple ESCRT-III subunits, the initial phosphorylation of CHMP4C by Aurora B could be subsequently \u2018amplified\u2019 by ULK3. Our data further show that ULK3 and Aurora B phosphorylate CHMP4C at different sites (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlton et al., 2012</a>). This is consistent with the functional interdependence of ULK3 and CHMP4C in the abscission checkpoint and could contribute to creating a feedback loop that sustains the inhibitory signal. Mitotic phosphorylation of CHMP4C then decreases at (or near) the time of abscission, suggesting that a checkpoint-dependent phosphatase may override ULK3 activity and provide an \u2018all clear\u2019 signal to complete abscission."

Molecular ions with +1, +2, or +3 charge states determined from an ESI-FTMS primary mass spectrum (LTQ-FT instrument) were typically considered. Searches for trypsin- or chymotrypsin-specific peptide cleavages allowed two missed cleavages, and a mass error tolerance of 5 ppm in the ESI-FT-ICR data and 0.5 Da for MS/MS ions. Peptide modifications included in the searches were oxidation on Met and/or phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, or Tyr residues. Identified peptides were accepted when the MASCOT ion score value exceeded 20, mass errors were less than 5 ppm, and expect values were less than 1. Peptide and phosphopeptide assignments were also manually validated. Sequence coverage of Myc-IST1 was 94%, with identified peptides encompassing 39 out of the 40 Ser and Thr residues.

They identify a protein kinase, ULK3 that binds a number of components of the ESCRT III com-lex. ULK3 is the second kinase (after Aurora B) to enter into this pathway. Abscission happens more rapidly in cells defective in ULK3 and therefore the authors hypothesize that ULK3 is part of the abscission checkpoint that delays abscission until lagging chromosomes are fully segregated and until NPC are properly formed. ULK3 regulates the timing of abscission through phosphorylation and modulation of function of a member of the ESCRT complex protein IST1. ULK3 also functions with CHMP4C to regulate timing of abscission."

My main concern stems from how the experiments are done in general, in that the entire study depends on over expression and siRNA based knockdown. In particular all protein-protein interactions have been performed with over expressed ULK3 and localization also done with over expressed ULK3. I think with genome editing working very efficiently through the suite of approaches (ZFN, TALEN, CRISPR/CAS9), I would want to see them make ULK3-HA or ULK3GFP in cell lines expressed off the native promoter to localize the protein and perform immunoprecipitations (for example see the Drubin lab papers on endocytosis in mammalian cells)."

Having a precise deletion will also allow them to address the relationship between ULK3 and Aurora B (parallel vs. linear pathways) and ULK3 and CHMP4C more convincingly. They might also find that ULK3 deletion does not survive, in which case they would have unearthed something new."

If they want to maintain this statement they should further explore the ULK3-Aurora B relationship. Using similar nocodazole-release experiments to those shown in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, the authors have previously concluded that the mobility shift of CHMP4C during mitosis (due to phosphorylation) was dependent on Aurora B activity (PMID:22422861; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D-I</a>). In turn, CHMP4C phosphorylation by Aurora B was found to depend on the 'INS' region. Using the same setup in the current study, the authors find that deleting the 'INS' region has no effect on CHMP4C phosphorylation during mitosis, with ULK3 being the main regulator of mitotic phosphorylation in the current study (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). How do the authors explain this apparent discrepancy? To this end, and to mechanistically link the current study with existing literature, the authors should explore the relationship between Aurora B and ULK3 in more detail. Does ULK3 control interaction of Aurora B with CHMP4C? Does Aurora B provide the additional phosphorylation on IST1? This can be addressed using Aurora B inhibitors."

Another consequence is poor temporal alignment of cells as exemplified in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a> (compare the t=0 time point for the non-targeting vs. ULK3 siRNAs in panel D; these cells are very different).

However, it is unclear which of these are attributed to ULK3 and which are involved in abscission checkpoint signaling, complicating interpretation of results with the 4SA/E mutants in relation to ULK3. The authors should assess and clarify whether all 4 sites are ULK3 dependent, and if not, which ones are. This analysis could be done using in vitro kinase assays on recombinant proteins or by purifying IST1 from ULK3 depleted cells, followed by phospho-MS/MS analysis. Have the authors analyzed the single SA mutants? This is important since IST1 phospho-mutant phenotypes do not mimic ULK3 phenotypes, with ULK3 overexpression only mildly delaying abscission (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but the IST1 4SE showing strong effects on abscission and multinucleation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

It should be pointed out that we have looked at CHMP4C phosphorylation with two different approaches, by looking at changes in mobility using SDS-PAGE and by performing in vitro phosphorylation assays with recombinant kinases. These methods complement each other although it is well known that phosphorylation events do not result necessarily in mobility shifts. Our published data and the results in this manuscript indicate that Aurora B and ULK3 phosphorylate CHMP4C at separate sites with different consequences on the mobility of this protein in SDS-PAGE. In this context, we previously observed that the INS region is required for in vitro phosphorylation of CHMP4C by recombinant Aurora B (PMID:22422861; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G-H</a>), but we never showed that this insertion is required for the mobility shift observed in mitotically arrested cells. We have now done these experiments showing that deletion of the INS region does not alter the mobility shift of CHMP4C in mitosis whereas ULK3 depletion inhibits this shift (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). The fact that Aurora B inhibitors reduce the mitotic phosphorylation of CHMP4C as measured by mobility shifts (PMID:22422861; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) is now better explained by the new data indicating that ULK3 is a downstream effector of Aurora B, thus suggesting that Aurora B inhibition is likely to have a knock-on effect on ULK3 activity thus preventing the mitotic phosphorylation of CHMP4C.

Regarding the apparent variation between experiments, this reflects the normal day-to-day variation in abscission time that is observed in HeLa cells and our experiments are specifically designed to neutralize this issue. Crucially, equivalent cell cultures were treated in parallel with the different siRNAs, thus excluding cell density as a source of uncontrolled variability. Moreover, the data were acquired in parallel using a motorized microscope to ensure that the differences in abscission time are meaningful. Importantly, the small fraction of midbodies that moved out of the plane of focus were excluded from the analysis. Regarding the temporal alignment of cells, it is worth noting that midbody formation occurs less than 10 minutes after the end of anaphase. Hence, the apparent differences pointed by the reviewer represent stages that are very close in time. Moreover, to ensure that the differences observed are not due to potential artifacts associated with the scoring of midbody formation, we have re-analyzed an entire figure (including three independent experiments) using the end of anaphase instead of midbody formation as t=0. As <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a> shows, both types of analysis result in similar differences in the abscission time.

We envision a model in which ULK3 delays abscission by phosphorylating IST1, rendering it incapable of functioning in abscission. If cells do not contain defects like lagging chromatin or misformed nuclear pores, they are released from the checkpoint, IST1 is dephosphorylated, and abscission proceeds. This model is consistent with our observation that IST1 cycles between phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated states throughout the cell cycle, with the phospho-IST1 species accumulating during mitosis (as mimicked by nocodazole treatment, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D, E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). This \u201cdephosphorylation\u201d event cannot occur for the 4SE IST1 mutant. Moreover, we would point out that cells that express the IST1 4SE that escape abscission failure have delays (48 min) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), that are comparable to the delays induced by ULK3 overexpression (78 min and 39 min in two different experiments).

As expected the IST1 4SA mutant fails to delay abscission in response to nuclear pore depletion and lagging chromatin at the intercellular bridge. Surprisingly, however, the IST1 4SA mutant behaves like the wild type IST1 protein in response to tension. These observations imply that abscission delays that are triggered via (lack of) tension require different signals and/or may not be as sensitive to IST1 phosphorylation as delays triggered through nuclear pores or lagging chromatin. This result is interesting because it could mean that delays in abscission in response to tension may require additional ULK3 substrates and/or additional, unidentified phosphorylation sites on IST1."

In contrast, ULK3 overexpression provides a unique opportunity for meaningful localization studies because this situation induces (or mimics) the abscission checkpoint in a large fraction of the cell division events.

These proteins do not interact, and the authors do not explore the significance of the phosphorylation event in any detail (e.g. no mapping of target sites, no ULK3-specific phosphoCHMP4C mutants to see if this affects abscission timing etc.). On the other hand, several datasets points towards interplay between CHMP4C and ULK3 that are left undiscussed: For example, ULK3 KD seems to affect the overall level of CHMP4C (</i><a href=\"#fig2\"><i>Figure 2B</i></a><i>). Can the authors explain this? Does ULK3 control CHMP4C stability, and can this be rescued by WT, K44M or M434D ULK3 alleles? Additionally, ULK3 SDS-PAGE mobility is altered upon CHMP4C knockdown (</i><a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5E</i></a><i>). Could this reflect altered ULK3 modifications, such as phosphorylation? This should be discussed. In the absence of further data the authors should play down their statements about the ULK3-CHMP4C link (This part could be deleted)</i>."
