The complex regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression, DNA damage repair and cell differentiation. HDACs 1 and 2 are recruited by the MTA1 corepressor to form the catalytic core of the complex. The histone chaperone protein RBBP4, has previously been shown to bind to the carboxy-terminal tail of MTA1. We show that MTA1 recruits a second copy of RBBP4. The crystal structure reveals an extensive interface between MTA1 and RBBP4. An EM structure, supported by SAXS and crosslinking, reveals the architecture of the dimeric HDAC1:MTA1:RBBP4 assembly which forms the core of the NuRD complex. We find evidence that in this complex RBBP4 mediates interaction with histone H3 tails, but not histone H4, suggesting a mechanism for recruitment of the NuRD complex to chromatin."

The complex regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression, DNA damage repair and cell differentiation. HDACs 1 and 2 are recruited by the MTA1 corepressor to form the catalytic core of the complex. The histone chaperone protein RBBP4, has previously been shown to bind to the carboxy-terminal tail of MTA1. We show that MTA1 recruits a second copy of RBBP4. The crystal structure reveals an extensive interface between MTA1 and RBBP4. An EM structure, supported by SAXS and crosslinking, reveals the architecture of the dimeric HDAC1:MTA1:RBBP4 assembly which forms the core of the NuRD complex. We find evidence that in this complex RBBP4 mediates interaction with histone H3 tails, but not histone H4, suggesting a mechanism for recruitment of the NuRD complex to chromatin."

Genes are actively switched on or off through the action of assemblies of proteins that act together as molecular machines. Some of these machines alter the way that DNA is packaged inside cells. Packaged DNA \u2013 called chromatin \u2013 consists of DNA wrapped around proteins called histones, which together form structures called nucleosomes. Changing how tightly nucleosomes are packed together can alter whether a gene is active: tighter packing makes it harder to access the genes in that stretch of DNA and therefore inactivates them."

This complex is important for early development and for the stability and repair of our genes.

Millard et al. have therefore used a number of structural techniques to investigate the three-dimensional architecture of the three core proteins in the NuRD complex. The resulting structures have revealed how the HDAC1, MTA1 and RBBP4 proteins interact to influence how the complex is recruited to nucleosomes. The next step will be to assemble all the remaining proteins of the NuRD complex to understand its architecture as a whole."

RBBP4 has also been found to be a subunit of the chromatin-assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex whose function is to initiate nucleosome assembly by assembling histones H3 and H4 onto newly synthesized DNA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Parthun et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Verreault et al., 1996</a>).

We show that both sites within the MTA1 monomer are capable of independently recruiting RBBP4 proteins such that the HDAC1:MTA1 dimer recruits four molecules of RBBP4 to the NuRD complex. The crystal structure of this central recruitment site reveals an extensive interface that requires some structural rearrangement within RBBP4. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and single-particle negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) reveal the architecture of the core NuRD complex. RBBP4 proteins are tethered to the HDAC1 dimer by MTA1 forming an elongated zig-zag conformation. We show that when in complex with MTA1, RBBP4 is able to interact with histone H3, but not histone H4 suggesting a mechanism for recruitment of the NuRD complex to chromatin."

We have used a combination of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), single-particle negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) and chemical crosslinking to determine the architecture of this core complex.

The <i>ab initio</i> molecular envelope generated from the SAXS curve in the lowest symmetry mode (P1) suggests that the core NuRD complex has an elongated architecture (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3d,e and f</a>). Although no symmetry was imposed, the envelope has an approximate two-fold symmetry consistent with a dimeric complex. We fitted the HDAC1:MTA1 dimer in the centre of the envelope such that the two-fold axis of symmetry matched the approximate symmetry of the envelope (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). This left two 'lobes' to the envelope that were of sufficient volume to contain the structure of the MTA1-R1:RBBP4 complex and additional volume for the zinc-finger domain that forms a link between the two X-ray structures."

This initial model was refined against 17,841 semi-automatically picked particles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). The resulting EM envelope showed that RBBP4 and HDAC1 form a closer association than predicted in the SAXS model. The HDAC1:MTA1 and MTA1-R1:RBBP4 structures fitted well within this envelope. In their new position the RBBP4 domains are tipped by 30\u00b0 such that they are approximately parallel to each other and propagate the symmetry of the HDAC1:MTA1 dimer. This position fits well with the cross-linking data. A 30\u2009\u00c5 filtered model was then generated, based on the new position of RBBP4, and refined further to produce a 19\u2009\u00c5 EM structure using the FSC criterion with a cutoff of 0.143 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,c</a>)."

Sequence alignment show that a stretch of c.35 residues is highly similar between the two recruitment regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). These include the amino terminal strand, helices H1 &amp; H2 and the PYxPI loop. A previous structure of the R2 domain in complex with RBBP4 included helix H2 and the PYxPI loop (22 residues) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alqarni et al., 2014</a>). Comparison of this structure with that of the equivalent region of the R1 domain (region B in the description above) shows a highly similar mode of binding to RBBP4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Indeed, the path of the mainchain from P492 to I503 is essentially identical. The sidechains A495, A496 and R497 in helix H2 and P499, Y500, P502 and I503 in the PYxPI loop mediate key interactions with RBBP4 and are identical in the R2 domain."

However, the histone H3 interaction on RBBP4 is exposed in both the MTA1:RBBP4 binary complex and in the dimeric MTA1:HDAC1:RBBP4 complex.

We have established that a central section of MTA1 directly recruits RBBP4/7 and brings this subunit into close proximity to HDAC1/2. It is possible that the relative arrangement of HDAC1, MTA1 and RBBP4 may be somewhat different in the holo-NuRD complex.

Recognisable R1 and R2 interaction domains are present in MTA1 and 2 proteins from fly to man suggesting that the stoichiometry of the NuRD complex is evolutionarily conserved. Our findings fit partially with a previous study of the NuRD complex using label-free mass spectrometry.

The similarity in affinity led them to suggest that there may be competition between MTA1 and histone H4 for binding to RBBP4 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alqarni et al., 2014</a>). Our findings suggest that there is likely to be a more extensive interface between MTA1-R2 and RBBP4 with an additional helix and beta-strand contributing to the interaction. This is in fact supported by cross-linking data (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kloet et al., 2015</a>). Given this extended interface we suggest that histone H4 is unlikely to be able to compete with either MTA1-R1 or R2 for binding to RBBP4. Indeed, the MTA1-R1:RBBP4 complex appeared highly stable since the resin-bound complex could be washed with 2\u2009M NaCl and 5% triton-X-100 without significant dissociation (data not shown).

This would correlate with previous studies that have observed association of the NuRD complex with a specific subset of gene promoters enriched with H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>). In addition, MBD3, a component of the NuRD complex has been reported to localise at H3K27ac and H3K27me3 enriched sites (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shimbo et al., 2013</a>). RBBP4 may therefore have an important role in directing the NuRD complex to chromatin bearing these modifications."

The authors convincingly confirm previous reports of a possible second RPBB4 interaction site in MTA1 and of a 1:2 stoichiometry for the MTA1:RBBP4 complex (both of these previous reports are appropriately referenced). An X-ray structure of RBBP4 interacting with a ~80 amino acid segment of MTA1 containing the novel/previously suspected binding site provides an improved understanding of a possibly conserved MTA1:RBBP4 interaction mode. The experiments to test interaction of RBBP4 with various MAT1 segments are convincing and the implications from analysis of the X-ray structure showing the \"new\" interaction with MAT1 are interesting."

MALS was used to analyze the stoichiometry and SAXS to investigate the core's overall structure. These results were complemented by cross-linking/mass spectrometry and analysis of single particle electron microscopy (EM) images of the core. The MALS results to test complex stoichiometry, and the SAXS results to evaluate overall complex structure are sound. However, the cross-linking/MS and EM results used to derive a structure for the MTA1:HDAC1:RBBP4 are not as convincing. The SAXS envelope is, as expected very low resolution and cannot determine more than the overall position of RBBP4. The authors relied on the MS analysis to orient RBBP4 in the complex and then compared views of their cross-linking based model with class-averages obtained from EM images. About two third of crosslinks are consistent with the proposed model and the authors highlight a number of EM class averages that also appear consistent with the model. This seems sufficient to validate the proposed model, but actually calculating a low-resolution structure from the EM images would have provide more definite evidence. Since the EM class averages seem to show various views of the complex, it is conceivable that those averages contain enough information to calculate a 3D map. There are also other simple approaches that could have been used to obtain an actual structure from EM images of stained particles."
