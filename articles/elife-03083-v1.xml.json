Though known for over a century, it received little interest until it was appreciated that it is highly enriched in receptors for various signaling pathways, including PDGF, calcium, receptor tyrosine kinases, Wnt, and Hh (<a href=\"#bib27\">Satir et al., 2010</a>). The assembly of primary cilium is coupled to cell cycle exit and entry into quiescence. The primary cilium functions as a tumor suppressor organelle that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Pan et al., 2012</a>). Dysfunctions of the primary cilium cause a set of human diseases, classified as ciliopathies, such as polycystic kidney diseases (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hildebrandt et al., 2011</a>). Cancers are also associated with the loss of cilia, due to misregulated cell proliferation through ciliary signaling (<a href=\"#bib23\">Plotnikova et al., 2008</a>)."

The assembly/disassembly of cilia and maintenance of ciliary length are tightly regulated through control of intraflagellar transport (IFT) and axoneme modification (<a href=\"#bib1\">Avasthi and Marshall, 2011</a>). Ciliary length is regulated by the balance of the bidirectional transport of microtubule subunits and associated protein complexes through IFT (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008</a>). Importantly, the extension/resorption of primary cilia also involves changes of the stability of axonemal microtubules, which are controlled by post-translational modifications. For example, Aurora kinases stimulate disassembly of cilia and flagella by phosphorylation and activation of tubulin deacetylase (<a href=\"#bib19\">Pan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Pugacheva et al., 2007</a>). Another key post-translational modification during ciliogenesis is ubiquitylation. In Chlamydomonas flagella, there is an increase in the levels of protein ubiquitylation during flagellar resorption (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huang et al., 2009</a>). However, the precise mechanism for how ubiquitylation might control the process of ciliogenesis is not known."

Recently, it was shown that anaphase-promoting complex (APC), the key ubiquitin E3 ligase that governs cell cycle progression is localized to the basal body of the motile cilia in multiciliated <i>Xenopus</i> epidermal cells, where it has some role in regulating ciliary polarity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ganner et al., 2009</a>). In mitosis, APC sequentially recruits co-activators (Cdc20 followed by Cdh1) and cooperates with two specific E2s (UBCH10 and Ube2S) to control proteolysis of key regulators of the metaphase to anaphase transition (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fujita et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Fujita et al., 2009</a>). APC also has a less well understood role in regulating other cellular processes, such as neurogenesis, metabolism, and myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Eguren et al., 2011</a>)."

Regulation of phosphorylation of APC subunits and Cdc20 is essential for the timing of APC activation during mitotic progression (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kramer et al., 2000</a>); APC-Cdc20 is also modulated by its inhibitor proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Luo et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Madgwick et al., 2006</a>). In addition, protein levels of APC cognate E2s, UBCH10 and Ube2S are crucial for the activation of APC-Cdc20, and play a role in the override of mitotic arrest (<a href=\"#bib26\">Reddy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Garnett et al., 2009</a>). Although the function and regulation of APC-Cdc20 during mitosis and meiosis is thoroughly studied (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kramer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Madgwick et al., 2006</a>), the non-mitotic roles of APC-Cdc20 remain largely unknown. It was recently found that APC-Cdc20 is localized to the centrosome of postmitotic neurons and plays an important role in dendrite morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kim et al., 2009</a>). It would therefore be of interest to explore the potential activity of Cdc20 in quiescent and differentiated cells. All of this circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a value in investigating whether APC has a broad regulatory role in the primary cilium. We report here that APC-Cdc20 is central to the regulation of the primary cilium. The APC is localized to the basal body of primary cilia of human epithelial cells, where it negatively controls the length and stability of the axonemal microtubules. During exit from the quiescent (G0) state APC-Cdc20 is activated and drives ciliary resorption."

Human hTERT-RPE1 cell line is an established model to study the assembly/disassembly of primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib25\">Pugacheva et al., 2007</a>). Greater than 80% of RPE1 cells are ciliated after serum-starvation for 48 hr, and disassembly of primary cilia occurs 1\u20132 hr after re-adding serum. We found that APC is still active in cytoplasmic extracts of quiescent ciliated RPE1, using the canonical APC substrate Securin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Immunostaining showed that APC subunit 2 (APC2) is localized to the basal body of the ciliated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), consistent with the previous report that APC is localized to the basal body of motile cilia in the <i>Xenopus</i> epidermis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ganner et al., 2009</a>). Co-localization of APC2 with dynactin subunit P150 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Guo et al., 2006</a>) further confirmed its localization to the mother centriole (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B and 2C</a>). Furthermore, we found that the APC co-activator Cdc20 is also localized to basal body of the primary cilium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), whereas Cdh1 did not show such localization (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Interestingly, Cdc20 was not observed at the centrosome of cycling interphase non-ciliated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), indicating that Cdc20 is specifically recruited to the basal body during ciliogenesis, rather than generally binding to the interphase centrosome. Western blotting showed that Cdc20 protein levels are dramatically reduced after serum starvation for 24 hr, due to the exit of cells from proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Importantly, Cdc20 protein levels were significantly elevated at 48 hr after serum starvation, when &gt;80% of the cells are ciliated, consistent with the appearance of this protein at the basal body. Thus, our data suggest that APC-Cdc20 may have a special role at the basal body after initiation of ciliogenesis."

Reduction of APC subunit 2 (APC2) by siRNA significantly increased the length of primary cilia marked by acetylated tubulin staining (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Consistently, the depletion of Cdc20 by siRNA had no effect on the percentage of ciliated cells, but there was a significant increase in the ciliary length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). Negative Ki-67 staining demonstrated that these ciliated cells after the knockdown of either APC2 or Cdc20 are still in quiescent stage (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, knockdown of Cdh1 by siRNA gave no obvious ciliary phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This result is contradictory to a previous study proposing that APC-Cdh1 promote ciliogenesis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Miyamoto et al., 2011</a>). Reciprocally, we asked what the effect would be for overexpression of Cdc20. When we transiently transfected cells with plasmid encoding Cdc20-GFP, we found it localized to the centrosome of quiescent cells, and completely suppressed the formation of primary cilia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). This phenotype was confirmed by Immunostaining of Arl13b, another specific marker for ciliary axoneme (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These results suggested that Cdc20 negatively controls the length of the primary cilium."

Previous studies showed that cell-permeable proTAME efficiently inhibits the APC activity through disruption of the association of APC with its co-activators (<a href=\"#bib34\">Zeng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Zeng and King, 2012</a>). The advantage of small molecule inhibition over RNAi is that proTAME exerts its inhibitory effect immediately after drug treatment, which helps differentiate the ciliary phenotype from the possible secondary effect caused by impaired cell cycle control. The length of preformed cilia was increased from 4\u00b5m to 7\u00b5m after treatment of fully ciliated quiescent cells with proTAME for 3 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), consistent with the Cdc20 knockdown or APC2 knockdown phenotype. Negative Ki-67 staining shows that the ciliated cells are still in quiescent stage after short-term treatment with this drug (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This result supports the view that the activity of APC is required for maintaining the proper length of primary cilia."

To test this hypothesis, we treated serum-starved cells with proTAME when adding serum; serum causes ciliary resorption and subsequent re-entry into the cell cycle. Primary cilia on DMSO-treated control cells significantly shortened and resorbed 4 hr after serum addition. ProTAME treatment delayed the shortening and resorption of cilia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), demonstrating that APC activity is required for efficient ciliary resorption before the exit of cells from quiescent phase. Suppression of either Cdc20 or APC2 by siRNA also significantly delayed ciliary shortening (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Calcium influx is known to be necessary and sufficient for shortening and resorption of the primary cilium (<a href=\"#bib2\">Besschetnova et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Plotnikova et al., 2012</a>), and we found that proTAME treatment also prevented ciliary shortening induced by Calcium ionophore treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A and 2B</a>). Based on these results, APC-Cdc20 at the basal body has two related functions: it maintains cilium length of quiescent cells; it is required for shortening and resorption of the cilium."

Similarly, there should be substrates of APC that might regulate the stability of the ciliary axoneme. Aurora-A, a known APC substrate during late mitosis, plays an important role in regulating disassembly of primary cilium (<a href=\"#bib25\">Pugacheva et al., 2007</a>). We showed that protein levels of Aurora-A do not decrease upon serum stimulation when APC-Cdc20 is activated (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), consistent with the previous report (<a href=\"#bib25\">Pugacheva et al., 2007</a>). This may be explained by previous studies showing that during ciliogenesis, Aurora-A is autophosphorylated at S51 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Plotnikova et al., 2012</a>), which protects it from APC-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Littlepage and Ruderman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Littlepage et al., 2002</a>). Accordingly, the knockdown of Cdc20 in quiescent cells did not affect Aurora-A protein levels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). It was indicated by recent studies that APC may regulate ciliogenesis through degradation of dishevelled protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ganner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Miyamoto et al., 2011</a>). However, both specific ubiquitylation assay and in vitro degradation assay showed that dishevelled is not an authentic substrate of APC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and 1D</a>), contradictory to their argument."

Both human and mouse fibroblast cells with Nek1 mutations have cilia with abnormal branched structures (<a href=\"#bib28\">Shalom et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Thiel et al., 2011</a>). We found that the depletion of endogenous Nek1 by siRNA in serum-starved RPE1 cells generated cilia with branched structures, revealed by acetylated-tubulin staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), indicating that Nek1 controls the stability and integrity of axonemal microtubules. Nek1 knockdown in proliferating RPE1 cells did not affect the structure of either cytoplasmic-acetylated tubulin in microtubules or centrosomal gamma-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), suggesting a specific and confined role of Nek1 in ciliogenesis. After serum addition, the branched structure can still be efficiently resorbed (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), consistent with the dynamics of ciliary disassembly, indicating that the branched structure is ciliary axoneme. We found that Nek1 levels decreased after serum stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggesting that the degradation of Nek1 could be essential for triggering the destabilization of the primary cilium. Finally, Nek1 also has a canonical destruction box (RXXLXXXN), the APC recognition motif, right after its coiled-coil domain. We showed by degradation assays in vitro that Nek1 is degraded in HeLa cell extracts, and that this degradation can be suppressed by Emi1, a specific APC inhibitor protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Nek1 is efficiently ubiquitylated by APC in in vitro ubiquitylation assay involving purified APC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Furthermore, overexpression of Cdc20 leads to reduction of Nek1 levels in quiescent RPE1 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). These results validate Nek1 as an APC substrate. Moreover, simultaneous depletion of Cdc20 and Nek1 partially rescued the branched cilia phenotype caused by Nek1 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that APC-Cdc20 regulates the stability of ciliary axoneme at least in part through antagonizing Nek1 activity."

Impairment of ciliary length control and ciliary assembly can lead to inappropriate cell proliferation and defects in signal transduction, causing ciliopathies and perhaps tumorigenesis. Though more and more is understood about which proteins control ciliary function, much of it through human genetics, much less is known about regulatory features that control the timing of ciliogenesis, and with respect to our work here, ciliary resorption. Surprisingly, some of the machinery for regulation is very similar to that used in regulation of the mitotic cycle, which depends significantly on posttranslational modifications. In particular the mitotic process in cells is controlled from the top by the activation of a kinase, Cdk1-cyclin B and an E3 component of the ubiquitin pathway, APC-Cdc20 and APC-Cdh1. We have found that the same Cdc20 is recruited to the basal body of the primary cilium, where in complex with APC it negatively regulates ciliary length, by destabilizing axonemal microtubules. Following serum stimulation of quiescent cells, APC-Cdc20 is fully activated leading to ciliary shortening and resorption."

They also proposed that APC-Cdh1, but not Cdc20, specifically degrades dishevelled during ciliogenesis. There are several problems with their data and conclusions. We found that Cdc20 is recruited to the basal body of fully formed primary cilia, and there is no evidence for the presence of Cdh1 at the basal body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Knockdown of Cdh1 does not inhibit the assembly of cilia, contradictory to their model (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In addition, depletion of APC subunit (APC2) or treatment of ciliated cells with proTAME, which inhibits APC through promoting dissociation of both Cdc20 and Cdh1, increases (and not decreases) ciliary length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), consistent with the Cdc20 knockdown phenotype. There is no precedent for Cdc20 functioning as an inhibitor of Cdh1 in mitosis. Instead, APC-Cdh1 ubiquitylates Cdc20, leading to its rapid disappearance during anaphase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Pfleger and Kirschner, 2000</a>). Finally, we showed that dishevelled is not an authentic substrate of APC-Cdh1 using both specific ubiquitylation assays and degradation assays in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and 1D</a>). Thus, our data argue against their model and instead point to the role of APC-Cdc20 in negatively regulating ciliogenesis."

Depletion of Nek1 resulted in branched axonemal microtubules. An explanation for this phenotype is that the function of Nek1 is to stabilize axonemal microtubules. Thus, depletion of Nek1 leads to the destabilization and disassembly of axonemal subunits. It would appear that the disassembled axonemal subunits cannot be transported out of cilia efficiently, and instead they are randomly reassembled in the ciliary lumen, resulting in branched and frayed structures. Depletion of Nek1 also results in defects in ciliary signaling, revealed by the absence of Arl13b staining (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This indicates that proper regulation of APC-Cdc20 activity is also essential for normal cellular signaling through primary cilia."

Our preliminary data showed that suppression of Cdk activity increased the ciliary length (unpublished data), consistent with the role of Cdk1 in stimulating APC activity as in mitosis/meiosis. It is also possible that some protein inhibitor of APC is involved in ciliogenesis, regulating the suppression and activation of APC activity during ciliary maintenance and disassembly respectively. It is worthwhile to further dissect the detailed mechanism underlying this process in the future study."

The assembly/disassembly of primary cilium is under strict homeostatic control, and it is responsive to cell cycle regulation. The regulatory apparatus bears great similarities to the posttranslational control in the mitotic cycle. Despite the known presence of many of the same components that were thought to be quintessential components of the mitotic engine, it was not clear that their function bears strong similarities to their use in the cell cycle. Central to mitosis is this is the anaphase-promoting complex and its metaphase/anaphase regulator Cdc20. It acts as a master regulator of downstream kinases and phosphatases but it also targets terminal protein substrates. The primary cilium is thought to be a concentrated signaling system whose length may therefore act as a rheostat controlling a complement of signaling activities in cells. It therefore becomes attractive to think of ways of perturbing ciliary length. As more and more evidence accumulates documenting the connection between defects in ciliogenesis and human diseases, there could be a growing interest need for new therapies that modulate ciliary length and ciliary disassembly. An understanding of the central role of the APC in control of ciliary length could aid in the identification of new drug targets that may have broad applicability."

Using specific inhibitors, siRNAs and over-expression they then show that the APC/Cdc20 complex is required for controlling cilium length, and reabsorption upon serum-induced re-entry into the cell cycle.

However, the cited reference does not indicate this information is contained in the paper. In general, the weakness of the data presented for Nek1 makes it important to examine at least minimally the interaction between Cdc20 and Aurora-A in this study. The authors could test this more directly by show effects of depletion or over-expression of Cdc20 on Aurora-A expression and localization to the basal body</i>."
