Animal models suggest a role for intestinal bacteria in supporting the systemic immune response required for joint inflammation. Here we performed 16S sequencing on 114 stool samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients and controls, and shotgun sequencing on a subset of 44 such samples. We identified the presence of <i>Prevotella copri</i> as strongly correlated with disease in new-onset untreated rheumatoid arthritis (NORA) patients. Increases in <i>Prevotella</i> abundance correlated with a reduction in <i>Bacteroides</i> and a loss of reportedly beneficial microbes in NORA subjects. We also identified unique <i>Prevotella</i> genes that correlated with disease. Further, colonization of mice revealed the ability of <i>P. copri</i> to dominate the intestinal microbiota and resulted in an increased sensitivity to chemically induced colitis. This work identifies a potential role for <i>P. copri</i> in the pathogenesis of RA."

Animal models suggest a role for intestinal bacteria in supporting the systemic immune response required for joint inflammation. Here we performed 16S sequencing on 114 stool samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients and controls, and shotgun sequencing on a subset of 44 such samples. We identified the presence of <i>Prevotella copri</i> as strongly correlated with disease in new-onset untreated rheumatoid arthritis (NORA) patients. Increases in <i>Prevotella</i> abundance correlated with a reduction in <i>Bacteroides</i> and a loss of reportedly beneficial microbes in NORA subjects. We also identified unique <i>Prevotella</i> genes that correlated with disease. Further, colonization of mice revealed the ability of <i>P. copri</i> to dominate the intestinal microbiota and resulted in an increased sensitivity to chemically induced colitis. This work identifies a potential role for <i>P. copri</i> in the pathogenesis of RA."

The microbiota encompasses hundreds of bacterial species whose products represent an enormous antigenic burden that must largely be compartmentalized to prevent immune system activation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Littman and Pamer, 2011</a>). In the healthy state, intestinal lamina propria cells of both innate and adaptive immune systems cooperate to maintain physiological homeostasis. In RA, there is increased production of both self-reactive antibodies and pro-inflammatory T lymphocytes. Although mechanisms for targeting of synovium by inflammatory cells have not been fully elucidated, studies in animal models suggest that both T cell and antibody responses are involved in arthritogenesis. Moreover, an imbalance in the composition of the gut microbiota can alter local T-cell responses and modulate systemic inflammation. Mice rendered deficient for the microbiota (germ-free) lack pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, and colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a commensal microbe commonly found in mammals, is sufficient to induce accumulation of Th17 cells in the lamina propria (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ivanov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sczesnak et al., 2011</a>)."

Upon mono-colonization of arthritis-prone K/BxN mice with SFB, the induced Th17 cells potentiate inflammatory disease (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). An imbalance in intestinal microbial ecology, in which SFB is dominant, may result in reduced proportions or functions of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Treg) and a predisposition towards autoimmunity. This appears to affect not only the local immune response, but also systemic inflammatory processes, and may explain, at least in part, reduced Treg cell function in RA patients (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zanin-Zhorov et al., 2010</a>). Thus, T cells whose functions are dictated by intestinal commensal bacteria can be effectors of pathogenesis in tissue-specific autoimmune disease."

While treatment with antibiotics has been a therapeutic modality in RA for decades, no microbial organism has been shown to be associated with the disease. Based on the discovery that SFB-induced Th17 cells directly contribute to the onset of arthritis in gnotobiotic mice (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wu et al., 2010</a>), we analyzed the fecal microbiota in patients with RA. We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to classify the microbiota in patients with new-onset (untreated) RA, chronic (treated) RA, psoriatic arthritis, and age- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. We found a marked association of <i>Prevotella copri</i> with new-onset RA (NORA) patients and not with other patient groups. Shotgun sequencing of the microbiome indicated that some <i>P. copri</i> genes are differentially present in NORA-associated and healthy samples. Colonization of mice with <i>P. copri</i> enhanced susceptibility to chemical colitis, consistent with a pro-inflammatory potential of this organism. Taken together, our results suggest that NORA-associated <i>P. copri</i> may contribute to the pathogenesis of human arthritis."

Sequences were analyzed with MOTHUR (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schloss et al., 2009</a>) to cluster operational taxonomic units (OTUs, species level classification) at a 97% identity threshold, assign taxonomic identifiers, and calculate clade relative abundances. Although PsA patients revealed a reduction in sample diversity similar to that of IBD patients (<a href=\"#bib27\">Morgan et al., 2012</a>), diversity was comparable between NORA, CRA and healthy groups at 3.02 +/\u2212 0.66 (mean, SD) overall by Shannon Diversity Index (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, when applying Simpson\u2019s Dominance Index, the NORA group was less diverse (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that these patients harbored a relatively higher abundance of common taxa. Analysis at the major taxonomic hierarchy levels showed no significant differences in either phyla abundance or the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) between all groups. At the level of family abundances, however, we noted a significant enrichment of Prevotellaceae in NORA subjects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Using the linear discriminant effect size method (LEfSe, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Segata et al., 2011</a>) to compare detected clades (33 families, 177 genera, 996 OTUs) among all groups, we found a positive association of two specific <i>Prevotella</i> OTUs with NORA and an inverse correlation with Group XIV Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, and <i>Bacteroides</i> as compared to healthy controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Of all detected Prevotellaceae OTUs, OTU4 was the most highly represented with 171,486 supporting reads at 11.49 +/\u2212 17.85 (mean, SD) percent of reads per sample. OTU12, the next most abundant Prevotellaceae, was supported by 12,119 reads at 2.00 +/\u2212 5.42 (mean, SD) percent of reads per sample. Other Prevotellaceae OTUs (including <i>Prevotella</i> OTU934) were more scarcely represented with 1,232 +/\u2212 2,305 (mean, SD) total supporting reads at less than 0.5% total reads per sample. We therefore reasoned that OTU4 was the dominant <i>Prevotella</i> in our cohort with sixfold more supporting reads than the next most abundant OTU. Principal coordinate analysis with Bray-Curtis distances demonstrated that subjects form distinct clusters, irrespective of health or disease status (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The largest component of microbial variation corresponded to the carriage (or absence) of <i>Prevotella</i>, which significantly differentiated NORA subjects from healthy controls and other forms of arthritis. Consistent with other reports of either high <i>Prevotella</i> or high <i>Bacteroides</i> relative abundance, but rarely a high relative abundance of both, (<a href=\"#bib12\">Faust et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</a>), we found segregation of <i>Prevotella</i> or <i>Bacteroides</i> dominance in the intestinal microbiome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

The analysis revealed these OTUs to cluster tightly with <i>Prevotella copri</i>, a microbe isolated from human feces (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hayashi et al., 2007</a>) and sequenced as part of the HMP\u2019s reference genome initiative. To further characterize <i>Prevotella</i> OTU4, the most abundant taxon, we selected four high abundance NORA samples (028B, 030B, 061B, and 089B) for shotgun sequencing (single-end, 454 platform). The resulting long reads were used to generate metagenomic assemblies (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) which served as input to PhyloPhlAn (<a href=\"#bib40\">Segata et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, PhyloPhlAn locates 400 ubiquitous bacterial genes in a given assembly by sequence alignment in amino acid space, then builds a tree by concatenating the most discriminative positions in each gene into a single long sequence and applying FastTree (<a href=\"#bib29\">Price et al., 2010</a>), a standard tree reconstruction tool. This produced a phylogenomic tree placing the taxon most represented in each sample\u2019s metagenomic contigs (i.e., <i>Prevotella</i> OTU4) again in close association with <i>Prevotella copri</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)<i>.</i> We therefore chose to filter the resulting metagenomic assemblies by alignment to the <i>P. copri</i> reference genome to generate draft patient-derived genome assemblies (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Comparison of these draft assemblies to reference <i>P. copri</i> and to one another revealed a high degree of similarity, with possible genome rearrangements (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

This observation suggested that the presence or absence of particular genes in these strains might correlate with health or disease phenotypes in this cohort. To address this question, we performed shotgun sequencing on fecal DNA from NORA and healthy subjects, and chose to compare <i>Prevotella</i> sequences from 18 NORA <i>Prevotella-</i>positive subjects, which allowed for a depth of at least 7 M <i>Prevotella-</i>aligned reads (paired-end, 100 nt, Illumina platform), to those of <i>P. copri</i> from 17 healthy subjects (including 15 from the HMP database and 2 HLT from our cohort) (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Samples sequenced to a depth of less than 7 M such reads were excluded (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), having insufficient depth for complete recovery of <i>P. copri</i> ORFs (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

Overall, coverage was similar between healthy and NORA subjects in all but a few regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, blue and red horizontal lines). Eight regions were poorly covered in all subjects with mean coverage below the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of 0.79 FPKM, while several regions showed substantial variability between individuals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, gray vertical lines). To determine if the presence or absence of these regions within individuals was consistent between samplings, we applied MetaPhlAn (<a href=\"#bib42\">Segata et al., 2012</a>) to <i>Prevotella</i>-positive HMP samples collected over multiple visits (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Briefly, MetaPhlAn determines the presence or absence of metagenomic marker genes that are specific to particular bacterial clades by analyzing the coverage of such genes by sequenced reads. Genes are called specific for a bacterial clade if they are not found in any reference genomes outside the clade, but are found in all such genomes within the clade. In concordance with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schloissnig et al., 2013</a>) documenting the temporal stability of metagenomic SNP patterns in individuals, we found that carriage of <i>P. copri</i> genes within an individual varied little between samplings. In addition to a stable set of <i>P. copri</i> core marker genes common to all samples, a subset of variable marker genes was observed to co-occur in islands across the <i>P. copri</i> genome, suggesting genomic rearrangements as a mechanism of variability (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, blue boxes below plot). Together, these results suggest that <i>P. copri</i> strains vary between individuals and retain their individuality over time."

Notably, there is a prolonged period of autoimmunity (i.e., presence of circulating auto-antibodies such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies) in a pre-clinical state that lasts many years, during which time there is no clinical or histologic evidence of inflammatory arthritis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Deane et al., 2010</a>). Before the onset of clinical disease, there is an increase in autoantibody titers and epitope spreading coupled with elevation in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings have led to the \u2018second-event\u2019 hypothesis in RA, which proposes that an environmental factor triggers systemic joint inflammation in the context of pre-existent autoimmunity. Multiple mucosal sites and their residing microbial communities have been implicated, including the airways, the periodontal tissue and the intestinal lamina propria (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mcinnes and Schett, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Scher et al., 2012</a>)."

The human gut microbiota has been classified into unique enterotypes, one of which is defined by the predominance of <i>Prevotella</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arumugam et al., 2011</a>). In our cohort, we found the microbiota of many subjects to be defined by a single taxon\u2014<i>P. copri</i>\u2014which was associated with the majority of untreated, new-onset rheumatoid arthritis (NORA) patients. <i>P. copri</i> was also detected in a minority of healthy subjects in cohorts from the Human Microbiome Project (<a href=\"#bib18\">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</a>), the European MetaHIT project (<a href=\"#bib31\">Qin et al., 2010</a>), and our study. Surprisingly, the prevalence of <i>P. copri</i> in chronic rheumatoid arthritis (CRA) patients, all of whom had been treated and exhibited reduced disease activity, was similar to that observed in the healthy subjects. One hypothesis is that the <i>Prevotella-</i>defined microbiota fail to thrive when there is less inflammation, perhaps due to a lack of inflammation-derived terminal electron acceptors, as seen for <i>E. coli</i> in inflammatory bowel disease (<a href=\"#bib49\">Winter et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively, the gut microbiota changes observed in newly diagnosed RA patients may be the consequence of a unique, NORA-specific systemic inflammatory response. While DAS28 scores were slightly lower in CRA and PsA patients (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), the most remarkable difference was in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). This raises the question of whether CRP itself may have microbial modulating properties. CRP is characteristically high in early and flaring RA, but not in other autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematous, scleroderma, and PsA). A member of the pentraxin protein family, CRP was first identified in the plasma of patients with <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tillett and Francis, 1930</a>). Further, the primary bacterial ligand for CRP is phosphocholine, a component of multiple bacterial cell-wall components, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS). CRP binding to bacterial phosphocholine activates the complement system and enhances phagocytosis by macrophages. Whether or not CRP itself represents a specific response to the presence of <i>P. copri</i> in NORA is an area of future investigation. Interestingly, <i>Prevotella</i>-dominated healthy omnivore individuals were recently reported to have increased basal levels of serum TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), a product of inflammation linked to atherogenesis, compared to <i>Bacteroides</i>-dominated healthy individuals (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koeth et al., 2013</a>). While TMAO could be derived from increased consumption of meat (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koeth et al., 2013</a>), <i>Prevotella</i> has been previously associated with a dearth of meat in the diet (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). Additional studies are needed to determine if prevalence of <i>P. copri</i> in the microbiota is associated with changes in specific metabolites."

Interestingly, large regions of the <i>P. copri</i> genome were scarcely covered in both our cohort and subjects of the HMP. As the reference strain of <i>P. copri</i> was isolated in Japan and all samples analyzed in our study were collected and sequenced in North America, these differences may reflect geographically-associated strain variability, consistent with a report ranking <i>P. copri</i> as the second-most variable member of the human gut microbiota between continents (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schloissnig et al., 2013</a>). Notably, comparison of sequences in NORA samples with those of <i>P. copri</i>-dominated healthy individuals evaluated in the HMP allowed us to identify ORFs associated with the NORA phenotype. Two ORFs, both encoding components of an iron transporter, were specific for NORA-associated <i>P. copri</i>, while two ORFs were specific for HLT-associated <i>P. copri</i> and encode components of a <i>nuo</i> operon. Iron transporters are known to be virulence factors in other bacterial clades, while the ubiquinone oxidoreductase pathway encoded by the <i>nuo</i> operon may provide a fitness advantage in the context of a healthy microbiome by allowing use of metabolites available therein. While colonization with <i>P. copri</i> increases the pre-test probability of NORA from 1% to approximately 3.95% in western cohorts (by Bayes\u2019 theorem, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), the presence of one of the aforementioned ORFs may markedly increase the pre-test probability of NORA status. The diagnostic application of these biomarkers needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts."

The THF biosynthetic pathway encoded by the gut metagenome, which includes a DHF reductase enzyme, may compete with host DHF reductase for MTX binding and metabolism. If so, an increase in DHF reductase-high microbiota in some RA subjects (i.e., <i>Bacteroides</i> overabundant) may help explain, at least partially, why only about half of RA patients respond adequately to oral MTX, ultimately requiring either parenteral administration or the addition of complementary immunosuppressants. <i>Prevotella</i>-high NORA subjects, with a dearth of DHF reductase in the gut, may respond better to oral MTX. Prospective human studies should help to clarify these observations."

A recently published study with HLA-DR transgenic mice revealed that the gut microbiota was, at least partially, regulated by the HLA genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gomez et al., 2012</a>). Arthritis-susceptible DRB1*04:01 transgenic mice had a markedly different intestinal microbiota when compared to arthritis-resistant DRB1*04:02 animals, and this was associated with altered mucosal immune function (i.e., increased gene transcripts for Th17-related cytokines) and increased intestinal permeability. Our results suggest that, similarly, SE risk-alleles in humans may have an impact on the composition of the gut microbiota. Intriguingly, patients in the NORA cohort showed a significant inverse correlation between <i>P. copri</i> relative abundance and presence of SE alleles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). It is therefore possible that, as in mice, certain human gut microbial communities are determined by specific MHC alleles that favor the expansion of particular species. As in the case of cigarette smoking, this could also represent a gene-environment interaction that contributes to RA pathogenesis. It is conceivable that a certain threshold for <i>P. copri</i> abundance may be necessary to overcome the lack of genetic predisposition in RA subjects, while a lower abundance may be sufficient to trigger disease in those carrying risk-alleles. Validation in expanded cohorts and mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the significance of these findings."

This shift in abundances correlated with a metagenomic shift, which may support and/or perpetuate an inflammatory environment. For example, uniquely present superoxide reductase in <i>P. copri</i> may facilitate resistance to or allow the use of host-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during inflammation, perhaps as terminal electron acceptors for respiration (<a href=\"#bib49\">Winter et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, the <i>P. copri</i> genome encodes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase (PAPS), an oxidoreductase absent in <i>Bacteroides</i> that participates in sulfur metabolism and leads to the production of thioredoxin. Intriguingly, thioredoxin has been widely implicated in the pathogenesis of RA and high levels of this redox protein have been found in both serum and synovial fluid of RA patients (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maurice et al., 1999</a>)."

Further characterization of changes in the host immune system associated with a <i>Prevotella</i>-dominated microbiota should provide deeper insight into whether expansion of <i>P. copri</i> contributes causally to the development of autoimmunity in early onset RA."

Sequences shorter than 200 bp, containing undetermined bases or homopolymer stretches longer than 8 bp, with no exact match to the forward primer or a barcode, or that did not align with the appropriate 16S rRNA variable region were not included in the analysis. Using the 454 base quality scores, which range from 0\u201340 (0 being an ambiguous base), sequences were trimmed using a sliding-window technique, such that the minimum average quality score over a window of 50 bases never dropped below 30. Sequences were trimmed from the 3\u2032-end until this criterion was met. Sequences were aligned to the 16S rRNA gene, using as template the SILVA reference alignment (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pruesse et al., 2007</a>), and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with the default scoring options. Potentially chimeric sequences were removed using the ChimeraSlayer program (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haas et al., 2011</a>). To minimize the effect of pyrosequencing errors in overestimating microbial diversity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Huse et al., 2010</a>), rare abundance sequences that differ in one or two nucleotides from a high abundance sequence were merged to the high abundance sequence using the pre.cluster option in MOTHUR. Sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the average neighbor algorithm. Sequences with distance-based similarity of 97% or greater were assigned to the same OTU. OTU-based microbial diversity was estimated by calculating the Shannon diversity index and Simpson Index using <i>mothur</i>. Phylogenetic classification was performed for each sequence using the Bayesian classifier algorithm described by Wang and colleagues with the bootstrap cutoff 60% (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2007</a>)."

Vectors resulting from the comparison of abundances (e.g., <i>Prevotella</i> relative abundance) between groups are used as input to linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which produces an effect size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In analyses performed here, the main utility of LEfSe over traditional statistical tests is that an effect size is produced in addition to a p or q value. This allows us to sort the results of multiple tests by the magnitude of the difference between groups, not only by q values, as the two are not necessarily correlated. In the case of hierarchically organized groups (e.g., bacterial clades, or KEGG pathways), this lack of correlation can arise from differences in the number of hypotheses considered at different levels in the hierarchy. For example, at the genus level, there may be 1,000 tests performed, requiring a high level of significance to pass multiple testing correction, whereas at the phylum level, only 10 tests may be performed, requiring a less stringent threshold for significance."

The threshold can be viewed as the percentage of biomarkers that are likely to be false positives. Given the number of hits returned in this analysis (i.e., 19), we expect only 4.75 to be false positives, with a great majority expected to be true. In exploratory analyses such as the one we conducted for this paper, a higher FDR threshold is often used\u2014for example, the popular GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) software uses an FDR cutoff of 0.25 by default (<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545\">http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545</a>).

While it is difficult to devise a statistical test for such a situation, biological intuition suggests that these may be meaningful.

In fact, during the study design phase, we have discussed at length which disease would represent the most appropriate control group/s, specifically to address systemic inflammation as a possible modulator of the gut microbiome. In our study, NORA samples had (as expected) overall higher disease activity scores, reflecting untreated RA. In order to address \u201cinflammation\u201d as a confounder, we have included two reasonable positive control groups. CRA samples in our study have, by inclusion criteria, longer disease duration and have been under various treatment regimens at the time of enrollment. We have also enrolled recent-onset, mostly untreated PsA samples as our second control group. In both cases, as reflected in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, disease activity scores were slightly lower than those found in the NORA group. Although we believe this comparison addresses the issue of systemic inflammation as modulator of gut microbiome, it is still possible that microbiota changes observed in newly diagnosed RA patients represent rather a consequence of a unique, NORA-specific systemic inflammatory response. A paragraph has now been included discussing this alternative possibility. A second, related issue that requires further investigation is the role of CRP in the modulation of microbiota. Importantly, while DAS28 scores were slightly lower in CRA and PsA patients, the most remarkable difference was found in levels of CRP. It is particularly intriguing to us whether CRP itself may have microbial modulating properties. CRP is synthesized by the liver in response to factors released by macrophages and adipocytes. It is a member of the pentraxin protein family and was first identified in the plasma of patients with <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> infection and it was named according to its ability to precipitate the somatic C-fraction of the pneumococcal cell wall. Curiously, CRP was the first pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to be identified. The primary bacterial ligand for CRP is now recognized to be phosphocholine, a component of several bacterial cell wall structures. The physiological role of CRP consists in binding phosphocholine and the activation of the complement system leading to phagocytosis. Interestingly, and unlike many other autoimmune diseases (such as Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE), scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis and PsA), CRP is characteristically high in RA. Whether or not CRP itself represents a specific response to the presence of <i>P. copri</i> or other taxa is an area of future investigation. We have now added a paragraph addressing the reviewers\u2019 comments."

Certain alleles within the HLA Class II locus confer higher risk for disease, in particular those belonging to DRB1 (i.e., shared epitope, or SE, alleles). However, genetic variance can only explain 20-30% of the cases. To address reviewers\u2019 points, we have now included HLA-sequencing data. Indeed, consistent with recently published mouse data, the presence of SE risk-alleles seems to have an impact in the composition of gut microbiota. Our NORA cohort shows a significant inverse correlation between <i>P. copri</i> relative abundance and presence of shared epitope alleles. Intriguingly, a subgroup analysis of NORA patients according to presence/absence of SE alelles, revealed a significantly higher relative abundance of <i>P. copri</i> in those subjects lacking predisposing genes (P&lt;0.001). It is possible therefore that, as in mice, microbiota abundance correlates with certain MHC alleles that favor an expansion of specific taxa. This could also represent a gene\u2013environmental interaction for RA incidence, as reported for other factors such as smoking. Although we cannot prove causation, it is conceivable that a certain threshold of <i>P. copri</i> abundance may be necessary to overcome the lack of genetic predisposition in RA subjects, while a lower abundance may be sufficient to trigger disease in those carrying risk-alleles. Validation in expanded cohorts and mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the significance of these findings.
