Mutp53 proteins often accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF. Its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we found that BAG2, a protein of Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family, promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors. Mechanistically, BAG2 binds to mutp53 and translocates to the nucleus to inhibit the MDM2-mutp53 interaction, and MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53. Thus, BAG2 promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in tumors. BAG2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients and mutp53 accumulation in tumors. These findings revealed a novel and important mechanism for mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors, and also uncovered an important role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis through promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOF."

Mutp53 proteins often accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF. Its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we found that BAG2, a protein of Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family, promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors. Mechanistically, BAG2 binds to mutp53 and translocates to the nucleus to inhibit the MDM2-mutp53 interaction, and MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53. Thus, BAG2 promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in tumors. BAG2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients and mutp53 accumulation in tumors. These findings revealed a novel and important mechanism for mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors, and also uncovered an important role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis through promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOF."

Trp53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors; it is mutated in over 50% of all tumors. Majority of Trp53 mutations are missense mutations that are localized in the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD), including several mutational hotspots in tumors (e.g., R175, R248, and R273) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harris and Hollstein, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Muller and Vousden, 2014</a>). Many tumor-associated mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins not only lose the tumor suppressive function of wild-type p53 (wtp53), but also gain new oncogenic activities independently of wtp53, which is defined as mutp53 gain-of-function (GOF) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Muller and Vousden, 2014</a>).

At the same time, as a direct transcriptional target of p53, MDM2 is up-regulated by p53 under both non-stressed and stressed conditions. Thus, p53 and MDM2 forms a negative feedback loop to tightly regulate p53 protein levels in cells. However, mutp53 proteins often become stable and accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis and contributes greatly to tumor progression (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oren and Rotter, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Muller and Vousden, 2013</a>). It had long been thought that the inability of MDM2 to degrade mutp53 was the main cause for mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors. However, recent studies from mice with knock-in of R172H or R270H mutp53 (equivalent to human R175H and R273H mutp53, respectively) challenged this concept. Mutp53 protein is kept at low levels in normal tissues but accumulates to very high levels in tumors (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Olive et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, loss of MDM2 in mutp53 knock-in mice leads to mutp53 protein accumulation in normal tissues, which in turn promotes tumor development (<a href=\"#bib40\">Terzian et al., 2008</a>). Recent studies including ours also showed that MDM2 retains the ability to degrade mutp53 in in vitro cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lukashchuk and Vousden, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). These results strongly suggest that while MDM2 maintains mutp53 protein levels low in normal tissues, the disruption of MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation in tumors could be a main cause for the frequently observed mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors. Currently, the mechanism underlying the disruption of MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation in tumors is poorly understood. Destabilizing mutp53 to inhibit mutp53 GOF is being actively tested as a novel and promising strategy for cancer therapy. Understanding the underlying mechanism for mutp53 accumulation is critical for the development of novel targets and strategies for cancer therapy."

BAG2 belongs to the Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family, which is characterized by the BAG domain. As a group of multifunctional proteins, BAG proteins interact with a variety of proteins and take part in diverse cellular processes, including cell division, cell death and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Takayama and Reed, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kabbage and Dickman, 2008</a>). Currently, the role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis and its underlying mechanism are poorly understood. We found that mutp53 binds to BAG2 and promotes the nuclear translocation of BAG2. The BAG2-mutp53 interaction in the nucleus inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53 mediated by MDM2, and thereby promotes mutp53 accumulation and mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. Knockdown of BAG2 greatly decreases mutp53 protein levels in tumors and compromises mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in various types of human tumors. BAG2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients and mutp53 accumulation in tumors. These results revealed a novel and critical mechanism for mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors, and strongly suggest that BAG2 is a potential target for therapy in tumors carrying mutp53. Our results also uncovered an important role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis and revealed that promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOF is a novel mechanism for BAG2 in tumorigenesis."

BAG2 contains a BAG domain (amino acids 91\u2013211) at the C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2005</a>). The fragments containing the BAG domain interacted with mutp53 while the N-terminus of BAG2 protein lacking the BAG domain did not interact with mutp53 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Interestingly, the binding of mutp53 to the BAG2 fragment which lacks the N-terminus is much weaker compared with the full length (FL) BAG2 protein. It is possible that the N-terminus of BAG2 has an additional role for efficient BAG2-mutp53 complex formation although itself does not directly interact with mutp53. These results demonstrate that mutp53 DBD and BAG domain of BAG2 are essential for the BAG2-mutp53 interaction."

Here, we investigated whether BAG2 promotes mutp53 protein accumulation through the inhibition of mutp53 protein ubiquitination and degradation. Since endogenous BAG2 expression levels are relatively higher in Saos2 and HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/\u2212</sup> cells compared with H1299 cells as determined at the RNA and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), experiments with knockdown of endogenous BAG2 were performed by using Saos2 and HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/\u2212</sup> cells, and experiments with ectopic BAG2 expression were performed by using H1299 cells. We found that blocking proteasomal degradation by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely abolished the effect of BAG2 knockdown on mutp53 protein levels in HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/\u2212</sup>, Saos2-R175H, Saos2-R248W and Saos2-R273H cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Ectopic expression of MDM2 clearly down-regulated mutp53 R175H in H1299 cells co-transfected with vectors expressing mutp53 R175H and MDM2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which is consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lukashchuk and Vousden, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). Notably, co-expression of BAG2 largely reduced the degradation of mutp53 protein mediated by MDM2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Consistently, knockdown of endogenous MDM2 clearly increased mutp53 protein levels in Saoa2-R175H cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Notably, the effect of BAG2 knockdown on mutp53 protein levels was greatly reduced in cells with MDM2 knockdown, indicating that the effect of BAG2 knockdown on mutp53 protein levels is largely mediated by MDM2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). MDM2 directly binds to mutp53 to negatively regulate mutp53. Co-expression of BAG2 clearly decreased the interaction of MDM2 with mutp53 in H1299 cells, which could be an important mechanism by which BAG2 inhibits MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

                                "text": "It has been reported that BAG2 proteins were mainly localized in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, in H1299 cells with ectopic expression of BAG2 alone, BAG2 proteins were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as determined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Interestingly, we found that mutp53 promoted BAG2 nuclear translocation; ectopic expression of mutp53 (R175H, R248W and R273H), which is mainly localized in the nucleus, clearly increased the translocation of BAG2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cells transfected with vectors expressing BAG2 together with mutp53. Furthermore, BAG2 was largely co-localized with mutp53 in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, ectopic expression of wtp53, which is also mainly localized in the nucleus, did not have an obvious effect on BAG2 nuclear translocation in cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The effect of mutp53 on BAG2 nuclear translocation was also confirmed by Western blot assays using whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts isolated from H1299 cells transfected with BAG2 vectors alone or together with mutp53 vectors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Both mutp53 and MDM2 proteins contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and are mainly localized in the nucleus, where MDM2 binds to and ubiquitinates mutp53 protein. The translocation of BAG2 to the nucleus where it interacts with mutp53 may play an important role in blocking MDM2 to bind to and degrade mutp53. To test this possibility, we constructed the vector expressing the NLS mutant of mutp53 R175H (mutp53<sup>NLS</sup>) by mutating Lys305, Arg306, Lys319, Lys320 and Lys321 to Ala as reported (<a href=\"#bib33\">O'Keefe et al., 2003</a>). Unlike mutp53 proteins which were mainly localized in the nucleus, mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> proteins were mainly localized in the cytoplasm as shown by IF staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). While mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> readily interacted with BAG2 as determined by co-IP assays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> could not promote the nuclear translocation of BAG2. BAG2 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm in H1299 co-transfected with vectors expressing BAG2 and mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Notably, ectopic expression of MDM2 showed a limited effect on degradation of mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> protein compared with mutp53 (R175H) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Furthermore, co-expression of BAG2 had no obvious effect on mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> protein levels in cells co-transfected with expression vectors of BAG2, mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> and MDM2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These results strongly suggest that mutp53 promotes BAG2 nuclear localization and the BAG2-mutp53 interaction in the nucleus inhibits MDM2-mediated mutp53 protein degradation."

Chemoresistance is one of the most important mutp53 GOFs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Napoli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Masciarelli et al., 2014</a>). 5-flurorouracil (5-FU), which can induce apoptosis in cells, is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for a wide variety of human cancers. 5-FU induced less apoptosis in Saos2-R175H, Saos2-R248W and Saos2-R273H cells compared with Saos2-Con cells as determined by Annexin V staining and the levels of cleaved Caspase 3 protein, demonstrating that mutp53 promotes chemoresistance, which is consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib32\">Napoli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Masciarelli et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>).

Compared with p53-null cells (Saos2-Con and HCT116 p53<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells), mutp53 (R175H, R248W and R273H in Saos2 cells and R248W in HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/\u2212</sup> cells) promoted migration of cells as determined by transwell assays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

While wtp53 proteins are kept at low levels in normal tissues under normal conditions, mutp53 proteins often accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Terzian et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Oren and Rotter, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Muller and Vousden, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). Currently, the mechanism for mutp53 accumulation in tumors is poorly understood. Results from mouse genetic experiments with knockout of MDM2 in mutp53 mice and cell-based in vitro experiments suggest that MDM2 maintains mutp53 protein levels low in normal tissues, whereas some changes occurred in tumors disrupt MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation, thereby leading to mutp53 accumulation. Recent studies have reported that HSP90 can bind to mutp53 and reduce mutp53 degradation mediated by MDM2. Knockdown of HSP90 by siRNA or blocking HDAC6-HSP90 axis by SAHA induced destabilization of mutp53 and inhibited its GOF in tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2011b</a>). Our recent study showed that tumor-derived MDM2 short isoforms inhibited full-length MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation, which promoted mutp53 accumulation and enhanced GOF in tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we searched for the changes that occurred in tumors to disrupt MDM2-meidated mutp53 degradation by screening for mutp53 binding protein in tumors from mutp53 knock-in mice. Results from this study identified that BAG2 is a novel mutp53 binding protein that promotes mutp53 protein accumulation, which revealed a novel mechanism for mutp53 accumulation in tumor cells."

The BAG domain is a conserved region located at the C-terminus of the BAG-family proteins that binds to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and has general nucleotide exchange activities towards Hsc70 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Takayama and Reed, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kabbage and Dickman, 2008</a>). Therefore, proteins containing the BAG domain often functions as a co-chaperone protein. Aside from the formation of the BAG-Hsc70 interaction, BAG proteins functionally interact with many proteins to regulate cellular functions. The expression of BAG2 has been detected in many tissues. Recently, it was reported that BAG2 interacts with and stabilizes PINK1 and ataxin3-80Q, proteins involved in neurological diseases, through inhibiting their ubiquitination and degradation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Che et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2014</a>). BAG2 can also deliver Tau to the proteasome for protein degradation independently of ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carrettiero et al., 2009</a>). In this study, we found that BAG2 preferentially binds to mutp53 at the DBD domain. BAG2 can interact with many different mutp53, including several tumor-associated mutational hotspots. This BAG2-mutp53 interaction is conserved in both human tumor cells and mouse tissues. It is unclear how BAG2 can discriminate between the DBD of a diverse range of mutp53 proteins and wtp53. BAG2 is a co-chaperone protein. It is possible that conformational changes of mutp53 proteins lead to its association with chaperone and co-chaperone proteins. It remains unclear whether BAG2 interacts with mutp53 directly or interacts with mutp53 through other protein, such as Hsc70, which will be of interest to investigate in future studies."

Considering that BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells, our findings revealed a new and important mechanism for mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors. Trp53 is the most frequently-mutated gene in tumors. Mutp53 protein is frequently accumulated in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF in tumor development.

Expression vectors of mutp53 fragments containing different domains were obtained by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce R175H mutation into expression vectors of wtp53 fragments containing different domains, which were generous gifts from Dr Xinbin Chen at University of California, Davis. R175H mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> expression vectors were obtained by using site-directed mutagenesis. Primers used for site mutagenesis and cloning for mutp53 fragments, Flag-tagged FL BAG2 and BAG2 fragments are listed in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. Retroviral shRNA vectors against human BAG2 were purchased from Open Biosystems (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat#V2LHS-27769). Two different siRNA oligos against MDM2 were purchased from Qiagen (Germantown, MD, Cat#SI00300846) and Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, Cat#M-003279-01). Two different siRNA oligos against BAG2 were purchased from IDT (Coralville, Iowa). siRNA targeting BAG2: siRNA-1: 5\u2032-GUU GGC UUU AGC GUU GAU CUU CGC CUG-3\u2032; siRNA-2: 5\u2032-GUG UCA GUA GAA ACA AUU AGA AAC C-3\u2032. 5-FU and MG132 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO)."

Previously, it was believed that because mutant p53 does not transactivate its ubiquitin ligase MDM2, the level of mutant p53 in cells is very high. However, two groups created mutant p53 knock-in mice, and failed to see high levels of mutant p53 in tissues from these mice, only in tumors, thus dispelling this hypothesis. Yue and colleagues solve this issue, and this is a very significant finding, not just for the p53 field, but for the field of cancer, as mutant p53 is known to contribute to tumor aggressiveness in many ways."

Importantly, they show that BAG2 is translocated to the nucleus by mutant, but not wtp53, and that silencing BAG2 destabilizes mutant p53 by removing the ability of BAG2 to inhibit interaction between mutant p53 and MDM2. In an elegant series of experiments, the authors show that silencing BAG2 inhibits the \u201cgain of function\u201d activity of mutant p53 (resistance to 5FU, migration and metastasis), and further they show that silencing BAG2 inhibits the development of tumors with mutant p53, but not null for p53.

The reviewers provided a very good suggestion to carefully analyze the BAG2-mutp53 interaction in normal tissues from mutp53<sup>R172H/R172H</sup> expressing mice. We re-analyzed the raw data for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. We observed lower levels of mutp53 protein and weak interaction between BAG2 and mutp53 in normal thymus tissues from mutp53<sup>R172H/R172H</sup> expressing mice after longer exposure.
