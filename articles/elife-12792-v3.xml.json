Cell-based studies demonstrated that these mutants confer ER\u03b1 constitutive activity and antiestrogen resistance and suggest that ligand-binding domain dysfunction leads to endocrine therapy resistance. Here, we integrate biophysical and structural biology data to reveal how these mutations lead to a constitutively active and antiestrogen-resistant ER\u03b1. We show that these mutant ERs recruit coactivator in the absence of hormone while their affinities for estrogen agonist (estradiol) and antagonist (4-hydroxytamoxifen) are reduced. Further, they confer antiestrogen resistance by altering the conformational dynamics of the loop connecting Helix 11 and Helix 12 in the ligand-binding domain of ER\u03b1, which leads to a stabilized agonist state and an altered antagonist state that resists inhibition."

Cell-based studies demonstrated that these mutants confer ER\u03b1 constitutive activity and antiestrogen resistance and suggest that ligand-binding domain dysfunction leads to endocrine therapy resistance. Here, we integrate biophysical and structural biology data to reveal how these mutations lead to a constitutively active and antiestrogen-resistant ER\u03b1. We show that these mutant ERs recruit coactivator in the absence of hormone while their affinities for estrogen agonist (estradiol) and antagonist (4-hydroxytamoxifen) are reduced. Further, they confer antiestrogen resistance by altering the conformational dynamics of the loop connecting Helix 11 and Helix 12 in the ligand-binding domain of ER\u03b1, which leads to a stabilized agonist state and an altered antagonist state that resists inhibition."

These mutations make the receptor resistant to antiestrogen drugs, and two mutations (called Y537S and D538G) account for approximately 70% of cases.

Inhibiting the action of ER\u03b1 with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), or reducing endogenous estrogen levels with aromatase inhibitors (AI), are effective treatments for many of these breast cancers (<a href=\"#bib45\">Strasser-Weippl and Goss, 2005</a>). Due to their efficacy and broad therapeutic indices, antiestrogens can be administered sequentially for progressive disease over the course of several years (<a href=\"#bib47\">Toy et al., 2013</a>). Unfortunately, despite continued expression of ER\u03b1, the majority of metastatic breast cancers that initially respond to endocrine therapies become refractory."

Approximately 25% of patients who previously received SERM/SERD/AI treatments for an average of five years presented with conserved somatic mutations that were not identified in primary (untreated) tumors. The most prevalent ER\u03b1 point mutations were Y537S and D538G, while several others were identified at significantly reduced frequencies. Importantly, breast cancer cell-based studies revealed that the Y537S and D538G mutations conferred hormone-independent activation of ER\u03b1 and reduced the inhibitory potency and efficacy of clinically prescribed SERMs and SERDs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Toy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Merenbakh-Lamin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Carlson et al., 1997</a>). Notably, the constitutive activity and antagonist resistance of the Y537S and E380Q mutations were first described in cell models in 1996 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Weis et al.,1996</a>), and shortly thereafter, the Y537N mutation was found in a clinical sample of metastatic breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zhang et al., 1997</a>).

Structurally, ER\u03b1 LBD is an \u03b1-helical bundle, with the C-terminal helix, H12, functioning as a key structural component of the activating function-2 (AF-2) cleft that governs the agonist or antagonist state of the receptor. In the agonist conformation (e.g. estradiol (E2)-bound), H12 covers the ligand-binding pocket, docking between Helices 3 (H3) and 11 (H11), thereby facilitating coactivator recruitment to the AF-2 cleft via canonical LXXLL coactivator sequence motifs. In contrast, in the antagonist state (e.g.SERM-bound), H12 occupies the AF-2 cleft using its own LXXML sequence, thereby blocking coactivator recruitment and ER\u03b1 action."

Additionally, x-ray crystal structures and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations uncover altered conformations adopted by the mutant receptors in the absence and presence of agonists and antagonists. Together, these findings present a molecular explanation for how the Y537S and D538G mutations elevate the basal or constitutive activity of ER\u03b1 and confer resistance to the beneficial effects of the SERM, SERD, and AI therapies. A comprehensive understanding of how these and other gain-of-function mutations alter the structure and function of ER\u03b1 is crucial to development of more efficacious and potent inhibitors to target these mutant receptors in the clinic."

TOT abolished basal Y537S and D538G SRC3 binding in the absence of agonist. To mimic this reversal in WT, which does not bind SRC3 NRD without ligand, a low concentration of E2 was added to WT-ER to recruit SRC3 NRD to about 50% of maximal (data not shown). As expected, titration of TOT reversed the binding of SRC3 NRD by the mutant ER and E2-primed WT.

Perturbation in time-dependent deuterium uptake profiles (measured as protection to number of exchanged amide hydrogens with solvent deuterium between two states) is indicative of conformational alterations due to rearrangement of amide hydrogen bonds (<a href=\"#bib14\">Horn et al., 2006</a>). Differential amide HDX experiments were performed to compare the conformational dynamics of liganded and unliganded (<i>apo</i>) receptors. H11, the H11-12 loop, and H12 were all protected from solvent exchange for WT, D538G, and Y537S ER\u03b1 LBD in the presence of E2 as compared to <i>apo</i> receptor (solvent exchange was lower for peptides containing these structural elements in the presence of ligand as compared to unliganded receptor), indicating the adoption of a more stable agonist-bound conformation matching that observed in x-ray co-crystal structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4s3\">3</a>). For the unliganded states, the H12 of Y537S and D538G exhibited increased solvent exchange (deprotection indicative of increased conformational dynamics) compared to WT ER\u03b1, suggesting that the mutant receptors adopt an alternative H12 conformation in the absence of E2. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a> shows differential deuterium incorporation for the WT versus mutant ER\u03b1 LBD in the <i>apo</i> states focusing on the H11-12 loop and H12 regions. <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 4</a> and 5 show the complete differential HDX perturbation maps comparing the <i>apo</i> WT versus <i>apo</i> Y537S and D538G ER\u03b1 LBD, respectively. Interestingly, residues close in space to or within the AF-2 cleft (positions 310\u2013325, 344\u2013349, 370\u2013380, and 405\u2013410) of the <i>apo</i> Y537S also showed statistically significant increase in solvent exchange compared to <i>apo</i> WT. Similar deprotection was observed in residues 310\u2013325 of the <i>apo</i> D538G. Together, the HDX data suggests that the Y537S and D538G mutants enables H12 to sample a suite of conformations that expose the AF-2 cleft at a greater frequency thereby facilitating coregulator recruitment in the absence of hormone. Furthermore, these data suggest that the Y537S mutant possesses a higher affinity for SRC3 as compared to D538G as it samples more frequently AF-2-cleft conformers that facilitate coregulator binding, in agreement with our in vitroSRC3 NRD-binding experiments."

Few statistically significant differences in solvent exchange were observed in the C-terminus of LBD when the WT ER\u03b1 LBD was incubated with saturating concentrations of SRC3 NRD, with the exception of H11 (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). In contrast, the H11-12 loop showed statistically significant protection from exchange in the Y537S-SRC3 NRD complex, indicating that the region in the Y537S mutant was further stabilized by the inclusion of coregulator (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). These results suggest that H12 in the <i>apo</i> mutant receptor is in a more favorable conformation promoting co-activator binding when compared to <i>apo</i> WT. The magnitude of protection from solvent exchange observed in the AF-2 cleft in Y537S with SRC3 NRD was further increased upon addition of E2 indicating a more stable Y537S-SRC3-E2 complex (<a href=\"#fig4s10\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). In contrast to Y537S, the H11-12 loop and H12 in the D538G mutant did not show a statistically significant difference in deuterium incorporation in the presence of SRC3 NRD alone, but did show increased protection from solvent exchange in these regions in the presence of E2 (<a href=\"#fig4s8\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s10\">10</a>). This finding could be attributed to the low intrinsic SRC3 NRD-binding affinity of <i>apo</i> D538G as compared to Y537S (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Together, these data, along with the SRC3 NRD recruitment and trypsin susceptibility, suggest that the increased solvent exchange in H12 and AF-2 cleft residues for the <i>apo</i> Y537S is due to an altered conformation of H12 that promotes coactivator recruitment. This observation is apparent in the x-ray crystal structure of the <i>apo</i> Y537S. When compared to the WT-E2 complex (PDB: 1GWR), the serine at residue 537 in the <i>apo</i> Y537S (PDB: 2B23) replaces the phenolic side chain of WT Y537, exposing a solvent channel between the H11-12 loop and H3. Further, H12 is slightly displaced away from the ligand-binding pocket toward solvent (<a href=\"#fig4s12\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 12</a>). It is important to note that the HDX MS studies provide novel insight into the conformational mobility of the WT H12, in that this helix does not reach maximum structural stability until both hormone and coregulator are bound."

The H11-12 loop is displaced away from H3 and toward H11, accompanied by conformational changes in Y537 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In the WT-E2 structure, Y537 forms a hydrogen bond with N348 on H3, packing the H11-12 loop into the interior of the protein. In the D538G-E2 structure, however, the Y537 loses its hydrogen bond with N348, and its phenolic side chain is pointed toward bulk solvent. The space previously occupied by Y537 in WT is replaced by a well ordered water molecule in the mutant (observed in both monomers), which hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of Y537 in between H3 and H12 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While the side-chain orientations are identical for residues 531\u2013536 between both monomers in the ASU, the side chain of Y537 appears to adopt two different conformations, both facing solvent, while the main chain orientation of Y537 is identical in the two monomers. It should be noted that the phenolic oxygen of Y537 maintains the same hydrogen bond to N348 in every WT ER\u03b1 LBD-agonist structure available in the PDB. Thus, this rotation of Y537 is unique to the D538G-E2 structure, and it brings the \u03c6 and \u03c8 angles of residues 537 and 538 out of the \u03b1-helix region and into the allowed, more sheet-like region around -120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 (defined by \u03c6/\u03c8 angle regions in the Ramachandran plot) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ramachandran et al., 1963</a>).

The greatest conformational discrepancy between the two structures lies at Y537, which, in the unliganded structure, adopts a more WT-E2 like conformation by orienting toward H3 in chain A, thus returning the \u03c6 and \u03c8 angles of residues 537 and 538 into the \u03b1-helical region. Y537 of chain B, however, matches the solvent-exposed orientation of the D538G-E2 structure whereby the \u03c6 and \u03c8 angles for 537 and 538 are outside of the \u03b1-helical region. Based on this conformational asymmetry between the two monomers in <i>apo</i>-D538G ER\u03b1, Y537 can switch between the buried state observed in the WT-agonist structures and the solvent-exposed orientation of the D538G-E2 structure (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Thus, <i>apo</i> D538G has lost some\u2014but not all\u2014of the conformational attributes of the E2-bound mutant, which is consistent with its modest level of constitutive activity. Together, these structural features agree with our biophysical data showing that D538G can adopt an agonist state in the absence of hormone that recruits coregulator with a modest affinity."

A similar electron density was observed in the published <i>apo</i> Y537S (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nettles et al., 2008</a>). The unidentified ligand is not of sufficient size to be a hormone nor is it near enough to H11 and H12 to interact with them. We believe that the unidentified small molecule in the ligand-binding site is an artifact of protein expression in bacteria, as reported earlier for the Y537S structure, and does not influence H11 and H12 nor the loop connecting them (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nettles et al., 2008</a>)."

In order to gain a better understanding of how the D538G mutation stabilizes the ER\u03b1 LBD agonist conformation, MD simulations were performed on this mutant in the absence of ligand, and for WT ER (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) in both the presence and absence of ligand.

This rotation shifts the backbone conformations of residues 535\u2013537 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) to occupy regions of the Ramachandran plot that are similar to WT-E2 and distinct from <i>apo</i>-WT. These mutation-induced changes allow the H11-12 loop to adopt conformations similar to WT-E2, despite the absence of ligand. Computing the density maps for the side-chain atoms of hydrophobic residues V533, V534, P535, and L536 further confirmed this altered state in which the resulting backbone conformation also permits new side-chain positions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Analysis of the averaged atomic density for residues 533\u2013536 in the WT simulations reveals that the removal of the ligand (WT-E2 vs. <i>apo</i> WT, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) results in more exposed positions for the hydrophobic residues in the loop region, thus destabilizing the H11-12 loop, while the D538G mutation allows the receptor to maintain side-chain positions buried more deeply into the protein surface (WT-E2 vs. <i>apo</i> D538G, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Further, reduced fluctuations were exhibited in the WT-E2 and <i>apo</i>-D538G MD simulations, as observed from larger volumes for the given isosurface, thus indicating that the residues pack more favorably. The optimized packing of the hydrophobic loop residues was additionally quantified by the decreased solvent exposure for the WT-E2 and <i>apo</i> D538G conformations compared to <i>apo</i> WT over the course of the entire simulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). All of the changes that result from replacing D538 with glycine are consistent with increased stability of the H11-12 loop in the mutant, which likely contributes to its constitutive activity."

We were unable to obtain diffraction-quality crystals for Y537S in complex with any SERM. However, the D538G-TOT structure was solved to 3.06\u2009\u00c5 with four dimers in the ASU by molecular replacement. The TOT ligand and H12 are both well resolved in every monomer (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Significant conformational differences are observed between WT-TOT (PDB: 3ERT) and D538G-TOT structures, both in H12 and the H11-12 loop regions. We believe that these differences help account for the reduced potency and efficacy of TOT toward the D538G mutant ER\u03b1 in breast cancer reporter gene assays."

In D538G-TOT, L536 is oriented toward solvent rather than docking into the well-defined leucine-binding pocket found in the WT-TOT structure, and P535 occupies the space previously occupied by the L536 of the WT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The largest conformational change occurs in the H11-12 loop (residues 527\u2013537). Instead of extruding toward solvent, the loop is packed toward the interior of the protein by 9.6\u2009\u00c5 compared to the WT (V534 alphacarbon to alpha carbon) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This conformational change likely explains why trypsin displayed a reduced ability to cleave at this region. Additionally, the tertiary amine at the terminus of the TOT ligand is observed in several conformations in the complex with D538G ER rather than the single conformation present in the WT-TOT structure. Together, these observations suggest that the flexibility of a glycine at position 538 reduces the ability of an antagonist to influence the H11-12 loop and H12. However, care must be taken when interpreting differences within this loop between the WT and the D538G mutant crystal structures. A crystal contact is formed in the WT-TOT structure between the backbone amide of K531 with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of K492 in a symmetry mate. Together, these data reveal that the D538G mutant adopts an altered antagonist conformation that resists antagonism relative to the WT-TOT complex."

During the simulation, H12 of Y537S was found to lie within the AF-2 cleft in a perturbed conformation compared to the WT-TOT crystal structure, similar to that seen in the D538G-TOT crystal structure. Specifically, L536 no longer packs well with the leucine binding site on H3 but reorients to face the solvent, and the rest of the motif is also pushed outward and even shifted toward the C-terminus along the axial direction of H12 by half a turn (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These findings suggest that Y537S stabilizes H12 inside the AF-2 through the formation of a newly formed hydrogen bond (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) that is predicted to form between S537 and E380. Like the D538G-TOT complex, our data for the Y537S-TOT complex show that these conformational changes serve to reduce the inhibitory potency of the SERM relative to the WT ER\u03b1 LBD."

While somatic mutations in the androgen receptor are a known mechanism of acquired hormone therapy resistance in prostate cancer, somatic mutations in <i>ESR1</i> have only recently been identified as an important mechanism of acquired endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer. Subsequent studies have established Y537S and D538G as the two most common point mutations conferring hormone-independent activation and reduced SERM/SERD/AI inhibitory potency and likely efficacy (<a href=\"#bib41\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Toy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</a>).

Coactivator binding assays show that these mutant LBDs recruit the SRC3 coactivator in the absence of hormone, while the unliganded WT LBD does not. Importantly, <i>apo</i> Y537S binds SRC3 NRD with a significantly increased affinity compared to D538G. This differential coactivator binding affinity likely accounts for the significantly increased constitutive transcriptional activity of Y537S versus D538G in breast cancer cell line reporter gene assays (<a href=\"#bib47\">Toy et al., 2013</a>). <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> shows a model for aberrant ER\u03b1 activity as a result of Y537S and D538G mutations in the recurrent anti-estrogen-resistant breast cancer cell. Ligand-binding assays demonstrate that both mutants possess a slightly reduced affinity for E2 and a significantly reduced affinity for TOT. Collectively, these data suggest that the combination of a recruitment of coactivator in the absence of hormone and a reduced TOT-binding affinity underlie the hormone therapy resistance conferred by these H12 ER\u03b1 mutations."

The Y537S and D538G mutations are located at or near H12, a key molecular switch governing the ligand-regulated actions of ER\u03b1 via AF-2. Previously published <i>apo</i> and agonist-bound Y537S structures showed that S537 promotes the agonist conformation in the absence of ligand by forming a hydrogen bond to D351 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nettles et al., 2008</a>), in the process facilitating a tighter packing of the H11-12 loop against the LBD. Similarly, our analysis of the agonist-bound and <i>apo</i> D538G structures show that this mutation relaxes the helical character at the start of H12, thereby also relaxing the H11-12 loop and improving the packing of its hydrophobic side chains. Importantly, our data also show that binding of coregulator (SRC3) further stabilizes H12 in the agonist conformation. While the Y537S and D538G mutants may work through different mechanisms, both stabilize the agonist state in the absence of hormone. The D538G mutation, however, appears to be less stabilizing, as reflected by the lower constitutive activity of D538G ER\u03b1 in both biochemical and cell-based assays (<a href=\"#bib47\">Toy et al., 2013</a>)."

Our biophysical studies indicate that the H11-12 loop and H12 are both altered when TOT is bound in the Y537S and D538G mutants compared to the WT. Further, when compared to the WT-TOT structure, the D538G-TOT structure shows an altered conformation of the H11-12 loop and H12 occupancy of the AF-2 cleft, and multiple conformations of the TOT ligand (indicative of reduced influence on the H11-12 loop). Additionally, MD simulation of the Y537S-TOT complex shows that S537 might form a hydrogen bond with E380 that alters the antagonist conformation. Therefore, the reduced inhibitory potency of TOT stems from its reduced affinity for the Y537S and D538G mutants along with conformational changes to the antagonist state once it occupies the ligand-binding site."

This pre-organized agonist state contributes to a decreased affinity for hormone and especially for SERMs because the stabilized H12 agonist conformation restricts ligand access to the hormone-binding pocket. In addition to reduced ligand affinity, SERM action is further reduced by an altered antagonist state of H12. Thus, recruitment of coactivators in the breast cancer cell is not inhibited as efficiently for the Y537S and D538G mutants as for WT ER\u03b1."

In addition, the effect of these mutations on the other aspects of ER\u03b1 action including other hormone/SERM/SERD binding affinities, homodimer formation, DNA-binding, and stability (in vitro and in vivo) and whether these mutant receptors display a differential preference for a spectrum of coactivators must be investigated."

In this regard, our data show that the H11-12 loop plays an important and previously unrecognized role in regulating the behavior of H12, an essential molecular switch that is allosterically controlled by ligand, which determines the differential ability of the ER\u03b1 AF-2 to recruit coactivators and corepressors. Therefore, antagonists with improved inhibitory potency will increase the dynamic character of mutant H12, an already appreciated aspect of SERD action (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pike et al., 2001</a>). Additionally, our work provides a biophysical hypothesis for why fulvestrant (a SERD, known to disorder H12) was the only molecule which could completely ablate the transcriptional activity of the Y537S and D538G mutants in breast cancer cells while TOT (a SERM) could not (<a href=\"#bib47\">Toy et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, newly developed mixed SERM/SERDs and SERDs with improved pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability over fulvestrant, such as AZ9496, bazedoxifene, GDC910, and RAD1901, should be particularly effective against cancers expressing the Y537S and D538G <i>ESR1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib8\">De Savi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Garner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lai et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wardell et al., 2013</a>).

Deuterium uptake for each peptide is calculated as the average of% D<sub>2</sub>O for the six time points (10\u00a0s, 30\u00a0s, 60\u00a0s, 300\u00a0s, 900\u00a0s, and 3600\u00a0s) and the difference in average% D<sub>2</sub>O values between the <i>apo</i> and liganded states is presented as a heat map with a color code given at the bottom of each figure (warm colors for deprotection and cool colors for protection) and colored only if they show a&gt;5% difference (less or more protection) between the two states and if atleast two time points show a statistically significant difference in a paired two-tailed student\u2019s t-test (p&lt;0.05). Grey color represents no significant change (0\u20135%) between the two states. The exchange at the first two residues for any given peptide is rapid and is ignored in the calculations. Each peptide bar in the heat map view displays the average \u0394% D<sub>2</sub>O values with its associated standard deviation and the charge state shown in parentheses."

Following overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, 10\u00d71L LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin were each inoculated with 5-mL aliquots of the overnight culture. Cells grew at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm until they reached mid-log phase growth (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.8) at which point expression of the protein was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG and incubation continued overnight with shaking at 20\u00b0C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500\u2009<i>g</i> for 30 min, and the pellet was frozen at -20\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 200 mL BPER and 100 \u03bcg DNAse, protein inhibitor cocktail, and lysozyme were added to the lysate.

Using the Structure Preparation module within MOE, all missing loops were constructed, explicit hydrogen atoms added, a side-chain rotamer search was performed, and protonation states were computed for all titratable residues. The resulting structure was loaded into VMD, where each protein monomer, coactivator peptide, and all crystallographic water molecules were written to separate PDB files; the E2 ligand coordinates were discarded for simulated <i>apo</i> structures. Each histidine residue was renamed according to the CHARMM naming convention to reflect the computed protonation states, as shown in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>. The dimeric ER\u03b1 structure was then constructed from the separate PDB files using the PSFGen plugin within VMD. The N- and C-termini were capped with neutral acetyl and <i>N</i>-methylamido groups, respectively. The protein complex was subsequently solvated using the Solvate plugin of VMD with a 20-\u00c5 padding thickness on all sides, and ions were added using the Autoionize plugin to neutralize the system and yield a final NaCl concentration of 0.1 M. Ions were placed a minimum distance of 5\u2009\u00c5 from the protein surface. The resulting fully solvated system contained ~101k atoms. The D538G mutant structure was constructed in an analogous manner, differing only in an additional mutate' command in PSFGen to create the D538G mutation.

Simulation trajectories were first prepared by removing water molecules, concatenating sequential trajectory files, downsampling the framerate to 10 ps/frame, and rewrapping the periodic system to move the protein center of mass to the center of the periodic cell. Prior to analysis, all trajectories were aligned to the initial frame by fitting C\u03b1 atoms of the protein, excluding the coactivator peptides from the fit measurement. When a consistent reference frame was required for cross-trajectory comparisons, all frames were aligned to the 1GWR x-ray structure prior to analysis. With the exception of explicit time series measurements (i.e. SASA), all other analyses were performed for the last 50 ns of the 100-ns production simulation."

Density maps of side chain and backbone atoms were computed using the Volmap plugin of VMD with a resolution of 1\u2009\u00c5 and averaging the mass-weighted density over the trajectory. The volumetric maps for visualizing the side-chain positions were set to the 0.75 isosurface, representing the volume containing atomic density for greater than 75% of the analyzed trajectory. Ramachandran analysis was performed by measuring the \u03c6 and \u03c8 dihedral angles for each residue at a 10-ps interval (n = 5000). The data were then converted to a two-dimensional histogram and plotted using the Matplotlib package of the python programming language (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hunter, 2007</a>). A Gaussian filter was used to smooth the data (\u03c3 = 10.0), and the resulting bins were grouped into 10 contours. The lowest intensity contour (background, dark blue) was removed for clarity. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was computed for the side chains of hydrophobic residues 533\u2013536 using the built-in measure sasa function of VMD. The default probe radius of 1.4\u2009\u00c5 was used while taking the surrounding protein environment into account. SASA measurements were computed at 10-ps intervals (n = 10000) over the entire production simulation and smoothed using a Gaussian-weighed running average (\u03c3 = 10.0)."

The partial atomic charges of TOT were then derived with Restrained ElectroStatic Potential (RESP) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bayly et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cornell et al., 1993</a>) fitting to the quantum mechanical RHF/6-31g* potential. The ideal geometry was defined as the optimized. The other molecular mechanical parameters were derived by assigning CHARMm22 atom types for TOT (<a href=\"#bib33\">Momany and Rone, 1992</a>). The dimer with the least missing residues of the H11-H12 loop was selected from the D538G-TOT crystal structure and served as the template structure to model the Y537S-TOT dimer structure. The side-chain atoms at positions 537 and 538 were removed, and then desired side-chain atoms were placed with the other missing atoms using the default geometry parameters in CHARMm22. Hydrogen atoms were placed with the hbuild module of the computer program CHARMM (<a href=\"#bib2\">Br\u00fcnger and Karplus, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Vanommeslaeghe and MacKerell, 2012</a>).\u00a0Missing\u00a0residues (loops) in the starting crystal structure were optimized in three rounds (100 steps of the steepest descent method followed by two rounds of 100 steps of the adopted New-Raphson method) with updated harmonic constraints on the other atoms.

The authors, evaluate the hypothesis that mutations in the H11/12 region of ER\u03b1 alter the interaction of the receptor with transcriptional coregulators and that the basal, ligand independent, transcriptional activity of these mutants can likely be ascribed to their increased affinity for LXXLL-containing coregulators. The studies also explain the reduced affinity of these mutants for estradiol and tamoxifen. In all this is a tour de force structural analysis that addresses an important emerging issue in breast cancer."
