Normally it is only activated in response to growth or survival signals, but it has increased activity in many cancers. It has been known for some time that AKT promotes the survival of cancer cells by adding phosphate groups (yellow) to protein substrates (light blue): this process involves ATP (not shown) binding to an active site in the kinase domain of the AKT, so it can be inhibited by drugs that compete with ATP to bind to this site (red rectangle). Vivanco, Chen et al. show that AKT can also promote cancer cell survival in a way that is independent of its kinase function: however, the details of this process remain unclear (hence the question mark). Drugs that compete with ATP do not inhibit this kinase-independent role, but allosteric inhibitors (left; see main text) inhibit both the kinase-dependent and kinase-independent roles of AKT, so they have the potential to be more effective therapies to treat cancer."

Other inhibitors work by altering the shape or \u2018conformation\u2019 of AKT in a process known as allosteric inhibition (<a href=\"#bib2\">Fang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Dienstmann et al., 2014</a>).

Furthermore, they found that the most common mutation in AKT present in cancer cells\u2014which promotes the interaction of AKT with the cell membrane\u2014also promotes cell survival independent of kinase activity. These findings suggest that the kinase-independent role of AKT could have widespread importance in tumor formation."

It suggests that allosteric inhibitors of AKT are likely to be more useful for treating AKT-dependent cancers than those that specifically target the kinase domain. More generally, it suggests that finding allosteric inhibitors of other protein kinases linked with human diseases may prove to be a fruitful approach to use to develop new therapies."
