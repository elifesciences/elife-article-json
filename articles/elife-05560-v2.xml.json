SCD-associated mutations have been identified in the gene encoding UBIAD1, a prenyltransferase that synthesizes vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Here, we show that sterols stimulate binding of UBIAD1 to the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA reductase, which is subject to sterol-accelerated, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation augmented by the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeraniol through an unknown mechanism. Geranylgeraniol inhibits binding of UBIAD1 to reductase, allowing its degradation and promoting transport of UBIAD1 from the ER to the Golgi. CRISPR-CAS9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1 relieves the geranylgeraniol requirement for reductase degradation. SCD-associated mutations in UBIAD1 block its displacement from reductase in the presence of geranylgeraniol, thereby preventing degradation of reductase. The current results identify UBIAD1 as the elusive target of geranylgeraniol in reductase degradation, the inhibition of which may contribute to accumulation of cholesterol in SCD."

SCD-associated mutations have been identified in the gene encoding UBIAD1, a prenyltransferase that synthesizes vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Here, we show that sterols stimulate binding of UBIAD1 to the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG CoA reductase, which is subject to sterol-accelerated, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation augmented by the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeraniol through an unknown mechanism. Geranylgeraniol inhibits binding of UBIAD1 to reductase, allowing its degradation and promoting transport of UBIAD1 from the ER to the Golgi. CRISPR-CAS9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1 relieves the geranylgeraniol requirement for reductase degradation. SCD-associated mutations in UBIAD1 block its displacement from reductase in the presence of geranylgeraniol, thereby preventing degradation of reductase. The current results identify UBIAD1 as the elusive target of geranylgeraniol in reductase degradation, the inhibition of which may contribute to accumulation of cholesterol in SCD."

The clinical manifestation of SCD can be apparent early in life, usually within the first decade. Thereafter, opacification of the cornea progresses slowly and ultimately leads to reduced visual acuity, which is postulated to be caused by light scattering (<a href=\"#bib64\">Weiss, 2009</a>). The significance of this visual impairment is highlighted by the frequency in which corneal transplant surgery is utilized in treatment of SCD; approximately 50% of SCD patients \u226550 years of age undergo corneal transplant surgery for restoration of normal vision acuity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Weiss, 2007</a>). The frequency of the procedure increases to greater than 70% for SCD patients 70 years and older. Analyses of corneas removed from SCD patients during transplantation surgery revealed a marked accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and lesser accumulation of esterified cholesterol and phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib35\">McCarthy et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gaynor et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yamada et al., 1998</a>), suggesting dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism may underlie pathogenesis of the disease. Systemic dyslipidemia has been reported to be associated with some, but not all cases of SCD (<a href=\"#bib60\">Thiel et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brownstein et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Crispin, 2002</a>)."

This reaction constitutes a rate-limiting step in synthesis of cholesterol as well as nonsterol isoprenoids such as the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups that are transferred to many cellular proteins and utilized in synthesis of ubiquinone, heme, and dolichol (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Casey and Seabra, 1996</a>). Multiple feedback mechanisms converge on reductase to ensure a constant supply of nonsterol isoprenoids, while avoiding overaccumulation of cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown and Goldstein, 1980</a>). This feedback system is exploited therapeutically by a group of competitive inhibitors of reductase called statins, which trigger regulatory responses that result in the lowering of plasma levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol and thereby reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease (<a href=\"#bib59\">Stossel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Marais et al., 2014</a>).

Insig binding occurs through the membrane domain of reductase, which contains eight membrane-spanning helices and precedes a large cytosolic domain with enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liscum et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roitelman et al., 1992</a>). Insig-associated ubiquitin ligases gp78 and Trc8 facilitate ubiquitination of cytosolically exposed lysine residues in the membrane domain of reductase (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sever et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Song et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). This ubiquitination marks reductase for recognition by the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities)-ATPase VCP/p97, which mediates extraction of reductase across ER membranes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Morris et al., 2014</a>). Once extracted, ubiquitinated reductase is then released into the cytosol and delivered into the proteolytic chamber of the 20S proteasome through reactions mediated by the proteasome 19S regulatory particle, which contains six AAA-ATPases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ehlinger and Walters, 2013</a>). Geranylgeraniol, the alcohol derivative of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, augments sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase but does not appreciably affect sterol-induced ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sever et al., 2003a</a>). This observation led to the notion that geranylgeraniol augments post-ubiquitination steps in reductase ERAD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Indeed, geranylgeraniol enhances sterol-induced membrane extraction and cytosolic dislocation of reductase as judged by assays carried out in vitro and in intact cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Song and DeBose-Boyd, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Elsabrouty et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Morris et al., 2014</a>)."

Endogenous UBIAD1 binds to reductase in sterol-treated cells as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. This sterol-induced binding is inhibited by geranylgeraniol, releasing UBIAD1 for translocation from membranes of the ER to the Golgi. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of UBIAD1 relieves the geranylgeraniol requirement for reductase ERAD. UBIAD1 harboring the SCD-associated N102S mutation resists geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase and remains associated with the protein in the ER, thereby blocking sterol-accelerated degradation of reductase. These studies identify UBIAD1 as the elusive target of geranylgeraniol in the ERAD of reductase and provide insight into mechanisms through which the nonsterol isoprenoid modulates the reaction. Moreover, our results suggest that slowed ERAD of reductase may contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol observed in SCD."

However, it should be noted that the prenyltransferase has also been localized to membranes of the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nickerson et al., 2010</a>) as well as the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mugoni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). In the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, we examined the subcellular localization of endogenous UBIAD1 in SV-589 cells grown in medium containing FCS (fetal calf serum). The results show that endogenous UBIAD1 localized to juxtanuclear structures that resembled the Golgi and also stained with antibodies against the Golgi protein GM130 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nakamura et al., 1995</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, panels 1 and 2). The Golgi localization of UBIAD1 was markedly diminished when the cells were depleted of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids through incubation in medium containing LPPS (lipoprotein-poor serum) and the reductase inhibitor compactin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, panels 3 and 4). Notably, localization of Golgi-localized GM130 was unaffected by depletion of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (compare panels 2 and 4). The Golgi localization of UBIAD1 was restored in sterol- and nonsterol isoprenoid-depleted cells by the addition of geranylgeraniol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, panel 5), but not by the addition of 25-HC (panel 7). A repeat experiment confirms that sterol and nonsterol isoprenoid depletion disrupted the Golgi localization of UBIAD1 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, this localization was restored by geranylgeraniol, but not by farnesol, 25-HC, or cholesterol. We obtained similar results with SV-589 cells stably transfected with pCMV-Myc-UBIAD1 encoding Myc-tagged human UBIAD1. Depletion of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids disrupted Golgi localization of transfected Myc-UBIAD1 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This localization was restored by geranylgeraniol, but not by farnesol or 25-HC. Notably, endogenous UBIAD1 exhibited relatively more non-Golgi staining compared to Myc-UBIAD1 in FCS-cultured cells, suggesting anti-Myc may have a greater degree of specificity compared to that of anti-UBIAD1."

For RNAi experiments, SV-589 cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting the GFP or UBIAD1 mRNAs and subsequently treated in the absence or presence of 25-HC and geranylgeraniol prior to subcellular fractionation. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows that 25-HC stimulated reductase degradation from membranes of control siRNA-transfected cells (top panel, lane 2); this degradation was enhanced by geranylgeraniol (lanes 3 and 4). In UBIAD1 knockdown cells, 25-HC stimulated complete degradation of reductase, even in the absence of geranylgeraniol (lanes 5\u20138). Nearly identical results were obtained using an siRNA duplex targeting a different region of the UBIAD1 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Geranylgeraniol also augmented the ERAD of reductase that was stimulated by Apomine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, top panel, lanes 1\u20134); however, the 1,1-bisphosphonate ester caused reductase to become completely degraded in UBIAD1 knockdown cells (lanes 5\u20138). Results consistent with those observed using RNAi were obtained in cells subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1. In wild type SV-589 cells, Apomine stimulated reductase ERAD through a mechanism augmented by geranylgeraniol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top panel, lanes 1\u20134), whereas the compound caused complete degradation of reductase in cells deficient in UBIAD1 (designated UBIAD1<sup>\u2212</sup>) (lanes 5\u20138). <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> shows that in a time-dependent fashion, geranylgeraniol augmented Apomine-induced degradation of reductase in SV-589 cells (compare lanes 1\u20136 with lanes 7\u201312). However, Apomine alone caused complete degradation of reductase in UBIAD1<sup>\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lanes 13\u201318) and augmentation by geranylgeraniol was markedly diminished (lanes 19\u201324).

Asparagine-102 (N102), which localizes to the prenyltransferase domain of UBIAD1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Li, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2014</a>), is the most frequently altered residue (\u223c30%) in SCD families. Considering that SCD is an autosomal dominant disorder, we reasoned that overexpression of UBIAD1 harboring the SCD-associated N102S mutation would block reductase ERAD. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> shows that when overexpressed in SV-589 cells, the T7-tagged membrane domain of reductase became degraded in the presence of 25-HC and geranylgeraniol (top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Co-expression of a plasmid encoding wild type UBIAD1 stabilized reductase in a dose-dependent fashion and 25-HC plus geranylgeraniol continued to accelerate its ERAD (lanes 3\u201310). Notably, the highest level of wild type UBIAD1 co-expressed with reductase blunted the enzyme's accelerated degradation (lanes 11 and 12). Co-expression of UBIAD1 (N102S) also stabilized the membrane domain of reductase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, top panel, compare lane 1 with lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), suggesting the protein continued to bind to the enzyme. However, UBIAD1 (N102S) blunted sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase, even at low levels of expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, top panel, compare lane 2 with lanes 4, 8, 10, and 12). Similar results were obtained with T7-tagged, full-length reductase (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The protein was subjected to sterol-accelerated degradation when transfected alone or together with up to 100 ng of plasmid encoding wild type UBIAD1 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, top panel, lanes 1\u20138); co-transfection of higher levels (300 and 1000 ng) of the UBIAD1-encoding plasmid inhibited reductase degradation (lanes 9\u201312). Consistent with results obtained with the reductase membrane domain, inhibition of full-length reductase degradation was observed upon co-transfection with a significantly lower amount (30 ng) of plasmid encoding UBIAD1 (N102S) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, top panel, compare lanes 1\u20134 with lanes 5\u201312). Glycine-177 (G177, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) is the second-most frequently altered UBIAD1 residue in SCD families (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nickerson et al., 2013</a>). The results of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> show that UBAID1 harboring the SCD-associated G177R mutation blocked reductase ERAD to a degree similar to that observed with UBIAD1 (N102S) (top panel, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3\u20136)."

As previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib38\">Morris et al., 2014</a>), the reaction is initiated by accumulation of sterols, which triggers binding of Insigs to reductase and results in its gp78/Trc8-mediated ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib58\">Song et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jo et al., 2011</a>). We find in the current study that the oxysterol 25-HC and the 1,1-bisphosphonate ester Apomine, which mimics 25-HC in accelerating reductase ERAD (<a href=\"#bib51\">Roitelman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sever et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nguyen et al., 2009</a>), trigger binding of reductase to UBIAD1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), a prenyltransferase that mediates synthesis of the vitamin K<sub>2</sub> derivative MK-4 (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The sterol-induced binding of UBIAD1 to reductase appears to follow the action of Insigs as indicated by inhibition of the association by RNAi-mediated Insig knockdown (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast to the action of sterols, the nonsterol isoprenoid geranylgeraniol, which augments sterol-accelerated reductase ERAD (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sever et al., 2003a</a>), inhibits formation of the UBIAD1-reductase complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Geranylgeraniol also regulates the subcellular localization of UBIAD1. The prenyltransferase primarily localizes to Golgi membranes when cells are cultured in sterol-replete FCS-containing medium (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The Golgi localization of UBIAD1 is disrupted when cells are switched to sterol-depleting medium containing LPPS and the reductase inhibitor compactin, which depletes cellular stores of nonsterol isoprenoids (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown and Goldstein, 1980</a>). Remarkably, Golgi localization of UBAID1 is restored by the addition of geranylgeraniol, but not of 25-HC or farnesol, to cells deprived of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2, 3</a>). We conclude from these observations that geranylgeraniol-mediated disruption of the UBIAD1-reductase complex allows for the translocation of UBIAD1 from ER membranes to the Golgi and for membrane extraction, cytosolic dislocation and proteasomal degradation of reductase (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

The intracellular accumulation of sterols in ER membranes triggers binding of reductase to Insigs, resulting in its ubiquitination by Insig-associated ubiquitin ligases gp78 and Trc8 and association with UBIAD1. Geranylgeraniol becomes phosphorylated to produce geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which enhances reductase degradation by binding to UBIAD1, causing its displacement from reductase-Insig. This displacement allows for transport of UBIAD1 to the Golgi and membrane extraction, cytosolic dislocation, and proteasomal degradation of reductase. We postulate that the SCD-associated N102S or G177R mutations in UBIAD1 abrogate binding of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. As a result, UBIAD1 (N102S) and (G177R) do not translocate to the Golgi and remain associated with reductase in the ER, thereby blocking its membrane extraction, cytosolic dislocation, and proteasomal degradation."

In support of this notion, we observed that RNAi-mediated knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of UBIAD1 eliminates the requirement of geranylgeraniol for maximal degradation of reductase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The continuance of accelerated reductase degradation in UBIAD1-deficient cells is consistent with the proposal that UBIAD1 mediates a step in the reaction downstream the action of Insigs. In future studies, efforts will be undertaken to delineate mechanisms through which UBIAD1 retards reductase ERAD. Geranylgeraniol is required for extraction of ubiquitinated reductase across the ER membrane through a reaction that is mediated by the AAA-ATPase VCP/p97 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Morris et al., 2014</a>). Thus, one likely mechanism for the inhibitory effects of UBIAD1 on reductase ERAD may involve inhibition of the association of ubiquitinated reductase with VCP/p97 or one of its ubiquitin-binding cofactors, thereby preventing its subsequent membrane extraction."

In 1979, Faust, Brown, and Goldstein found that in the absence of LDL, cells accumulate reductase to produce mevalonate for conversion into primarily cholesterol and other sterols (<a href=\"#bib15\">Faust et al., 1979</a>). The addition of LDL to cells partially suppressed reductase, limiting production of mevalonate. As a result, incorporation of mevalonate into cholesterol was reduced, whereas incorporation of the molecule into nonsterol isoprenoids such as CoQ10 was enhanced. We postulate that LDL failed to completely suppress reductase due to its binding to UBIAD1 and resultant inhibition of sterol-accelerated degradation. This residual reductase produces a small amount of mevalonate that is preferentially diverted into nonsterol isoprenoids. Once appropriate levels of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate accumulate in cells, the isoprenoid binds to UBIAD1, causing its release from reductase, which subsequently becomes degraded. Released UBIAD1 then translocates to the Golgi where it synthesizes PPHB (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mugoni et al., 2013</a>) and perhaps MK-4. Thus, substrate-regulated transport of UBIAD1 ensures that products of the enzyme are only produced when cellular demands for other nonsterol isoprenoids as well as sterols have been met.

Consistent with the autosomal dominant phenotype of SCD, disease-associated N102S and G177R mutants of UBIAD1 inhibit sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The molecular basis for this inhibition is suggested by <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, which show that UBIAD1 (N102S) resists geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase. Subcellular localization studies show that in FCS-cultured cells, wild type UBIAD1 localizes to the Golgi, whereas the N102S and G177R mutants of the enzyme appear defective in Golgi trafficking and remain sequestered within the ER (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Mutation of the asparagine residue in bacterial UbiA prenyltransferases that corresponds to N102 markedly diminishes substrate binding and enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Li, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we postulate that binding of UBIAD1 to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate produced by phosphorylation of geranylgeraniol triggers displacement of wild type UBIAD1 from reductase, allowing the protein to translocate to the Golgi. In contrast, the N102S and G177R mutants of UBIAD1 exhibit reduced affinity for geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and thus, remain associated with reductase in the ER, thereby inhibiting its sterol-accelerated ERAD (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This inhibition may contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol that is observed in corneas of SCD patients. It will be important in future studies to develop a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate-binding assay for mammalian UBIAD1 and to determine the subcellular localization and effect of the other 18 SCD-associated UBIAD1 mutants on reductase ERAD."

They have also revealed a potential mechanism whereby mutations in UBIAD1 cause the accumulation of cholesterol in corneas of SCD patients. Finally, results of this study indicate the existence of a novel link between the synthesis of MK-4 and cholesterol. Further investigation of this link is merited owing to the potential for development of novel therapies that accelerate reductase ERAD to lower plasma LDL-cholesterol and retard corneal accumulation of cholesterol that characterizes SCD."

In addition, coverslips were stained for 5 min with 1 \u00b5g/ml Hoechst 33,342 (Life Technologies) to visualize nuclei. The coverslips were then mounted in Mowiol 4-88 solution (Calbiochem/EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and fluorescence analysis was performed using a Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7/1.4 DIC objective (Zeiss, Peabody, MA), an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss), an Orca 285 camera (Hamamatsu,Houston, TX), and the software Openlab 4.0.2 (Improvision, Coventry, England)."

Dominant mutations in UBIAD1 that cause Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) disrupt this regulation. The work resolves a long-standing question of how GGOH enhances the sterol-dependent degradation of mammalian HMGR, which has been a consistent yet mysterious feature of HMGR degradation as studied by this group for a number of years. The results make sense, and lead to a number of hypotheses and perhaps distinct therapeutic approaches for Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy. The topic and findings should be of interest to the readers of <i>eLife</i> and open up several future areas for study. Nevertheless, some aspects of the study require clarification and a modest amount of new experimentation to fully support the authors' conclusions. The following three points were deemed essential to the central conclusions, while the 'minor comments' below are more peripheral."

Chem., and Gil et al., 1985, Cell). We have observed in unpublished studies that the membrane domain of reductase appears to be more susceptible to accelerated degradation than the full-length form, which could explain why UBIAD1 stabilizes the membrane domain of reductase more than the full-length protein. The difference in stability between the membrane domain of reductase and the full-length protein may be attributable to the C-terminal catalytic domain, which is known to form a tetramer that likely has to be unassembled prior to proteasomal degradation. As suggested by the reviewers, we have now included experiments (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) that compare the ability of wild type and mutant (N102S) UBIAD1 to block degradation of full-length reductase. Results similar to those with the truncated membrane domain of reductase were obtained with the full-length enzyme."

Thus, we have included in the revised manuscript an additional two independent experiments that demonstrate UBIAD1 (N102S) is more resistant to geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase than its wild type counterpart (see <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). We previously showed that reductase remains in the ER when cells are treated with sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (see Hartman et al., 2010, J. Biol. Chem, 285:19288). The current observations show that: 1) geranylgeraniol triggers translocation of UBIAD1 to the Golgi in sterol and nonsterol isoprenoid-depleted cells; and 2) UBIAD1 (N102S) remains sequestered in ER membranes. Thus, we conclude the most likely mechanism of action for UBIAD1 in reductase degradation involves its geranylgeraniol-mediated displacement from reductase, which allows reductase degradation and translocation of UBIAD1 to the Golgi. UBIAD1 (N102S) exhibits reduced affinity for geranylgeraniol (or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) and remains associated with reductase in the ER, thereby blocking its degradation."

We have now included in the revised manuscript the documentation of proteins identified as associated proteins of the reductase-BirA* chimera. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>, we excised three segments from a colloidal blue-stained gel of proteins that co-purified with reductase-BirA*. These segments were subjected to trypsin digestion and the proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. We identified 15 proteins from these segments that gave spectral counts greater 4; these proteins are indicated in the figure. In the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, we used co-immunoprecipitation to confirm the association of the identified protein with endogenous reductase. Some of the proteins did not associate with reductase, while others bound in both the absence and presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). UBIAD1 was the only protein that exhibited sterol-regulated association with endogenous reductase. This feature, along with a previous report for an association between reductase and UBIAD1, and accumulation of cholesterol in SCD, prompted us to focus attention on UBIAD1. We did not identify Insigs or the ubiquitin ligases that mediate reductase ubiquitination in the three segments of the gel that were selected for protein identification. The molecular weights of the selected segments did not correspond to those of the ubiquitin ligases."

It should be noted that in the absence of UBIAD1, sterols continue to accelerate degradation of reductase. This indicates that UBIAD1 acts downstream Insig in the degradation of reductase and is not absolutely required for the reaction. Moreover, data indicate that geranylgeraniol modulates the subcellular localization of UBIAD1 and considering that geranylgeraniol mediates a post-ubiquitination step in reductase degradation, we conclude the action of UBIAD1 follows that of Insig."
