                    "text": "The budding yeast genome contains regions where meiotic recombination initiates more frequently than in others. This pattern parallels enrichment for the meiotic chromosome axis proteins Hop1 and Red1. These proteins are important for Spo11-catalyzed double strand break formation; their contribution to crossover recombination remains undefined. Using the sequence-specific <i>VMA1</i>-derived endonuclease (VDE) to initiate recombination in meiosis, we show that chromosome structure influences the choice of proteins that resolve recombination intermediates to form crossovers. At a Hop1-enriched locus, most VDE-initiated crossovers, like most Spo11-initiated crossovers, required the meiosis-specific MutL\u03b3 resolvase. In contrast, at a locus with lower Hop1 occupancy, most VDE-initiated crossovers were MutL\u03b3-independent. In <i>pch2</i> mutants, the two loci displayed similar Hop1 occupancy levels, and VDE-induced crossovers were similarly MutL\u03b3-dependent. We suggest that meiotic and mitotic recombination pathways coexist within meiotic cells, and that features of meiotic chromosome structure determine whether one or the other predominates in different regions."

                    "text": "The budding yeast genome contains regions where meiotic recombination initiates more frequently than in others. This pattern parallels enrichment for the meiotic chromosome axis proteins Hop1 and Red1. These proteins are important for Spo11-catalyzed double strand break formation; their contribution to crossover recombination remains undefined. Using the sequence-specific <i>VMA1</i>-derived endonuclease (VDE) to initiate recombination in meiosis, we show that chromosome structure influences the choice of proteins that resolve recombination intermediates to form crossovers. At a Hop1-enriched locus, most VDE-initiated crossovers, like most Spo11-initiated crossovers, required the meiosis-specific MutL\u03b3 resolvase. In contrast, at a locus with lower Hop1 occupancy, most VDE-initiated crossovers were MutL\u03b3-independent. In <i>pch2</i> mutants, the two loci displayed similar Hop1 occupancy levels, and VDE-induced crossovers were similarly MutL\u03b3-dependent. We suggest that meiotic and mitotic recombination pathways coexist within meiotic cells, and that features of meiotic chromosome structure determine whether one or the other predominates in different regions."

Breaks that span across both strands of the DNA can cause cell death because if the break is incorrectly repaired, a segment of the DNA may be lost. Cells use a process known as homologous recombination to repair such breaks correctly. This uses an undamaged DNA molecule as a template that can be copied to replace missing segments of the DNA sequence. During the repair of double-strand breaks, connections called crossovers may form. This results in the damaged and undamaged DNA molecules swapping a portion of their sequences."

In regions that had high levels of meiotic axis proteins, crossovers mainly formed using the meiosis-specific resolvase enzyme. In regions that had low levels of meiotic axis proteins, crossovers formed using resolvases that are active in mitotic cells. Further experiments demonstrated that altering the levels of one of the meiotic axis proteins changed which resolvase was used."

Inter-homolog COs, combined with sister chromatid cohesion, create physical linkages that ensure faithful homolog segregation during the first meiotic division, avoiding chromosome nondisjunction and consequent aneuploidy in gametes (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib47\">Hunter, 2015</a>)."

Spo11-DSBs and resulting recombination events are non-uniformly distributed in the genomes of organisms ranging from budding yeast to humans (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baudat and Nicolas, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buhler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fowler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Gerton et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hellsten et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Pratto et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Singhal et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Smagulova et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Wijnker et al., 2013</a>). In budding yeast, this non-uniform distribution of Spo11-DSBs is influenced by meiosis-specific proteins, Red1 and Hop1, which are components of the meiotic chromosome axis. The meiotic chromosome axis coordinates sister chromatids and forms the axial element of the synaptonemal complex, which holds homologs in tight juxtaposition (<a href=\"#bib45\">Hollingsworth et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Page and Hawley, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Smith and Roeder, 1997</a>). Spo11-DSBs form frequently in large (ca 50\u2013200 kb) 'hot' domains that are also enriched for Red1 and Hop1, and these 'hot' domains are interspersed with similarly-sized 'cold' regions where Spo11-DSBs are infrequent and Red1/Hop1 occupancy levels are low (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baudat and Nicolas, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Blat et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buhler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>). Normal Spo11-DSB formation requires recruitment of Spo11 and accessory proteins to the meiotic axis (<a href=\"#bib78\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Prieler et al., 2005</a>), and Red1/Hop1 are also central to mechanisms that direct Spo11-DSB repair towards use of the homolog as a recombination partner (<a href=\"#bib18\">Carballo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Niu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1997</a>). Other eukaryotes contain Hop1 analogs that share a domain, called the HORMA domain (<a href=\"#bib86\">Rosenberg and Corbett, 2015</a>), and correlations between these meiotic axis proteins and DSB formation are observed in fission yeast, nematodes and in mammals (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fowler et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Goodyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Wojtasz et al., 2009</a>).

In budding yeast, about half of meiotic events form NCOs via synthesis-dependent strand annealing, a mechanism that does not involve stable recombination intermediates (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allers and Lichten, 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">McMahill et al., 2007</a>) and is suggested to be the predominant HR pathway in mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bzymek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">McGill et al., 1989</a>). Most of the remaining events are repaired by a meiosis-specific CO pathway, in which an ensemble of meiotic proteins, called the ZMM proteins, stabilize early recombination intermediates and promote their maturation into double Holliday junction joint molecules (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allers and Lichten, 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">B\u00f6rner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Lynn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Schwacha and Kleckner, 1994</a>). These ZMM-stabilized joint molecules (JMs) are subsequently resolved as COs (<a href=\"#bib93\">Sourirajan and Lichten, 2008</a>) through the action of the MutL\u03b3 complex, which contains the Mlh1, Mlh3, and Exo1 proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Argueso et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Khazanehdari and Borts, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Wang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Zakharyevich et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib109\">2012</a>). MutL\u03b3 does not appear to make significant contributions to mitotic COs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ira et al., 2003</a>). A minority of events form ZMM-independent JMs that are resolved as both COs and NCOs by the structure-selective nucleases (SSNs) Mus81-Mms4, Yen1, and Slx1-Slx4, which are responsible for most JM resolution during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Argueso et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Santos et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">De Muyt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Mu\u00f1oz-Galv\u00e1n et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</a>; reviewed by <a href=\"#bib107\">Wyatt and West, 2014</a>). A similar picture, with MutL\u03b3 forming most meiotic COs and SSNs playing a minor role, is observed in several other eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berchowitz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Holloway et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Plug et al., 1998</a>)."

In the first, expression of meiosis-specific proteins and the presence of high levels of Spo11-DSBs results in nucleus-wide changes in recombination biochemistry, shifting its balance towards MutL\u03b3-dependent resolution of JMs, wherever they might occur. In the second, local features of meiotic chromosome structure, in particular enrichment for meiosis-specific chromosome axis proteins, provides an in cis structural environment that favors MutL\u03b3-dependent JM resolution. However, because Spo11-DSBs form preferentially in Red1/Hop1-enriched regions, and because these proteins are required for efficient Spo11-DSB formation and interhomolog repair, it is difficult to distinguish these two models by examining Spo11-initiated recombination alone."

VDE- catalyzed DSBs (hereafter called VDE-DSBs) form independent of Spo11 and meiotic axis proteins. However, like Spo11-DSBs, VDE-DSBs form after pre-meiotic DNA replication and are repaired using end-processing and strand invasion activities that also repair Spo11-DSBs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fukuda et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Neale et al., 2002</a>). We examined resolvase contributions to VDE-initiated CO formation, and obtained evidence that local enrichment for meiotic axis proteins promotes MutL\u03b3-dependent CO formation; while recombination that occurs outside of this specialized environment forms COs by MutL\u03b3-independent mechanisms. We also show that CO formation at a locus, and in particular MutL\u03b3-dependent CO formation, requires Spo11-DSB formation elsewhere in the genome."

Restriction site polymorphisms at flanking <i>Hin</i>dIII sites, combined with the heterozygous <i>VRS</i> site, allow differentiation of parental and recombinant DNA molecules. This recombination reporter was inserted at two loci: <i>HIS4</i> and <i>URA3</i>, which are 'hot' and 'cold', respectively, for Spo11-initiated recombination and Red1/Hop1 occupancy (<a href=\"#bib11\">Borde et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buhler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Wu and Lichten, 1995</a>; also see Figure 4A and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1, below).

In contrast, Spo11-DSBs infrequently occur at the same place on both sister chromatids (<a href=\"#bib110\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). While the consequences of this difference remain to be determined, we note that inserts at both <i>HIS4</i> and <i>URA3</i> are cleaved by VDE with equal frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

At the <i>HIS4</i> locus, COs were reduced in <i>mlh3\u2206</i> mutants, which lack MutL\u03b3, by\u00a0~60% relative to wild type. In <i>mms4-md yen1\u2206 slx1\u2206</i> mutants, which lack the three structure selective nucleases active during both meiosis and the mitotic cell cycle (SSNs, triple mutants hereafter called <i>ssn</i> mutants), COs were reduced by\u00a0~30%, and by\u00a0~75% in <i>mlh3 ssn</i> mutants. Thus, like Spo11-initiated COs, VDE-initiated COs in inserts at <i>HIS4</i> are primarily MutL\u03b3-dependent, and less dependent on SSNs. In contrast, COs in inserts located at <i>URA3</i> were reduced by only\u00a0~\u00a010% in <i>mlh3</i>, by\u00a0~40% in <i>ssn</i> mutants, and by\u00a0~60% in <i>mlh3 ssn</i> mutants, so that the final level of residual COs was the same as at <i>HIS4</i>. Thus, SSNs make a substantially greater contribution to VDE-initiated CO formation at <i>URA3</i> than does MutL\u03b3, and MutL\u03b3\u2019s contribution becomes substantial only in the absence of SSNs."

To test further the suggestion that differential Hop1 occupancy is correlated with differences in CO formation at these loci, we examined the resolvase-dependence of VDE-initiated COs in <i>pch2\u2206</i> mutants. Pch2 is a conserved AAA+ ATPase that maintains the nonuniform pattern of Hop1 occupancy along meiotic chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib15\">B\u00f6rner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Joshi et al., 2009</a>).

While VDE-DSBs form at similar levels and timing in <i>SPO11</i> and <i>spo11</i> mutant cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Neale et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Terentyev et al., 2010</a>), features of VDE-DSB repair, including the extent of end resection, are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of Spo11-DSBs (<a href=\"#bib73\">Neale et al., 2002</a>). To determine if other aspects of VDE-initiated recombination are also affected, we examined VDE-initiated recombination in a catalysis-null <i>spo11-Y135F</i> mutant, hereafter called <i>spo11</i>. In <i>spo11</i> mutants, VDE-DSB dynamics and NCO formation were similar in inserts at <i>HIS4</i> and <i>URA3</i>, were comparable to those seen in wild type (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and were independent of HJ resolvase activities (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the absence of Spo11-DSBs substantially reduced VDE-induced COs, resulting in virtually identical CO timing and levels at the two loci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Unlike the\u00a0~60% reduction in COs seen at <i>HIS4</i> in <i>SPO11 mlh3\u2206</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), final CO levels were similar in <i>spo11 mlh3\u0394</i> and <i>spo11 MLH3</i> strains, at both <i>HIS4</i> and <i>URA3</i>, and similar CO reductions were observed at both loci in <i>spo11 ssn</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Thus, processes that depend on Spo11-DSBs elsewhere in the genome are important to promote VDE-initiated COs, and appear to be essential for MutL\u03b3-dependent CO formation."

VDE-initiated COs at <i>HIS4</i> are similar to those initiated by Spo11, in that most depend on MutL\u03b3. In contrast, VDE-initiated COs at the 'cold' locus, <i>URA3</i>, more closely resemble mitotic COs, which are independent of MutL\u03b3, but are substantially dependent on SSNs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ira et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Mu\u00f1oz-Galv\u00e1n et al., 2012</a>). Locus-dependent differences in MutL\u03b3-dependence are reduced in <i>pch2\u2206</i> mutants, as are differences in Hop1 occupancy at later times in meiosis I prophase. Based on these findings, we suggest that local chromosome context exerts an important influence on the biochemistry of CO formation during meiosis, and that factors responsible for creating DSB-hot and -cold domains also create corresponding domains where different DSB repair pathways are dominant. An attractive hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) is that regions enriched for meiosis-specific axial element proteins create a chromosomal environment that promotes meiotic DSB formation, limits inter-sister recombination, preferentially loads ZMM proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Joshi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Serrentino et al., 2013</a>), and is required for recruitment of MutL\u03b3. In such regions, where most Spo11-dependent events occur, recombination intermediates will have a greater likelihood of being captured by axis-associated ZMM proteins, and consequently being resolved as COs by MutL\u03b3. Regions with lower axial element protein enrichment are less likely to recruit ZMM proteins and MutL\u03b3; DSB repair and CO formation in these regions are more likely to involve non-meiotic mechanisms. In short, the meiotic genome can be thought of as containing two types of environment: meiotic axis protein-enriched regions, where 'meiotic' recombination pathways predominate; and meiotic axis protein-depleted regions, in which recombination events more closely resemble those seen in mitotic cells."

In addition, it is important to keep in mind that ChIP-based values for meiotic axis protein-enrichment and molecular measures of CO resolvase-dependence are both population-based averages, and do not detect cell-to-cell heterogeneity. It is possible that meiotic axis protein enrichment at <i>HIS4</i> varies across a population, and most SSN-dependent COs form in cells where <i>HIS4</i> is not meiotic axis protein-enriched.

This suggests that Spo11-DSBs form in an environment that is refractory to Rad53 recruitment and modification, but that there also are environments where exogenously-induced damage can trigger the mitotic DNA damage response. In light of this suggestion, it is interesting that the meiotic defects of <i>spo11</i> mutants in a variety of organisms are often only partially rescued by DSBs caused by exogenous agents (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bowring et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Celerin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dernburg et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Loidl and Mochizuki, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Pauklin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Storlazzi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Thorne and Byers, 1993</a>). While other factors may be responsible for the limited rescue observed, we suggest that it reflects the random location of exogenously-induced DSBs, with only a subset forming in regions where repair is likely to form interhomolog COs that promote proper homolog segregation."

At <i>HIS4</i>, where MutL\u03b3 predominates, <i>ssn</i> mutants still display a modest reduction in VDE-initiated COs when MutL\u03b3 is active, but an even greater relative reduction in the absence of MutL\u03b3. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that, in the absence of MutL\u03b3, SSNs serve as a back-up that resolves JMs to produce both COs and NCOs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Argueso et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">De Muyt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Zakharyevich et al., 2012</a>). Our current data indicate that the converse may also be true, since at <i>URA3</i>, MutL\u03b3 appears to make a greater contribution to CO formation in the absence of SSNs than in their presence. However, in our studies, JMs are more efficiently resolved in <i>mlh3\u2206</i> mutants than in <i>ssn</i> mutants, which display persistent unresolved JMs. Therefore, if MutL\u03b3 acts as a back-up resolvase, it can do so in only a limited capacity, possibly reflecting a need for a specific chromosome structural context in which MutL\u03b3 can be efficiently loaded and activated. The absence of such a meiosis-specific chromosome context may explain why MutL\u03b3 does not appear to contribute to CO formation during the mitotic cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ira et al., 2003</a>), although lower <i>MLH3</i> expression in mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib83\">Primig et al., 2000</a>) may also reduce its contribution."

These residual crossovers may reflect the activity of a yet-unidentified JM resolvase; they may also reflect the production of half-crossovers by break-induced replication (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Kogoma, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Llorente et al., 2008</a>) or by other mechanisms that do not involve dHJ-JM formation and resolution (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ivanov and Haber, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Maz\u00f3n et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Mu\u00f1oz-Galv\u00e1n et al., 2012</a>).

Because patterns of Hop1 occupancy are not markedly altered in <i>spo11</i> mutants (Franz Klein, personal communication), these findings indicate that, in addition to the local effects of meiotic chromosome structure suggested above, meiotic CO formation is affected by processes that require Spo11-DSBs elsewhere in the genome."

To account for the reduced levels and MutL\u03b3-independence of VDE-initiated COs in <i>spo11</i> mutants, we suggest that a single VDE-DSB is not sufficient to promote stable homolog pairing, and that additional DSBs along a chromosome are needed to promote stable homolog pairing, which in turn is needed to form ZMM protein-containing structures that stabilize JMs and recruit MutL\u03b3. However, the 140\u2013190 Spo11-DSBs that form in each meiotic cell (<a href=\"#bib13\">Buhler et al., 2007</a>) are also expected to induce a nucleus-wide DNA damage-response, and to compete with other DSBs for repair activities whose availability is limited, and both have the potential to alter recombination biochemistry at VDE-DSBs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Neale et al., 2002</a>). Thus, while we believe it likely that defects in homolog pairing and synapsis are responsible for the observed impact of <i>spo11</i> mutation on VDE-initiated CO formation, it remains possible that it is due to changes in DNA damage signaling, repair protein availability, or in other processes that are affected by global Spo11-DSB levels."

These 'mitotic' mechanisms remain active in the meiotic nucleus, and can act both in recombination events that occur outside of the local 'meiotic' structural context, and in recombination in <i>spo11</i> mutants. It is well established that local chromosome context influences the first step in meiotic recombination, Spo11-catalyzed DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib78\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Prieler et al., 2005</a>). Our work shows that it also influences the last, namely the resolution of recombination intermediates to form COs. It will be of considerable interest to determine if other critical steps in meiotic recombination, such as choice between sister chromatid and homolog as a DSB repair partner, or the choice between NCO and CO outcomes, are also influenced by local aspects of interstitial chromosome structure."

One known and documented difference between these two loci is the occupancy for the chromosome axis protein Hop1, high at HIS4 and low at URA3. The authors find that VDE-initiated COs at HIS4 are strongly dependent on MutL\u03b3, similar to those initiated by Spo11. VDE-induced COs at URA3 are more dependent on SSNs. The authors also show that <i>pch2\u2206</i> mutants, which have smaller differences in Hop1 occupancy between HIS4 and URA3, display smaller locus-dependent differences in formation of COs by MutL\u03b3.

This intriguing paper documents a substantial difference between two positions in the yeast genome for use of MutLgamma and other Holliday junction resolving activities. The experimental design is clever, taking advantage of site-specific DSBs made by the VDE nuclease. The data are of excellent quality and the striking differences between insertions at HIS4 and URA3 are clearly documented. This is an interesting and important study."

The main issue is that the authors are trying to argue based on a two-point correlation, but there are a large number of possible differences between these loci aside from the ones the authors focus on, and it remains possible that the direction of the correlation seen with these two loci remains purely coincidental. The <i>pch2</i> experiments are consistent with the authors' preferred interpretation, but fall short of providing convincing support: while it is true that Hop1 occupancy changes, it is also the case that other things probably change as well in the absence of Pch2. So, it is a stretch to ascribe the effects of this mutation as being solely or even primarily via effects on Hop1 localization. What this paper clearly demonstrates is context dependence for recombination protein utilization. The title of the paper is thus spot-on. But the Discussion needs to be more cautious in interpreting the possible causes of the context dependence, because there is just not enough information here to make strong conclusions."

Since the values are the ratio of two means, range is not applicable. In addition, values are a mix of dependent (8 and 9 hr samples from the same time course) and independent values (everything else), so formally it is not legitimate to calculate standard deviations. Instead, we removed error bars and representations of significance from these panels, and figure legends have been appropriately adjusted. We believe that these bar graphs still have value (see below), in that they enhance comprehensibility. We would prefer to retain them, but will remove them if requested. If error bars are deemed necessary, then we can calculate standard deviations for these ratios (we agree that S.E.M. was not correct), keeping in mind that such a calculation is not strictly legitimate."
