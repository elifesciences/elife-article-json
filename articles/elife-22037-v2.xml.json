Individual ORFs on the mRNA are differentially translated, with rates varying as much as 100-fold. The signals controlling differential translation are poorly understood. Our genome-wide mRNA secondary structure analysis indicated that operonic mRNAs are comprised of ORF-wide units of secondary structure that vary across ORF boundaries such that adjacent ORFs on the same mRNA molecule are structurally distinct. ORF translation rate is strongly correlated with its mRNA structure in vivo, and correlation persists, albeit in a reduced form, with its structure when translation is inhibited and with that of in vitro refolded mRNA. These data suggest that intrinsic ORF mRNA structure encodes a rough blueprint for translation efficiency. This structure is then amplified by translation, in a self-reinforcing loop, to provide the structure that ultimately specifies the translation of each ORF."

Individual ORFs on the mRNA are differentially translated, with rates varying as much as 100-fold. The signals controlling differential translation are poorly understood. Our genome-wide mRNA secondary structure analysis indicated that operonic mRNAs are comprised of ORF-wide units of secondary structure that vary across ORF boundaries such that adjacent ORFs on the same mRNA molecule are structurally distinct. ORF translation rate is strongly correlated with its mRNA structure in vivo, and correlation persists, albeit in a reduced form, with its structure when translation is inhibited and with that of in vitro refolded mRNA. These data suggest that intrinsic ORF mRNA structure encodes a rough blueprint for translation efficiency. This structure is then amplified by translation, in a self-reinforcing loop, to provide the structure that ultimately specifies the translation of each ORF."

Thus, to optimize cellular efficiency, the rate of synthesis of each protein must be carefully controlled. In bacteria, operons are central to this process. Open reading frames (ORFs) with related functions are organized into operons that are transcribed as a single mRNA ensuring that operonic genes are transcriptionally co-regulated in response to various conditions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jacob and Monod, 1961</a>). Additionally, the translation of each ORF in the operon is precisely tuned to cellular need. Indeed, the rate of protein production (i.e. the translation efficiency) of adjacent ORFs on a single mRNA can vary by as much as 100-fold, and members of protein complexes encoded on a single mRNA are generally translated in proportion to their stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Understanding how the cell achieves optimal energy utilization critically depends on understanding how mRNA sequence features reliably drive ORF-specific translation."

Both the strength and accessibility of a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence upstream from the initiation codon (<a href=\"#bib44\">Steitz and Jakes, 1975</a>) have been implicated in translatability. In support of the importance of SD accessibility, highly stable mRNA structures in direct proximity to the initiation codon diminish translatability (<a href=\"#bib8\">de Smit and van Duin, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hall et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lodish, 1970</a>) and rare codons that disfavor RNA structure are enriched in positions immediately following the translation start site (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentele et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Eyre-Walker and Bulmer, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Scharff et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, several studies examining either synthetic ORFs with a few bases difference (e.g. alterations to GFP), or fluorescent reporter assays studying the effect of multiple codon changes in the 5\u2019 UTR and N-terminal coding sequences, find that models based on their predicted RNA structure at the translation start site are relatively successful at predicting their differences in translatability (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goodman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kudla et al., 2009</a>). Most recently, codon usage has emerged as an important variable for translation. A large study examining thousands of foreign ORFs concluded that except for the very initial nucleotides of the ORF, codon usage rather than mRNA folding propensity was the critical determinant for translatability (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bo\u00ebl et al., 2016</a>)."

First, all the high-throughput studies overexpressed the mRNAs they studied, which is known to perturb the charged tRNA pool and introduce biases in codon usage (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dittmar et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Elf et al., 2003</a>). Second, in the Boel et al. manuscript and in other studies, mRNAs were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase, which not only elongates significantly faster than <i>E. coli</i> RNA polymerase but also removes the influence of the many endogenous <i>E. coli</i> RNA polymerase binding proteins that modulate its elongation rate. Where examined, such RNAs exhibit altered folding patterns (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lewicki et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chao et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pan et al., 1999</a>). Thus, these transcripts likely have non-native structure. Third, these studies all used foreign mRNAs, which had not been subjected to evolution for precise tuning in <i>E. coli.</i> Finally, these studies primarily measured protein abundance, a quantity that is dependent on mRNA and protein stability as well as on the efficiency at which each ORF is translated."

To accomplish this, we systematically assessed the translational efficiency (TE)\u00a0of every ORF mRNA and then examined which of its features (e.g. secondary structure, codon usage, and the strength of ribosome binding site) correlated with its translatability. The translation efficiency of endogenous messages in <i>E. coli</i> could be probed with existing global technologies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Oh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>) and the effects of codon usage with two metrics, tAI (tRNA adaptation index) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">dos Reis et al., 2004</a>) and codon influence (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bo\u00ebl et al., 2016</a>). However, in vivo mRNA structure has not previously been empirically evaluated at the global level in <i>E. coli.</i> We therefore adapted the dimethyl sulfate (DMS)-seq technique (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rouskin et al., 2014</a>), which uses next-generation sequencing to determine chemical accessibility of RNA to DMS, to <i>E. coli</i>. Our studies point to a critical role of intrinsic ORF-wide differences in mRNA structure in allowing differential translation of ORFs sharing the same operonic mRNAs."

Signal threshold of 0.2 has 90% agreement with the crystal structure. (<b>D</b>) Structural prediction for <i>rimM</i>. The predicted <i>rimM</i> structure is based on a minimum free-energy prediction constrained by our DMS-seq measurements, using the same 0.2 threshold used for the 16S rRNA in (<b>B</b>), which agrees with the <i>rimM</i> structure proposed and mutationally verified in <a href=\"#bib48\">Wikstr\u00f6m et al.

(<b>E</b>) Calculation of the Gini index from the DMS-seq signal is indicated schematically by comparing highly structured regions to less structured regions. For a region of mRNA, the cumulative fraction of the total DMS-seq signal is plotted against the cumulative fraction of the total number of positions as a Lorenz Curve. The extent to which the curve sags below the diagonal indicates the degree of inequality of distribution, which is quantified by the Gini index defined as the ratio of the area between the diagonal line and the Lorenz Curve (a) to the area below the diagonal line (a + b). A high Gini index indicates high level of mRNA structure, and vice versa. (<b>F</b>) Histogram of Gini indices of <i>E. coli</i> ORFs calculated from in vivo DMS-seq data at 37\u00b0C.

We tested whether the Gini scores across ORFs remained correlated in the absence of translation in two different conditions. First, we examined Gini scores of in vivo mRNA when translation initiation was inhibited with kasugamycin. We achieved rapid inhibition by using a\u00a0\u0394<i>gcvB</i> mutant, which has enhanced kasugamycin uptake rates (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shiver et al., 2016</a>). Using \u2206<i>gcvB</i> mutant is critical for this experiment because kasugamycin uptake by wild-type\u00a0(WT) cells is slow enough to allow massive degradation of mRNA before ribosomes are cleared (see extended methods for protocol and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a> for method validation, including demonstrating that <i>\u2206gcvB</i> does not alter global mRNA structure). Second, we examined Gini scores of purified mRNA refolded in vitro at 37\u00b0C. In both cases, the translation-independent mRNA structures obtained from DMS-seq indicated that Gini scores across the ORF mRNAs remain correlated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>). This correlation also holds true for computationally predicted mRNA structure of ORFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Moreover, the degree/extent of mRNA structures (henceforth referred to as structure) determined in these various ways are highly correlated with each other (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>). We conclude that mRNA is organized in ORF-wide structures that depend on the intrinsic sequence of the mRNA."

We asked whether TE is correlated solely to the mRNA structure that results from ribosome unwinding or whether it is also correlated to the intrinsic mRNA structure that exists in the absence of translation. We find that when translation is inhibited in vivo (e.g. following kasugamycin treatment), the absolute correlation of TE to structure remains high but decreases somewhat (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.58, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and that there is a small further decrease in correlation when mRNAs are refolded in vitro (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.48, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Additionally, computationally predicted structures of entire ORFs also show robust correlation to their TE\u2019s (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.52, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>).

This suggests that codon bias may be evolutionally selected to correspond to the ORF expression level rather than to its translation efficiency. Additionally, there is evidence that codon usage correlates with mRNA half-life in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bo\u00ebl et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Presnyak et al., 2015</a>). ORF-wide codon usage (tAI) and intrinsic mRNA structure appear to be largely independent variables, as they show little correlation with each other (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Although a novel metric quantifying codon influence was highly successful at predicting protein production from overexpressed exogenous genes transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bo\u00ebl et al., 2016</a>), it is relatively weakly correlated with TE under physiological conditions for endogenous genes (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.29) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This suggests that the codons providing efficient translation of an over-expressed transgene may differ from the efficient codons for an endogenous gene, as overexpression causes amino acid starvation and concomitant alteration of charged tRNA pools (<a href=\"#bib36\">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Welch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dittmar et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Elf et al., 2003</a>)."

A linear regression model that includes the addition of the Boel metric, tAI, and Shine-Dalgarno sequence strength showed marginal improvement in the predictive power compared to the ORF-wide structure alone (Figure 4\u2014source data 1). Therefore, rather than being a driver for TE, codon optimization may be critical for highly expressed genes due to higher demand for these tRNAs and may play a role in setting the appropriate mRNA half-life."

                                "text": "Our results thus far indicate that the rules for endogenous translation differ from those for overexpressed genes, particularly in the role of codon choice. Considering the fact that the expression of each tRNA species is tuned to the endogenous usage of its cognate codon(s) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 1996</a>), overexpressed transgenes are likely to perturb the balance between codon usage and tRNA abundance, creating a global translation defect (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shah et al., 2013</a>). To directly test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of transgene overexpression containing one codon at a time. We constructed a synthetic gene with only one sense codon after the initiating codon and expressed this minimal ORF to directly assess the influence of a single tRNA and amino acid without additional complications from the protein product. When the minimal ORF contains the rare leucine codon CUA, which has only one cognate tRNA, we observed elevated ribosome occupancy at CUA codons in endogenous genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). In particular, slow translation at CUA codons in the <i>leuL</i> leader sequence triggers the expression of leucine biosynthetic genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), whereas overexpressing the minimal ORF with the common leucine codon CUG or without any coding sequence does not change the expression level or ribosome occupancy at leucine codons of endogenous genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G and I</a>). These results suggest that overexpression of a rare codon and not a common codon can deplete the pool of free cognate aa-tRNA molecules, leading to global perturbation of translation. Cells expressing a transgene that contain more rare codons are thus under a different physiological state compared to WT cells solely expressing endogenous genes."

Numerous studies have investigated the important question of which features control protein production from overexpressed, foreign ORF mRNAs, identifying codon usage and local structure around the translation start site as key variables. However, these studies have left open the question of which mRNA features regulate endogenous translation. The importance of this question is highlighted by the observation that the rate of protein production from each ORF in a polycistronic mRNA can vary as much as 100-fold. Our global study now examines this issue. Our principal finding is that ORF mRNAs have modular structures within polycistronic mRNAs and that ORF-wide mRNA structure rather than codon usage correlates most strongly with the translation efficiency of endogenous ORFs."

Each ORF mRNA in the operon has a characteristic degree of structure, with highly correlated Gini scores between their first and second halves. This correlation persists in the absence of translation, when mRNAs are refolded in vitro and when structure is determined computationally (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). In stark contrast, there is little correlation between the extent of structure in adjacent ORFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Additionally, and consistent with earlier computational findings, we observe a small\u00a0~25 nucleotide region beginning at the translation start that is more unstructured than the remainder of the ORF (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Thus, polycistronic mRNAs consist of a series of ORF-wide modules each with characteristic but different extents of structure, punctuated by regions of low basepairing at the translation start site (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Maintenance of a common degree of structure throughout an ORF suggests that this parameter, like reduced structure at the start of ORFs, is a selective force in the evolution of ORF sequence, providing yet another constraint on mRNA sequence beyond codon adaptation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sharp and Li, 1987</a>)."

We have begun to deconvolute the \u2018chicken and egg\u2019 problem of whether mRNA structure is a cause or a consequence of translation by examining the correlation of TE to ORF-wide structure when translation is inhibited. This removes the ribosome contribution but retains vectorial folding, RNA binding proteins and in vivo concentrations of salts and macromolecules. Untranslated mRNA structure is highly correlated with TE but less so than translated mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>). Moreover, the difference in the mRNA structure of an ORF with and without translation is highly correlated to its TE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Thus, poorly translated mRNAs, have virtually identical extents of structure with and without translation, but more highly translated RNAs become increasingly more unstructured. Finally, computationally predicted structures or those obtained from in vitro refolded mRNAs correlate somewhat more poorly with TE (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.52 or \u22120.48 respectively) than the structure of untranslated in vivo mRNA (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.58) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>).

As the translation termination codon of most ORFs is separated by less than 25nt of untranslated mRNA from the start site of the downstream ORF, the abundant ribosomes of the highly translated ORF could transiently open the structure of the poorly\u00a0translated ORF and increase the accessibility of its start site. The propensity for in-ORF mRNA folding at both the beginning and ends of ORFs may prevent the upstream ORF from influencing the structure and hence TE of the downstream ORF, effectively insulating each ORF from its neighbors. We have identified small regions, located about 25\u201350 nucleotides both downstream and upstream of ORF translation start sites that preferentially pair within their ORFs. These regions may reinforce the folding barriers between adjacent ORF mRNAs, as we demonstrated for the <i>dusB-fis</i> operon. Interestingly, RNA polymerase pausing is enriched at translation start sites (<a href=\"#bib26\">Larson et al., 2014</a>) and this may reinforce ORF-centric structural insulation by allowing ORFs to fold independently during the pioneer round of translation."

Alternatively, a constant degree of ORF-wide mRNA structure may be the most robust way to ensure the appropriate amount of mRNA structure around the translation initiation site. In support of this idea, a recent study using in situ codon mutation of the <i>E. coli</i> essential gene <i>infA</i> showed that mutations of codons even far downstream from the start of the gene can be deleterious if they disrupt the native 5\u2019 RNA conformation via long-range structural interactions predicted computationally (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kelsic et al., 2016</a>). ORF-wide structures may also play additional roles. For high TE (poorly structured) ORFs, extended lack of structure may provide the landing pad necessary to capture a large pool of non-specifically bound 30S subunits to wait for opening of the SD and start codon, the so-called \u2018standby model\u2019 of translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adhin and van Duin, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Smit and van Duin, 2003</a>). Additionally, the ORF-centric mRNA folding strategy may have been driven by the necessity for adjacent ORFs to have discrete, often significantly different TEs. Finally, ORF-wide mRNA structures may help set the rate of endonucleolytic cleavage. The function of these modules is an important area for future inquiry."

This difference may arise from the fact that codon usage and tRNA abundance are largely balanced under physiological conditions, but become imbalanced when foreign ORFs are overexpressed, and we have directly demonstrated that this is the case (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013I</a>). This suggests that synthetic biologists and the cell tune translation in different ways. However, synthetic biologists struggle to robustly program differential translation of ORFs on the same mRNA. Our finding that polycistronic mRNAs consist of ORF-wide modules with set amounts of structure that are insulated from their neighbors may be key to this issue. Design approaches that incorporate appropriate mRNA structures may have the potential to produce the finely tuned synthesis rates observed in natural operons."

To calculate mRNA abundance, the number of mRNA sequencing reads mapped to a gene, following a Winsorization applied to trim the top and bottom 5% of reads, was divided by the length of the gene to yield the number of reads corresponding to the message per thousand bases of message per million sequencing reads (RPKM). The protein synthesis rate of individual ORFs was measured by average ribosome footprint density of the ORF calculated as described in (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2014</a>). First, genes with less than 128 reads mapped and genes with unconventional translation events were excluded from the analysis, which include\u00a0(1) genes encoding selenoproteins (e.g. <i>fdhF</i>, <i>fdoG</i>, <i>fdnG</i>); (2) proteins with nearly identical coding sequences (e.g. <i>gadA</i> and <i>gadB</i>, <i>ynaE</i> and <i>ydfK</i>, <i>ldrA</i> and <i>ldrC</i>, <i>ybfD</i> and <i>yhhI</i>, <i>tfaR</i> and <i>tfaQ</i>, <i>rzoD</i> and <i>rzoR</i>, <i>pinR</i> and <i>pinQ</i>). Second, sequencing reads from ribosome profiling mapped to the first and last five codons of the gene were excluded to remove effects of translation and termination. Third, correction for the variations in translation elongation rate was done in three steps as described in <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al. (2014</a>): (1) correcting for the elevated ribosome footprint density observed for the first 50\u2013100 codons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oh et al., 2011</a>); (2) correcting for the elevated density at the ribosomal anti-Shine-Dalgarno (aSD) site (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>); (3) correcting for other possible ribosome pausing using 90% Winsorization, by removing the top and bottom 5% of the ribosome profiling signal for each gene. Finally, the average ribosome footprint density of a gene was calculated by dividing the corrected number of mapped ribosome footprint reads by the corrected length of the gene. Translation efficiency of a gene was calculated by normalizing the average ribosome footprint density by the mRNA abundance of the gene (defined above).

To identify adjacent ORFs expressed as a single operon, we assessed mRNA-seq data for equivalent mean message level and for signal continuity, as described below. Equivalent mean message level was assessed by first determining the variability in mean mRNA-seq read density within individual ORFs. There is a single transcript that extends over the entire body of the large majority of ORFs, and so the variability in mean read density level in the first half of each ORF was compared to mean read density in the second half of each ORF, and the variability in this distribution was used to define a cut-off for ORFs on a single message. Adjacent ORFs that fell within a 2\u03c3 cutoff in mean level (calculated to be a 1.5-fold difference in mRNA level) were determined to have equivalent mRNA level and were then assessed for signal continuity. Signal continuity was assessed by first determining the distribution of read density in windows within messages. Gini index of mRNA-seq signal was calculated for all 80nt windows within ORF bodies, and the variability in this distribution was again used to define a cutoff for continuous mRNA regions. Gini index were then calculated for 80nt windows tiling the region between adjacent ORFs. Gene pairs that fell within a 2\u03c3 cutoff defined by the intra-ORF distribution were considered to be a pair of adjacent ORFs on a single message."

Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BIO-RAD,\u00a0Hercules\u00a0CA). The membrane was first incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Fis antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Reid C. Johnson at UCLA) and mouse monoclonal anti-RNAP \u03b2 subunit antibody (abcam,\u00a0Cambridge\u00a0MA), and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye 800CW and anti-mouse IgG IRDye 680RD secondary antibodies (LI-COR,\u00a0Lincoln\u00a0NE). The blots were visualized and quantified by an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR). The amount of Fis protein in each sample was normalized against the amount of RNAP \u03b2 subunit in the same sample."

Despite overall enthusiasm, there are several key statistical issues that need to be addressed (see reviewer 2 comments) including an evaluation of the statistical significance of the comparisons in correlations (which were done for different sets of genes). The reviewers also agreed in consultation that the ideal approach to take would be to perform a multiple regression analysis (reviewer 2, point 5) to explain TE using the various parameters (mRNA structure, codon bias, SD sequence, structure around start codons, etc.). These statistical analyses should be reasonably straightforward and would significantly increase the impact of the manuscript."

Using a genome-wide RNA structural probing method (DMS-Seq) the authors have made a major discovery, that mRNA structure occurs in modules or blocks corresponding to ORFs, where adjacent ORFs often have very different levels of structure. mRNA structure is strongly anti-correlated with translational efficiency. While they offer a sophisticated discussion about the role of translating ribosomes in opening up mRNA structure, they argue that the structure is to a large extent encoded within the mRNA sequence itself on the basis of structural probing experiments in cells where translation is inhibited, with in vitro refolded RNA, and in silico analyses of the thermodynamics of folding. Finally, they argue forcefully that for endogenous <i>E. coli</i> genes, mRNA structure is a more reliable predictor of translational efficiency than codon adaptation (tAI) or the recently published codon influence metric. The experiments are well controlled, clearly explained, and compelling, and their findings have important implications for gene expression in bacteria."

In fact, ORF-wide secondary structure is a much better predictor of TE than other parameters (SD, tAI).

This coverage requirement was also reported in analyzing DMS-MaPseq data from yeast (Meghan et al., 2016). For <i>E. coli</i> genome-wide DMS-seq data, ~30% genes passed this filter due to the low abundance of some mRNAs, deficiency of DMS modification, and/or the experimental noise. The ksg-treated samples have the lowest sequence coverage and therefore lowest number of genes passing the filter, likely due to the degradation of mRNA when ribosomes run off after the treatment. We note that the analysis after kasugamycin treatment is possible only because of the high response strain (\u0394<i>gcvB</i>) that we developed. We have added the explanation of the criteria for gene selection for DMS-seq data in the text. We indicate the number of ORFs in each analysis in the body of the figure and perform all analyses for both the ORFs passing the \u2265 15 DMS-seq reads/nt cutoff in each conditions and the set of 421 ORFs that passed the cutoff in all 3 conditions (DMS-seq of wt cells in vivo, ksg-treated cells in vivo, and in vitro modified mRNA)."

Supporting this conclusion, the correlation between TE and Gini of gene body (60:end) is slightly lower than that between TE and full ORF Gini, but the difference is significant (p &lt; 2.2e-16, K-S test comparing the two bootstrapped distributions of Spearman\u2019s \u03c1)."
