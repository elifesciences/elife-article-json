Most of these processes rely on the fact that each of the two strands that make up a DNA molecule can be used as a template to build the other strand. However, this is not possible if both strands of the DNA break in the same place. This form of damage can be repaired in a process called homologous recombination, which uses an identical copy of the broken DNA molecule to repair the broken strands. As a result, this process can only occur during cell division shortly after a cell has duplicated its DNA."

This involves one of the broken strands swapping places with part of the equivalent strand in the intact DNA molecule. To do so, the strands of the intact DNA molecule separate in the region that will be used for the repair, and the broken strand can then use the other non-broken DNA strand as a template to replace any missing sections of DNA. The region of the intact DNA molecule where the strands need to separate often grows during this process: this is known as branch migration. In bacteria, a protein called RecA plays a fundamental role in controlling strand exchange, but there are other, similar proteins whose roles in homologous recombination are less well known."

This revealed that RadA can bind to single-stranded DNA and stimulate branch migration to increase the rate of homologous recombination. Further investigation revealed that RadA allows branch migration to occur even when RecA is missing, but that RadA is unable to begin strand exchange if RecA is not present. The process of branch migration stabilizes the DNA molecules during homologous recombination and may also allow the repaired DNA strand to engage the machinery that copies DNA."

The first phase is the formation of the presynaptic filament on ssDNA. RecA filaments form when dimers nucleate on DNA in a slow step (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bell et al., 2012</a>); subsequently the filament is extended in both directions, although at a higher rate at the 3\u2019 end of the RecA:ssDNA filament. When ssDNA is bound in the primary DNA binding site of the RecA filament, it is underwound relative to B-form dsDNA such that the RecA-DNA filament has about 18 bases per turn (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Galletto et al., 2006</a>). ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, is required for active RecA filament formation.

After homologous DNA molecules are paired, the third phase of strand exchange involves branch migration, in which the region of heteroduplex DNA formed between the two strand exchange partners is extended. The heteroduplex is initially bound through RecA primary site interactions, with the displaced strand(s) in the secondary site (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mazin and Kowalczykowski, 1998</a>). ATP hydrolysis is required for complete heteroduplex product formation when the homologous molecules exceed several kilobases in length (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jain et al., 1994</a>)."

In addition, loss of RadA reduces homologous recombination when in combination with loss of RuvAB or RecG (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beam et al., 2002</a>), as measured by conjugation with Hfr donors. RuvAB and RecG are DNA motor proteins that branch-migrate recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions during the late stages of homologous recombination (reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib48\">Persky and Lovett, 2008</a>). For sensitivity to genotoxins including azidothymidine (AZT), ciprofloxacin (CPX) and UV irradiation, mutations in <i>radA</i> are especially strongly synergistic with those in <i>recG</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beam et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper et al., 2015</a>). This genotoxin-sensitivity in <i>radA recG</i> strains appears to be due, in part, to the accumulation of recombination intermediates, since it can be suppressed by early blocks to recombination (by mutations in <i>recF</i> or <i>recA</i>) or by overexpression of RuvAB (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper et al., 2015</a>).

The N-terminal 30 amino acids form a putative zinc-finger domain with a C4 motif, CXXC-X<sub>n</sub>-CXXC. In bacteria, proteins with this domain include the DNA repair proteins UvrA and RecR, and the ATP-dependent serine protease ClpX. <i>The E. coli radA100</i> mutation, a C28Y mutation in the putative Zn finger motif, negates <i>radA</i> function in vivo and is partially dominant (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Diver et al., 1982b</a>). The second RadA domain (aa 59\u2013184) is homologous to the ATPase region of RecA and contains both Walker A and Walker B boxes and regions homologous to its L1 and L2 loops involved in primary site DNA binding. A RadA-K108R mutation at the Walker A sequence is a dominant-negative RadA allele in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper et al., 2015</a>). The C-terminal 150 amino acids comprise a predicted S5 domain 2-type fold, (EMBL-EBI Interpro subgroup IPR014721, <a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR014721\">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/IPR014721</a>), present in ribosomal proteins S5 and S9, EF-G, Lon, RNase P, MutL, and several DNA topoisomerases. Deletion of this domain negates RadA functions in vivo (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cooper et al., 2015</a>). In BLAST alignments, this region is most closely related to the ATP-dependent serine protease Lon (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chung and Goldberg, 1981</a>). Mutation of serine 372 of RadA, comparable in alignments to the active site serine of Lon, did not affect RadA genetic function and this serine is not conserved among RadAs; this and the lack of other conserved residues of the Lon protease catalytic triad indicate that RadA is unlikely to possess serine protease activity. Between the RecA and S5 domain 2 domains, there is a conserved motif specific to RadA proteins, KNRFG, a motif also found in the phage 29 structure-specific nuclease (<a href=\"#bib22\">Giri et al., 2009</a>).

We found that the wild-type RadA protein preferentially binds single-strand DNA in the presence of ADP, exhibits ATPase activity stimulated by DNA, and increases the rate of RecA-mediated recombination in vitro\u00a0by stimulation of branch migration. Branch migration can be mediated by RadA even in the absence of RecA and is highly directional in nature, with\u00a0preferential extension of the heteroduplex in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction, relative to the initiating single-strand; this is codirectional with that of RecA-mediated strand exchange. Mutations in the Walker A, KNRFG and zinc finger motifs abolish RadA\u2019s branch migration activity in RecA-coupled reactions and lead to the accumulation of strand exchange intermediate species. The ability of RadA to catalyze branch migration in the context of the RecA filament and its codirectionality with strand exchange distinguish it from other branch migration functions in <i>E. coli</i>, RecG and RuvAB (<a href=\"#bib71\">Whitby et al., 1993</a>).

Like RecA, RadA\u2019s ATPase activity is strongly stimulated by ssDNA. However, RadA\u2019s ATPase is also substantially stimulated by dsDNA whereas dsDNA stimulates RecA's ATPase only after a lag period (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kowalczykowski et al., 1987</a>). RadA\u2019s ATPase activity in the presence of ssDNA was measured to have a kcat of 29.4\u2009min<sup>-1</sup>, comparable to that of RecA (<a href=\"#bib68\">Weinstock et al., 1981</a>). Addition of single-strand DNA-binding (SSB) protein after incubation of RadA or RecA with ssDNA was observed to repress the ATPase activity of RadA, whereas it slightly stimulated the ATPase of RecA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This latter observation suggests that, although RecA exhibits stable binding to ssDNA when challenged by SSB, less stable binding by RadA allows for SSB competition and inhibition of its ATPase activity. RadA ATPase activity measured with a variety of different DNA structures formed by oligonucleotides, including forks, splays, and other branched structures, showed no significant difference from that with ssDNA (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although these DNA molecules are\u00a0only very weakly bound by RadA in gel shift experiments (data not shown), they are sufficient to stimulate RadA\u2019s ATPase activity, indicating some transient or unstable association."

Presynaptic filaments are formed by the\u00a0incubation of RecA with ssDNA, linear dsDNA is then added and the reaction is initiated by the addition of ATP and SSB.

In this regimen, RecA catalyzes the formation of branched DNA molecules within 5 min, which are converted to the relaxed circular dsDNA final product by 18 min. Addition of RadA, at a 1:17 stoichiometry relative to RecA, accelerated final product formation, such that the reaction was complete by 5\u2009min, with no detectable accumulation of branched intermediates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Although RadA did not change the efficiency of the RecA strand-exchange reaction, RadA enhanced the branch migration phase of the reaction to yield the final product more quickly.

Therefore, RadA need not be present in the reaction during RecA presynaptic filament formation and can stimulate branch migration from RecA-promoted strand-exchange intermediates. Order-of-addition experiments (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) measuring RecA-mediated strand exchange, with and without RadA, showed that RadA strongly stimulated branch migration when added before SSB, but not when added after. In addition, RadA did not detectably stimulate RecA-strand exchange in the absence of SSB. RadA stimulated RecA-mediated strand exchange reactions when RecA concentrations were reduced to suboptimal levels but did not when RecA became limiting (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

As an indication of how RadA might affect the RecA filament, we assayed ADP-inhibition of the standard RecA 3-strand reaction (lacking an ATP-regenerating system), at various concentrations relative to a fixed amount of ATP, 5 mM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In 60 min reactions with RecA alone, ADP completely inhibited strand-exchange at 4 mM. In reactions containing both RecA and RadA, ADP inhibition of strand exchange was almost complete at 1 mM and complete at 2 mM. Furthermore, even without ADP addition, RadA inhibited RecA 3-strand transfer reactions that lack an ATP-regeneration system. We note that under these reaction conditions, which include SSB, RadA\u2019s ATPase is inhibited (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), so this result is not simply due to a higher rate of ATP depletion by the mere addition of RadA. Under the conditions used for RecA presynaptic filament formation, addition of RadA at 1:17 RadA:RecA caused a slight reduction in the measured ATPase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which appears to be primarily due to RecA. This may indicate some removal and replacement of RecA with RadA on ssDNA, or alternatively, that RadA, at substoichiometric amounts, can inhibit RecA\u2019s ATPase while bound to ssDNA. RadA did not promote RecA strand transfer or joint molecule formation when SSB was omitted from the reaction (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) indicating that RadA does not assist nucleation or filament extension under these conditions. Under no conditions examined did we find that RadA by itself could promote strand-pairing and exchange (for example, see <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

These reactions substitute dATP for ATP, which promotes higher affinity of RecA for ssDNA, and lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. As reported previously, the RecA mutant readily catalyzes strand-pairing to form branched intermediates but is inefficient at branch migration to form the final relaxed circular dsDNA product. RadA did indeed accelerate branch migration in RecA K72R-mediated reactions, with final nicked circular product ('NP') visible at 30\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Interestingly, the RadA K258A mutant appeared to arrest branch migration, with the accumulation of slowly-migrating intermediate species.

In contrast, RadA S372A appeared fully wild-type in its ability to accelerate strand-exchange. These experiments show that RadA\u2019s ATPase activity, negated in the K108R mutant, is required to stimulate branch migration. RadA K258A, a dominant-negative mutant in the 'RadA motif', not only did not accelerate branch migration but also interfered with RecA\u2019s ability to branch migrate, suggesting it binds either to intermediate structures and/or RecA to block the reaction.

In the RecA RadA-coupled reaction, the final product was visible at the first time point, 10 min, and accumulation of intermediates was not observed.

This mechanism underlies a number of repair events associated with DSBs, including transposon-mediated breaks in Drosophila (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nassif et al., 1994</a>), mating-type switching in yeast (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haber et al., 2004</a>) and radiation damage-repair in the bacterium <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zahradka et al., 2006</a>).

In this case, RadA protein appears to promote the initial joints that prime DNA synthesis but could, in theory, also participate in the subsequent branch migration that resolves such joints to allow annealing. Alternatively, this dissolution might be catalyzed by RecG, whose polarity seems suited for this role (Whitby et\u00a0al., 1993).

One difference is that RadA can function in the context of the RecA synaptic filament, with branches migrated in the direction of RecA-promoted strand transfer. In contrast, when purified RuvAB or RecG are added to ongoing RecA-strand transfer reactions, they decrease the recovery of full strand-exchange products, by accelerating the reverse reaction back to substrate forms (<a href=\"#bib71\">Whitby et al., 1993</a>).

RuvB acts as the motor, pumping DNA through the complex and thereby moving the position of the junction. RuvAB has classical helicase activity (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tsaneva et al., 1993</a>), unwinding DNA strands, and, through the RuvA complex, special affinity for branched structures (<a href=\"#bib45\">Parsons and West, 1993</a>). The magnitude of RuvAB ATPase activity depends on the DNA structures to which it is bound (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abd Wahab et al., 2013</a>). The RuvAB complex interacts with a nuclease component, RuvC, coupling branch migration to junction cleavage (<a href=\"#bib69\">West, 1997</a>).

ATP hydrolysis is required for RecA strand transfer over extended distances (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jain et al., 1994</a>); how ATP hydrolysis promotes branch migration via the RecA mechanism is not well understood. Unlike RuvAB, RecA has no special affinity for branched DNA structures nor can it act as a DNA helicase/translocase. The mechanism by which RadA branch migrates DNA is not known, although its RecA-like sequence character, lack of structure-specific binding or helicase activity might suggest a RecA-like mechanism.

Because of its role in synapsis, RecA binding needs to be highly specific for ssDNA, lest it bind indiscriminately to the undamaged chromosome. RadA cannot pair DNA and has weak ability to bind ssDNA, in comparison to RecA. Its capacity to bind DNA in the presence of ADP is an intriguing property. In a study of a RecA mutant (P67G E68A, near the Walker A motif), strand-exchange between lengthy homologies (but not homologies &lt;2 kb) was highly stimulated by ADP and completely inhibited by ATP or an ATP-regenerating system. This finding suggests that the ADP-form of the RecA filament is required, in some way, for the branch migration phase of strand-exchange, as revealed by this particular mutant. RadA binding behavior may naturally reflect this propensity and the stable binding of RadA in the presence of ADP may explain its superior ability to promote branch migration, relative to that by RecA. RadA has stronger dsDNA-stimulated ATPase activity relative to RecA, which may also assist branch migration. Because the role of ATP hydrolysis in RecA strand-exchange is still unclear, further study of RadA-mediated branch migration may provide valuable insights into this mechanism."

Typically, the transformation mix was grown for 1\u2009hr at 37\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0in SOC media (2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 20 mM glucose, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl), diluted into 20 ml SOC supplemented with ampicillin ('Ap', 100 \u03bcg/ml) and then grown standing overnight. This culture was used as the inoculum for a 1\u2009l LB (2% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) culture with Ap. Cultures were grown until the A<sub>590</sub> reached approximately 0.8 at which time IPTG (Gold Biotechnology,\u00a0St.\u00a0Louis,\u00a0MO) was added to 1 mM and arabinose was added to 0.2% (for BL21 AI strains). Growth was continued for 3\u20134\u2009hr at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. For production of RadAC28Y and RadAK108A mutant protein, growth conditions were altered so that a 500 ml culture was grown from the initial 20 ml inoculum in LB supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin until the culture reached an A<sub>590</sub> of 1.0. Cells were then diluted into LB with 0.4% arabinose, 1 mM IPTG and fresh ampicillin. Growth was continued 2\u2009hr at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. After growth of all strains, cells were collected by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was frozen and stored at -20\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0RadA was purified with slight modifications from the Biorad eXact protocol. Cleavage of the N-terminal eXact tag produces a RadA protein with the addition of a 2\u2009N-terminal amino acids, threonine serine, (necessary to facilitate efficient cleavage). Typically, pellets from 200 ml of wild type RadA culture were resuspended in 20 ml eXact buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 300 mM sodium acetate. (The final pH was adjusted to 7.2 if necessary). Cells were lysed by adding lysozyme (in eXact buffer) to 200 \u03bcg/ml and incubating for 45 min on ice. Lysis was completed by incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0for 2 min followed by homogenization using a Dounce Homogenizer on ice (5 passes with B, followed by 5 passes with A). The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 17000 x g for 30 min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0One third of the cleared lysate was applied to a 1 ml eXact pre-packed column equilibrated in eXact buffer at room temperature. The column was then washed with 15\u201320 ml eXact buffer. To cleave the eXact Tag from RadA, 2 ml cleavage buffer (eXact buffer + 100 mM NaF) was applied to the column, and the column was capped and incubated at room temperature for 45\u201360 min. RadA was then eluted from the column with eXact buffer + 100 mM NaF. Fractions containing RadA were pooled, diluted in small batches in Q buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 10\u00a0mM beta-mercaptoethanol) without salt to give a conductivity of approximately 125 mS<sup>-1</sup> and applied to a 1 ml Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with125 mM NaCl Q buffer. After washing with 15 ml 125 mM NaCl Q Buffer, RadA was eluted with a linear gradient from 125 mM NaCl in Q buffer to 750 mM NaCl in Q buffer with 20% glycerol replacing the ethylene glycol. RadA eluted at a conductivity approximately 275 mS<sup>-1</sup>. To retain activity, fractions containing RadA were immediately flash-frozen in small aliquots and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0Thawed aliquots were used within 24\u2009hr. Purification from 200 ml of cells yielded approximately 0.75\u20131 mg of highly purified RadA Protein (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For some experiments, purified RadA was concentrated using Q HP Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare,\u00a0Chicago,\u00a0IL).

Yet these (non-bound) polynucleotides stimulate the ATPase activity of RadA indicating that they do in fact interact with RadA. Presumably the interaction with poly(dT), observed by PAGE is a reflection of the stability of binding rather than binding per se \u2013 especially since binding is only seen in the presence of ADP. The turnover rates on the other substrates (and with ATP) may be significantly greater than that observed with poly(dT). Have attempts been made to stabilize complexes by glutaraldehyde fixation? Also, from the gel data provided it is not clear whether the observed binding band represents a defined RadA-DNA complex or an aggregate that fails to enter the gel. Binding assays would benefit from the use of quantitative assays such as fluorescence anisotropy or surface plasmon resonance, rather than gel assays. Given that RadA appears to drive junction branch migration, the assays should be carried out with single-stranded (both defined and random sequence), duplex, 3-arm and 4-arm (Holliday junction) DNA substrates. Only then will the substrate specificity become apparent. Overall, the sections on DNA binding and ATPase activity are na\u00efve and let the manuscript down."

An alternative, not considered by them, is that RadA uses a RecA-like strand transfer mechanism to branch migrate DNA. Because of the sequence similarity of RadA to RecA, including highly conserved residues in regions that align to primary and secondary DNA binding sites in RecA, we think that a RecA-like mechanism should be seriously considered. RecA does not act as a translocase or helicase and our failure to find RadA helicase activity may be consistent with a RecA-like mechanism. This idea has been added to the discussion, where we discuss both DNA pump and strand-transfer branch migration mechanisms. We note, in addition, that RecA does not have special affinity to branched structures, which may be true for RadA as well. RadA shows no structure-specific stimulation of its ATPase; this contrasts to RuvAB and RecG, which do show structure-specific stimulation of ATPase activity. We therefore disagree that demonstration of translocase or helicase activity should be a condition for publication \u2013 RadA may simply use another mechanism."

The reactions promoted by RecA can carry out the key reactions needed to reconstruct the fork. However, there has always been a problem. RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange has been too slow to account for the rates of fork reactivation observed in vivo. In this important work, Dr. Lovett and colleagues provide the first in vitro characterization of the E. coli RadA protein, a protein that likely solves the strand exchange rate problem. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the addition of RadA to RecA reactions provides an impressive boost to the rates of many RecA reactions, complementing RecA in these endeavors. Although the work opens many new questions about how the rate enhancements are brought about, the overall effort is an extremely important step and provides a window into the (until recently) obscure bacterial RadA protein that should stimulate much additional work. A series of thoughtfully designed point mutants also reveal that the key RadA activities are dependent on the ATP hydrolysis, Zn finger, and unique KNRFG motifs of RadA. While these data provide a great addition to our knowledge of homologous recombination, the following issues need to be addressed: The only RadA concentrations used in this study when RecA is present appear to be those needed to effect a 1:17 ratio with RecA (subsection \u201cStrand exchange reactions\u201d, first paragraph; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> legend).

In the paper cited by authors, (Witby et al., 1993), RuvAB was shown to stimulate RecA-mediated 4-strand exchange to produce final nicked product. Other papers also showed that RuvAB-mediated branch migration direction can be opposite to RecG or bidirectional (Matthew and Lloyd (1995) EMBO-J 14 3302-3310; Iwasaki et al.
