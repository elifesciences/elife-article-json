Depletion of PTBP2 in developing mouse cortex leads to degeneration of these tissues over the first three postnatal weeks, a time when the normal cortex expands and develops mature circuits. Cultured <i>Ptbp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> neurons exhibit the same initial viability as wild type, with proper neurite outgrowth and marker expression. However, these mutant cells subsequently fail to mature and die after a week in culture. Transcriptome-wide analyses identify many exons that share a pattern of mis-regulation in the mutant brains, where isoforms normally found in adults are precociously expressed in the developing embryo. These transcripts encode proteins affecting neurite growth, pre- and post-synaptic assembly, and synaptic transmission. Our results define a new genetic regulatory program, where PTBP2 acts to temporarily repress expression of adult protein isoforms until the final maturation of the neuron."

Depletion of PTBP2 in developing mouse cortex leads to degeneration of these tissues over the first three postnatal weeks, a time when the normal cortex expands and develops mature circuits. Cultured <i>Ptbp2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> neurons exhibit the same initial viability as wild type, with proper neurite outgrowth and marker expression. However, these mutant cells subsequently fail to mature and die after a week in culture. Transcriptome-wide analyses identify many exons that share a pattern of mis-regulation in the mutant brains, where isoforms normally found in adults are precociously expressed in the developing embryo. These transcripts encode proteins affecting neurite growth, pre- and post-synaptic assembly, and synaptic transmission. Our results define a new genetic regulatory program, where PTBP2 acts to temporarily repress expression of adult protein isoforms until the final maturation of the neuron."

In rodents, the time required for neuronal progenitors to become fully functional neurons can be many days, during which cells will exit mitosis, migrate to a proper location, grow initial neurites to be defined in their polarity, fully extend these axons and dendrites to their proper targets, and finally assemble active synaptic connections and circuits (<a href=\"#bib59\">Waites et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Craig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hamby et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</a>). A wide variety of genetic mechanisms ensure that these events occur in proper sequence and induce cell death when a process is incorrect. This developmental pathway is best understood at the level of transcriptional regulation where important signaling molecules, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications are implicated in lineage commitment, cell survival, and establishment of synaptic connections. However, many aspects of the genetic control of neuronal development are not understood."

In contrast, PTBP1 is expressed at high levels in neural progenitor cells, glia, and other non-neuronal cells, but is repressed in differentiating neurons coincident with the increase in PTBP2 concentration (<a href=\"#bib49\">Polydorides et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>). The repression of PTBP1 is mediated by the miRNA miR124 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>), which leads to the induction of PTBP2 expression through additional post-transcriptional mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Spellman et al., 2007</a>). SiRNA mediated depletion of PTBP1 stimulates PTBP2 expression and can be sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation of fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib61\">Xue et al., 2013</a>). However, the role of PTBP2 in differentiating neurons is not understood."

The best-characterized function of the two PTB proteins is in the regulation of alternative splicing patterns. PTBP1 and PTBP2 bind to CU-rich regulatory sequences within or adjacent to many alternative exons to repress or activate their splicing, or sometimes to cause intron retention (<a href=\"#bib62\">Xue et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Llorian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kafasla et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Keppetipola et al., 2012</a>). However the two proteins differ in their splicing regulatory activities. Some exons, such as exon 8A of the CaV1.2 calcium channel transcript (<i>Cacna1c</i>), are more strongly repressed by PTBP1 than PTBP2, whereas other exons, such as exon 18 of the PSD95 transcript (<i>Dlg4</i>), are affected by both proteins (<a href=\"#bib40\">Markovtsov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>).

This can be seen in the embryonic cortex and olfactory bulb where proliferating cells in the subventricular zone are stained for nestin, but more mature cells populating the outer cortical layers have lost nestin expression but gained PTBP2 immunoreactivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To investigate the function of PTBP2 in the developing brain, we generated a conditional null allele carrying loxP sites flanking exon 4 of the <i>Ptbp2</i> gene (<i>Ptbp2</i><sup><i>loxP</i></sup>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In targeted tissues, Cre-mediated deletion of exon 4 introduces a reading frame shift to render the allele null. Correct targeting in ES cells and germ line transmission were confirmed by Southern blot and PCR of genomic DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>).

Unlike their wild-type or heterozygous littermates, they do not respond to touch and appear completely paralyzed. Immunoblots of E18.5 whole brain lysates confirm the complete absence of PTBP2 in homozygous mutant mice and reduced protein in heterozygous mice compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We also do not observe a truncated PTBP2 protein arising from the mutant allele (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This phenotype is consistent with that of another full <i>Ptbp2</i> null allele (<a href=\"#bib37\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>).

However, these mutant mice displayed slower growth than their littermates and could be identified by their small size and low body weight as early as postnatal day 3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). By P14, their average weight was less than half of control pups, and they all died around weaning age (P18-21). The cause of the <i>Ptbp2</i>-EmxKO pups\u2019 failure to thrive was apparent upon dissection of their brains. The <i>Ptbp2</i>-EmxKO cortex appeared relatively normal at birth. However, while the control cortices thicken and grow in size during the first three postnatal weeks, largely due to development of the neuropil and white matter, the EmxKO cortex displayed widespread neuronal death and degeneration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). Brain structures not subject to PTBP2 loss, such as striatum, developed normally. The knockout tissue showed a progressive loss of structural integrity making it difficult to section and stain. Comparing coronal sections of mutant and control brains at P5, the EmxKO cortex was substantially thinner than control cortices. Nissl staining revealed widespread pyknotic nuclei within the EmxKO cortical plate as a result of neuronal cell death (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Further staining with more specific cell death markers showed evidence of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death but was difficult to quantify in the degenerating tissue (data not shown). Understanding the mechanisms initiating cell death in these tissues will require additional analyses. By P11, when control cortex had substantially thickened with well-defined cellular layers, the EmxKO cortex had further degenerated with additional loss of tissue integrity. The lateral ventricles were enlarged in EmxKO brains at both P5 and P11, and the corpus callosum was missing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and data not shown). Other brain structures where <i>Ptbp2</i> was inactivated were also defective in the EmxKO; the mutant hippocampus was significantly reduced in size and the lamination in the olfactory bulb was highly disrupted, with the Mitral cell layer entirely absent (data not shown)."

The paralysis phenotype of <i>Ptbp2</i> pan-neural knockout pups also implied defects in synaptic transmission. To assess whether neural development proceeded to later stages, such as synapse formation, in the absence of PTBP2, we examined the expression of several important synaptic proteins in the brains of E18 <i>Ptbp2</i> null mice. The mutant brains exhibited strikingly lower levels of multiple synaptic markers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), including PSD95, the neurotransmitter receptor NR2B, the major synaptic vesicle protein Synaptophysin (SYP), and the trans-synaptic scaffolding protein Neuroligin1 (NLG1). Other synaptic proteins, such as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Cask and the Glutamate Receptor GluR2 also declined. These results indicate that cells may be arrested or delayed in their maturation or that synapse formation may be otherwise defective in the absence of PTBP2."

Immediately after dissociation and plating, cortical neurons from E15-16 <i>Ptbp2</i>-NesKO mice exhibited similar viability to control neurons.

A similar catastrophic cell death occurred during the third week of culture in hippocampal neurons cultured from E18 <i>Ptbp2</i> null mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

To assess transcriptome changes caused by the loss of PTBP2, we carried out genomewide expression and splicing analyses of the nesKO mice, initially using splicing-sensitive exon junction microarrays (MJAY) analyzed by Omniviewer, and later using RNAseq and SpliceTrap analysis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Srinivasan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shen et al., 2012</a>).

Alternative splicing events that changed between wild type and mutant brains were ranked by Sepscore and q-value for microarray analysis, and by delta PSI (percent spliced in) and false discovery rate (FDR) for RNAseq (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Using cutoffs of a Sepscore of 0.345 for the arrays and a 10% change in PSI for the RNAseq, we identified 359 PTBP2 target cassette exons by array (Supplementary file 2 in Dryad [<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2014</a>])) and 597 exons by RNAseq (Supplementary file 3 in Dryad [<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2014</a>]). These included 92 exons found by both methods. Exons identified by RNAseq but not microarray included exons that were not represented on the array, exons exhibiting complex patterns of splicing, and a few exons where particular exon probes seemed to fail on the array. Alternative splicing events identified by array but not RNAseq included exons that did not pass the deltaPSI and/or overall expression filters, and a few exons that were absent from the SpliceTrap database. Combining the two methods provided a significant increase in the total set of splicing changes identified in the mutant mice."

For much of the brain, this time period represents a key phase of neuronal maturation when neurons project processes and establish synapses. The normal shift in splicing of these transcripts coincides with the known postnatal decrease in PTBP2 levels in the brain (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>), and the mutation of <i>Ptbp2</i> leads to a premature switch from embryonic to adult isoforms. In one example, the <i>Camk2b</i> gene contains two alternative exons that are mostly excluded from embryonic <i>Camk2b</i> transcripts, but are included in the adult isoform (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brocke et al., 1995</a>). These two cassette exons insert short peptide sequences into the variable domain of the protein to alter its autophosphorylation, its response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, and its association with F-actin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brocke et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bayer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">O\u2019Leary et al., 2006</a>).

PTBP2 levels remain high in the differentiating cells and then drop late in maturation, with adult neurons expressing moderate levels. It was previously shown that some exons are more strongly affected by PTBP1 than by PTBP2, whereas for other exons the regulatory effect of the two proteins is nearly equal (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Llorian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Keppetipola et al., 2012</a>). The expression profile of the PTB proteins thus creates three regulatory states during neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). PTBP1 maintains repression of many exons in neuronal progenitor cells. As cells begin to differentiate and shift to PTBP2 expression, exons that are more sensitive to PTBP1 begin to be spliced. These include the <i>c-src</i> N1 exon and exon 8A from the <i>Cacna1c</i> calcium channel transcript (<a href=\"#bib40\">Markovtsov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tang et al., 2011</a>). Later in neuronal maturation when PTBP2 levels drop, a second transition occurs with changes in the splicing of a new group of transcripts. We previously found that PSD95 exon 18 is controlled during this second transition (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>). We now identify a large network of exon targets that have this common regulatory profile and are precociously spliced in the <i>Ptbp2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice. Thus, one function of the PTBP2 protein is to maintain repression of a subset of PTBP1 target exons after PTBP1 is depleted in early differentiation. The differing sensitivity of target exons either to just PTBP1 or to both PTBP1 and PTBP2 presents an interesting mechanistic question of how an exon can be structured to respond to one protein or to both."

Licatalosi et al. also report microarray identification of PTBP2 target exons in germline null brain that largely overlap with exons we identify in the pan-CNS knockout brain by microarray and by RNAseq. They suggest a role for the PTBP2 splicing program in neurogenesis. We do not see defects in neurogenesis and commitment to neuronal lineages, but find a dramatic defect in the later maturation of neurons after their birth. This is in keeping with both the developmental timing of PTBP2 expression and the precocious expression of adult isoforms observed by both groups in the knockout mice."

                        "text": "Interestingly, the later Emx-knockout mice show some differences from the NesKO in their ensemble of PTB2 target exons. These transcripts may be subject to regulatory events that occur after birth and are thus not observable in mice subject to neonatal lethality. Exons observed to change in the EmxKO but not in the NesKO mice point to the dynamic nature of splicing regulation during neuronal development. Most exons are controlled by combinations of factors, and there is likely to be extensive intersection between the PTBP2 regulatory program and splicing programs driven by other splicing factors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Calarco et al., 2011</a>). In the future, it will be interesting to focus on the development of particular circuits and assess the temporal expression profiles of multiple other splicing regulators. Such studies will allow examination of how the different splicing regulatory networks are integrated."

PTBP1 is known to also affect miRNA function and cytoplasmic translation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sawicka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fred and Welsh, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gorospe et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kafasla et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Xue et al., 2013</a>). PTBP2 will likely also serve similar roles, and a portion of the <i>Ptbp2</i> null phenotype may also derive from the loss of these other functions. In the CAD neuronal cell line, PTBP1 has been reported to cause retention of selected introns in transcripts for several important synaptic proteins, leading to their downregulation through nuclear RNA decay (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yap et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yap and Makeyev, 2013</a>). These introns appear to be efficiently spliced in embryonic brain, as might be expected after the downregulation of PTBP1. PTBP2 may have similar activity on a different set of target transcripts. So far we have not seen a clear example of this, but one possibility is <i>Ngrn</i>, which contains a 3\u2032-terminal intron that is spliced more efficiently in the Emx-KO than in wild type (data not shown)."

Future studies will examine the functional roles of individual PTBP2 target transcripts. We are particularly interested in two processes. The establishment of axonal/dendritic polarity that occurs early in differentiation may coincide with the loss of PTBP1 protein and gain of PTBP2. In contrast, synaptic assembly occurs late in maturation and requires the downregulation of PTBP2. Many identified synaptic proteins change their splicing at this stage and it will be very interesting to examine how their isoform switching affects synaptic architecture and function."

The pFlox-PGK-Neo vector, containing a neomycin resistance gene (Neo) flanked by FRT and loxP sites and a diphtheria toxin gene cassette, was used for <i>Ptbp2</i> targeting. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 knockout arms of the targeting construct were generated by high-fidelity PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase of 129S2 genomic DNA. The targeting vector was linearized with Xba I and electroporated into 129S2-derived ES cells. Isolated ES cell clones were analyzed for homologous recombination. Incorporation of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 loxP sites was confirmed by Southern blotting using 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 probes following digestion with XbaI. Clones with the targeted <i>Ptbp2</i> allele were injected into 3.5-day C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the resulting chimeras were crossed to C57BL/6 females to achieve germline transmission of the targeted (PTBP2Neo-loxP) allele. The <i>Ptbp2Neo-loxP</i> mice were crossed to FLPe transgenic mice (129S4/SvJaeSor-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(FLP1)Dym/J; Jackson, Bar Harbor, ME) to remove the Neo cassette. <i>Ptbp2loxP</i> was crossed to the germline-active EIIaCre transgenic mice (gift of Stephen Smale) to obtain the <i>Ptbp2</i>KO alleles. Conditional targeting in the CNS or forebrain projection neurons was achieved in crosses with Nestin-Cre (Jackson) and Emx-Cre (gift of William Yang) mice respectively. The Cre-transgenes were all in the C57Bl/6 background. Analyzed knockouts had been backcrossed to this background for three to eight generations. At least 12 litters were generated for each Cre genotype to assess the phenotypes of each homozygous mutation.

Using different conditional knockout mouse lines in combination with phenotypic analyses and transcriptome profiling, the authors investigate the contribution of PTBP2 at different stages of development. The results show that PTBP2 regulates programs of alternative splicing events, and that loss of PTBP2 leads to premature derepression of exons that are normally included later in development. Taken together, the data support a model in which PTBP2 coordinates, in conjunction with PTBP1 and likely other splicing regulators, at least two distinct temporal transitions in the landscape of neuronal splicing regulatory networks: one from neural progenitors to differentiating neurons, and the other from differentiating to mature neurons."

G&D, 2012), the results presented by Li and colleagues significantly extend our understanding of the function of this protein since the use of different conditional knockout backgrounds unmasked phenotypes later in development that could not be observed in null mutants. The results thus emphasize the importance of studying the dynamics of RNA regulatory networks in knockout animals at different stages of development, especially for RNA binding proteins that are dynamically regulated such as PTBP2. Although it is unclear which of the many alternative splicing events regulated by PTBP2 are most critical for the observed mutant phenotypes, this study represents an important step towards the future characterization of these variants.

Nestin expression commences upon neuronal differentiation not during the earliest of neurogenic stages; (2) PTBP2 expression in non-neuronal cell types (such as glia, for instance) might contribute to proper neurogenesis.

We thought this was clear from the presented sections. We have stained sections for various markers and there is clearly widespread cell death. The problem is that the tissue is extremely unstable and difficult to stain, yielding very messy sections, and we see staining for a variety of markers making the results so far rather equivocal for understanding the pathway of cell death. We have added further explanation of this in the Results section."

The reviewers are correct that to really add statistical rigor to the phenotypic analysis, one would need to quantify the defects over a large number of mice. This would take at least 18 months of additional mouse breeding. We feel this is beyond the scope of this study, where our intent is to make an initial report of these complex phenotypes \u2013 each portion of which will require substantial additional analysis. It is perhaps worth noting that the phenotypes we observe appear to be more penetrant than the ectopic mitoses reported in the Darnell paper described below."

While these are possible contributors, there are two intriguing (and ultimately more easily testable) possible explanations not mentioned by the authors: (1) The Nestin-Cre based knockout of PTBP2 occurs after the effects of requirement for PTBP2 in neurogenesis. Nestin expression commences upon neuronal differentiation not during the earliest of neurogenic stages; (2) PTBP2 expression in non-neuronal cell types (such as glia, for instance) might contribute to proper neurogenesis. Accordingly, the authors are requested to provide a deeper discussion of possible factors underlying differences between results from the two studies</i>."

                    "text": "This also needed more explanation. We were not clear that we also did not observe the neurogenesis phenotype reported by Darnell even in our full null mouse. So our different observations are not simply due to the differences between the nestinKO and the full null. While the reviewers are correct that there are markers for neuronal progenitors that are somewhat earlier than Nestin, Nestin expression is induced quite early and is turned off when progenitors exit mitosis to differentiate. These same progenitors give rise to glial cells but this occurs primarily after the developmental period we analyze here. Thus, we don\u2019t think that either of the two explanations offered by the reviewers are likely. Nestin positive progenitors express very low amounts of PTBP2, but the primary period of PTBP2 expression is after the downregulation of nestin with the onset of differentiation. To clarify these questions, we have added <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> to the paper. This shows nestin expression in the progenitor cells of the subventricular zone and PTBP2 expression in the maturing neurons that have migrated to outer layers. This expression pattern is consistent with our observed defect in neuronal maturation. From our reading of the Darnell paper, the phenotype of ectopic mitoses in the subventricular zone appears to be sporadic and not able to explain the large differences in splicing or the neonatal death seen in their and our mice. Nevertheless, the fact that we haven\u2019t yet observed this defect does not mean that we doubt the result. Most splicing factor knockouts analyzed so far have highly pleiotropic phenotypes and the early defect observed and its relation to Numb splicing will be very interesting to examine further."
