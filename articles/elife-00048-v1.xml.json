                    "text": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) monitors the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In all organisms analyzed to date, the UPR drives transcriptional programs that allow cells to cope with ER stress. The non-conventional splicing of <i>Hac1</i> (yeasts) and <i>XBP1</i> (metazoans) mRNA, encoding orthologous UPR transcription activators, is conserved and dependent on Ire1, an ER membrane-resident kinase/endoribonuclease. We found that the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> lacks both a Hac1/XBP1 ortholog and a UPR-dependent-transcriptional-program. Instead, Ire1 initiates the selective decay of a subset of ER-localized-mRNAs that is required to survive ER stress. We identified <i>Bip1</i> mRNA, encoding a major ER-chaperone, as the sole mRNA cleaved upon Ire1 activation that escapes decay. Instead, truncation of its 3\u2032 UTR, including loss of its polyA tail, stabilized <i>Bip1</i> mRNA, resulting in increased Bip1 translation. Thus, <i>S. pombe</i> uses a universally conserved stress-sensing machinery in novel ways to maintain homeostasis in the ER."

In all organisms analyzed to date, the UPR drives transcriptional programs that allow cells to cope with ER stress. The non-conventional splicing of <i>Hac1</i> (yeasts) and <i>XBP1</i> (metazoans) mRNA, encoding orthologous UPR transcription activators, is conserved and dependent on Ire1, an ER membrane-resident kinase/endoribonuclease. We found that the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> lacks both a Hac1/XBP1 ortholog and a UPR-dependent-transcriptional-program. Instead, Ire1 initiates the selective decay of a subset of ER-localized-mRNAs that is required to survive ER stress. We identified <i>Bip1</i> mRNA, encoding a major ER-chaperone, as the sole mRNA cleaved upon Ire1 activation that escapes decay. Instead, truncation of its 3\u2032 UTR, including loss of its polyA tail, stabilized <i>Bip1</i> mRNA, resulting in increased Bip1 translation. Thus, <i>S. pombe</i> uses a universally conserved stress-sensing machinery in novel ways to maintain homeostasis in the ER."

Any sequence of amino acids has the potential to fold into a large number of different shapes, and misfolded proteins can lead to toxicity and other problems. For example, all cells rely on signaling proteins in the membranes that enclose them to monitor their environment so that they can adapt to changing conditions and, in multicellular organisms, communicate with neighboring cells: without properly folded signaling proteins, chaos would ensue. Moreover, many diseases\u2014including diabetes, cancer, viral infection and neurodegenerative disease\u2014have been linked to protein folding processes.

If the ER does not have enough capacity to fold all of the proteins that are delivered there, the UPR switches on to increase the protein folding capacity, to expand the surface area and volume of the compartment, and to degrade misfolded proteins. If the UPR cannot adequately adjust the folding capacity of the ER to meet the demands of the cell, the UPR triggers a program that kills the cell to prevent putting the whole organism at risk."

RIDD cleavage reactions have been reconstituted in vitro with recombinantly expressed purified Ire1, lending support to the notion that Ire1's endoribonuclease actvity, rather than another enzyme recruited to it, carries out the initial cleavage reaction (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cross et al., 2012</a>)."

To this end, we isolated polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA from wild type and <i>Ire1\u0394</i> cells, in which the UPR was induced with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). DTT causes ER stress by impairing disulfide bond formation in the ER. The purified mRNA population was reverse-transcribed and subjected to deep-sequencing. Unexpectedly, we observed widespread Ire1-dependent mRNA down-regulation, but virtually no mRNA up-regulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Thirty-nine mRNA species were reduced by more than twofold in a DTT- and Ire1-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, bottom left grayed area). Most members of this set of down-regulated mRNAs were abundantly expressed, as depicted by the size of the plotted circles. Down-regulation, however, did not correlate with mRNA abundance (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Intriguingly, the set of down-regulated genes exclusively encoded proteins targeted to the ER (identified by signal sequences and/or transmembrane segments) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, red circles). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, the genome-wide profile of Ire1- and ER stress-dependent mRNA changes of genes encoding ER-targeted proteins is skewed to a significantly greater extent toward down-regulation than that of other mRNAs (p&lt;1\u00d710<sup>\u221220</sup>). More than half of the most down-regulated mRNAs encode proteins with annotated functions in the secretory pathway, in particular proteins involved in lipid metabolism, trafficking, and ER functions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>)."

To this end, we sought to trap any putative primary Ire1-cleavage products prior to degradation by deleting <i>Ski2,</i> which encodes a helicase component of the cytosolic Ski complex (cytosolic exosome) that mediates 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 RNA decay. Northern blot analysis of <i>Ski2\u0394</i> cells revealed that <i>Gas2</i> mRNA (which is down-regulated 2.5-fold in an ER stress and Ire1-dependent manner) yielded two discrete cleavage products upon ER stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). <i>Gas2</i> mRNA cleavage was dependent on Ire1, as no mRNA reduction and no cleavage products were observed in <i>Ire1\u0394 Ski2\u0394</i> double deletion cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Another target, <i>Yop1</i>, behaved similarly (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In time-course experiments, reduction of <i>Gas2</i> mRNA and accumulation of the cleavage products peaked at 30 min after UPR induction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>); at later time points the abundance of intact full-length mRNA increased, suggesting that newly transcribed mRNA is not cleaved if the Ire1-dependent cleavage products are not further degraded. Indeed, <i>Ski2\u0394</i> cells failed to grow on plates containing tunicamycin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), indicating that an intact mRNA decay is important for <i>S. pombe</i> cells to cope with ER stress."

We used tRNA ligase to attach linker sequences specifically to those RNA fragments terminating in a 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate, which is the expected product of Ire1-catalyzed RNA cleavage (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schutz et al., 2010</a>). We then amplified the cleavage products in 3\u2032 RACE reactions priming at the linker sequence. Alignment of the sequencing data to the <i>S. pombe</i> genome identified the 3\u2032 ends of Ire1-dependent fragments. In particular, we identified 39 Ire1-dependent fragments mapping to 24 of the most down-regulated genes, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a> for <i>Gas2</i> mRNA (left panel). By size estimation, the major Ire1-dependent peak corresponded to the smaller, more abundant <i>Gas2</i> mRNA cleavage product (labeled \u25b2 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2a and 2b</a>). A second, less abundant short fragment was also observed in the sequencing data (labeled \u00d7 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>).

Paradoxically, we found <i>S. pombe Bip1</i> mRNA among the 39 down-regulated mRNAs identified by the analyses shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>. Analysis by Northern blotting yielded seemingly conflicting results: by this analysis, <i>Bip1</i> mRNA was fourfold more abundant in ER stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Intriguingly, the appearance of a faster migrating mRNA species (\u2018<i>tBip1</i> mRNA\u2019) indicates that <i>Bip1</i> mRNA changes size in cells experiencing ER stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, lanes 3\u20134). Appearance of the <i>tBip1</i> mRNA species was Ire1-dependent and in wild type cells accounted for the increase in overall mRNA abundance. The increase did not result from augmented transcription. We measured the activity of a heterologous reporter in which the <i>Bip1</i> promoter was fused to GFP and showed no Ire1-dependent change in mRNA abundance with ER stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). In agreement with this result, we found that the stability of an mRNA bearing the <i>Bip1</i> ORF and 3\u2032 UTR showed a more than threefold increase in half-life from T<sub>1/2</sub>=20 min for the unprocessed form present in unstressed cells to T<sub>1/2</sub>=70 min for the processed form present in ER-stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Furthermore, the <i>Bip1</i> 3\u2032 UTR and the presence of a signal sequence were sufficient to a heterologous mRNA construct to confer Ire1-dependent processing (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Here we show that mRNA decay can serve as the sole means of resolving ER stress without transcriptional up-regulation of classical UPR target genes. The identified transcripts targeted for RIDD compose a subset of mRNAs, all encoding proteins that reside in or traverse the secretory pathway. Being translated by membrane-bound ribosomes, these mRNAs are therefore in an appropriate cellular location to meet activated Ire1."

Indeed, a back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that in <i>S. pombe</i> RIDD reduces the total protein influx into the ER by only 15%, even under the severe ER stress conditions explored here experimentally. This estimate derives from our ribosome footprinting data in normal vs ER-stressed cells: We scored the relative translational engagement of all mRNAs encoding proteins displaying signal sequences or transmembrane regions to estimate flux of newly synthesized polypeptides in to the ER and calculated the impact of RIDD on this set (see <i>Materials and methods</i>).

Indeed, Ire1 may be localized to the vicinity of mRNAs encoding such proteins by interactions of its ER lumenal unfolded protein sensing domain with portions of the nascent polypeptide chains that have entered the ER lumen, as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ron, 2006</a>). An alternative and not mutually exclusive view poses that RIDD qualitatively changes the gene expression profile. In support of this notion, we notice that the population of RIDD target mRNAs is highly selective. mRNAs encoding proteins involved in lipid metabolism are highly enriched (31% of RIDD target mRNA as compared to 6.7% in all ER-targeted mRNAs). Moreover, we find that RIDD targets encoding proteins involved in sterol metabolism are particularly enriched (13% as compared to 1.3%). How reduced sterol synthesis would counteract the toxic effects of ER stress remains unclear. One possible explanation would be that ER stress limits sterol exit through vesicular transport and a compensatory reduction in sterol synthesis becomes important to sustain basic ER functions, perhaps by maintaining appropriate membrane fluidity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nilsson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Feng et al., 2003</a>). In this way, RIDD (akin to other degradative pathways) could adjust basic metabolic parameters in the cell (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernasconi et al., 2012</a>)."

Our results provide two further lines of evidence in support of this view: first, we show that an Ire1 RNase active site mutant, <i>Ire1(H1018N),</i> is unable to sustain cell growth on ER stress-inducing media. This mutation was designed to block catalysis while retaining hydrogen-bonding interactions of the amino acid side chain. Indeed, the equivalent single amino acid substitution in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Ire1, Ire1(H1080N), reduces catalytic activity by &gt;10<sup>5</sup>-fold. Otherwise, Ire1(H1080N) is indistinguishable from wild type Ire1, both in its oligomerization and structural properties as determined by crystallography (<a href=\"#bib26\">Korennykh et al., 2011</a>). Second, we showed that cleaved RIDD target mRNAs carry a 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate group, which is a prerequisite for the ligation reaction (tRNA ligase) used in the genome-wide mapping of mRNA ends created upon ER stress.

By chance, UGC triplets occur much more frequently in mRNAs than Ire1 cleavage sites. Therefore, the information that specifies an mRNA as an Ire1 substrate must require additional elements. Potential determinants may lie in sequence or secondary structure determinants that to date have escaped bioinformatics identification. We and others note that many of the identified cleavage sites lie in loops of potential hairpin structures (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hur et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Oikawa et al., 2010</a>); however, the position of the scissile G in the loops is not conserved. These structures therefore do not provide a structurally plausible explanation. Alternatively, Ire1's lumenal domain may become preferentially engaged with nascent polypeptide chains that display higher affinity and/or longer exposed peptide sequences, thereby selecting mRNAs co-translationally by recognizing features in the encoded protein. The concept of Ire1 recruitment, whether through interactions via the nascent chain or elements in the mRNA per se, is supported by our finding that mutation of one cleavage site (UG\\C \u2192 UC\\U) in <i>Gas2</i> mRNA gives rise to cleavage at alternative sites. These data indicate that local proximity rather than the RNA sequence surrounding the immediate cleavage site may guide substrate selection."

As we suggest here, <i>Bip1</i> mRNA is also cleaved by Ire1, yet escapes decay. The Ire1 cleavage site shares the same features described above for RIDD target mRNAs. During ER stress-induced processing, <i>Bip1</i> mRNA loses a portion of its 3\u2032 UTR and polyA tail.

A plausible explanation for the increased stability of <i>tBip1</i> mRNA is the loss of an RNA degron located in the severed portion of the 3\u2032 UTR. <i>tBip1</i> mRNA is actively translated with its ribosome density paralleling its increased abundance. Although polyA tails are generally linked to stability and translational efficiency, histone mRNAs, which likewise lack polyA tails, provide precedence for such an exception to the rule (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marzluff et al., 2008</a>). Histone mRNAs terminate in a well-conserved 3\u2032 stem-loop structure, which protects from exonucleolytic degradation. Proteins binding there functions akin to the polyA binding proteins found on other mRNAs to enhance histone mRNA translation by looping back to the 5\u2032 cap structure (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sanchez and Marzluff, 2002</a>)."

                                "text": "Why <i>tBip1</i> mRNA escapes decay remains to be explored. Possible explanations include the presence of secondary structure elements. Indeed, we find a predicted conserved hairpin structure at the 3\u2032 termini of <i>tBip1</i> RNAs in some fission yeasts (<i>S. pombe</i>, <i>S. octosporus</i> and <i>S. cryophilus</i>); however preliminary mutational analysis failed to validate its importance for mRNA stability in <i>S. pombe</i>. An alternative possibility is that the 3\u2032 end of <i>tBip1</i> mRNA may be covalently modified. Such modification would need to be restricted to the 2\u2032-OH, because the 3\u2032-OH group is still accessible for modification by RNA ligase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). In this regard, <i>tBip1</i> mRNA would resemble miRNAs, which are 2\u2032-O-methylated, conferring resistance to degradation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yu et al., 2005</a>)."

Why would such a singular mechanism have evolved exclusively for Bip1? From work in other species, Bip1 emerges as the most pleiotropically important and precisely controlled ER chaperone (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gulow et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, Bip1 holds a unique position in <i>S. pombe</i>, where it is glycosylated (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pidoux and Armstrong, 1993</a>). A recent comprehensive gene interaction map revealed that Ire1 in <i>S. pombe</i> clusters tightly with enzymes involved in the quality control cycle of glycosylated proteins, pointing toward a unique connection between glycosylation and ER stress (<a href=\"#bib9\">Frost et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, corresponding E-maps in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> succinctly confirm the long-appreciated linear relationship between Ire1 and Hac1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schuldiner et al., 2005</a>). One may speculate that ER stress in <i>S. pombe</i>, as in other species, enhances turnover of glycosylated proteins and that the regulation of <i>Bip1</i> mRNA is beneficial to its stability by compensating for such loss (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernasconi et al., 2012</a>)."

While input (unfolded proteins, ER stress) and output (RNA cleavage) have been conserved, both detail and global consequences of downstream processes have been adapted to serve different needs. The UPR in both <i>S. cerevisae</i> and <i>S. pombe</i> fulfills a cytoprotective role, yet the mechanisms of executing this task are opposed. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, folding capacity is increased via transcriptional up-regulation; in <i>S. pombe</i> the folding load is decreased and the ER is restructured. In metazoan cells, both modes of Ire1 activity are merged, and depending on condition and cell type can serve different purposes. RIDD can protect cells by removing major secretory protein loads, as it is the case in insulin secreting cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lipson et al., 2008</a>), or it can serve to activate apopototic pathways, as it is the case in cells experiencing prolonged and unmitigated ER stress (<a href=\"#bib16\">Han et al., 2009</a>)."

While we cannot ascertain what represents the ancestral state, it is tempting to speculate that a broader mRNA degradation pathway preceded the development of the more specialized splicing mechanism. The prevalence of a much broader scope of Ire1 targets in <i>S. pombe</i> suggests that a primitive UPR may have served primarily as an ER-localized yet promiscuous RNA degradation system. Individual mRNA substrates would then have evolved appropriate affinities for the enzyme, rendering them more or less susceptible substrates. In this way, the stem/loop splice sites of <i>HAC1/XBP1</i> mRNAs could be the result of a long time optimization process: duplication of the cleavage site with concomitant recruitment and repurposing of tRNA ligase would have culminated the UPR splicing reaction. In this view, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> emerges as the endpoint of an optimization process rather than an evolutionary precursor. By losing the more ancient RIDD function of the UPR, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cell would have developed to rely exclusively on a more refined and more powerful transcriptional regulation program."

The design of the library (3\u2032 end mapping) made it necessary to align the reads to the opposed strand of the gene. To map putative Ire1-dependent cleavage sites with high stringency, we identified the positions within each transcript containing more than four reads in RNA derived from the <i>Ski2</i>\u2206 sample and zero reads in RNA derived from the <i>Ire1\u2206 Ski2\u2206</i> sample. We identified by this method 4027 putative Ire1-dependent cleavage sites in the genome. By using a less stringent criterion (by taken the ration between <i>Ski2\u2206</i> sample and <i>Ire1\u2206 Ski2\u2206</i> sample: we allowed a ratio of 5 or more). By this criterion we identified 4134 putative Ire1-dependent cleavage sites. The overlap between the two methods is 97%. We continued our analysis with the more stringent criteria of only allowing zero reads in <i>Ire1\u2206 Ski2\u2206</i> sample. To identify an overrepresented consensus sequence, we first extended the sequences 9 nt upstream and downstream of the potential cleavage sites. Furthermore, we used a position weight matrix (PWM), which was generated from these sequences by weighting each sequence with the reads from the <i>Ski2\u2206</i> sample. By using all annotated genes and the corresponding putative cleavage sites, we could not identify overrepresented sequences. The same held true for the ER-target mRNAs set (N=1014). By contrast, a strong consensus motif (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>) emerged when we mapped the putative cleavage sites in our set of 39 Ire1- and ER stress-dependently twofold down-regulated transcripts."

Typically, endonuclease sites are demonstrated by also showing the 3\u2032 mRNA fragment accumulates in an Xrn1\u2206 strain. Such a demonstration would not be required for publication but would strengthen the work</i>."

Xrn1-deleted S. pombe cells grow very poorly, however, even in the absence of ER stress. Moreover, we feel that the issue of endonucleolytic cleavage will be much cleaner addressed in in vitro experiment, where a clear precursor/product relationship for the substrate can be ascertained. Such experiments are in progress in the lab, and will be part of a more extensive mechanistic dissection of the reaction."
