The effects of statistical gene\u2013gene interactions on phenotypes have been used to assign genes to functional modules. However, directional, epistatic interactions, which reflect regulatory relationships between genes, have been challenging to map at large-scale. Here, we used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of <i>Drosophila</i> cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This network reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis. Moreover, it revealed that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction that we show is conserved in human cancer cells. Our study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations."

The effects of statistical gene\u2013gene interactions on phenotypes have been used to assign genes to functional modules. However, directional, epistatic interactions, which reflect regulatory relationships between genes, have been challenging to map at large-scale. Here, we used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of <i>Drosophila</i> cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This network reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis. Moreover, it revealed that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction that we show is conserved in human cancer cells. Our study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for the interpretation of functional consequences of genetic alterations."

Fischer, Sandmann et al. took hundreds of thousands images of the cells and analyzed the changes in cell shape, cell size, cell division and other traits. Next, they developed a method to infer the directions of the interactions between individual pairs of genes from the data and then made a map of the genetic interactions for the traits."

Furthermore, it revealed previously unknown interactions between genes. For example, genes involved in the Ras signaling pathway\u2014which promotes cell growth and is frequently mutated in human tumors\u2014interacted with genes that encode a group of proteins called the SWI/SNF complex. This complex alters how DNA is packaged in cells to control the expression of genes, and these gene interactions may play an important role in the control of cell growth by Ras signaling."

Mathematically, Fisher defined a genetic interaction as an interaction term between genetic covariates in a (statistical) linear model for a phenotype. Genetic interactions occur, for example, when a cellular process is controlled by two parallel pathways: loss of gene products in one pathway are buffered, and only when the both pathways are disturbed, a phenotype is observed. Conversely, the phenotype of closely collaborating proteins, for example, in a protein complex, is often not further enhanced when more than one of its gene products are depleted (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dixon et al., 2009</a>). Systematic screens for genetic interactions have been performed in yeast (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schuldiner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Costanzo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ryan et al., 2012</a>), <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nichols et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Babu et al., 2014</a>), <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lehner et al., 2006</a>) and metazoan cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakal et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Horn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bassik et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Laufer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roguev et al., 2013</a>). These approaches have successfully unravelled symmetric relationships, such as pathway and complex co-membership (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baryshnikova et al., 2013</a>). However, the observation of a statistical genetic interaction implies no directionality between the genes: it does not take into account a possible order of relationships, for example, their temporal relation in a signalling cascade. Directionality is present if one gene product positively or negatively regulates the activity of the other, if its function temporally precedes that of the other, or if its function is a necessary requirement for the action of the other. Such directional genetic interactions were described by <a href=\"#bib6\">Bateson (1907)</a>, and observing epistatic interactions between genes has been a powerful method to organise them into functional pathways (<a href=\"#bib49\">Phillips, 2008</a>). In special cases, for example, in which one of the two interrogated genes has no phenotype itself, it has been possible to infer directionality by comparing the gene\u2013gene phenotype to the single gene phenotype (<a href=\"#bib20\">Drees et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">St Onge et al., 2007</a>). However, in many cases genes that show genetic interactions have phenotypes themselves, and more general methods to predict directionalities have been lacking."

Our map comprises 1367 <i>Drosophila</i> genes implicated in cellular processes including signalling, chromatin and cell cycle regulation. We quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cultured cells using automated imaging. First, we inferred gene functions based on statistical genetic interactions, predicted protein complexes and clustered processes by similarity. Moreover, in a novel analytical approach, we employ the multivariate nature of the phenotypes to compute directional genetic interactions, and we show that they reveal the logical and temporal dependencies between functional modules. For example, we were able to reconstruct the temporal order in which protein complexes are active during mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signalling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodelling, which we confirmed in vivo. We demonstrate that directional genetic interactions can be identified at a large scale and mapped to other genomic data sets to identify regulatory relationships."

For example, depletion of <i>ida</i>, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), led to an increased mitotic index as previously described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bentley et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

For more than 94% (1293 of 1367) of genes, phenotypic profiles were highly correlated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a>), and these genes were used in further analysis. Genetic interactions were calculated using a multiplicative model (<a href=\"#bib32\">Horn et al., 2011</a>). 12361 gene pairs (13%) showed significant statistical genetic interactions in at least one phenotype (FDR 1%, moderated <i>t</i>-test). Compared to an analysis of the cell number phenotype alone, which detected 2357 genetic interactions, the number of observed genetic interactions was more than fivefold higher in the multi-phenotype analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Interactions derived from different phenotypes were non-redundant, for example, genetic interactions affecting the number of cells displayed only weak correlation with those affecting mitotic index (correlation coefficient: 0.33) or cell diameter (correlation coefficient: \u22120.32) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For example, depletion of <i>Rho1</i> mRNA alone interfered with cytokinesis, resulting in large, multinucleated cells and reduced cell number (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast, RNAi against <i>Dlic</i>, the dynein light intermediate chain, led to a moderate reduction in cell number but did not affect nuclear size. As predicted from the single-RNAi phenotypes, combined targeting of <i>Rho1</i> and <i>Dlic</i> reduced cell numbers further, with no evidence of a genetic interaction for this phenotypic feature. In contrast, their co-depletion resulted in a negative genetic interaction on cell and nuclear sizes, indicating that <i>Dlic</i> is epistatic to <i>Rho1</i>. Similarly, co-depleting <i>Not3</i> (a member of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex) and the growth regulator <i>hippo</i> (<i>hpo</i>) did not reveal a significant genetic interaction affecting total cell number. Yet, the same RNAi combination reversed the mild decrease in mitotic index observed upon RNAi of each single gene, and increased the fraction of mitotic nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thus, genetic interactions affect multiple phenotypes, with each phenotype contributing independent information."

                                "text": "First, consider two genes A and B with distinct multivariate phenotypes. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, this situation is depicted by the blue and orange arrows that represent the effects of the single-gene knockdowns. When A and B do not genetically interact, the phenotype of the double-knockdown (grey arrow; AB) is simply the combination (vector sum) of the two individual arrows (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We call this the non-interacting model (NI). Second, when A and B genetically interact, the multivariate phenotype of the double knockdown (AB) is different from the vector sum (NI). This difference, geometrically depicted by the black arrows, defines the genetic interaction (\u03c0). If the double knockdown phenotype is an amplified or dampened version of one of the single gene knockdown phenotypes, then the genetic interaction (black arrow) is parallel or antiparallel to the phenotype of either one of the single knockdowns (blue or orange arrow: <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Together, this geometric information indicates the directionality of the interaction (i.e., which gene modifies which), and whether it is alleviating (antiparallel) or aggravating (parallel). For example, if the double knockdown phenotype of gene A and gene B is similar to the single knockdown of gene A, we call this an alleviating interaction from A to B (A \u2192 B). This indicates that a functional gene A is required for the phenotype of gene B (i.e., gene A is functionally upstream of gene B), while the absence or presence of B has a limited effect on the phenotype of A. Similarly, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows an example of an aggravating interaction from gene A to gene B (A <math id=\"inf1\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u22a3</mi></math> B), where loss of gene A's function leads to an even stronger phenotype of gene B, while the phenotype of gene A is unchanged. The two remaining cases, alleviating and aggravating directional interactions from gene B to gene A are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> (B \u2192 A, B <math id=\"inf2\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u22a3</mi></math> A). Alternatively, if the double knockdown phenotype (AB) is not merely increasing or decreasing the amplitude of one of the single gene phenotypes, no direction is assigned (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Using a conservative threshold, we found directional epistatic interactions between 1344 pairs of genes. Of these, 1040 were alleviating and 304 aggravating (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 6</a>). This directional genetic interaction network provided a rich snapshot of regulatory, causal and temporal relationships. For instance, we detected an alleviating interaction between the APC/C member <i>Cdc23</i> and the cytokinesis regulator <i>sti</i>. After knockdown of <i>Cdc23</i>, we recorded reduced growth and slightly smaller nuclear area (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>, blue arrows for the two independent dsRNAs). Knockdown of <i>sti</i> also reduced growth, but in addition led to a strong increase in nuclear area (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>, orange arrows). The double knockdown of <i>Cdc23</i> and <i>sti</i>, however, almost completely reproduced the phenotype of <i>Cdc23</i> alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, black arrows for 2 \u00d7 2 dsRNA design). This directional alleviating interaction between the genes reflects the known, consecutive functions of the encoded proteins. Without <i>Cdc23</i>, cells arrest in metaphase, leading to the observed reduction in cell number (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, top). Without <i>sti</i>, a component of the contractile ring, which executes the abscission of the cytoplasm to form the two daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">D'Avino et al., 2004</a>), cells undergo karyokinesis (division of the nucleus) and re-replicate their genome without being able to divide their cytoplasm, resulting in giant cells with large nuclei and often multi-nucleated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, middle). However, when <i>Cdc23</i> is depleted together with <i>sti,</i> the increase of nucleus size is avoided (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, bottom) since depletion of <i>Cdc23</i> arrests cells in metaphase thereby preventing re-replication (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zielke et al., 2008</a>), explaining the detected directional interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

The mitosis master regulator <i>polo</i> was observed as alleviating epistatic to components that are required for the initial mitotic phases, including the \u03b3TuRC, which serves as the structural basis of the mitotic spindle. In contrast, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme <i>vih</i> showed directional interactions to components that are active at later stages. Depletion of \u03b3TuRC members aggravated the cellular phenotype of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Dynein/dynactin motor proteins mediated a chain of directional epistatic interactions between the SAC and the APC/C. Moreover, whereas SAC knockdown had an aggravating effect on the phenotype of condensin/cohesion, the latter relied on a functional APC/C. The phenotypes of cytokinesis regulators including <i>sti</i>, <i>pav</i>, <i>tum</i>, <i>Rho1</i> or <i>scra</i> were strongly dependent on APC/C as well as on dynein/dynactin motor proteins. Our data also showed that <i>vih</i>, the ubiquitin-ligase APC/C, as well as cytokinesis executers regulated the phenotype of the SCF ubiquitin-ligase core component <i>Skp2</i>. In contrast, <i>Elongin-B</i>, another ubiquitin-ligase core component, itself regulated the phenotype of the SAC, condensin/cohesin components and cytokinesis regulators. This unbiased mapping and automated inference of directional epistatic interactions, made possible by the multivariate phenotyping approach, revealed a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

We found genetic interactions between the SWI/SNF complex with both the SWI/SNF-associated chromatin remodeller <i>dalao</i> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Papoulas et al., 2001</a>) and the Ras inhibitor <i>RasGap1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)<i>.</i> Moreover, <i>dalao</i> and <i>RasGap1</i> also both interacted with other Ras signalling pathway components. Directional epistasis was evident in several of these genetic interactions. While <i>dalao</i> alleviated the knockdown phenotype of SWI/SNF, <i>RasGap1</i> aggravated it (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>). <i>RasGap1</i> is a known negative regulator of Ras signalling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gaul et al., 1992</a>), and consistent with that, its single knockdown increased cell proliferation. We found that additional knockdown of SWI/SNF complex members (<i>mor</i>, <i>brm</i>, <i>Bap60</i>, <i>Snr1</i> or <i>osa</i>) compensated the <i>RasGAP1</i>-dependent increased proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that constitutive active Ras signalling requires SWI/SNF function. In addition, cell area and eccentricity were increased after the double knockdown compared to the single-knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Next, we tested whether mutations in SWI/SNF complex components could suppress a Ras gain-of-function rough eye phenotype in the <i>Drosophila</i> eye (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zipursky and Rubin, 1994</a>).

We aimed to use our directional interaction network to predict relationships between recurrent cancer mutations. For example, we found an alleviating directional interaction between <i>Pten</i> (PTEN) and <i>gig</i> (TSC2) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), as previously described (<a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2012</a>). We also identified upstream and downstream regulators: for instance, our data predict that the ARP2/3 complex member <i>Arp3</i>, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, aggravates the phenotype of the Ras GTP exchange factor <i>Sos</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Another example is given by the epistatic interactions of <i>Myb</i> (MYB), an essential member of the DREAM complex. This complex regulates cell-cycle dependent gene expression (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sadasivam and DeCaprio, 2013</a>) and is recurrently mutated in cancer. Upstream of <i>Myb</i> we detected its known regulators <i>mip120</i> and <i>mip130</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beall et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, our data indicate functions of central mitosis regulators (<i>polo</i>, <i>Elongin-B</i>, <i>fzy</i>) upstream of <i>Myb</i>, while <i>SMC4</i>, which is involved in chromosomal maintenance, and many cytokinetic genes are downstream. The DREAM subcomplex members <i>Myb</i>, <i>mip120</i>, <i>mip130</i> have been shown to co-ordinately regulate transcription of mitotic genes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Georlette et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, we found that the phenotype of the recurrently mutated transcriptional repressor <i>spen</i> (SPEN) is aggravated by <i>nonC</i>, which is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Oswald et al., 2005</a>)."

Identifying genetic dependencies can facilitate finding combinatorial drug treatments and avoiding resistance mechanisms, which are important in cancer (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nijman and Friend, 2013</a>). The identification of genetic interactions in population-based observational studies, however, is limited by sample size and statistical power (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zuk et al., 2012</a>) both in model organisms (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mackay, 2014</a>) and for human diseases (<a href=\"#bib15\">Civelek and Lusis, 2014</a>).

A statistical genetic interaction exists between genes if the effect of their combined perturbation differs from what is expected from the single perturbations. The obtained information on gene\u2013gene interactions is symmetric and does not reveal a potential directionality. The experimental and computational approach presented in this study aimed at capturing interactions, first irrespective of direction (symmetric), and second, adding directionality. Directional genetic interactions provide an additional layer of information above symmetric, statistical genetic interactions. Directional genetic interactions reflect causal, temporal or regulatory relationships between phenotypes and their underlying biological processes. Our method requires the observation of multiple phenotypes and is an algorithmic formalisation of the epistasis concept of <a href=\"#bib6\">Bateson (1907)</a>. Bateson mapped epistatic alleles when studying the inheritance of coat colour of mice using multiple colour phenotypes. The formalisation of mapping epistatic interactions as done in our study is straightforward to implement and should also be applicable to future studies."

The study demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale, automated discovery of directional epistatic interactions. There are also other approaches to annotate relationships between genes. For instance, <a href=\"#bib35\">Kelley and Ideker (2005)</a> detected different interaction types by searching for network motifs and integrated information from genetic, physical and reaction networks. <a href=\"#bib20\">Drees et al. (2005)</a> and <a href=\"#bib57\">St Onge et al. (2007)</a> derived partial orderings of single and double mutant viability phenotypes. This method can derive directional interactions in special cases, for example, when one of the genes does not have a phenotype itself. More recently, <a href=\"#bib62\">Vinayagam et al. (2014)</a> annotated protein\u2013protein interactions with positive and negative signs, which they obtained from the correlations between the genes' individual knockdown phenotypes. <a href=\"#bib38\">Liberali et al. (2014)</a> tested whether one gene's single knockdown phenotypes are contained in those of another gene, and used such subset relationships to derive hierarchies between genes. In contrast to these previous approaches, our study directly captures epistatic relationships from multivariate phenotypes observed after di-genic perturbations, often revealing effects that cannot be constructed from single-gene perturbations, or from single phenotypes alone. <a href=\"#bib61\">van Wageningen et al. (2010)</a> recorded gene expression profiles from single and double yeast deletion strains and reported frequent instances of mixed epistasis. It would be interesting to study how our approach can be extended to detect mixed directional relationships. Another avenue for future work is the combination of directional genetic interaction mapping with Bayesian modelling (<a href=\"#bib7\">Battle et al., 2010</a>) to further improve the inference of regulatory networks."

Recent cancer genome sequencing studies have revealed many recurrent mutations that are individually rare (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chin et al., 2011</a>). A current challenge is to order these genetic variants by their functional and phenotypic effects. We have demonstrated a method to detect which recurrently mutated genes modify each other's phenotypes.

Other features are more abstract. For instance, we included the quantile features to be able to detect changes that affect only a small proportion of cells: for example, the elongation phenotype often only affects a small fraction of the cells. Other features are mathematical descriptors, or numerical \u2018fingerprints\u2019, of texture and intensity patterns; the use of these is well-established in cellular image analysis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boland and Murphy, 2001</a>), and while they are not directly interpreted as a specific process or function, they sensitively pick up complex changes in the cellular network caused by the genetic perturbations. Together, we computed a large number of phenotypic features, which were partially redundant. We then aimed at selecting an informative, non-redundant subset of these features for further analysis by an automated procedure. First, we eliminated those features that were not sufficiently reproducible between replicates (cor &lt;0.6) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We then started the feature selection with three manually chosen features based on their interpretability and to facilitate comparability with previous work: number of cells, fraction of mitotic cells and cell area (<a href=\"#bib32\">Horn et al., 2011</a>). Subsequently, for each further feature, we fit a linear regression that modelled the feature's values over all experiments as a function of the already selected features. The residuals of this fit were used to measure new information content not yet covered by the already selected features (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Among candidate features, we selected the one with the maximum correlation coefficient of residuals between two replicates. This procedure was iterated, and in each iteration we computed the fraction of features with positive correlation coefficients. The iteration was stopped when this fraction no longer exceeded 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This choice of cut-off was motivated by the fact that for a set of uninformative features, the fraction is expected to be 0.5. The 21 selected features are listed in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>."

For each gene pair the \u03c0-score-vector over all 21 features was fit by a linear combination of the main effect vectors of the two genes. By analysis of variance we then quantified how much of the \u03c0-score was explained by each of the two genes. We called an epistatic interaction from gene A to B if the fraction of sum of squares explained by gene A was smaller than a lower threshold and if the fraction of sum of squares explained by gene B was larger than a higher threshold. The two thresholds were chosen as the 10% and 95% quantile over all gene pairs. In addition to the direction of phenotypic regulation, the coefficient of the fit defined the sign, which could be alleviating (negative coefficient) or aggravating (positive coefficient)."

In the revised version of the manuscript, we acknowledge these papers and refer to them either in the Introduction (second paragraph) or Discussion (third paragraph). We also explain how our approach differs from previous studies. Specifically, in previous studies epistasis and therefore directionality was only inferred in special cases, e.g. where one of the single gene phenotypes is zero. By using multiple phenotypes and considering them as \u2018vectors\u2019, our method is more general and more widely applicable. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> gives an example: when both genes have some effect on growth rate, it is not possible to unambiguously derive directionality. In practice, these cases are common and previous studies have demonstrated that genes with phenotypes are most likely to show genetic interactions (Costanzo, Science, 2010). In contrast, our multivariate method is able to assign directionality even in cases where both single gene phenotypes are non-zero, based on a straightforward vector algebra calculation."

While they report the use of statistical methods to discover genetic interactions, in the paper they did not use the expression \u201cstatistical genetic interactions\u201d for these. To the best of our knowledge, we follow the mainstream usage of this term, where a statistical interaction is detected from an interaction term between the covariates in a linear model (ANOVA) for the phenotype (see e.g., Cordell et al., Epistasis: what it means, what it doesn't mean, and statistical methods to detect it in humans, Human Molecular Genetics, 2002).
