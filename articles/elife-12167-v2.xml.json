Here we show that the expression of the Notch ligand Dll4 fluctuates in individual endothelial cells within sprouting vessels in the mouse retina in vivo and in correlation with dynamic cell movement in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived sprouting assays. We also find that sprout elongation and branching associates with a highly differential phase pattern of Dll4 between endothelial cells. Stimulation with pathologically high levels of Vegf, or overexpression of Dll4, leads to Notch dependent synchronization of Dll4 fluctuations within clusters, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the Vegf-Dll4/Notch feedback system normally operates to generate heterogeneity between endothelial cells driving branching, whilst synchronization drives vessel expansion. We propose that this sensitive phase transition in the behaviour of the Vegf-Dll4/Notch feedback loop underlies the morphogen function of Vegfa in vascular patterning."

Here we show that the expression of the Notch ligand Dll4 fluctuates in individual endothelial cells within sprouting vessels in the mouse retina in vivo and in correlation with dynamic cell movement in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived sprouting assays. We also find that sprout elongation and branching associates with a highly differential phase pattern of Dll4 between endothelial cells. Stimulation with pathologically high levels of Vegf, or overexpression of Dll4, leads to Notch dependent synchronization of Dll4 fluctuations within clusters, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the Vegf-Dll4/Notch feedback system normally operates to generate heterogeneity between endothelial cells driving branching, whilst synchronization drives vessel expansion. We propose that this sensitive phase transition in the behaviour of the Vegf-Dll4/Notch feedback loop underlies the morphogen function of Vegfa in vascular patterning."

If a tissue is not receiving an adequate blood flow, existing blood vessels may widen or new blood vessels may sprout from their walls. In certain diseases, such as cancer, blood vessels may grow excessively to form disorganized networks, and preventing this growth may help to treat these conditions. However, we do not fully understand how the body controls the size, shape and branching pattern of blood vessels."

The tip forms when the endothelial cells that line the blood vessel are activated by a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa), which is produced by the surrounding tissue. The activated endothelial cells respond to Vegfa stimulation by producing the protein Dll4, which talks to neighboring endothelial cells to prevent them from also forming new tips. In a way, this process bears all the signs of a competition between cells, as they fight for which one is allowed to take the lead. The losers of this competition, when forced into subordination by the tips, also serve an important function, as they will help to form and elongate the base of the new sprout."

This revealed that the levels of Dll4 fluctuate widely in individual cells. Time-lapse movies of the cells showed that as a new sprout forms, the levels of Dll4 in neighbouring cells fluctuate in an uncoordinated manner. However, increasing the amount of Vegfa in the cells indeed synchronizes these fluctuations. This causes the new sprout to retract and allows the original blood vessel to widen. Increasing the levels of Dll4 had the same effect."

How the endothelial cells lining blood vessels collectively determine whether to form a new vessel branch or expand existing vessels is currently not understood. Similarly, the morphogenic and cellular principles underlying the chaotic vascular network formation in disease scenarios remain unclear. Recent work established that Dll4/Notch signalling between the activated endothelial cells functions to amplify stochastic differences in expression levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (Vegfr), ultimately establishing tip cells bearing high Vegfr expression, and inhibited stalk cells, bearing lower levels of signalling receptors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Jakobsson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Suchting et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lobov et al., 2007</a>). The Dll4/Notch pathway thereby establishes a lateral-inhibition feedback loop with the Vegf-Vegfr pathway, controlling branching frequency by balancing the number of new tip cells with the number of stabilizing stalk cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>). Genetic mosaic experiments in 3D embryoid body sprouting assays and in vivo illustrated tip and stalk cells regularly change position as endothelial cells dynamically compete for the tip position\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Jakobsson et al., 2010</a>). Every 3\u20135\u2009hr, the tip cell is exchanged, leading to continuously changing cellular neighbourhood relationships. Computational modelling of the feedback loop illustrated that it should suffice to pattern new sprouts, and comprise a robust mechanism for the establishment of a regular branching pattern\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Bentley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">2009</a>). Recently integrated modelling and experiments further identified that this Notch/VEGF feedback drives differential VE-cadherin dynamics at individual endothelial junctions contributing to cell rearrangement behaviour (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bentley et al., 2014a</a>). The meeting of new neighbours itself propagates iterative lateral-inhibition. Whether and how this activity might affect Notch signalling in individual cells over time remains unclear. In other cell systems, Notch signalling is highly dynamic, and Notch target genes oscillate both in single cells through autonomous feedback regulation, as well as in cell collectives\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib33\">Masamizu et al., 2006</a>). The latter is best studied during formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm, in which Notch activity synchronizes intrinsic oscillatory gene regulation between neighbouring mesoderm cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Kageyama et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jiang, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hubaud and Pourqui\u00e9, 2013</a>). In the absence of Notch signalling, cells eventually drift out of synchrony, finally leading to loss of somite patterning."

Constitutive genetic endothelial activation of Notch4 leads to embryonic vessel diameter increase and arterio-venous shunt formation, further suggesting that controlled Notch activity plays a role in vessel diameter regulation and adequate network remodelling (<a href=\"#bib47\">Uyttendaele et al., 2001</a>). Collectively, existing studies show that reduced Notch signalling in endothelial cells promotes a highly branched network with small calibre vessels whereas increased Notch activity promotes a sparse network of large calibre vessels. Similarly, Vegfa shows strong dosage dependent effects on vascular patterning. Like <i>Dll4, Vegfa</i> is genetically haplo-insufficient, and overexpression causes embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib34\">Miquerol et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carmeliet et al., 1996</a>). Surprisingly, despite the extensive body of work on Vegf and Dll4/Notch, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms that underlie these exquisitely dose sensitive effects on vascular patterning have hardly progressed beyond phenomenology. This may in part be because of the difficulties in analysing Vegf and Dll4/Notch signalling in a quantitative and dynamic manner, especially in vivo."

                        "text": "Here, we developed in vitro and in vivo analysis of Dll4 mRNA, protein and gene expression reporter dynamics under normal and pathological Vegfa stimulation, identifying a phase transition in the Dll4 dynamics that determines whether new vessels branch or expand. Computational modelling previously predicted that the Vegf-Dll4/Notch-Vegfr feedback loop normally establishes salt-and-pepper patterning between endothelial cells to regulate tip/stalk specification, but under elevated Vegfa levels, simulations predicted that this feedback loop would switch to drive the cells to collectively fluctuate their Dll4 levels in contiguous clusters, unable to stabilize into a heterogeneous pattern (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentley et al., 2009</a>). This highlights how the non-linear feedback involved in Vegf/Notch signalling can make it extremely hard to intuit how perturbation conditions, such as elevated Vegf, will impact on dynamics. Importantly, clear experimental evidence for the predicted dynamics and changing behaviours has been difficult to obtain. Further more, the computational models contain a limited parameter set, thus simplifying the complexity, potentially missing critical modifiers. Such modifiers may not only be molecular components, but also effects that originate from differences in cell shape and geometries, as these can trigger changes to signalling pathway dynamics (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bentley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">2014b</a>). In the present study, we therefore chose to combine and compare refined computational models that reflect the experimental assays and their endothelial geometries and integrate specific experimental assays and computational modelling throughout. Using high Vegfa levels in embryoid body assays, intraocular injection of Vegfa, the oxygen induced retinopathy model of ischemia driven ocular neovascularization, and finally syngenic mouse glioblastoma tumours, we present evidence for local Notch-dependent synchronization of Dll4 dynamics leading to vessel expansion whilst disrupting branching."

We collected mRNA from endothelial monolayers treated with either 50\u00a0ng/ml Vegfa 164 (normal) or 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml Vegfa 164 (high) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e\u2013i</a>). We monitored <i>dll4</i> mRNA levels by qPCR over a period of 9 and 24\u00a0hr post-stimulation. High Vegfa consistently induced fluctuations with high amplitude and several peaks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f,i</a>), which given the population based measurement indicates the cells are fluctuating in relative synchrony. Lomb-Scargle analysis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dequ\u00e9ant et al., 2006</a>) showed that the dominant periodicity in each dataset was 5\u20136\u2009hr. The modest and varying degree of confidence in this analysis however suggests that these dynamic patterns in vitro are inherently noisy. Under normal Vegfa levels, <i>dll4</i> mRNA showed an unexpected low-amplitude rise and decline, but then remained relatively unchanged (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). We had hypothesized these conditions should permit a stabilized salt and pepper pattern, manifested as a stable population level of <i>dll4</i>. To investigate whether this observation contests our current working model of Vegf/Notch feedback or if it can be explained simply by the different geometric nature of cells in a monolayer compared to a sprouting system impacting on the ensuing signalling dynamics, we simulated the Vegf/Notch feedback in a 2D monolayer geometry (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). This model revealed that the restricted ability of cells to change shape in a monolayer (without filopodia extensions and Vegf gradients) destabilizes the salt and pepper pattern; they instead fluctuate between salt-and-pepper pattern-like states and then near-uniform Notch activation across the cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,b</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Simulation of higher levels of Vegfa in this simple model led to high amplitude, synchronized oscillations of Dll4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c,d</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

Like <i>Dll4</i>-P2A-dVenus, also <i>Dll4</i>-P2A-Emerald was expressed in sprouting endothelium, and generated ES cells and viable reporter mice with no changes in sprouting, branching and retinal patterning (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e\u2013i</a>). However, unlike dVenus, the distribution of Emerald protein was more widespread than Dll4 protein or <i>dll4</i> mRNA. Both in the embryoid body ES cell sprouting assay (EB) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jakobsson et al., 2007</a>) and in the postnatal mouse retina, staining for dVenus showed the typical salt-and-pepper distribution pattern, with high levels in tip cells, and low levels in neighbouring stalk cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007</a>). The long sprouts in EBs showed strong expression at the tip, followed by one or two cells with low expression, and then again single cells with high expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). This pattern matches the principles of lateral inhibition thought to govern Dll4/Notch signalling in endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Suchting et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lobov et al., 2007</a>). Emerald however was present at high levels in both Dll4 protein positive and Dll4 protein negative cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>), suggesting that Dll4 protein half-life is considerably shorter than that of Emerald. Also in the retina, Emerald protein highlighted large stretches of the vascular front with little difference between neighbouring cells, illustrating that most cells at the front experienced a phase of <i>Dll4</i> expression, and that the reporter accumulates over time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i,l</a>). The salt-and-pepper distribution of dVenus and widespread distribution of Emerald provide the first evidence for dynamic phases of <i>Dll4</i> expression in sprouting angiogenesis in vivo. Remarkably, these results indicate that the salt-and-pepper distribution is not fixed, but dynamic, consistent with the idea of continued and iterative competition for the tip position via Dll4/Notch signalling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jakobsson et al., 2010</a>)."

Furthermore, the distant integration leading to slightly higher Dll4 levels nevertheless fully recapitulates endogenous and functional <i>Dll4</i> expression patterns. Only the ES cell line, and mouse line, carrying an additional distant integration of <i>Dll4</i> (3<i>Dll4</i>) showed sufficient dVenus levels to allow detection without antibody staining.

Dll4 protein and dVenus showed the typical salt-and-pepper distribution correlating with normal sprouting patterns (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,d</a>). However, high Vegfa conditions led to conspicuously short and stunted sprouts, with much wider diameter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Interestingly, this morphological change from elongation to expansion invariably correlated with altered Dll4 and dVenus distribution. Although still most strongly expressed at the tip, Dll4 and dVenus were expressed at very high levels in clusters of neighbouring cells close to the tip (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Thus, as predicted by computational modelling (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bentley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), high Vegfa levels appear to disrupt the typical lateral-inhibition salt-and-pepper pattern and instead lead to more synchronized fluctuations of Dll4 levels in contiguous cells, thereby disrupting branching. Also the 3<i>Dll4</i>-Emerald ES cells responded to high Vegfa with stunted sprouting, reduced branching and increased sprout diameter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Emerald expression was also strongest in clusters of cells at the front (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Computational modelling further predicted that raising Dll4 levels should also lead to synchronized fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>). Indeed, ES cells carrying multiple copies of the <i>Dll4</i>-dVenus transgene (7<i>Dll4</i>) showed high but dynamic levels of <i>Dll4</i> expression, and synchronized in clusters of cells that correlated with stunted sprouting and vessel expansion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3 e-i</a>). DAPT treatment restored branching and elongation under high Vegfa or <i>Dll4</i> overexpression conditions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), demonstrating that this synchronization and morphogenesis effect is Notch mediated."

However, collectively, the patterns of <i>Dll4</i> expression between neighboring spheres appeared more synchronized (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i,j</a>). Intriguingly, these wider sprouts moved forward led by a cluster of several cells synchronously expressing high <i>Dll4</i>-dVenus levels (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">12</a> and <a href=\"#media13\">13</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2c,d</a>). A short time later, the same sprout retracted, concomitant with reduced <i>Dll4</i>-dVenus levels in the cluster. Later again, regaining higher expression, the same sprout moved forward with a bright <i>Dll4</i>-dVenus cluster at the tip (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4k,l</a>). Similarly, high Vegfa levels induced clustering and iterative extension and retraction concomitant with synchronized dll4 reporter fluctuations at the tip (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4m\u2013r</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>, <a href=\"#media14\">14</a> and <a href=\"#media15\">15</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2e,f</a>). These results provide the first experimental evidence for a synchronized fluctuation in Dll4 expression and cell behaviour by high Vegfa levels or <i>Dll4</i> overexpression in an in vitro sprouting assay."

Fluorescent ISH allowed the detection of nascent <i>dll4</i> mRNA (one or two dots) in the nucleus as well as mature mRNA in the cytoplasm of actively transcribing ECs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). dVenus and <i>dll4</i> mRNA expression showed a salt-and-pepper distribution in control retinas, but strong clustering of <i>dll4</i> positive cells in Vegfa injected retinas 20\u00a0hr post-injection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013h</a>). Intriguingly, despite the strong Vegfa stimulation, clusters of <i>dll4</i> negative cells were also present, arguing against a simple linear relationship between Vegf and <i>Dll4</i> expression. Similar results were obtained for Dll4 protein expression (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013f</a>). The change in spatial <i>Dll4</i> expression distribution correlated with a dramatic shift from branching and extension to vessel enlargement, remarkably similar to what we observed in the EB system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). At the sprouting front, most of the sprouts had disappeared and were replaced by a dramatically widened peripheral vessel with occasional protrusions. In the plexus, all vessels increased substantially in diameter while the overall branching frequency was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Radial expansion of the vascular plexus was also significantly reduced, consistent with earlier reports (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gerhardt et al., 2003</a>)."

We observed that the impact of elevated vegf is strong enough alone to drive a full shift in patterning dynamics matching the observed phenotypic changes in vascular patterning of the retina plexus. Simulations of collagen matrix deposition of advancing sprouts in this model further predicted that the iterative synchronized sprouting and retraction movement generated by the synchronized fluctations in Notch signaling should lead to accumulation of empty collagen sleeves ahead of the vascular front (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5i</a>; <a href=\"#media16\">Video 16</a>). Testing this prediction, we assessed the pattern of collagen IV basement membrane deposition at the vascular sprouting front 3\u2009hr (P4 retinas) and 20\u2009hr (P5 retinas) after Vegfa injection. Retinas injected with Vegfa showed a dramatic mismatch between the vasculature and collagen IV deposition in the blunted regions of the sprouting front (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5j,k</a>). In these areas, already 3\u2009hr after Vegfa injection, collagen IV sleeves protruded ahead of the blunted vasculature, and further increased in number and length over time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5l\u2013o</a>). The observed radial expansion delay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5p</a>) is thus likely a result of unproductive and iterative sprouting and retraction."

Indeed, injecting Vegfa into the vitreous leads to widespread endothelial proliferation throughout the plexus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,c</a>). To discriminate between proliferation and collective endothelial cell synchronization effects, we inhibited proliferation by systemic treatment with mitomycin C (MMC) 24\u00a0hr prior to and again concomitant with intraocular mVegfa 165 injection, and analysed proliferation and retinal patterning 24\u00a0hr post Vegfa treatment. EdU incorporation revealed a complete block in proliferation in the MMC treated samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u2013d</a>). Blocking proliferation alone without Vegfa treatment lead to reduced vascular density in particular in the peripheral zone that developed over the duration of MMC treatment, in line with the proliferation zone in normal development (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). Interestingly however, the diameter increase at expense of branching complexity after Vegfa treatment was equally evident in samples from MMC plus Vegfa treated pups (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6k,l</a>). To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence for the morphogenic effects of quantitative changes in Vegfa to be independent of proliferation. Although proliferation will likely contribute to vessel size increase under high Vegfa, surprisingly, it is not required. Instead we propose that the increased coupling of cells through elevated Dll4/Notch signaling, drives clustering of cells through synchronization of cellular dynamics that interfere with branching, but promote vessel diameter increase."

To investigate the implications of Dll4/Notch signalling and behavior synchronization between endothelial cells for vascular patterning in tumours, we analyzed <i>dll4</i> mRNA and protein expresion together with collagen IV deposition in a mouse syngeneic glioblastoma model (GBM). C57Bl6 derived CT-2A glioblastoma cell spheres implanted into the brain of mice developed highly vascularized solid tumours over the course of 4 weeks (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mart\u00ednez-Murillo and Mart\u00ednez, 2007</a>). Tumours expressed high levels of Vegfa and Hif1a indicating hypoxia, and developed a highly irregular vasculature (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>dll4</i> fluorescent ISH performed on 200\u00a0\u00b5m vibratome sections of GBM revealed a highly irregular pattern of expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). Whilst some vessels showed little or no signal at all, other vessels showed high levels of expression in all neighboring endothelial cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8 a\u2013c</a>). Vessels close to the hypoxic core generally exhibited the highest expression and strong clustering frequently associated with local vessel diameter increase. Similarly Dll4 protein expression showed clustering of high levels in adjacent cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2j,k</a>). Furthermore, the aberrant vascular patterning in GBM was associated with extensive empty collagen IV sleeves radiating from the tumour vessels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d\u2013f</a>). These results provide the first evidence for iterative sprouting and retraction and, together with the <i>Dll4</i> expression pattern, indicate that endothelial cell Dll4/Notch signalling and sprouting behaviour becomes locally synchronized between neighboring cells during tumour angiogenesis."

At normal physiological levels, that typically correspond with developmental angiogenesis, Dll4 fluctuates dynamically in individual cells; the lateral-inhibition feedback with the Vegfr system functions to generate differences between neighbouring cells that manifest themselves as a salt-and-pepper distribution of <i>Dll4</i> high and low cells. As a consequence, the salt-and-pepper distribution of tip and stalk cell phenotypes, although individually transient, support the differential behaviour of neighbouring cells at any given time. Dynamic observations in embryoid body sprouting assays indicate that the differential behaviour is critical for branching and continuous elongation. At higher Vegfa levels however, the dynamic fluctuations between neighbouring cells become synchronized, corresponding with a loss of salt-and-pepper patterning. This synchronization, and thus local clustering of cells with high or low Dll4 levels, is dependent on Notch activity, as dampening or inhibiting Notch activity disrupts synchronization. Observations of dynamic behaviour in EBs stimulated with high Vegfa demonstrate that synchronization of <i>Dll4</i> levels coincides with synchronized sprouting activity. As a consequence, sprouting and branching is disrupted and the vessel instead expands (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The finding of clustered <i>Dll4</i> expression by in situ hybridisation, <i>Dll4</i> reporter and protein staining in the vessel expansions in the OIR model and in dilated vessels after Vegfa injection and in mouse glioblastomas together indicate that synchronization is an important principle of vessel malformation in disease."

Under high VEGF or high Dll4 these fluctuations become more synchronized leading to homogenous cellular dll4 levels that fluctuate between high and low levels together, driving vessel expansion rather than branching. In contrast, when Dll4 levels are homogeneous, but not fluctuating (termed 'static dll4' scenarios here for simplicity) the result is that cells either all remain activated and behave as tip cells (hypersprouting phenotype) or are all constantly inhibited, prohibiting vessel extension and driving a sparse branching phenotype. Thus the expansion phenotype is specifically driven by the dynamic fluctuations between homogeneous Dll4 high/low levels, rather than by the homogeneity of the Dll4 levels alone."

Together with the observed up-regulation of <i>Dll4</i> under Vegfa control, this suggests that Vegfa-induced <i>Dll4</i> up-regulation is the key to synchronization. The observed clustering, stunted sprouting and expansion upon <i>Dll4</i> overexpression in the absence of an altered Vegfa environment further suggests that synchronization itself is the major driver of the switch from branching to expansion. When injecting Vegfa in vivo or raising the concentration in vitro, not only the concentration of Vegfa, but also its spatial distribution changes. We previously proposed that Vegfa injection disrupts the Vegfa gradient, thereby reducing tip cell migration, while driving stalk cell proliferation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Gerhardt et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ruhrberg, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ruhrberg et al., 2002</a>). Based on static images, we concluded that this shift in the balance between tip migration and stalk proliferation reduces branching while driving expansion. Our new dynamic data, the transient nature of tip and stalk cell phenotypes, and the new insights from blocking proliferation under this condition and from computational modelling give rise to a different interpretation. Computational modelling previously predicted that reduced Vegfa gradients interfere with tip/stalk specification as the reduced differences in the local environment make it more difficult for the lateral-inhibition feedback loop to establish differences between neighboring endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bentley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">2009</a>). A loss in gradient already pushes the system towards synchronization, an effect that is dramatically aggravated by higher Vegfa levels. Our present findings indicate that the underlying mechanism driving expansion and clustering, instead of branching and elongation, in situations of reduced Vegfa gradients and high Vegfa levels lies in Dll4/Notch mediated synchronization of adjacent cells as they fail to establish a dynamic salt and pepper pattern."

Why and how this leads to tumour vessel expansion has since remained unclear. In the light of our current results it is tempting to speculate that overexpression of <i>Dll4</i> in tumour cells adjacent to the endothelium will cause synchronization of endothelial Notch dynamics, similar to the situation of overexpressed endothelial <i>Dll4</i>. Conversely, inhibition of Dll4 by antibody, genetic haploinsufficiency or Notch inhibition by DAPT all lead to a dramatic increase in vessel branching, but reduced vessel diameter in tumour vessels (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ridgway et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Noguera-Troise et al., 2006</a>). We propose that this switch in tumour vessel patterning is driven by the loss of synchronization, and thus a switch from collectively synchronized cell behaviour to differential individual behaviour. Given our recent identification of Notch-regulated differential VE-cadherin adhesion\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Bentley et al., 2014</a>), it is conceivable that synchronization leads to vessel expansion through the loss of adhesion differences. According to this concept, differential adhesion drives intercalation and thus vessel elongation, whereas synchronization disrupts intercalation, thus causing cells to cluster and thereby enlarge vessel diameter. As endothelial cell migration as opposed to endothelial cell apoptosis appears to present the key mechanism in vessel remodelling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Franco et al., 2015</a>), our current finding of Vegfa-induced vessel enlargement and loss of branching in the absence of proliferation further supports the idea that synchronization disrupts the normal differential migration/intercalation behaviour of endothelial cells and thereby leads to the observed morphological changes. Our observations in EBs overexpressing <i>Dll4</i> or treated with high Vegfa levels demonstrate that Notch inhibition is sufficient to break the synchronisation and restore branching morphogenesis."

The presomitic mesoderm close to the tip of the tail bud shows dynamic activity of Dll/Notch and Notch target genes of <i>hes/hey</i> family. Intriguingly, the zone closest to the tip shows unsynchronized salt-and-pepper patterning of this activity, whilst temporal waves of synchronized activity emerge just rostral of this zone. Although many genes and components of the Notch, Fgf and Wnt-signaling pathway oscillate in the presomitic mesoderm\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Aulehla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wahl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Goldbeter and Pourqui\u00e9, 2008</a>) and single cells oscillate autonomously through feedback loops in the regulation of the hes family of transcriptional repressors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Kageyama et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Webb et al., 2016</a>), it has become clear that Dll/Notch activity between the cells is the driver of synchronization. In the absence of Notch activity or Dll expression cells gradually drift out of synchrony, leading to loss of somite pattern and thus vertebrae defects. Recent work by Oates and colleagues using mathematical modelling and experimentation identified that the levels of Dll expression not only critically influence synchronization, but also affect the periodicity of the synchronized oscillations by changing the strength of coupling between the neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Herrgen et al., 2010</a>)."

Our computational model does not simulate cell-intrinsic oscillations that are coupled via Dll4/Notch. Yet, the ultimate behaviour of the Vegfa-Dll4-Notch-Vegfr feedback loop shows highly similar elements when Dll4 levels change. Thus, although the precise wiring of the signalling circuit is different, there is a striking analogy in that rising Dll4 levels under the influence of Vegfa stimulation will increase the coupling strength between neighbouring endothelial cells. This will ultimately drive the cells to switch from differential to synchronized behaviour and thus to iterative sprouting and retraction, disrupting branching morphogenesis."

Collagen here does not currently change the Vegf signalling but merely shows where the cell body has been located. 2) The cell body was allowed to randomly move forward along filopodia tracks with a small probability (0.001 per filopodia/per timestep) whereas previously only contact with another tip cell\u2019s filopodia would trigger this migratory behaviour (see <a href=\"#bib4\">Bentley et al.

Through a series of new models, elegant microscopy and video microscopy, plus predictive computational modelling, this paper shows that \u0394-like 4 fluctuates in individual endothelial cells in sprouting vessels. The authors propose a model by which the synchronisation (or lack thereof) of Dll4 expression between ECs governs their collective cell behaviour during vessel branching and expansion. The study proposes that under normal conditions, lateral inhibitory effects of Notch promote a salt and pepper expression of Dll4 that co-ordinates endothelial migratory dynamics to regulate angiogenesis, while under high VEGF conditions, Dll4 expression becomes synchronised in ECs, which disrupts normal sprouting leading to reduced branching and elongation. The switch between branching and expansion is a potentially critical phase in the development of blood vessels, highly relevant to understanding pathological angiogenesis and indeed, in the future, therapies."

The idea from these studies would be that differential adhesion drives intercalation and thus vessel elongation, whereas synchronization disrupts intercalation, thus causing cells to cluster and thereby enlarge vessel diameter.

We have worked very hard to make this complex topic and the diverse methodology used here understandable for a broad audience, and have continued this effort in the revision. Following the editorial advice and the comment by this referee, we shortened the text, although not quite by a third. All attempts to achieve this led to omission of critical information and loss of congruence. We feel the revised version is sufficiently concise but comprehensive."

Also during our revision period, we did not have access to Dll4 blocking antibodies, but more importantly we did not have the license to perform this experiment at our new location in Berlin. This licence is pending. In any case, it is clear that blocking Notch signaling in the oxygen induced retinopathy model leads to increased branching and less tuft formation. This was already published in supplementary material in our original Nature paper on the role of Dll4 in tip cell biology in 2007 (Hellstr\u00f6m et al. Nature 2007). However, the mechanisms we identify now, and the dynamic understanding was missing at that time."

I would like to suggest that the authors include analysis of the LLC model, which is a simple experiment. Some discussion should also be included on Dll4-Notch signaling in vessel co-option, which is a common invasive growth pattern in the brain.</i>"

We invested 1.2M Euro into a 2P-LSM with the most sensitive detectors available, and optimized together with physicists and the company every aspect to get highest possible sensitivity. We can study angiogenesis in the tumour with great precision (manuscript without any Dll4/Notch data is currently in revision in science translational medicine, can be provided if requested) but sadly have not succeeded in detecting the destabilized reporter signal. At this time we cannot be sure about the reason. One confounding factor is the wavelength profile of Venus, which falls right in the middle of the autofluorescence spectrum. We get quite some signal in the expected Spectrum, but this is unfortunately not derived from the reporter. The attempts to separate any signal from autofluorescence that were successful in the ES cells, failed in the in vivo setting in the brain. Secondly, it is possible, that the overall levels in the brain are not as high as in the retina where we can clearly detect the signal when studying fresh material. This has been frustratingly tricky, but cannot be helped. Therefore the best direct data to date remain from the ES cell model. We hope that future work with new reporters including in the fish model will allow live imaging in living species including tumours. Importantly, we do not believe the lack of this in vivo data at this time invalidates our novel conclusions."

Even if the architecture is different in different tumour models, how would this help? The important question is to see whether the different tumour vessel architecture that forms in different regions within a tumour correlates with evidence for altered Dll4 spatial patterns that would indicate possible breakdown of salt-and-pepper patterns. The combined Dll4 protein staining and ISH on tumour material is very challenging and lengthy procedure, which requires optimization for every new tissue type. We strongly feel that this investment is not justified given questionable insight prospects. In addition, confirming data in models that are intrinsically more variable and not orthotopic seems difficult to justify. Given that we are asked to reduce and shorten, we hope this referee will agree that we do not follow this avenue."

However, the model we are using is based on implantation of pre-aggregate tumour cell spheres. This model shows less invasive behavior at the borders and grows much more as a solid mass that attracts blood vessels. Having said that, there is some invasion at the borders, and we assume also some cooption. We would be happy to discuss this in relation to dll4/Notch if we had a good way to distinguish these modes in fixed tissues. At this time, any such discussion would be purely speculative and we don\u2019t have any indication of specific differences or commonalities between coopted or sprouting-derived vessels. We suggest this is left out for future studies."
