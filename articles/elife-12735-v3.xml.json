Here, we show that that influenza A virus (IAV) with maximised frequencies of these dinucleotides in segment 5 showed comparable attenuation in cell culture compared to unmodified virus and a permuted control (CDLR). Attenuation was also manifested in vivo, with 10-100 fold reduced viral loads in lungs of mice infected with 200PFU of CpG-high and UpA-high mutants. However, both induced powerful inflammatory cytokine and adaptive (T cell and neutralising antibody) responses disproportionate to their replication. CpG-high infected mice also showed markedly reduced clinical severity, minimal weight loss and reduced immmunopathology in lung, yet sterilising immunity to lethal dose WT challenge was achieved after low dose (20PFU) pre-immunisation with this mutant. Increasing CpG dinucleotide frequencies represents a generic and potentially highly effective method for generating safe, highly immunoreactive vaccines."

Here, we show that that influenza A virus (IAV) with maximised frequencies of these dinucleotides in segment 5 showed comparable attenuation in cell culture compared to unmodified virus and a permuted control (CDLR). Attenuation was also manifested in vivo, with 10-100 fold reduced viral loads in lungs of mice infected with 200PFU of CpG-high and UpA-high mutants. However, both induced powerful inflammatory cytokine and adaptive (T cell and neutralising antibody) responses disproportionate to their replication. CpG-high infected mice also showed markedly reduced clinical severity, minimal weight loss and reduced immmunopathology in lung, yet sterilising immunity to lethal dose WT challenge was achieved after low dose (20PFU) pre-immunisation with this mutant. Increasing CpG dinucleotide frequencies represents a generic and potentially highly effective method for generating safe, highly immunoreactive vaccines."

Insertion of sequences with large scale compositional changes using reverse genetic systems established for many RNA and DNA viruses has provided the opportunity to investigate the effect of virus genome composition on replication ability, evolutionary fitness and transmissibility. Large scale recoding of RNA virus genomes can be functionally exploited, for example to attenuate replication in a controllable way so as to create safer, non-reverting viral vaccines. Attenuation may be achieved by increasing the relative frequencies of disfavoured or rare codons encoding the same amino acid (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennetzen and Hall, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Sharp et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). Based on prokaryotic models, these impair translation rates and accuracy through mismatches with tRNA abundances and effects on ribosomal processivity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gingold and Pilpel, 2011</a>). Production of synthetic coding sequences with increasing frequencies of\u00a0codons\u00a0or codon pairs that are naturally under-represented in vertebrate and viral genomes have been similarly proposed to reduce translation efficiency (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tats et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gutman and Hatfield, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yarus and Folley, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boycheva et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Moura et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Yang et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib23\">Nogales et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fan et al., 2015</a>)."

However, it is increasingly recognised that both codon and codon pair de-optimisation (CPD) strategies have additional confounding effects on virus genome composition that are known to also influence virus replication (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burns et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">Tulloch et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib2\">Atkinson et al., 2014</a>). Significantly, selection for disfavoured coding elements increases frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides that are normally suppressed in vertebrate RNA and DNA virus genomes. For RNA viruses, adding CpG and UpA dinucleotides in only a small part of a viral genome severely restricts virus replication, an effect that we have demonstrated to be independent of translation effects on the virus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tulloch et al., 2014</a>). The mechanism(s) through which dinucleotide composition influences virus replication rates are uncharacterised, and existing data indicates that they are independent of interferon pathways and PKR-mediated recognition of viral RNA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atkinson et al., 2014</a>)."

This system additionally provided the opportunity to investigate whether CpG or UpA elevation showed comparable phenotypic effects on a virus with a substantially different replication mechanism to echovirus 7 (E7), which is markedly attenuated upon increase of the CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequency of its genome (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atkinson et al., 2014</a>)."

Changes were consistent with an acute to subacute disease process at days 3 and 6 while day 14 samples exhibited more chronic pathology including prominent evidence of repair such as piling up of epithelial cells lining the airways and florid type II pneumocyte proliferation outlining alveolar spaces. Infection with the CpG-high mutant virus produced less pathology at day 3 compared to the WT, CDLR and UpA-high variants. The CpG-high mutant also showed a significantly more rapid resolution of inflammation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; scored as the mean of perivascular, peribronchiolar and interstitial inflammatory lesions; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Epithelial and interstitial necrosis was prominent in mice infected with all IAV variants, but had largely resolved by day 14 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Consistent with its reduced overall pathology, CpG-high showed more rapid resolution of epithelial and interstitial cell repair processes at day 14 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Contrastingly, the histopathological changes in the UpA-high infected mice were similar to WT and CDLR infected mice at all time points and dosages."

Substantial (&gt;two-fold) induction of 21 of the 40 cytokines in the panel over levels in mock infected mice was observed in at least one IAV strain at days 3 and 6, but with these showed substantial variability in levels between time points. With the exception of IP-10, which was maximally induced at day 3, cytokine levels increased between days 3 and 6, while they became largely undetectable on day 14 after resolution of infection. Most prominent among induced cytokines were chemokines (<i>e.g.</i> RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1) and less prominent induction of interleukins or TNF-\u03b1. In contrast to the increased levels between days 3 and 6 in the majority of the inflammatory cytokines, individual mouse measurements of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA by qPCR showed consistently higher levels at day 3, particularly in the WT and CDLR-infected groups (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

This raised the question of whether the response to infection with the CpG high mutant conferred protection from re-infection. To investigate this and to determine the dose of virus required to confer protection, cohorts of 4 mice were infected with reduced doses (100, 50 and 20 PFU) of the CpG-high virus mutant and weight loss was compared with those infected at the original dose (Experiment 3 - <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

Firstly, we have documented that its attenuated phenotype results directly from the compositional changes in segment 5 since other forms of sequence disruption that retained dinucleotide frequencies (CDLR) was phenotypically equivalent to WT. Thus attenuation is based on the cumulative effect of several hundred individual nucleotide changes associated with increasing CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that cannot readily revert to wild type virulence. This contrasts with conventional attenuation mechanisms, in which replication ability is decreased through the presence of a limited number of nucleotide changes that may potentially revert. For example, attenuation of the currently used temperature sensitive FluMist backbone of IAV is dependent on only 4\u20135 amino acid changes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jin et al., 2003</a>) and there is at least the theoretical possibility that one or more of these may revert and increase virulence in vaccinees."

The CpG-mutant in the current study induced these responses both in the lung and spleen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), equivalent to the response to WT virus despite its &gt;ten-fold reduction in replication in the lung. The presence of T cell epitopes in more conserved genome regions than HA and NA additionally provides the ability of a monovalent attenuated vaccine to confer protection against heterologous IAV challenge, as has been demonstrated in experimental mouse models (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nogales et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wang et al., 2009</a>)."

These may potentially be related to the ability of both CpG- and UpA-high mutants to induce powerful innate and adaptive immune responses in infected mice disproportionate to their replication phenotypes. The key observation was the equivalence in T cell and B cell responses and induction of local cytokine responses by virus mutants that replicated ten\u2013hundred fold less in the lung than WT (or CDLR) viruses. Contrastingly, inoculation of all of these viruses at a ten-fold lower dose reduced host response to a degree comparable to their reduction in replication. Similar maintenance of host response despite attenuation of replication has been observed repeatedly in other studies in which codon or codon pair usage was altered (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nogales et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mueller et al., 2010</a>).

For all sequences, ratios of observed CpG and UpA frequencies to expected frequencies derived from mononucleotide composition were calculated by the formula f(XpY)/f(X)*f(Y) and referred to as O/E ratios (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The codon adaptation index for human codon usage was calculated through the website <a href=\"http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/\">http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/</a> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Puigbo et al., 2008</a>)."

Firstly, sequences of the mutated segment 5 sequences were assembled into separate bidirectional expression (\u201cpDUAL\u201d) plasmids. Then, 8 pDUAL plasmids (250 ng each with 4\u00a0\u03bcl Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Loughborough, UK) containing sequences of a complete IAV genome were used to transfect 293T cells simultaneously, with transfections either incorporating the WT segment 5 sequence or a dinucleotide modified version. After overnight incubation, virus growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin, 0.14% BSA fraction V and penicillin (100\u2009U/ml) and streptomycin (100\u2009\u03bcg/ml)) was added to allow a small-scale amplification of the viruses in 293T cells. After 48\u2009hr, the virus particle-containing supernatants were passaged on MDCK cells or in embryonated chicken eggs to further amplify the viruses to obtain working stocks. To confirm the sequences of recovered IAV mutants were correct, RNA was extracted from the virus-containing supernatants using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits (Qiagen,\u00a0Manchester,\u00a0UK). A reverse transcription reaction was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Loughborough, UK). Subsequently, the cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using segment 5-specific primes listed in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, and sequenced by BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies, Loughborough, UK)."

Mice were weighed daily and assessed for clinical signs of infection. At various time points post-inoculation, mice were euthanized and whole blood was collected with subsequent collection of plasma supernatant after coagulation (for microneutralisation assays). Left lungs were harvested for qPCR (as above), plaque assay (as above), mouse cytokine arrays (below) or T cell assays (below). The four lobes of the right lung were inflated with and then immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, UKSigma-Aldrich) until fixed, then processed using routine methods and embedded in paraffin blocks. 5\u00a0\u03bcm thin section were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. The sections were assessed (blinded) by a veterinary pathologist (PMB). The individual pathology features assessed were damage to the airway epithelium (degeneration, necrosis and repair), perivascular inflammation, peribronchi/bronchiolar inflammation, interstitial inflammation, interstitial necrosis and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Each feature was scored from 1 (mild) to 3 (marked). The percentage of lung affected was also noted.

As way of background, there have been a number of papers arguing that viruses can be attenuated by altering their \"codon-pair\" frequencies. Some of the authors of this paper have argued that this codon-pair de-optimization was in fact due to the fact that altering codon pairs also increased CpG and UpA dinucleotides. They have published prior work showing that altering the dinucleotide frequencies without altering codon pairs leads to similar levels of attenuation. Based on this work, they have argued that CpG/UpA di-nucleotides mediate attenuation of mammalian viruses though some as-yet unknown mechanism. This study is an important continuation of previous work from this group exploring the biology of codon bias in virus-host interactions using echovirus 7. The paper is lucid and experiments performed at the highest levels of technical competence. The findings will be of general interest for both basic and translational scientists."

They find that the CpG and UpA viruses are greatly attenuated both in MDCK cells and mice. The scrambled control appears slightly attenuated in MDCK cells and not detectably attenuated in mice. The CpG/UpA viruses induce substantial levels of cytokines despite replicating less well. This is used to note that such viruses might be a good way to create vaccines."

The primary problem is as follows: there are undoubtedly a great number of ways that synonymous mutations can alter viral fitness, including altering with RNA structure, altering translation efficiency, altering genome packaging efficiency, introducing spurious splicing, etc. So how are we to know that the CpG/UpA altered viruses are really attenuated <i>because</i> of their altered di-nucleotide content, rather than due to some other effect of one of the numerous synonymous mutations. We are supposed to be re-assured that this is not the case because the scrambled control. While such a scrambled control is necessary to make such a case (and certainly should have been included in all of the now dubious codon-pair de-optimization studies), it is not sufficient. In effect, we have one data point for the control (the scrambled control) and two data points for the di-nucleotide alteration."

Each of these summary statistics is correlated with many of the others. It is certainly true that IF summary statistic A is mechanistically causal, and summary statistic B is not, and there are no other important features of the sequence controlling attenuation <i>then</i> creating variant sequences that change A but hold B constant should attenuate, while variants that change B without changing A should not attenuate. The converse doesn't follow. The true cause of attenuation could be some feature that no one has thought to look for, something perhaps as simple as the frequency of one particular codon that tends to change when adapting sequences to measure A but not measure B. Or it could be something extremely complex involving long-range interactions that for some reason tend to be much more sensitive to measure A than to measure B. Just as the recognition that changing CPS tends to change CpG frequencies generated an alternate hypothesis for attenuation, one could generate other alternate hypotheses for summaries that correlate with these measures. For practicable numbers of experiments, it will be hard to exclude \u2013 based on the attenuation of certain sequences but not others \u2013 all but one hypothesis for the causal mechanism."

By analogy, the finding that a particular sequence is the mechanism of bacteriophage restriction is made far more convincing by the discovery of a specific restriction enzyme with the specified target sequence that restricts phage replication and that, when knocked out in the bacterial host, no longer does so."

As recently reported by a number of labs, flu virus preps can differ widely in their number of semi-infectious particles, and that in one case, this was modulated by sequence alterations. It would be nice to see that the different viruses don't vary widely in their particle to PFU ratios. This can be easily done by flow cytometry at very low MOI to enumerate the number of particles capable of producing viral proteins following infection. For example see <a href=\"http://jvi.asm.org/content/87/6/3155.short\">http://jvi.asm.org/content/87/6/3155.short</a>. At the same time, the findings can be corroborated just based on HA titrations: which despite its simplicity is perhaps the most accurate method for counting particles (at the end point, there is one particle for every two RBC)."

As a more general perspective, increasing CpG and UpA frequencies in other virus systems (e.g.echovirus 7) also increases RNA/particle to infectivity ratios. E7 is a monopartite virus indicating that alterations to RNA / infectivity ratio as a result of dinucleotide frequency changes occur independently of packaging. Summarily, the reviewers requested further analysis in the form of HA assay, which we have undertaken and supported by generating HA:infectivity and RNA:infectivity ratios."

To show that the same <i>amount</i> of protein is produced, virus stocks were analysed by PAGE, and relative ratios of the different virus structural proteins were quantified. The relative amounts of protein production were consistent, demonstrating that NP production was not defective in our mutant viruses (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).
