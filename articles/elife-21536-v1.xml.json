We used FGF-receptor signaling to identify <i>EGR1</i> as a locus that strongly responds to the activation of a majority of the recognized protein kinase oncogenes, including 30 receptor tyrosine kinases and 154 of their disease-associated mutants. The <i>EGR1</i> promoter was engineered to enhance <i>trans</i>-activation capacity and optimized for simple screening assays with luciferase or fluorescent reporters. The efficacy of the developed, fully synthetic reporters was demonstrated by the identification of novel targets for two clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nilotinib and osimertinib. A universal reporter system for in-cell protein kinase profiling will facilitate repurposing of existing anti-cancer drugs and identification of novel inhibitors in high-throughput screening studies."

We used FGF-receptor signaling to identify <i>EGR1</i> as a locus that strongly responds to the activation of a majority of the recognized protein kinase oncogenes, including 30 receptor tyrosine kinases and 154 of their disease-associated mutants. The <i>EGR1</i> promoter was engineered to enhance <i>trans</i>-activation capacity and optimized for simple screening assays with luciferase or fluorescent reporters. The efficacy of the developed, fully synthetic reporters was demonstrated by the identification of novel targets for two clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nilotinib and osimertinib. A universal reporter system for in-cell protein kinase profiling will facilitate repurposing of existing anti-cancer drugs and identification of novel inhibitors in high-throughput screening studies."

While cell-free activity profiling may only uncover chemicals that directly target RTK catalytic function, in-cell profiling confers several additional benefits that could improve the drug development process. First, RTKs are targeted in their natural conformation, with post-translational modifications and in the\u00a0cell metabolic environment. The protein-protein interactions involved in signal transduction through the RTK-associated signaling complexes, downstream elements, or effector pathways may also be targeted, increasing the chance of success. In-cell profiling may identify biological pathways that naturally oppose the signaling of a certain RTK, and can then be therapeutically exploited (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wendt et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, this approach may also enable the targeting of RTKs in non-signaling states, via interference either with their expression, maturation and transport to the cell membrane or their internalization and degradation. Finally, in-cell activity profiling is applicable to disease-specific in vitro and in vivo models. This is important in the development of therapeutics for chronic diseases caused by pathological RTK signaling, such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or developmental disorders (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fountas et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">ten Freyhaus et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Harskamp et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Laederich and Horton, 2012</a>), all of which are poorly represented in current clinic (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bamborough, 2012</a>). Lastly, several important oncogenes and downstream targets of RTK signaling, such as RAS, appear not druggable directly (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cox et al., 2014</a>) and thus the inhibitors of their signaling may only be discovered via in-cell activity profiling. However, the existing toolkits for in-cell RTK activity profiling provide only partial solutions for the development of RTK inhibitors, as they only focus on a few RTKs or their disease-associated mutants (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), are technically or instrumentally challenging, or require the development of RTK-specific tools (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ni et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ingl\u00e9s-Prieto et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Regot et al., 2014</a>)."

Hence, the strong effect of ERK on gene transcription could be exploited in the development of reporters that are applicable to the activity profiling of many different RTKs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yang et al., 2003</a>). Here, we report the engineering of one such system, which is based on the promoter sequences of the ERK target gene <i>EGR1</i> (<i>Early growth response 1</i>). We demonstrate that the <i>EGR1</i>-based reporter system is applicable to simple in-cell activity profiling of most protein kinase oncogenes. Additionally, we generate proof-of-concept examples for the use of this system in the identification of novel targets for clinically used protein kinase inhibitors."

The expression profiling of cells treated with FGFR ligand FGF2 identified <i>Egr1</i>, <i>Egr2</i>, <i>Nr4A2</i>, <i>Dusp6</i> and <i>Rgs1</i> among the most strongly induced genes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Krejci et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Buchtova et al., 2015</a>). The putative promoter sequences of human <i>EGR1</i>, <i>EGR2</i>, <i>NR4A2</i>, <i>DUSP6</i> and <i>RGS1,</i> located directly upstream of the transcription start sites (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), were cloned into the promoterless pGL4.17 vector carrying firefly luciferase. In dual-luciferase activity assays performed in RCS cells, <i>EGR1</i> promoter showed the strongest response, as it was <i>trans</i>-activated approximately 12-fold following FGF2 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and was therefore chosen for subsequent studies. FGF2 induced endogenous EGR1 protein expression in seven different cell types tested, and this phenotype was dependent on ERK activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Four successive rounds of 3- and/or 5-prime sequence shortening and optimization identified a 402nt-long region (\u2212799/\u2013397 relative to TSS) that is critical for FGF2-mediated <i>trans</i>-activation (called D-E element) of the <i>EGR1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The addition of two extra copies of the D-E element into the <i>EGR1</i> promoter (hEGR1-D) enhanced its response to FGF2 by approximately 50% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We named this construct pKrox24(2xD-E_inD)<sup>Luc</sup> after KROX24, one of the alternative names of EGR1 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). The level of pKrox24(2xD-E_inD)<sup>Luc</sup> FGF2-mediated <i>trans</i>-activation in RCS cells peaked at approximately 40 ng/ml FGF2. Treatment of RCS cells with higher doses of FGF2 further elevated ERK activation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Krejci et al., 2007</a>), but had a negligible effect on pKrox24(2xD-E_inD)<sup>Luc</sup> activity (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), implying that it is unlikely that further development of the pKrox24(2xD-E_inD)<sup>Luc</sup> promoter sequence would yield a significant increase in trans-activation capacity. In the five different cell types tested, pKrox24(2xD-E_inD)<sup>Luc</sup> responded to the activation of FGFR signaling following FGF2 addition, as well as to the chemical inhibition of endogenous FGFR signaling (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

This is likely due to the fact that in active RTKs some phosphotyrosines are differentially phosphorylated and thus may not be identified by antibodies designed for specific motifs. The most notable example is FGFR3, as all five active mutants associated with skeletal dysplasia and cancer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kant et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Passos-Bueno et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Carter et al., 2015</a>) induced EGR1, but only K650M FGFR3 was found to be phosphorylated by an antibody recognizing FGFR phosphorylation at Y653/Y654. The pseudokinases lacking catalytic activity (ROR1, ROR2, RYK, ERBB3) were among the RTKs that did not induce EGR1, along with RTKs that did not autophosphorylate after expression in 293T cells (TYRO3, INSRR, ROS1) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Furthermore, 36 mutants failed to induce EGR1 despite being derived from RTKs that induce EGR1 expression. The majority of these mutants (83%) were kinase-inactive mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). The remaining six mutants did not induce EGR1 because of weak activation (DDR1<sup>R896Q</sup>, ERBB4<sup>E836K</sup>, RET<sup>E768N</sup>) or due to an unknown reason (RON<sup>R470C</sup>, RON<sup>R1231C</sup>, PDGFRB<sup>D850N</sup>). Overall, the RTK activation correlated with EGR1 induction in 96% (154 out of 160) of the tested wt and mutant RTKs. Thirteen additional non-receptor tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases C-RAF and B-RAF as well as RAS small GTPase, were subjected to the same analyses (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, we have demonstrated that, apart from the JAK and MAPKK kinases not evaluated in this study, all of the protein kinase oncogenes recognized to date (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vogelstein et al., 2013</a>) are capable of inducing EGR1 expression in 293T cells."

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation that produces a cytoplasmic BCR-ABL fusion protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Zhao et al., 2002</a>). The suppression of BCR-ABL catalytic activity with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has greatly improved CML prognosis, effectively turning a once fatal cancer into a manageable chronic disease. Several generations of BCR-ABL TKIs have been developed to improve efficacy and overcome the BCR-ABL resistance to first generation TKIs caused by mutations and gene amplifications (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hochhaus et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cortes et al., 2013</a>). However, some TKIs, such as ponatinib, can cause severe toxicity in CML patients and even lead to discontinuation of the therapy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Modugno, 2014</a>). The reasons why these BCR-ABL TKI side-effects occur are not clear, and in this way, the elucidation of how TKIs affect physiological tyrosine kinase signaling is of major interest to CML research. To identify novel targets, we evaluated the activity of five clinically used BCR-ABL TKIs, that\u00a0is ponatinib, imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and nilotinib, against a panel of 28 wt RTKs. Different TKI concentrations were used to assess the inhibition of BCR-ABL activity as well as cell toxicity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> shows that all tested TKIs inhibited RTKs that had already been reported as targets in literature (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>), with exception of LTK and INSR, which were identified as two novel targets for nilotinib (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Osimertinib is a mutant-selective EGFR inhibitor, with 200-fold selectivity for EGFR mutants T790M and L858R over the wt EGFR (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cross et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Finlay et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang and Zhou, 2014</a>). Crystallographic studies indicate that osimertinib binds to the outer edge of the EGFR ATP binding pocket through a covalent bond with Cys797 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yosaatmadja et al., 2015</a>). Although these data provide no clear explanation for EGFR mutant versus the wt selectivity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cross et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Finlay et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang and Zhou, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yosaatmadja et al., 2015</a>), osimertinib is expected to possess a very narrow spectrum of RTK specificity, limited to EGFR and the closely related ERBB2 and ERBB4. We tested this prediction by evaluating osimertinib activity against 30 wt RTKs and 116 of their active mutants with a pKrox24(2xD-E_inD)<sup>Luc</sup> luciferase assay in 293T cells. We observed inhibitory activity for osimertinib against EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB4, but not for the other 26 RTKs and 99 mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). However, LTK was an exception, as it appeared to be inhibited by osimertinib in both wt and mutant forms. These included the D535N and L844I mutants, which associate with multiple myeloma and stomach carcinoma (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hucthagowder et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kubo et al., 2009</a>), respectively, and the W831C and H608Y substitutions found in the Cosmic and VarSome databases. The osimertinib activity was confirmed by suppression of the autophosphorylation of LTK expressed in 293T cells, and by inhibition of LTK-mediated phosphorylation of recombinant STAT1 substrate in cell-free kinase assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

While the luciferase reporters may be applied to tractable cell models to repurpose existing protein kinase inhibitors, the application of fluorescent pKrox24 reporters to high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries offers a major advantage. Cells can be viewed any time during the screening, and this characteristic of HTS would enable researchers to detect false-positive hits based on the inhibition of dTomato and DsRed expression by cell-toxic compounds through mechanisms unrelated to the target protein kinase. Hence, these reporters could improve the interpretation of HTS screening data by readily eliminating false-positive hits."

We demonstrate that Krox24 transactivation gradually increases with 1-40 ng/ml FGF2, but peaks and plateaus at 40-100 ng/ml of FGF2. This suggests that the Krox24 reporters may have a limited capacity to quantitatively record the differences in RTK activation, especially in RTKs which are strong activators of ERK pathway, such as the FGFRs. In the manuscript revision, we tested the ability of Krox24 reporters to record differences in RTK activation by two experiments: (A) by determining whether different mutants belonging to one RTK transactivate Krox24 differently, corresponding to their known activity; (B) by determining whether the two groups of unrelated wt RTKs, belonging to strong or weak ERK activators, transactivate Krox24 reporters differently. The data presented by <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a> demonstrate that, in both cases, the relative differences in RTK activity can be distinguished by the levels of EGR1 expression and Krox24 reporter transactivation."

This is in contrast to data presented by <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>, which show only partial AZD1480-mediated inhibition of Krox24 transactivation caused by high endogenous FGFR activity in hESC and hiPSC cells. The data presented elsewhere (Gudernova et al., 2016; Human Molecular Genetics, 25, 9-23), or those on <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 2</a> demonstrate that AZD1480 is a potent FGFR inhibitor, capable of complete suppression of activation of even highly active <i>FGFR1</i>-3 mutants. Thus the residual Krox24 activity after AZD1480 treatment, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>, appears to be caused by ERK activation independent of FGFR signaling. This is no surprise since cultured cells usually have some levels of background ERK activity caused by serum growth factors. This fact could limit the use of Krox24 reporters in situations where the RTK transfection or activation of endogenous RTK signaling induces very little ERK activation on the top of high ERK background, and thus the two sources cannot be clearly distinguished from each other. Our data demonstrate that this is not the case for majority of the RTKs and their mutants tested here, which clearly induce EGR1 or transactivate Krox24 reporters when expressed in cells or endogenously, when activated by their cognate ligands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A</a>,<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#fig5\">5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s8\">8D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 2</a>)."
