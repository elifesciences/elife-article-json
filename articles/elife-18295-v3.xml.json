                    "text": "<i>Drosophila</i> hematopoiesis bears striking resemblance with that of vertebrates, both in the context of distinct phases and the signaling molecules. Even though, there has been no evidence of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in <i>Drosophila</i>, the larval lymph gland with its Hedgehog dependent progenitors served as an invertebrate model of progenitor biology. Employing lineage-tracing analyses, we have now identified <i>Notch</i> expressing HSCs in the first instar larval lymph gland. Our studies clearly establish the hierarchical relationship between <i>Notch</i> expressing HSCs and the previously described <i>Domeless</i> expressing progenitors. These HSCs require Decapentapelagic (Dpp) signal from the hematopoietic niche for their maintenance in an identical manner to vertebrate aorta-gonadal-mesonephros (AGM) HSCs. Thus, this study not only extends the conservation across these divergent taxa, but also provides a new model that can be exploited to gain better insight into the AGM related Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)."

Even though, there has been no evidence of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in <i>Drosophila</i>, the larval lymph gland with its Hedgehog dependent progenitors served as an invertebrate model of progenitor biology. Employing lineage-tracing analyses, we have now identified <i>Notch</i> expressing HSCs in the first instar larval lymph gland. Our studies clearly establish the hierarchical relationship between <i>Notch</i> expressing HSCs and the previously described <i>Domeless</i> expressing progenitors. These HSCs require Decapentapelagic (Dpp) signal from the hematopoietic niche for their maintenance in an identical manner to vertebrate aorta-gonadal-mesonephros (AGM) HSCs. Thus, this study not only extends the conservation across these divergent taxa, but also provides a new model that can be exploited to gain better insight into the AGM related Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)."

There are many similarities between how blood cells develop in vertebrate animals, such as humans, and in fruit flies. Therefore, researchers often use fruit flies as models to study how vertebrates make new blood cells. Fruit fly larvae produce new blood cells in the lymph gland from \u201cprogenitor\u201d cells that show several similarities to the stem cells that make blood cells in vertebrates, known as Hematopoietic Stem Cells (or HSCs for short). The progenitor cells grow and divide and subsequently develop into mature blood cells."

For example, a signal protein called Hedgehog delivered from the niche maintains the progenitor cells. On the other hand, HSCs in vertebrates rely on another signal protein called BMP to maintain them. Although the progenitor cells present in the lymph gland are believed to behave like vertebrate stem cells, it is not clear whether fruit flies also have groups of HSCs."

The experiments reveal a new group of cells in the lymph gland that behave like vertebrate stem cells and give rise to progenitor cells. Since the newly discovered cells also depend on a niche for their maintenance, Dey et al. named them HSCs. Further experiments show that, like HSCs in vertebrates, the fruit fly HSCs use Dpp (the fruit fly equivalent of BMP) as a niche signal."

The onset of definitive hematopoiesis in <i>Drosophila</i> occurs in a defined multi-lobed larval organ, the lymph gland. The first or the primary lobe of the lymph gland houses a bunch of stem -like progenitor cells in its central region forming the medullary zone (MZ). These multi-potent progenitor cells can give rise to all blood cell lineages which populate the outer periphery of the gland, referred as the cortical zone, CZ (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jung et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Posterior to both of these zones is the niche or the Posterior Signaling Centre (PSC), which carefully orchestrates homeostasis in the organ through an intricate regulatory network, thereby maintaining the progenitors and the differentiating hemocytes and their dainty balance (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lebestky et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mandal et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mondal et al., 2011</a>). Recent work has shown that some of the progenitors in the posterior lobes of the lymph gland home into active hematopoietic hubs in adult flies and initiate new blood cell formation and specification (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ghosh et al., 2015</a>)."

The second probe uses a CycB moiety fused to mRFP and is susceptible to degradation by APC/C during G1 phase, thereby clearly identifying cells in S, G2, and M phase.

The number of these cells was now reduced to 3 (stars, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013D'\"'</a>). We have previously showed that cell division in <i>Notch</i> expressing cells starts from 13 hr onwards (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013I\"</a>,\u00a0N and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Interestingly, the second cell type observed was <i>Notch</i> lineage traced and <i>dome</i> positive (magenta) which also validated that indeed cell division has happened during this time. This group thus was the clonal expansion of <i>Notch</i> expressing cells that have now turned on <i>domeless</i> expression. In addition, we also detected few cells that were not <i>Notch</i> lineage traced but expressed <i>dome</i> (magenta: arrowheads). This group we believe, arose from the <i>dome</i> expressing cells that co-existed with <i>Notch\u00a0</i>cells during the time of lineage tracing."

Remarkably, at 30 hr AEH the lymph gland was substantially populated by <i>dome</i> (magenta) expressing cells that were lineage traced for <i>Notch</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013F'\"</a>). Quite interestingly, none of the <i>Notch</i> (red: <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) expressing cells were seen from this time onwards, undoubtedly strengthening the fact that <i>Notch</i> positive cells eventually become <i>dome</i> positive cells. When this genotype was analyzed at late third instar (following the same regime of lineage tracing as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), this transient labeling of the <i>Notch</i> positive cells only during first instar resulted in labeling of almost all cells of the lymph gland including <i>dome</i> expressing progenitors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013G'\"</a>, also see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013C\"</a>)."

As Notch is required in several development processes, we encountered early lethality on activation of <i>rpr</i>. A narrow window of four hours activation of <i>reaper</i> post emergence of larvae yielded few individuals that were not lethal at late third instar stage. To assay, if Notch expressing cells were successfully ablated, <i>dome-MESO-LacZ</i> was brought in the background of <i>N-Gal4</i>. On restricted activation of <i>UAS-rpr</i>, few individuals of every batch were analyzed at first instar stages to ensure that the lymph gland contain only <i>dome-MESO-LacZ</i> and no Notch expressing cells, confirming a successful ablation (Compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> with <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The siblings of the batch that had only <i>dome</i> expressing progenitors in the first instar lymph gland and made it to third instar stage, were analyzed.

Another study revealed that Dpp signaling is required in the third instar larvae to regulate the size of PSC (<a href=\"#bib65\">Pennetier et al., 2012</a>). Here in this current study, we effectively demonstrate that Dpp signaling is also a requisite during the first instar larvae to sustain and maintain the HSCs existing at that time without affecting the niche. Quantitative analysis revealed that although the niche number got affected in <i>dpp</i> mutants, the loss of Dpp in the first 18 hr AEH, however, affected the HSCs only (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1M</a>) as the niche cell numbers in this case was comparable to wild type.

Dpp signaling has never been implicated in non-autonomous control over any other cell type in the lymph gland directly. Our study highlights this aspect of Dpp signaling in the homeostasis of the larval lymph gland. In this context, it is worth noting that both male and female germline stem cells in <i>Drosophila</i> also employ Dpp pathway for their maintenance (<a href=\"#bib84\">Xie and Spradling, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kawase et al., 2004</a>)."

Here, in this study, we have ventured into the early first instar larval lymph gland and discovered the founders of the considerably well studied prohemocytes that populate the MZ. These HSCs express several molecular markers, which are commonly associated with hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates namely Notch, STAT, Homothorax and BMP transcription factor Mad (<a href=\"#bib37\">Koch et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Stine and Matunis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Argiropoulos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Unnisa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Varnum-Finney et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burns et al., 2005</a>). Anatomical analysis of the HSCs unravels its close association with dorsal vessel (DV), an equivalent of larval heart. This is in tune with previous observation in zebra fish and mouse, where it has been established that HSCs reside primarily in the vascular and/or perivascular niches during embryonic and fetal development (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kiel and Morrison, 2008</a>).

They rely on Dpp signaling from the previously identified hematopoietic niche/PSC. Our genetic analyses clearly demonstrate that attenuation of Dpp signaling affects HSCs maintenance in the early lymph gland. This reflects a great degree of similarity to the vertebrate AGM related HSCs that express BMP4 receptor and require BMP4 signaling as the niche signal from the neighboring mesenchyme for their maintenance (<a href=\"#bib11\">Durand et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Drevon and Jaffredo, 2014</a>). It has been demonstrated that both the vertebrate AGM and <i>Drosophila</i> cardiogenic mesoderm are specified by identical signals and house blood cell precursors originating from hemangioblasts (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mandal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 1998</a>).

Strikingly, the blood precursors present in the lymph gland upon expansion actually home into the adult hematopoietic hub, a simpler version of the bone marrow (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ghosh et al., 2015</a>). However, in contrast to vertebrate system, in case of <i>Drosophila</i>, the larval lymph gland serves as the only organ involved for maturation and expansion of hemocytes before the final seeding happens into the hematopoietic hub of adult. We believe that since the entire process of genesis, expansion and lineage commitment happens within the lymph gland, the HSCs, unlike mammals, in this case are transient. Our temporal analysis reveal that that the <i>Notch</i> expressing HSCs can be observed in the first instar lymph gland only for the first 20 hr of development. During this time frame they divide and give birth to <i>domeless</i> expressing blood cell progenitors. Thus, it can be considered that the requirement of HSCs in the lymph gland is to establish a stockpile of undifferentiated progenitors that in turn generates differentiated blood cells for the immediate requirement of larval development and subsequently to support the upcoming events of metamorphosis and adult hematopoiesis."

The cardiogenic mesoderm in <i>Drosophila</i> is analogous to the developing AGM of vertebrate and is nourished by identical signals. In vertebrates, a subset of AGM-derived cells has been proposed to constitute hemangioblasts (HB), which produce HSCs and endothelial cells. These HSCs also require BMP4 signaling from the AGM mesenchyme (AGM MC) for its maintenance. Likewise in flies, a seeding HB has been proposed to give rise to a subpopulation of cardioblasts and lymph gland primordia. Lymph gland progenitors are thus derived from few HSCs that also require niche-derived Dpp signaling for their maintenance.

Extensive studies employing mammalian HSCs have addressed several aspects of HSC biology that include but are not limited to their developmental origin, molecular mechanisms regulating their cycling, viability and lineage commitment of HSCs as well as several issues related to hematopoietic abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ciau-Uitz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dzierzak and Speck, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Babovic and Eaves, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eaves, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Golub and Cumano, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mikkola and Orkin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nakano et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Orkin and Zon, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Tavian et al., 2010</a>). One of the aspects that has drawn much attention is to understand the mechanisms regulating self-renewal of early HSCs as it holds promise in developing measures for early HSCs expansion. Due to technical limitations and rarity of AGM HSCs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Medvinsky et al., 2011</a>), we still have little understanding about the nature of division that the cells undergo. Employing this amenable invertebrate model, we can now gather insights into such a process and boost our understanding of mechanism of early HSC expansion."

This has a far-reaching implication spilling into stem cell based therapies, wherein it is imperative to know how tissue specific stem cells are specified in development. Furthermore, the transcriptional networks controlling HSC fate during mammalian embryonic development are highly complex (<a href=\"#bib69\">Robin and Durand, 2010</a>). In this direction, the fly model can step in to identify and elucidate not only normal development but also several uncharacterized early pathological events linked with embryonic HSC related disorders."

Although past studies have shown the presence of progenitors, the presence of \"hematopoietic stem cells\" (HSCs) in <i>Drosophila</i> has not yet been fully established. The authors use cell specific markers and morphometric measurements to determine the presence of a unique cell type in proximity to the dorsal vessel of the first instar larvae. These cells express high levels of serpent (srp), a pan-blood cell marker, but lack a prohemocytes marker, domeless (dom). Using a candidate approach they discover that these cells are found 8 hours after egg hatching (AEH), are larger than prohemocytes and express high levels of Notch. They are initially slow cycling and eventually enter mitosis 13 hours AEH. They complete division by 18 hours AEH to give rise to progenitors of the larval lymph gland, which eventually express Dome. The authors further establish that the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the lymph gland acts as the HSC niche and provide Dpp signaling for the maintenance of these cells. Loss of Dpp signaling, results in the failure of HSC self-renewal and in the formation of small lymph glands. Altogether, these results indicate the presence of HSCs in the first 20 hours of larval development that establishes a reservoir of hemocyte progenitors required for adult hematopoiesis."

In complementary, these potential HSCs could be genetically ablated and show no progenies arising from them. Along the same line, in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, the authors made a strong statement that those N-expressing cells are founder cells for those Dome-expressing cells. However, some of the later stage Dome-expressing cells also come from N-negative cells. It is OK that more than one founder cell exists. But in order to complement the tracing experiments, more convincing evidence would be ablation of those N-positive cells lead to significant decrease of Dome-cells, similar to the experiments in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>.

I suggest to edit the text around here to simply convey the point that 'transient-labeling of nucleus by histoneH2B-GFP allowed to monitor these cells' proliferation status'.

The siblings of the batch that had only <i>dome-MESO-LacZ</i> expressing cells in the first instar larval lymph gland and made to third instar stage were analyzed. We found that genetic ablation of Notch expressing cells causes a massive reduction in the lymph gland size at third instar (please compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> with <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Quantitative analyses revealed that an average 5-fold reduction in the total size of the lymph gland (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Moreover, the ratio of area of progenitor cell population versus the total lymph gland area got reduced by more than 2 fold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) indicating that by killing the Notch expressing founder cells, the reserve population of progenitors arising from them were also eliminated.

Similarly, when we analyzed third instar larval lymph glands, we also observed that the niche number gets affected in dpp heteroallelic condition. However, in this current study, we effectively demonstrate that loss of dpp, specifically in the first 18h AEH, affects the number of HSCs without having any obvious effect on the number of niche cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1M</a>).These results clearly establish that in the first instar larvae Dpp signaling from the niche (PSC) is essential for the sustenance of the HSCs. We have now included these results in the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cDpp signal from the PSC maintains the self-renewal of HSCs\u201d, last paragraph)."
