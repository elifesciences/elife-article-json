However, the inceptive mechanisms imposing the symmetry-breaking are incompletely understood. In <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i>, the Hbox12 homeodomain-containing repressor is expressed by prospective dorsal cells, spatially facing and preceding the onset of nodal transcription. We report that Hbox12-misexpression provokes DV abnormalities, attenuating <i>nodal</i> and <i>nodal</i>-dependent transcription. Reciprocally, impairing <i>hbox12</i> function disrupts DV polarity by allowing ectopic expression of nodal. Clonal loss-of-function, inflicted by blastomere transplantation or gene-transfer assays, highlights that DV polarization requires Hbox12 action in dorsal cells. Remarkably, the localized knock-down of <i>nodal</i> restores DV polarity of embryos lacking <i>hbox12</i> function. Finally, we show that <i>hbox12</i> is a dorsal-specific negative modulator of the p38-MAPK activity, which is required for <i>nodal</i> expression. Altogether, our results suggest that Hbox12 function is essential for proper positioning of the DV organizer."
