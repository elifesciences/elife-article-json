Despite their importance, these components are not absolutely conserved between parts of the tree of life, suggesting that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. We evolved <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> for 1000 generations without the important polarity gene <i>BEM1</i>. Initially the <i>bem1\u2206</i> lineages rapidly increase in fitness and then slowly reach &gt;90% of the fitness of their <i>BEM1</i> ancestors at the end of the evolution. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization reveals a common evolutionary trajectory, with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. Our results show that organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and suggest that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions."

This activity is essential for the yeast to replicate itself. Previous studies have shown that the <i>BEM1</i> gene had a different role in other species of fungi, which suggests that yeast may have other genes that previously assumed the role that <i>BEM1</i> does now. In this study, Laan et al. removed <i>BEM1</i> from yeast and allowed the population of mutant cells to evolve for a thousand generations. The approach differs from previous studies because Laan et al. deliberately selected for yeast that had acquired multiple genetic mutations that can together almost fully compensate for the loss of <i>BEM1</i>."

However, by the end of the experiment, the cells were able to grow almost as well as the original yeast cells had before the gene deletion. Genetic analysis revealed that the deletion of <i>BEM1</i> triggers the inactivation of other genes that are also involved in the regulation of polarity, which largely restored the ability of the disrupted polarity module to work. This restoration follows a \u2018reproducible trajectory\u2019, as the same genes were switched off in the same order in different populations of yeast that were studied at the same time."

In cell polarization and movement, a biochemical and biophysical picture is emerging of how those complex functional modules self-organize to accomplish their functions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Howard et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Goehring and Grill, 2013</a>). Surprisingly, components that are essential for a module in well-studied model organisms can be absent in evolutionarily distant organisms (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bergmiller et al., 2012</a>), even though the modules must perform the same tasks. This observation suggests that complex modules reorganize during evolution, either to accommodate changing requirements or to respond to the chance loss of components during population bottlenecks, when selection against deleterious mutations is greatly diminished."

In closely related, inter-fertile species, genetic analysis can reveal the mutations that account for functional differences, but not their temporal order, and even this level of detail cannot be achieved in more distantly related species. Experimental microbial evolution circumvents these problems: sequencing and genetic analysis identifies the mutations responsible for the selected phenotype and storing and analyzing intermediate steps reveals the order in which mutations occurred (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lenski and Travisano, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lang et al., 2013</a>). In principle, these tools should lead to mechanistic understanding of evolutionary trajectories, but selections for faster growth or novel functions typically produce adaptive mutations in multiple functional modules (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2013</a>), whose relationship to each other is hard to explain. Are there multiple solutions to the selection, resulting in independent additive solutions in different cellular modules (<a href=\"#bib29\">Khan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koschwanez et al., 2013</a>), or are those mutations (and the modules they lay in) coupled in an unknown way (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wildenberg and Murray, 2014</a>)?"

                        "text": "We focused selective pressure by allowing populations to evolve after deleting an important gene in a well-described module. This approach differs from traditional suppressor screens, which isolate single compensatory mutations, by selecting for combinations of mutations, which together significantly increase fitness. The module we perturbed was polarization in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib54\">Smith et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Slaughter et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Howell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Klunder et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wu and Lew, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kuo et al., 2014</a>). Polarization involves selection of an axis of polarity, followed by the asymmetric organization of cytoskeletal elements and membranous organelles and cell wall growth along this axis. Yeast cells polarize and bud by localizing and activating the small GTPase, Cdc42, at a single site (<a href=\"#bib52\">Slaughter et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wu and Lew, 2013</a>). In haploid cells, polarization is directed by a historical mark deposited in the previous cell cycle, but even when the mark is absent, yeast cells still polarize efficiently, albeit at a random location (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chant and Herskowitz, 1991</a>). Under these conditions, symmetry breaking depends on at least two pathways: (1) an actin-based mechanism based on the positive feedback between actin-mediated delivery of Cdc42 to the plasma membrane and actin polymerization stimulated by membrane-bound Cdc42 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Marco et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Slaughter et al., 2013</a>), and (2) an actin independent, Turing type mechanism that depends on interactions amongst proteins that regulate the activity and localization of Cdc42 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Howell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Freisinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Smith et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We strongly perturbed yeast polarization by removing Bem1, a regulator of Cdc42, which recruits the guanine exchange factor (GEF) Cdc24 as well as Cdc42 to the membrane where Cdc24 activates membrane-bound Cdc42. We decided to delete Bem1 because previous research suggests that this protein is a relatively young component in polarity establishment that had a different role in ancestral fungi (<a href=\"#bib48\">Semighini and Harris, 2008</a>). Deleting this component of polarity could thus reveal other alternative, more evolutionarily ancient polarization modules."

                                "text": "We started by constructing <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells, in the W303 strain background, by sporulating a heterozygous <i>BEM1/bem1\u2206</i> diploid. <i>bem1\u2206</i> spores formed colonies at a frequency of 6 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, for details see Supplementary materials), while wild-type (<i>BEM1</i>) spores formed colonies at a frequency of 0.95. We imaged <i>bem1\u2206</i> and wild-type spores as they germinated and followed several subsequent cell divisions (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), where we measured the time of budding as a proxy for polarization: cells cannot bud without a successful polarization event. The majority of <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells (28/35 vs 0/41 for wild-type cells) did not polarize within 500 min but grew isotropically resulting in very large cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) that often lysed (16/35) (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells that did polarize, (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <i>P</i><sub><i>polarize</i></sub><i>_</i><sub><i>bem1\u2206</i></sub> = 0.23, <i>N</i> = 35), polarize fast, in contrast to wild-type cells, which show a wider distribution of polarization times, but always eventually polarize successfully (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <i>P</i><sub><i>polarize_wt</i></sub> = 1, <i>N</i> = 41). We used a single <i>bem1\u2206</i> colony, as well as a control, wild-type colony, as the starting point for our evolution experiments. From both colonies, we started with 10 wild-type and 10 <i>bem1\u2206</i> cultures, which we evolved for one thousand generations by serial dilutions, regularly freezing down a sample (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and see Materials and methods), resulting (due to contamination) in nine surviving <i>bem1\u2206</i> lineages and seven wild-type lineages. We characterized their phenotypic trajectories by measuring the population growth rate at different time points. The initial growth rate of the <i>bem1\u2206</i> lineages was approximately 12 times lower than the wild-type growth rate. By the end of the experiment, however, the <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells grew at almost the rate of their wild-type ancestors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Two <i>bem1\u2206</i> lines, A1 and A2, are plotted individually because they are discussed in more detail later in the article, and one line, A8, became diploid and was excluded from further analysis. We examined how the cell size distribution, which is an approximation for polarization dynamics (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), changed during the experiment: cells that take longer to polarize are on average larger than cells that polarize fast because yeast cells continue to grow during polarity establishment (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goranov et al., 2009</a>). We measured cell size distributions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, see Materials and methods) and fitted them to a log normal distribution to determine the mode, as a measure of the dominant cell size, and standard deviation, which we take as an approximation for noisiness in polarization dynamics. At the beginning of the experiment, <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells were larger and showed a wider distribution than the wild-type ancestor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E,F</a>) as confirmed by microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). At the end of the experiment, however, both the mode and the standard deviation in <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells adapted to wild-type cell size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and growth rate values, suggesting a properly functioning polarization machinery."

                                "text": "Which mutations caused the changes in growth rate and cell size? We sequenced the whole genomes of several evolved lines: from the seven wild-type lines that were left at the end of the evolution experiment, we sequenced five lines. We sequenced a total of 10 <i>bem1\u2206</i> lines: the eight bem1\u2206 A-lines that arose from the same starting colony and remained haploid, as described above. In addition, we sequenced two <i>bem1\u2206</i> lines that were evolved from two independent different starting colonies in a trial experiment (T2 and T3) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Laan et al., 2015</a>). In the control, wild-type lines we found a diverse set of mutations (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), with only one gene, <i>ECM21</i>, being mutated twice<i>. ECM21</i> was also the only mutated gene, in our control lines, that was also found in either of two other large scale evolution experiments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that adaptation in our control experiments involves similar mutations to those in other studies that have led to modest increases in the proliferation rate of wild-type cells. This is in contrast to the mutations we found in the 10 <i>bem1\u2206</i> lines. We found three genes that were mutated at least three times: <i>BEM3</i> (10/10), <i>NRP1</i> (5/10), and <i>BEM2</i> (3/10). Mutations in these genes were not reported in a variety of other yeast evolution experiments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gresham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koschwanez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that they are specific for the deletion of <i>BEM1</i>. All other mutations can be found in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. Only one of these mutations, the mutation in <i>IRA1</i>, in line T3, is also commonly found in other yeast evolution experiments suggesting that it is not specific for the deletion of <i>BEM1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The A-lines shared the same early stop mutation in <i>BEM3</i>, but lines T2 and T3 independently acquired different early stop mutations in <i>BEM3</i>. The <i>BEM3</i> mutation in the A-lines (Q61*) was acquired after germination of the spore that acted as their ancestor: cells from the original colony (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) showed the same severe growth defects as freshly germinated <i>bem1\u2206</i> spores, whereas engineered <i>bem1\u2206 bem3\u2206</i> cells had a much less severe defect. All five mutations in <i>NRP1</i> (all in A-lines) were independently acquired early stop mutations, whereas in <i>BEM2</i> we found a promoter mutation (line T2) and two amino acid substitutions (line A1 and A2), which are radical substitutions at conserved positions."

We generated the different genotypes by sporulating a <i>BEM1/bem1\u2206 BEM2/bem2\u2206 BEM3/bem3\u2206 NRP1/nrp1\u2206</i> diploid (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)<i>.</i> For each genotype, we measured the average colony size generated by germinating spores, the percentage of spores that produced visible colonies, and the growth rate in liquid media (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows that <i>bem1\u2206</i> spores are least likely to form colonies, while <i>bem1\u2206 bem2\u2206 bem3\u2206 nrp1\u2206</i> spores closely resemble wild-type spores, confirming that inactivating <i>BEM2</i>, <i>BEM3</i>, and <i>NRP1</i> substantially suppresses the severe polarization defect of <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells. We compared the growth rate of quadruply mutant <i>bem1\u2206 bem2\u2206 bem3\u2206 nrp1\u2206</i> cells with the final populations of line A1 and A2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The growth rate of line A2 is indistinguishable from the reconstructed strain, which carries gene deletions in the genes that were mutated in our experiments, suggesting that we found the mutations that confer fitness to this lineage, but line A1 grows slightly faster than the quadruple mutant, suggesting that it may contain additional adaptive mutations."

First, it reveals epistasis, in particular, sign epistasis (a mutation switching from being beneficial to deleterious) for some combinations of mutations. If mutations are added in the order they occurred in during the evolution, each successive mutation increases the fitness of the resulting strain, but adding mutations in different orders can reduce fitness. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>): adding the <i>bem2\u2206</i> mutation increases the growth rate of <i>bem1\u2206 bem3\u2206 nrp1\u2206</i> cells, but the same mutation reduces or has no effect on the fitness of all other tested genotypes. Another example of epistasis is the changing dependence of the cells on <i>BEM1</i>: the polarization module evolves from requiring Bem1, in wild-type strains, to being slightly impaired by the presence of functional Bem1 in a <i>bem2\u2206 bem3\u2206 nrp1\u2206</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

Because there are large cytoplasmic pools of Cdc42, which make it hard to monitor the location of membrane-associated, active Cdc42, we examined polarization by imaging Spa2-Citrine, which localizes to the polarity site and the cytokinetic ring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Snyder, 1989</a>). We measured two parameters: <i>t</i><sub><i>fs \u2212 c</i></sub>, the average time between cytokinesis <i>t</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> and the appearance of the first polarity site <i>t</i><sub><i>fs</i></sub><i>,</i> and how long cells spent with zero, one, two or three polarity sites in the interval between the appearance of the first focus of Spa2-Citrine and budding. As expected, <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells have a long delay before the first signs of polarization, and polarization is often abortive (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting weaker activation of Cdc42. In addition, <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells often contain more than one polarity site, suggesting that the positive feedback that ensures a single site of polarization is weaker."

A high-throughput RNA binding study suggested seven target RNAs for <i>NRP1</i>, but none of them forms an obvious link to polarity, and most have an unknown function (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hogan et al., 2008</a>). The most obvious change after <i>NRP1</i> deletion is a decrease in time between cytokinesis and the appearance of the first polarity site (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Therefore, we speculate that <i>NRP1</i> plays a role in initiating polarization, which is triggered when Cdc28 is activated by G1 cyclins. Cdc28 activation releases Cdc24 from the nucleus, activating Cdc42. If the absence of Nrp1 leads, directly or indirectly, to the release of more Cdc24, this would lead to faster activation of Cdc42 and earlier polarization<i>.</i> Finally, the loss of Bem2 reduces the time that the cells are not polarized, suggesting that this mutation also increases Cdc42 activity (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>)."

Experimental evolution has produced a range of answers to this question, from replicate populations that share a small fraction of causal mutations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gresham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chou and Marx, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koschwanez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</a>) to those where mutations occur in the same genes in the same order (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blount et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</a>) or repeatedly affect the same amino acids in a protein (<a href=\"#bib43\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>).

Examining the mutations that gave rise to a particular phenotype in the bacterium, <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, revealed a hierarchy of pathways: loss-of-function mutations are most frequent and other pathways, including promoter mutations, gene fusions, and gain-of-function mutations can only be found when the dominant pathway is blocked (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lind et al., 2015</a>)."

As far as we know, this is the first example of reproducible trajectories to adaptation to mutations that severely compromise a cellular function, and it will be interesting to see if evolving strains, adapting to severe perturbations in other pathways will also lead to reproducible trajectories."

Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties. As long as modules contain components, like Bem2 and Bem3, which alter the quantitative behavior of other proteins, like Cdc42 and other small GTPases, removing the regulators is the equivalent of rarer mutations that would change the biochemical parameters of central components of the pathway. Our findings are consistent with previous experimental evolution work which showed that loss-of-function mutations allow bacteria (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zinser et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hottes et al., 2013</a>) and yeast (<a href=\"#bib32\">Koschwanez et al., 2013</a>) to adapt to their environments and produce novel phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wildenberg and Murray, 2014</a>).

Instead, other mutations that increase the half-life of Cdc42-GTP (and possibly other small G proteins) remove the need to hold Cdc24 and Cdc42 close to each other. We suspect that the differing effects of removing genes and altering gene dosage may control the type of mutations that allow cells to adapt to large genetic perturbations. If increasing the dosage of genes can reverse the effects of the perturbation, cells may recover by becoming aneuploid, as observed when duplicating chromosome XVI increases the dosage of two genes (<i>MKK2</i> and <i>RLM1</i>) that help compensate for the absence of type II myosin (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rancati et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, if removing inhibitors will increase fitness, point mutations that inactivate the inhibitors will be selected, as we observed. Investigating how cells recover from other perturbations in these and different pathways will test the validity of this speculation, reveal the mechanistic details underlying evolutionary change, and improve our understanding of how the self-organizing properties of modules affect the course of evolution."

Although less in known about the evolutionary history of polarity proteins, recent studies suggest that the components of this pathway also vary substantially. In filamentous fungi, Cdc42 is not essential because its function is shared with Rac1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kwon et al., 2011</a>). However, the deployment of the Cdc42 module and the Rac1 module for critical morphogenetic functions is surprisingly different between closely related species (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harris, 2011</a>). Our study shows that removing one component of a conserved pathway selects for the inactivation of others.

This approach allowed us to select and monitor barely viable mutants from the moment they were created, and allowed us to observe the occurrence of the first and subsequent suppressor mutations. Diploid strains were sporulated in liquid culture by growing them to saturation in YPD at 30\u00b0C. Afterwards they were diluted into YEP (2% peptone and 1% yeast-extract) with 2% potassium acetate for 12 hr at 30\u00b0C, washed with water, resuspended in 2% potassium acetate and grown at 25\u00b0C for 3\u20135 days. The sporulation efficiency was checked under the microscope. If the sporulation efficiency was high enough (&gt;95%) 1.5 ml of spores were spun down, resuspended in 500 \u00b5l Zymolyase solution (10 \u03bcg/ml Zymolyase in TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5)) and incubated at 36\u00b0C for 60 min, to digest the ascus. Afterwards, the spores were spun down, resuspended in 500 \u00b5l 0.1% SDS +0.1% Triton in TE and incubated at 36\u00b0C for 30 min, to disrupt the membranes of remnant diploid cells. Subsequently, the spores were vigorously vortexed and the spore concentration was measured with a Coulter Counter (Z2 analyser; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Danvers, MA). 10<sup>1</sup>, 10<sup>2</sup>, and 10<sup>3</sup> spores were plated on YPD plates (3\u00d7 per condition), to get an estimate of the total number of viable spores. To select for viable <i>bem1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, and 10<sup>6</sup> spores were also plated on 4xG418/10xCANAVINE/-HIS plates (3\u00d7 per condition), which we will refer to as the selection plates. The selection plate strongly selected for <i>MAT</i><b>a</b>-haploid spores (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pan et al., 2004</a>) that lack <i>BEM1</i>: the absence of histidine selects for haploid <i>MAT</i><b>a</b> strains, because the <i>MFA1</i> promoter is expressed only in <b>a</b> cells, the presence of canavanine is a second selection for haploids, since the <i>CAN1</i> gene dominantly confers sensitivity to canavanine, an arginine analog, and G418 selects for <i>bem1\u2206</i> because the gene deletion is marked with the bacterial kanamycin resistance gene. After 2 days, the colonies on the YPD plates were counted and used to normalize the number of colonies on the selection plate to calculate the survival probability. The error is the standard deviation between five independent experiments and includes the statistical plating error."

The phenotype was determined by replica plating colonies that grew from single spores to all the different plates necessary to detect the different markers (figure supplement 3BC). Single spore colonies were generated by spotting individual spores with a FACS cell sorter (MoFlo Legacy, Dako Cytomation/Beckman Coulter) on YPD plates. 81 spores were spotted per plate on a total of 10 plates. After 2 days, the plates were imaged to measure the colony size. Calibration experiments showed that in this period the colony size is a good approximation for the growth rate of the cells in the colony. Subsequently, the colonies were replica plated to various drop-out and drug plates to determine their genotype. Home written software in Matlab was used to determine the colony size of every colony and to combine it with its genotype. From this data, the average colony size per genotype and the standard deviation between the colony sizes was calculated. In addition, the percentage of surviving colonies was calculated by dividing the number of observed colonies by the number of expected colonies*100%. The error bar is the statistical error (% surviving colonies/\u221aN, N is number of observed colonies). Comparing the wild-type data from assaying the behavior of the spores spotted on plates with results obtained from tetrad dissections of wild-type diploids, confirmed that the spore plotting assay did not introduce bias in the growth rates or fraction of surviving colonies. The percentage of surviving <i>bem1\u2206</i> colonies was higher in this assay than in the original assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), which we attribute to the presence of Spa2-Citrine: all the <i>bem1\u2206</i> colonies that survived contained Spa2-Citrine, even though this allele was heterozygous in the diploid that they were derived from. After replica plating, approximately 10^5 cells/genotype were inoculated into 2 ml YPD and incubated on 30\u00b0C on a roller drum overnight and the next morning the growth rate in log phase was measured by taking several time points with a coulter counter and fitting the data to an exponential function with a home written program in Matlab.

The authors grow the cells for 1000 generations and find that, in several independent lines, the cells evolve to compensate for the loss of BEM1. The striking result is that in several independent lines the same three genes are mutated in the same order during the course of the growth. Through the creation of the double and triple mutants the authors show that the order in which the mutations are acquired is likely due to a complex set of epistatic interactions among the three genes (BEM2, BEM3, and NRD1). The authors conclude that cells can overcome inactivating mutations in critical genes and that gene inactivation may be a mechanism that leads to rapid divergence in the component genes required for particular cellular functions."

It compellingly outlines the adaptation dynamics of a multi-step evolutionary process after the deletion of a major component of the yeast polarization module. The authors used various complementary approaches, ranging from classical genetics to microscopy and whole genome sequencing, to interpret their findings and support their main conclusions. However, my main concern is that the experimental system the authors have devised, the recovery of a lineage from deletion of a crucial component, is highly contrived and does not shed new light on the evolutionary process in natural habitats. Thus I think that one of the main questions the authors wish to address \u2013 how do functional modules reorganize during evolution, is not adequately answered."

The authors rightfully state that this mutation will necessitate reorganization of the functional module or take-over of a new module. Yet does this starting point, appearance of crippling mutation, reflect the starting point of natural evolutionary scenarios as we understand them? The authors only state that such module reorganization may occur to accommodate changing environments or when population bottlenecks result in fixation of deleterious mutations (Introduction, first paragraph). Yet even under a narrow population bottleneck, fixation of such highly deleterious mutations is unlikely. I think considerable more discussion and references are required to convincingly ground this work in the current understanding of evolution dynamics. Alternatively the authors can put more emphasis on their other, albeit less exciting, conclusions (as the observations that cells are robust to destructive genetic perturbations or new finding in cell biology of polarization)."
