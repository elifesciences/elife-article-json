Due to its known association with G9a/GLP, Wiz is generally considered a transcriptional repressor. Here, we provide evidence that it may also function as a transcriptional activator. Wiz levels are high in the brain, but its function and direct targets are unknown. ChIP-seq was performed in adult cerebellum and Wiz peaks were found at promoters and transcription factor CTCF binding sites. RNA-seq in <i>Wiz</i> mutant mice identified genes differentially regulated in adult cerebellum and embryonic brain. In embryonic brain most decreased in expression and included clustered protocadherin genes. These also decreased in adult cerebellum and showed strong Wiz ChIP-seq enrichment. Because a precise pattern of protocadherin gene expression is required for neuronal development, behavioural tests were carried out on mutant mice, revealing an anxiety-like phenotype. This is the first evidence of a role for Wiz in neural function."

Due to its known association with G9a/GLP, Wiz is generally considered a transcriptional repressor. Here, we provide evidence that it may also function as a transcriptional activator. Wiz levels are high in the brain, but its function and direct targets are unknown. ChIP-seq was performed in adult cerebellum and Wiz peaks were found at promoters and transcription factor CTCF binding sites. RNA-seq in <i>Wiz</i> mutant mice identified genes differentially regulated in adult cerebellum and embryonic brain. In embryonic brain most decreased in expression and included clustered protocadherin genes. These also decreased in adult cerebellum and showed strong Wiz ChIP-seq enrichment. Because a precise pattern of protocadherin gene expression is required for neuronal development, behavioural tests were carried out on mutant mice, revealing an anxiety-like phenotype. This is the first evidence of a role for Wiz in neural function."

The screen used a multicopy GFP transgene, under the control of erythroid promoter/enhancer sequences, as a reporter. As this reporter undergoes stochastic silencing among otherwise identical erythroid cells, it is reminiscent of the position effect variegation (PEV) screens used to identify genes with roles in regulating gene expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henikoff, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fodor et al., 2010</a>). Male mice with the reporter were treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and offspring were screened for changes in the percentage of erythrocytes expressing GFP; this was a screen for dominant effects. The mutation underlying the <i>MommeD30</i> strain was found to be a single base pair deletion in the gene <i>Widely interspaced zinc finger motifs, Wiz</i>. The deletion, of an adenine, causes a frame-shift that introduces a premature stop codon. <i>Wiz<sup>MommeD30/MommeD30</sup>\u00a0</i>embryos die around mid-gestation and heterozygosity for the mutant allele results in approximately half the normal levels of the protein, confirming that <i>Wiz<sup>MommeD30</sup></i> is a null allele (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daxinger et al., 2013</a>).

This study supports the latter idea in a number of ways. Firstly, we show that haploinsufficiency for Wiz results in reduced expression at the <i>A<sup>vy</sup></i> allele and previous work from our laboratory has shown that half the normal levels of Wiz is associated with reduced expression of a multicopy GFP transgene (<a href=\"#bib11\">Daxinger et al., 2013</a>). By focussing on neural tissue, we have gone on to show that haploinsufficiency for Wiz results in decreased expression of a number of genes, mainly within gene clusters or adjacent to telomeric repeats in both embryonic brain and adult cerebellum. While any instance of decreased expression could, theoretically, be an indirect effect, our ChIP-seq data suggests otherwise. At most of the sites at which decreased expression is observed, Wiz peaks were detected. Furthermore, analysis of the set of genes with altered expression in adult cerebellum, showed that Wiz was detected at the promoters of those with decreased expression but not at those with increased expression. This suggests that those sites at which reducing the levels of Wiz causes increased expression, i.e. Wiz is acting as a repressor, are indirect effects."

Mice received standard rodent chow and water <i>ad libitum</i>. After one week of acclimatisation mice were put under general anaesthesia and surgically implanted with a biotelemetry device (Mini-mitter, Bend, USA) into their peritoneal cavities. After one week of recovery, the biotelemetry devices were used to monitor body temperature and locomotor activity. A platform receiver sampled the device\u2019s temperature (\u00b1 0.1\u00b0C) and location at one minute intervals continuously and this was decoded by a software package VitalView (Starr Life Sciences Corp, Oakmont, USA). Following a 12 day period of uninterrupted monitoring, mice were exposed to an elevated plus-maze (EPM) test of anxiety-like behaviour (see below). Immediately following the EPM test, the mice were returned to their home cage for approximately 120\u2009min, then anesthetized using a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (Lethabarb, Virbac Pty. Ltd., Milperra, Australia). The telemetry data (activity and body temperature) were collapsed across the 12 days of testing to derive the activity for each hour in the 24\u2009hr cycle. These data were then analysed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time as the within subjects factor and genotype and cohort as between subjects factors. A Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction epsilon (\u03b5) was used to correct for potential violation of the sphericity assumption for the within-subject measure. Where significant main or interaction effects were found, post hoc Fisher\u2019s LSD tests were used to reveal pairwise differences between groups. As there was no main effect for cohort (F(1,17) = 1.313, p=0.268) the data from the two cohorts were combined."

Robust controls are required to demonstrate that the ChIP signals in this manuscript are Wiz dependent: Although Wiz null mice are lethal, 14d embryos have been published (Daxinger et al., 2013) and these embryos have been used for western in this manuscript. Therefore, the WizMD30/MD30 genotype can be and has to be tested by ChIP and qPCR at validating sites (i.e. about 10 positive and negative sites) and compared to wildtype. As a positive control, both genotypes have to be tested for H3 ChIP or similar at these sites. Data may be presented as <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>. Alternatively, in case of technical limitations to \"ChIPping\" homozygous embryos, Wiz ChIPseq with chromatin of a cell line +/- siRNA against Wiz has to be done to document that ChIP signals are indeed dependent on Wiz. Other suggestions to test this include trying another Wiz antibody by Chip-qPCR or performing some reporter assays (e.g. luciferase assays to test promoter activity with and without Wiz overexpression). Regardless, some test for antibody validation should be performed."

Nevertheless, this neglects mutations outside of exons, which potentially may influence the expression of the 48 genes in this chromosomal region (Daxinger et al., 2013) and/or of non-coding RNA. The authors should discuss this potential combined effect of Wiz and of unknown genes."

The transcriptional effects measured in E13.5 are a convolution of direct and indirect effects. Furthermore, only a handful of genes harboring Wiz binding in their promoter are affected, raising unanswered questions about the underlying mechanisms. With the present data it is difficult to conclude about a direct role of Wiz in transcriptional activation, especially in the absence of any biochemical/mechanistic exploration of the phenomenon. This should be commented on."

Robust controls are required to demonstrate that the ChIP signals in this manuscript are Wiz dependent: Although Wiz null mice are lethal, 14d embryos have been published (Daxinger et al., 2013) and these embryos have been used for western in this manuscript. Therefore, the WizMD30/MD30 genotype can be and has to be tested by ChIP and qPCR at validating sites (i.e. about 10 positive and negative sites) and compared to wildtype. As a positive control, both genotypes have to be tested for H3 ChIP or similar at these sites. Data may be presented as <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>. Alternatively, in case of technical limitations to \"ChIPping\" homozygous embryos, Wiz ChIPseq with chromatin of a cell line +/- siRNA against Wiz has to be done to document that ChIP signals are indeed dependent on Wiz. Other suggestions to test this include trying another Wiz antibody by Chip-qPCR or performing some reporter assays (e.g. luciferase assays to test promoter activity with and without Wiz overexpression). Regardless, some test for antibody validation should be performed.</i>"

To address the issue, we have used an unbiased tandem affinity purification + mass spectroscopy approach to purify the Wiz complexes in wildtype embryonic and adult neural tissues. We identified 45 proteins that were present in anti-Wiz antibody pull down samples and absent in anti-IgG antibody controls. Ranking these by the semi-quantitative number of peptides recovered from embryonic brain, where expression of Wiz is high, shows that four members of Wiz-Zfp644-EHMT1-EHMT2 complex are in the top five proteins identified in the dataset."
