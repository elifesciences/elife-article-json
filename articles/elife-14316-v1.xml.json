In reaching tasks with multiple targets, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) appears to represent all possible actions simultaneously. However, in many situations we are not presented with explicit choices. Instead, we must estimate the best action based on noisy information and execute it while still uncertain of our choice. Here we asked how both primary motor cortex (M1) and PMd represented reach direction during a task in which a monkey made reaches based on noisy, uncertain target information. We found that with increased uncertainty, neurons in PMd actually enhanced their representation of unlikely movements throughout both planning and execution. The magnitude of this effect was highly variable across sessions, and was correlated with a measure of the monkeys\u2019 behavioral uncertainty. These effects were not present in M1. Our findings suggest that PMd represents and maintains a full distribution of potentially correct actions."

In reaching tasks with multiple targets, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) appears to represent all possible actions simultaneously. However, in many situations we are not presented with explicit choices. Instead, we must estimate the best action based on noisy information and execute it while still uncertain of our choice. Here we asked how both primary motor cortex (M1) and PMd represented reach direction during a task in which a monkey made reaches based on noisy, uncertain target information. We found that with increased uncertainty, neurons in PMd actually enhanced their representation of unlikely movements throughout both planning and execution. The magnitude of this effect was highly variable across sessions, and was correlated with a measure of the monkeys\u2019 behavioral uncertainty. These effects were not present in M1. Our findings suggest that PMd represents and maintains a full distribution of potentially correct actions."

These studies vary significantly in the methods by which they provide cues to elicit a motor response. The cues may indicate different parameters of the action, such as the direction or extent of the movement (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bastian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Crammond and Kalaska, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gail et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Messier and Kalaska, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Welsh and Elliott, 2005</a>).

However, all share a common characteristic: the action is directed towards one of several mutually exclusive targets. This mutual exclusivity is a constraint specific to the task of target selection and does not exist in target estimation, since no explicit options are presented.

For example, one standard multiple-target selection task used in non-human primate reaching studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib3\">Bastian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2005</a>) briefly presents a monkey with two or more potential reach targets before indicating the correct one.

However, as uncertainty in sensation increases, it becomes more beneficial to combine sensory information with information learned through prior experience. The optimal method for integrating sensory and prior information was formulated centuries ago as Bayes\u2019 theorem (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bayes and Price, 1763</a>).

The magnitude of these uncertainty-related effects in PMd was spatially tuned. Neurons whose strongest response direction (their preferred direction, or PD) was aligned with the planned reach direction remained largely unchanged, while neurons with PDs opposite the reach direction experienced a significant increase in activity with increased uncertainty. Neurons with intermediate PDs displayed somewhat smaller uncertainty-related effects. The uncertainty-related change in this off-direction neural activity varied considerably across sessions, not only because of experimentally altered prior and likelihood uncertainty, but also apparently because of the monkeys\u2019 own subjective uncertainty in their final action decisions. We found that the magnitude of these cross-session activity\u00a0differences correlated with estimates of the monkey\u2019s decision-related uncertainty."

During the first block of trials, the monkeys made center-out reaches with an instructed delay to well-specified (zero uncertainty) targets that were randomly distributed across eight locations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top). In the second block of trials, the target locations were randomly drawn from a circular normal (von Mises) <i>prior</i> distribution centered on a single direction that remained constant for the remainder of the session.

In contrast, M1 activity built more slowly as the trial evolved, ultimately producing a strong spatial representation of the executed reach direction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, top right). However, while the recruitment of M1 neurons during low and high uncertainty conditions was similar (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right), the representation in PMd differed significantly across these conditions. During high uncertainty trials, the representation of the reach direction in the delay period\u00a0was present but significantly less distinct, most notably due to increased activity in neurons with PDs far away from the reach direction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, bottom left). We partitioned the neurons into three groups for each trial: same direction (SD; preferred direction within 45 degrees of the reach direction), opposite direction (OD; preferred direction within 45 degrees of the anti-reach direction), and orthogonal direction (ORTH; preferred direction within 45 degrees orthogonal\u00a0the reach direction).

However, the increase in OD activity varied considerably across sessions. We reasoned that the sessions with the greatest OD activity differences might correspond to the sessions with the greatest differences in the monkeys\u2019 uncertainty. To test this, we calculated the difference in behavioral uncertainty (\u2206behavioral uncertainty) between uncertainty conditions for each session (see\u00a0Materials and methods: <i>behavioral task</i>). By plotting the activity differences as a function of \u2206behavioral uncertainty, we found strong positive correlations for OD activity, but none for SD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> \u2013 monkey M; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> \u2013 monkey T). For monkey M, the slope of the relation increased from SD to ORTH to OD neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), consistent with the single-session example shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. We found very similar effects of uncertainty among OD neurons for monkey T (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These findings suggest that as the monkeys became less certain about their decision of where to reach, the representations of less likely reach directions increased."

Comparing the difference in activity between actual high uncertainty and sham uncertainty trials, we found that OD (and to some extent ORTH) activity was greater only\u00a0for the actual high\u00a0uncertainty condition (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). This suggests that our main finding of uncertainty-related changes in ORTH and OD activity cannot be explained simply as the result of differences in the visual information."

We showed that when visual cues of target location were made less informative, monkeys biased their reach direction toward the average target location that they had learned over the course of previous trials (their <i>prior</i> estimate) in a Bayesian-like manner. Activity in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) changed systematically as a function of the resulting uncertainty in the monkeys\u2019 final estimate of target location, with higher uncertainty leading to higher activity in PMd neurons. This effect was not present in primary motor cortex (M1). The extent to which uncertainty affected the activity of PMd neurons depended on their directional tuning properties. Neurons with preferred directions aligned to the ultimate reach direction showed no correlation with uncertainty, while those with orthogonal or opposite direction tuning displayed significant increases in activity with increased uncertainty. This can be interpreted as an increase in uncertainty causing in increase in the representation of less likely movements directions."

The resulting representations of potential actions in PMd did, in some sense, reflect\u00a0the monkey's\u00a0uncertainty in the choice prior to movement execution. However, in no studies before ours did the activity changes induced by an ambiguous cue persist throughout movement execution. One study that used gradually accumulating evidence to trigger movement choice (<a href=\"#bib39\">Thura and Cisek, 2014</a>) found that prior to movement,\u00a0greater ambiguity in the cue resulted in a stronger representation of the target that was ultimately not selected. They observed no effect on activity corresponding to the selected target, which reached a consistent peak\u00a0about 300\u00a0ms prior to movement initiation. These observations are well in line with our own results. However, at the time of movement initiation they found no ambiguity-related effects\u00a0on\u00a0activity, for either the\u00a0neurons tuned to the selected target\u00a0or the non-selected target.

Inherent to target selection is the knowledge that the correct action will only be one of several mutually exclusive options. This constraint represents additional task-relevant information that can (and should) be integrated into the decision-making processes within sensorimotor areas like PMd. In a target selection task, reaching anywhere that is not an explicit target will lead to failure. It is therefore\u00a0reasonable for the system to enforce a policy that before initiating a reach, the representation must\u00a0only reflect one of the explicit target options.

In our study, the distribution of actions represented in PMd changed according to the monkey's behavioral uncertainty, but\u00a0was\u00a0relatively static within a single trial. At no point did\u00a0the distribution\u00a0resolve into a single unambiguous reach representation. M1, on the other hand, seemed relatively unaffected by uncertainty and consisently reflected the\u00a0direction of the executed reach. These findings imply that PMd is not solely responsible for 'deciding' which movement to execute, but instead contains only a noisy representation of potential reach directions that must be interpreted in some way by downstream areas like M1.

However, we still observed a consistent\u00a0bias towards better decoding performance on low uncertainty trials. M1, on the other hand, showed a steady increase in reach-related information leading up to movement initiation that was slightly skewed towards better accuracy under low uncertainty. At the time of movement initiation, M1 was able to decode reach direction with high accuracy, regardless of uncertainty condition. From these observations, we speculate that the decision about where to reach is not explicitly determined in PMd, but rather in the connections between PMd and M1.

For example, we would expect that in very high uncertainty conditions (e.g., a novel behavioral task), PMd might retain nearly equal representations of all possible movements. As a consequence, small fluctuations due to noise within PMd would cause large variability in a downstream readout, driving exploration of the environment.

Thus PMd contains uncertainty-related information pertaining to the final action, which encompasses more than just the reliability of the visual cue. Additionally, if uncertainty in visual information were the sole driving force of changes in PMd planning- and execution-related activity, we would have observed very little difference in activity across sessions, since the visual cue properties were largely equivalent for all sessions. Instead, we found that activity modulated with the total behavioral uncertainty, which is a combination of visual uncertainty and prior expectation.

It is already well established that PMd can simultaneously represent all potential actions when faced with multiple, mutually exclusive visual targets (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bastian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2005</a>). Our results provide the additional observation that PMd also represents and retains a distribution of potential motor plans that are not explicitly presented, but arise as possibilities during uncertain target estimation. The question of why this representation is maintained for the problem of target estimation but not target selection is an interesting one. One possibility is that it is simply an unavoidable result of noisy inputs to PMd. That is, in the absence of explicit reach targets, the fidelity of the representation in PMd may be limited by the quality of available information. On the other hand, maintaining heightened representations of alternative movements in high uncertainty conditions may\u00a0be useful to the sensorimotor system for more rapid error correction or to drive subsequent motor learning. Experiments designed to test these alternatives could help to further our understanding of the role of PMd in movement planning."

We first divided neurons according to their PDs, creating sixteen bins of 22.5 degrees each. We then averaged the activity of all neurons within each bin (after first subtracting pre-target baseline activity levels) and fit a cosine to the resulting activity profile. The peak of this cosine defined the decoded reach direction. We characterized decoder performance for each uncertainty condition as one minus the circular variance of decoder error. Circular variance is bounded by 0 and 1. Therefore, a performance of 0 represents that the decoder did no better than random guessing, and a performance of 1 represents perfect decoding of the reach direction. This metric is similar to VAF, except it is not normalized by the total variance of the reach distribution. This is important for our dataset, which contained very non-uniform distributions of reach directions.

The main finding is that in PMd, but not M1, increased uncertainty leads to increased activation of neurons representing the non-chosen arm direction. This work builds on and extends the work by Cisek and coworkers in a number of important ways. First, it indicates that PMd does not represent the decision process, but rather represents the distribution of all potentially correct actions. Second, it provides important information about the way uncertainty is represented in the brain."

I would agree with the authors that their findings indicate that PMd might not be the final step in skeletomotor decision-making. However, it would be useful to see a decoding analysis. Taking activity recorded in PMd and M1, how well can the ultimate arm movement direction be decoded at the various times in the trial in the different trial periods. If the hypothesis of the authors is correct, one would expect a strong and consistent encoding of chosen direction in M1 (potentially also earlier than in PMd). On the other hand, PMd should not or only very weakly encode chosen action, in particular in the high-uncertainty condition. Given the data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, I am confident that the M1 prediction will turn out to be true, but I am not sure about PMd. How would the hypothesis of the authors be affected, if PMd would also encode chosen direction? Could PMd and M1 just be links in a set of cascading networks in which the initial selection simply gets sharpened?"

This activity pattern is interesting, because it argues against divisive normalization as has been postulated by a number of authors, including Cisek (Pastor-Benier &amp; Cisek, 2011). Specifically, the increased activity in the non-chosen action representing neurons should have diminished the activity in chosen action representing ones. The authors should discuss this point.</i> "

I would agree with the authors that their findings indicate that PMd might not be the final step in skeletomotor decision-making. However, it would be useful to see a decoding analysis. Taking activity recorded in PMd and M1, how well can the ultimate arm movement direction be decoded at the various times in the trial in the different trial periods. If the hypothesis of the authors is correct, one would expect a strong and consistent encoding of chosen direction in M1 (potentially also earlier than in PMd). On the other hand, PMd should not or only very weakly encode chosen action, in particular in the high-uncertainty condition. Given the data in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, I am confident that the M1 prediction will turn out to be true, but I am not sure about PMd. How would the hypothesis of the authors be affected, if PMd would also encode chosen direction? Could PMd and M1 just be links in a set of cascading networks in which the initial selection simply gets sharpened?</i> "

However, we would not necessarily have predicted that M1 would also show a small delay period difference in performance, or the time course of the decoding accuracy. We have added a figure and additional discussion points."

VAF normalizes performance with respect to the total variance in the signal (in this case reach direction). This variance could differ quite dramatically between uncertainty conditions, making direct comparisons of performance problematic. Instead, we simply computed performance with respect to the maximum possible circular variance (which always has an upper limit of 1). Subtracting this value from 1 created a useful and intuitive scale between 0 (decoder chooses random directions) and 1 (decoder perfectly decodes reach directions). This metric is unaffected by the distribution of reaches and thus allowed us to compare decoder performance directly across uncertainty conditions."
