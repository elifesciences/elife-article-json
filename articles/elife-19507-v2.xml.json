The neural dynamics in the striatum have been described in tasks with short delay periods (1\u20134 s), but remain largely uncharacterized for tasks with longer delay periods. We collected and analyzed single unit recordings from the dorsomedial striatum of rats performing a spatial working memory task with delays up to 10 s. We found that neurons were activated sequentially, with the sequences spanning the entire delay period. Surprisingly, this sequential activity was dissociated from stimulus encoding activity, which was present in the same neurons, but preferentially appeared towards the onset of the delay period. These observations contrast with descriptions of sequential dynamics during similar tasks in other brains areas, and clarify the contribution of the striatum to spatial working memory."

The neural dynamics in the striatum have been described in tasks with short delay periods (1\u20134 s), but remain largely uncharacterized for tasks with longer delay periods. We collected and analyzed single unit recordings from the dorsomedial striatum of rats performing a spatial working memory task with delays up to 10 s. We found that neurons were activated sequentially, with the sequences spanning the entire delay period. Surprisingly, this sequential activity was dissociated from stimulus encoding activity, which was present in the same neurons, but preferentially appeared towards the onset of the delay period. These observations contrast with descriptions of sequential dynamics during similar tasks in other brains areas, and clarify the contribution of the striatum to spatial working memory."

Given the fundamental nature of working memory, much effort has been invested in studying its underlying neural mechanisms, and several cortical regions have emerged as important contributors. For example, neural activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex encodes stimuli during the delay period of working memory tasks, suggesting these areas contribute to maintaining the memory (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arnsten, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Baeg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Erlich et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Funahashi et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Horst and Laubach, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Jung et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Powell and Redish, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Romo et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Spellman et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wang et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Yoon et al., 2008</a>)."

At the beginning of each trial, a sample lever would appear in one of two possible locations on the front wall of the chamber. The rat was required to press the sample lever, at which point the lever would retract into the wall and the delay period began. The end of the delay period was signaled by the illumination of the nose port on the back wall of the chamber (delay period duration of 1\u00a0s, 5\u00a0s, or 10\u00a0s, determined randomly). During the delay period, the nose port remained inactive (i.e. the light in the nose port remained off and nose-poking has no effect), and the rats spent the majority of their time at the nose port (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, bottom-center panel; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), waiting for the variable length delay period to terminate. After the illumination of the nose port, the rat was then required to place its nose into the illuminated port in order for both levers to appear in the front wall of the chamber. If the rat subsequently pressed the choice lever that did not match the initial sample lever ('non-match'), it would receive a liquid reward in a central receptacle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>)."

More specifically, we modeled each neuron\u2019s spiking activity using two generalized linear models (GLMs), one with position related predictors only (i.e. head position, head direction, and velocity \u2013 all calculated using head tracking) and the other with both the position-related predictors as well as time from the delay period onset as a predictor (see Materials and methods for details). Time from delay onset significantly improves the model in 80% of the neurons (84/105) in comparison to a model with only the position/locomotor variables (p&lt;10<sup>\u20134</sup>, likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without time from delay period as predictor).

We calculated the time-varying mutual information between the sample stimulus and the spike trains of individual neurons (within a 0.5\u00a0s sliding window), by assuming that spiking of each neuron is a Poisson point process with a time varying rate determined by the sample stimulus and time from the delay onset (see Materials and methods for details). We found many neurons showed transient information peaks (e.g. example neurons 2 and 3 in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To determine if these peaks were statistically significant, we calculated the distribution of the maximum information across the entire delay period that would be expected by chance for each neuron by repeatedly shuffling the labels specifying whether a trial had a left or a right sample and recalculating the mutual information. A neuron was considered to significantly encode the sample stimulus during the delay period if its peak sample information was larger than the 99th percentile of that distribution (green shaded area in the bottom panels of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By this criteria, 53 of the 105 neurons showed significant encoding of the sample stimulus at some point during the delay period (p&lt;0.01) with peak information values ranging between 0.07 to 0.69 bits (average peak information was 0.34 bits)."

This distinction is difficult to make without analysis of error trials, because in correct trials the sample and choice levers perfectly predict one another. Given that the decoder for error trials is trained on correct trials only, a significantly lower than chance level decoding accuracy for error trials means higher than chance level encoding of the choice lever. The accuracy of decoding error trials was high towards the beginning of the delay period, quickly dropped and stayed at chance level throughout most of the delay period, and fell below chance near the choice lever press time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This means that neural activity around the time of the sample lever press encodes the sample lever identity, as opposed to the rat\u2019s future choice.

To address this, we examined a time point during the delay period during which the movement trajectories converge for left and right sample trials. Following the sample press, rats typically move to the opposite wall and wait in front of the nose port for the delay period to end (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Instead of aligning trials to the beginning of the delay period (i.e. the sample lever press), we aligned trials to the moment the rats first arrived at the nose port, and excluded the small subset of trials in which they left the nose port within 1.5 s of the nose port arrival. We show that head position is very similar across left and right sample trials following nose port arrival (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), yet our population decoder was able to decode the sample stimulus with high accuracy, even during the first 1.5\u00a0s when the rat strictly maintains its head position in front of the nose port (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

For instance, the example neuron in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> responds to right sample presses but not right choice presses. Such a dramatic difference cannot be explained merely as a result of encoding of motor actions, location, or body position since the rat performs the same action at a similar location but we observe very different neural responses. Much like the example neuron in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, across the population of recorded neurons, some neurons preferentially encoded lever identity during the sample press while others encoded the lever identity during the choice press (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

The first method was to quantify the mutual information between the sample stimulus and the firing patterns for each individual neuron (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which revealed strong sample stimulus encoding at the onset of the delay period and less encoding during the delay period. The second method (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) was to measure our ability to decode the sample stimulus from the entire neural population as a function of time during the delay period. The second method revealed perfect decoding accuracy at the onset of the delay period and greater than chance level accuracy during most of the delay period. Both approaches demonstrated that the sample stimulus is encoded strongly at the onset of the delay period and that stimulus encoding declines noticeably with either measure by 2\u00a0s into the delay period. Stronger stimulus encoding toward the onset of the delay period has been reported in studies of primate cortical regions, although those studies did not compare sample stimulus encoding to sequential firing activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Brody et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Bruce et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Clark et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Colby et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gregoriou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Romo et al., 1999</a>)."

Considering that sample information in the DMS decreased substantially within several seconds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), the transient nature of stimulus encoding would have been less obvious if our task had only employed substantially shorter delay periods. Instead, the activity would have been better described as sustained memory-encoding activity. Indeed, previous recordings in primates have reported sustained delay period activity that encodes short-term memory in a subset of caudate neurons with delay periods of 2\u20134\u00a0s (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hikosaka et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kawagoe et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Schultz and Romo, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Schultz et al., 1994</a>).

Thus, we performed several analyses to control for the possibility that our conclusions of sequential firing rate activity or transient stimulus encoding was a result of motor or position confounds. This included analyzing data from times that the rat was in the nose port (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), as well as showing that task-relevant variables remained a significant predictor of neural activity in the vast majority of neurons, even when accounting for movement or position with a generalized linear model (GLM). However, motor and position confounds may have been even more strongly excluded had we instead used a task design that restricts movement of the rat during the delay period. Additionally, in our task design the correct choice of a trial can be determined from the onset of the delay period, making it difficult to distinguish encoding of the memory of the sample stimulus from encoding of future motor actions ('retrospective' versus 'prospective' memory). A more sophisticated task design that enabled dissociation of stimulus encoding and pre-motor activity could have allowed us to make even stronger conclusions about memory encoding."

For example, it has been suggested that the striatum may be involved in initiating the storage of new memories in cortical networks, an idea often referred to as 'gating' (<a href=\"#bib8\">Baier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Frank et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gruber et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">O\u2019Reilly and Frank, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Braver\u00a0and\u00a0Cohen 2000</a>). According to this idea, the striatum plays a role in selecting cortical memory buffers that are to be updated and determines the time memory updating occurs, similar to the role the striatum is thought to play in initiating and selecting motor actions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bailey and Mair, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bhutani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Grillner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kropotov and Etlinger, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Mink, 1996</a>). The gating model ascribes a crucial role to the striatum at the onset of the delay period, when new information must be stored in short-term memory buffers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Baier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Frank et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gruber et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">O\u2019Reilly and Frank, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Braver\u00a0and\u00a0Cohen 2000</a>).

                                "text": "However, another possibility is that DMS is contributing to maintaining the short-term memory. Although the accuracy of our population decoder decreases substantially during the course of the delay period, the decoding accuracy near the end of the delay period is roughly comparable to behavioral performance even at the 10\u00a0s delays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), indicating that activity in the DMS might be sufficient to support the animal\u2019s behavior. As another possibility, the DMS could assist cortical areas in maintaining the memory throughout the delay period, irrespective of holding the content of the memory. Memory encoding activity in cortex often appears as persistent elevated activity or sequential activations of neurons (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baeg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Cromer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Fujisawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Horst and Laubach, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">MacDonald et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Pastalkova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Powell and Redish, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995</a>), which may be implemented using positive feedback through distributed cortico-striato-thalamic loops (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Houk and Wise, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Middleton and Strick, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Wang, 2001</a>). In this view, the sequential activity that spans the delay period in DMS could play a role in exciting cortical memory buffers and enabling memory encoding activity there. As yet another possibility, the stimulus memory may be stored in the striatum in a form that would not be fully detectable in the spiking activity, perhaps in short-term synaptic plasticity, as suggested by recent theoretical models (<a href=\"#bib58\">Lundqvist et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Mongillo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Stokes, 2015</a>).\u00a0Future experiments employing transient perturbations of the striatum at sub-trial temporal precision will help address the question of whether the DMS is more important for initiating versus maintaining memories."

There were two retractable levers on the operant chamber front wall (right side of schematic and heat-maps, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At the beginning of each trial, a sample lever extends out of the wall, (either on the left or the right side \u2013 randomly interleaved). The rat is then required to press that lever, after which the lever retracts back into the wall. The rat has to remember the sample lever side for the duration of the delay period (1\u00a0s, 5\u00a0s, or 10\u00a0s \u2013 randomly interleaved). The end of the delay period is signaled by the illumination of the nose port on the back wall of the chamber (left side of schematic and heat-maps, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The rat must then poke his nose into the illuminated nose port for both levers to extend from the front wall of the chamber, and then choose one of the two levers. Following a correct lever press, i.e. a choice lever press that does not match the initial sample lever, the rat is rewarded with 40\u00a0\u03bcl of milk in the reward receptacle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The rats were given 30\u00a0s to respond to the sample lever, 5\u00a0s to respond to the activated at the end of the delay period, and 5\u00a0s to respond to the choice lever. An incorrect lever press or a failure to respond within the time limit, resulted in a 5\u00a0s time-out penalty, during which the house-light is turned off. Trials were followed by 10\u00a0s long inter-trial interval (ITI). The task was designed to encourage the rats to spend the delay period at the nose port. Tracking of head-position confirmed that rats spent the majority of the delay period in the nose port (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> center panel and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

During this period the cap and dummy cannulae were removed and internal cannulae with appropriate projection length were inserted into the guide cannula. 600\u00a0nl of saline or muscimol solution was infused at a rate of 200\u00a0nl/min. The internal cannula was removed and dummy cannulae were inserted 4 min after each infusion, to allow the solution to diffuse. Rats were given 20\u201325 min of recovery time after the infusion and anesthesia, before being placed in the operant chamber to begin behavioral testing. To identify the muscimol concentration that was used for testing each rat, a range of muscimol infusion concentrations (37.5\u201375\u00a0ng) was tested on different days, and the largest concentration for which each rat performed a sufficient number of trials during a session was identified (at least 50 trials per session). Once the concentration was identified, the rats underwent two days of additional infusion sessions. On the first day they received an infusion of saline, and on the second day they received an infusion of the muscimol concentration selected as described above. Concentration and volume were similar to values used in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib90\">Spencer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Yin et al., 2005</a>)."

We first made the two following simplifying assumptions: (1) the spiking of each neuron is a Poisson process (i.e. spiking at different time bins across neurons are independent of one-another) and, (2) the only factors involved in determining the spike rate is the sample stimulus of the current trial and time relative to the delay onset. Our calculations make use of the firing rates for left and right sample trials only, which are estimated as described above. The estimated\u00a0firing rates are then used to generate 500 random spike trains. the average pointwise mutual information with the sample stimulus for each randomly generated spike train is calculated to obtain the mutual information. Spike trains are generated by assuming a sample stimulus x (randomly chosen to be left or right) and determining the number of spikes in every 50\u00a0ms time bin of the desired time segment from the estimated\u00a0firing rates when <sample> = x.

For each neuron, this process was repeated 200 times and the maximum value of sample information within the delay period was taken each time, to obtain a distribution of the sample information peak value expected by chance. The peak information of the non-shuffled data was compared to that distribution to test for significance (p&lt;0.01, one-tailed test). All neurons with peaks larger\u00a0than the 99th percentile of the shuffled distribution were considered to be significantly encoding the sample stimulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The green shadings on the bottom panels of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> are the thresholds for significance of the peak value across the entire delay period interval, obtained by taking the 99th percentile of distribution for sample information peak expected by chance.\u00a0Information about lever identity for choice and sample presses was calculated in a similar fashion, with the modification that we did not use a sliding window, but rather calculated for the entire 500\u00a0ms window centered at a lever press (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

Our decoder was constructed based on the assumption that spiking of each neuron is a Poisson process with a time-varying spike rate function. To obtain a time-dependent evaluation of the decoder, we use a 500\u00a0ms wide sliding window. For each neuron the desired 500\u00a0ms segment of the spike train is binned into 50\u00a0ms bins. The decoder is given an N\u00d7k matrix S, where S<sub>i,j</sub> is the spike count of neuron i for bin j of that segment (N denotes the number of neurons, and k is the number of bins). The decoder then finds x to maximize <math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>&gt;=</mo><mi>x</mi><mspace width=\"thinmathspace\"></mspace><mo>\u2223</mo><mspace width=\"thinmathspace\"></mspace><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mspace width=\"thinmathspace\"></mspace><mspace width=\"thinmathspace\"></mspace><mi>d</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mo>&gt;=</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>.

The GLMs modeled number of spikes with a Poisson distribution and a log link function). Positional predictors included: 9 binary predictors for head position, 8 binary predictors for head direction, and 3 numerical predictors for velocity (x component, y component, and magnitude of velocity vector). For the head position predictors, the chamber was divided into nine tiles (3 equal segments along each axis) and each binary predictor represented whether the head position was located in the corresponding tile. For the head direction predictors, the range of possible head directions (0\u2013360 degrees) was divided into 8 equal segments and binary predictors for head direction represented which segment the head direction was in. For the task related predictors, the 10 binary predictors denoted time within the delay period and one binary predictor denoted the identity of the sample stimulus. For the time related predictors, time from delay onset was divided into 1\u00a0s long time bins and each of the 10 binary predictors signified whether the current time was in the corresponding 1\u00a0s time bin. Nested Model Comparison of GLMs were performed by first fitting the GLM to the data using R function glm() and then performing a likelihood ratio test using the R function anova\u00a0(model1, model2, test\u00a0=\u00a0'Chisq')."

However, the mechanism by which the DMS is involved in working memory is not understood. The authors characterized firing patterns of DMS neurons in rats performing a delayed non-match to position (DNMP) task. The authors observed transient activation of neurons when the rats initiated a delay period by a nose poke. The authors also show that neurons were activated sequentially throughout the delay period. The main conclusion is that the activity at the onset of the delay period conveyed information about sample lever presses, the content of working memory, whereas the sequential activity did not. The authors suggest a possibility that the DMS is involved in working memory by gating information only at the early phase of working memory."

Two reviewers were concerned about the possibility that the sequential activity as well as the transient activity at the beginning of the delay period are related to the movement or position of the animal and not directly related to working memory itself. The reviewers understood that the authors are not claiming that the sequential activation conveys information about working memory contents, but pointed out two problems. First, the data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows that the information about sample lever presses are present throughout the delay period, so this contradicts with the analysis using mutual information. Second, what is causing the sequential activity remains unclear (i.e. is it really related to working memory, or other motor or place parameters?). The reviewers thought that the sequential activity is very interesting regardless of what it relates to. However, they thought that, to address these issues, more thorough analysis on behavior during the performance of the task is necessary although the task design appears to make it difficult to dissociate confounding factors completely. Another important issue is that it remains to be established whether the firing difference at the onset of the delay period is due to the content of working memory. The reviewers thought that showing that more information is available in neural activity when type of lever press (sample versus choice lever press) is specified is not sufficient to demonstrate this point."

I have one major concern relating to how well the authors can relate the activity they observed to working memory rather than other task variables, such as motor actions. This concern made it difficult for me to be convinced that the dissociation the authors propose, between sequential activity and working memory, is strongly supported. Without improvement in this area, I think the main conclusions cannot be stated with high confidence."

The evidence for working memory activity is that there is mutual (MI) between the sample lever identity and firing rates during the delay period and that the decoder can read-out above chance levels the identity of the sample lever during the delay. However, it seems that another possibility is that the rat performs different actions following a left and right sample lever press and that the activity is related mostly to different motor actions on different trial types, rather than working memory. The encoding of motor actions might be reasonable for explaining why the MI is the highest at the start of the delay because the rat likely moves very differently away from the right and left levers. In addition, the decoder performance for sample lever identity is highest at the times during which the motor actions for the different sample lever trial types is most distinct, namely right after the sample lever press and during the response lever press (which involves different levers on correct trials for different samples). This point is consistent with the decoding of sample lever identity on error trials based on training the decoder on correct trials: the decoder performance is near perfect at the sample lever press and near zero at the response lever press. The one argument against this hypothesis is that presses of the same lever have different neural activity during sample and response periods. However, there are likely many different motor actions occurring in these cases, such as anticipatory licking during the response but not sample period or different body actions and orientations based on entrance into the port. Given the striatum's known role in driving motor actions, it seems that a perfectly valid interpretation of the data could be that the striatal firing is related to motor actions and is not related to working memory at all. With the current presentation of the behavioral data, it is impossible to understand if this alternative hypothesis can be excluded."

This means it is possible that information within DMS is used for maintaining the shortterm memory.

Unlike accuracy, none of these other measures were significantly affected by muscimol across the population of rats (n=7). However, a few of the rats did seem to perform fewer trials with DMS inactivation (with more sample omissions and more trial aborts), which is consistent with DMS being implicated in motivation or response vigor (Wang et al. 2013).

Our first method (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) was to quantify the mutual information between the sample stimulus and the firing patterns for each individual neuron, only including the units with significant sample information peaks. That method revealed strong encoding at the onset of the delay period and very little encoding during the delay period (only a few neurons appear to encode the memory of the sample stimulus above 0.2 bits later in the delay period). Our second method (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) was to measure our ability to decode the sample stimulus from the entire neural population as a function of time during the delay period. The second method revealed perfect decoding accuracy at the onset of the delay period and greater than chance level accuracy during most of the delay period. Based on the Reviewer comment, we now appreciate that these two results may at first appear to contradict each other, since a small amount of sample information in a few neurons contributes to an abovechance level of sample decoding accuracy when using the population data. However, the takehome message from the two plots is the same: the sample stimulus is encoded strongly at the onset of the delay period and that sample encoding declines noticeably with either measure by 23s into the delay period.

In the Discussion section of our new submission (subsection \u201cInsights into the striatal dynamics underlying working memory\u201d, second paragraph) we now elaborate on how our study relates to previous studies in primates. Previous recordings in primates show sustained delay period activity that encodes future choice in a substantial fraction of caudate neurons (Schultz et al. 1994, Hikosaka et al. 1989, Schultz &amp; Romo 1988; Kawagoe et al., 1998). However the delay periods in these studies were typically 24s, which is much shorter than the 10s delays used in our task, and there was a low proportion of neurons that showed sustained activity over that delay period (less than 10% of task modulated caudate neurons had sustained activity in one study that quantified this with delay periods up to 4s, i.e. Hikosaka et a. 1989, and less than a third of recorded neurons were found to have sustained memory related activity in another study that used delay periods 11.5s long, i.e. Kawagoe et al. 1988). In our study we do observe some neurons with sample encoding during the delay period that persisted for 24s (such as the one illustrated in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>), in agreement with prior work. Given that the prior studies did not employ longer delay periods, we do not think our new data contradicts the prior studies."

The evidence for working memory activity is that there is mutual (MI) between the sample lever identity and firing rates during the delay period and that the decoder can read-out above chance levels the identity of the sample lever during the delay. However, it seems that another possibility is that the rat performs different actions following a left and right sample lever press and that the activity is related mostly to different motor actions on different trial types, rather than working memory. The encoding of motor actions might be reasonable for explaining why the MI is the highest at the start of the delay because the rat likely moves very differently away from the right and left levers. In addition, the decoder performance for sample lever identity is highest at the times during which the motor actions for the different sample lever trial types is most distinct, namely right after the sample lever press and during the response lever press (which involves different levers on correct trials for different samples). This point is consistent with the decoding of sample lever identity on error trials based on training the decoder on correct trials: the decoder performance is near perfect at the sample lever press and near zero at the response lever press. The one argument against this hypothesis is that presses of the same lever have different neural activity during sample and response periods. However, there are likely many different motor actions occurring in these cases, such as anticipatory licking during the response but not sample period or different body actions and orientations based on entrance into the port. Given the striatum's known role in driving motor actions, it seems that a perfectly valid interpretation of the data could be that the striatal firing is related to motor actions and is not related to working memory at all. With the current presentation of the behavioral data, it is impossible to understand if this alternative hypothesis can be excluded.</i> "

In fact, given that there is a one-to-one mapping between the identity of the sample lever and the correct choice lever to be pressed at the offset of the delay period, our task design does not allow us to easily distinguish between retrospective and prospective memory (i.e. sample encoding versus premotor activity). We now bring up this important caveat up in the Discussion-  thank you for bringing it up. It is worth noting that in the second analysis described below for which we examine the time during the delay period during which the head position trajectories converge, the head position is similar for left and right trials for several seconds following the time window being analyzed, as will be evident in the occupancy maps."

This is a meaningful comparison because the rats are doing similar actions (i.e. pressing the left or right lever), but in a different context within the trial (i.e. sample vs choice press). We have now replotted the sample versus choice analysis in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> (previously <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) using a shorter time window (only \u00b1 0.25s around the lever press, rather than \u00b1 1s as before). The new time window was chosen to minimize movement before and after the lever press (see similarity in head position for sample and choice lever presses during this time window in 7A). This ensures that we do not include any additional motor actions such as anticipatory licking at the reward port, or movement towards or away from the lever for this analysis. In <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, we report the similarity in head position of the choice lever presses and sample lever presses. Next, in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, we show an example neuron that responds to right sample presses but not to right choice presses. This observation cannot be explained merely as a result of encoding of motor actions, location, or body position since the rat performs the same action at a similar location but we observed very different neural responses. Much like the example neuron (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), across the population of recorded neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), some neurons preferentially encoded lever identity during the sample press, while others during the choice press. In fact, there was significantly more dispersion in the difference between sample and choice information than expected by chance (inset in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C, p</a> &lt; 105; two sample Ftest for equality of variance for (sample information  choice information) in real vs. shuffled data).

For this analysis, instead of aligning trials to the beginning of the delay period (i.e. the sample lever press, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we align trials to the moment the rats first arrive at the nose port, excluding the small subset of trials in which they left the nose port within 1.5 seconds of the nose port arrival. Note that the head position is very similar for left and right sample trials at the nose port arrival time and in the following seconds (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We then assess the ability of our population decoder to decode the sample stimulus from the neural data using leaveoneout cross validation with a 0.5s wide sliding window (same approach used in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We noted high decoding accuracy, even during the first 1.5s during which the rat always maintains its head position in front of the nose port (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

However, one of our conclusions is that neural activity cannot be fully explained without taskrelated variables, such as the memory of sample stimulus or time from delay onset. To determine if this conclusion is justified, we sought to determine quantitatively if taskrelated variables had predictive power, even when accounting for motor variables. Towards this end, we modeled neural activity based on both task related variables and motor related variables. More specifically, we modeled each neuron's spiking activity using two generalized linear models (GLMs): one with only position related predictors and the other with both taskrelated and positionrelated predictors. The position/motion predictors we used were head position, head direction, and head velocity and the taskrelated variables were time from delay period onset, sample stimulus of current trial, and the interaction between time and sample stimulus. We performed a nested model likelihood ratio test for each neuron to compare the two models, to determine if the addition of the taskrelated variables improved the model (note that a likelihood ratio test controls appropriately for the difference in number of parameters between the models and that these models were based on delayperiod data only). For more than 90% of neurons, the model significantly improved when including the taskrelated variables (p &lt; 0.0001, likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without task related variables as predictor).
