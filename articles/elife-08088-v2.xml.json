To investigate how Csk activity regulates T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, we utilized a mouse expressing mutated Csk (Csk<sup>AS</sup>) whose catalytic activity is specifically and rapidly inhibited by a small molecule. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> during TCR stimulation led to stronger and more prolonged TCR signaling and to increased proliferation. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> enhanced activation by weak but strictly cognate agonists. Titration of Csk inhibition revealed that a very small increase in SFK activity was sufficient to potentiate T cell responses to weak agonists. Csk plays an important role, not only in basal signaling, but also in setting the TCR signaling threshold and affinity recognition."

To investigate how Csk activity regulates T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, we utilized a mouse expressing mutated Csk (Csk<sup>AS</sup>) whose catalytic activity is specifically and rapidly inhibited by a small molecule. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> during TCR stimulation led to stronger and more prolonged TCR signaling and to increased proliferation. Inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> enhanced activation by weak but strictly cognate agonists. Titration of Csk inhibition revealed that a very small increase in SFK activity was sufficient to potentiate T cell responses to weak agonists. Csk plays an important role, not only in basal signaling, but also in setting the TCR signaling threshold and affinity recognition."

They can also find and eliminate cancer cells. The microbes and cancer cells produce molecules called antigens that are detected by proteins on the surface of the T cell called T cell receptors (TCR). Antigen recognition causes the TCRs to transmit signals to the inside of the T cell that trigger an immune response. The degree to which the TCRs are active, and the length of time that they transmit signals regulates the size of the immune response. Therefore, developing new drugs that manipulate the activity of TCRs could be useful to treat many diseases."

When these cells detected an antigen in the presence of the drug, its TCRs were more highly activated and transmitted signals for a longer period of time than cells not exposed to the drug. The drug especially enhanced immune responses to very weak antigens, ones that might not activate T cells under normal circumstances."

The TCR activation threshold, agonist affinity discrimination and signal termination must therefore be tightly regulated. This is achieved through the concerted action of multiple positive and negative regulators acting basally and during inducible signaling. The SFK Lck regulates TCR signaling by phosphorylating tyrosines in the cytoplasmic segments of the TCR \u03b6 and CD3 chains, basally and during antigen recognition, as well as by phosphorylating downstream kinases such as ZAP-70 and ITK (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Heyeck et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Smith-Garvin et al., 2009</a>). The availability and recruitment of active Lck has been proposed to be the rate-limiting step in discriminating agonist affinity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Stepanek et al., 2014</a>). Weak agonists with shorter half-lives of pMHC (peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex)-TCR interaction have less time to recruit active CD4 or CD8 co-receptor bound Lck. Active Lck (phosphorylated on Y394) is critical for downstream signaling and can be detected in the basal state, but its level does not change appreciably after TCR stimulation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nika et al., 2010</a>)."

Trans-autophosphorylation of its kinase domain activation loop tyrosine, Y394, increases its catalytic activity, whereas phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail inhibitory tyrosine, Y505, promotes its closed, inactive conformation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Palacios and Weiss, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014</a>).

Transmembrane PAG and Lime, as well as the cytosolic PH-domain containing Dok1/2, may play roles in recruiting Csk to the cell membrane in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The association of Csk with PAG in biochemically defined lipid rafts has been observed to diminish in response to TCR stimulation, leading to its proposed involvement in regulating TCR signaling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Torgersen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Davidson et al., 2003</a>).

In this study, we utilized CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from Csk<sup>AS</sup> mice to investigate how Csk modulates the threshold for TCR signal activation, affinity recognition and TCR signal termination.

As previously shown, inhibition of Csk<sup>AS</sup> alone induced strong activation of Lck, as well as Fyn, which was indicated by the hyperphosphorylation of their activation loop tyrosines and the reduced phosphorylation of their inhibitory tyrosines (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, ligation of the TCR alone did not detectably alter Lck phosphorylation, consistent with an earlier report (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nika et al., 2010</a>). The striking Lck activation after Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition was associated with only relatively weak downstream phosphorylation of ZAP-70, LAT and PLC-\u03b31 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, this downstream signaling was very strongly enhanced when the Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibitor treatment was combined with anti-CD3\u03b5 crosslinking, as evidenced by the marked increase in ZAP-70, LAT and PLC-\u03b31 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To determine whether this early enhanced proximal signaling was transmitted further downstream, we examined ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK). The magnitude of p-ERK was increased by Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition in a 3-IB-PP1 dose-dependent manner, with the greatest enhancement seen when using a low dose of anti-CD3\u03b5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At a high dose of anti-CD3\u03b5 the increased p-ERK signal intensity, as indicated by the slight peak shift for 3-IB-PP1 treated cells, might reflect a more rapid or more complete peak response at the time point assayed. Notably, Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition alone induced only a small amount of protein phosphorylation downstream of ZAP-70 (i.e., LAT and ERK1/2), likely due to spurious activation of a few cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Instead, Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition synergized with TCR stimulation leading to downstream signaling. Our data strongly suggest that Csk activity plays a crucial role in establishing the TCR activation threshold. Specifically, a reduction in Csk activity lowered the threshold for signal activation and increased TCR sensitivity."

Each stimulus was titrated to doses that yield minimal to maximum responses since antibody and tetramer have different molecular weights and physiological potency. At low doses, both anti-CD3\u03b5 and OVA pMHC tetramer induced greater cellular proliferation when Csk<sup>AS</sup> was inhibited, consistent with the increased magnitude of proximal TCR signaling.

Here we used Csk<sup>AS</sup>-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or transgenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with the OTI TCR specific for an OVA peptide/MHC class I complex. Titration of 3-IB-PP1 in Csk<sup>AS</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells revealed a maximum threefold to fourfold enhancement of Lck pY394, which correlated with increased Lck activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014</a>). Thus at resting state 25\u201333% of Lck was phosphorylated at Y394, which agrees with some previous estimates (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nika et al., 2010</a>) and is higher than others (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ballek et al., 2015</a>). It should be noted that this is only an inference from the plateau with high drug doses. This study is not designed to estimate the percentage of active Lck at the basal state, since some Lck may not be available for activation by Csk inhibition. Low doses of 3-IB-PP1 (1 \u03bcM or less) induced at most a 50% upregulation of pY394, while doses of 5\u201310 \u03bcM induced a threefold to fourfold upregulation. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of the inhibitory tail Y505, the direct target of Csk, did not decrease as appreciably. This observation suggests that Lck is actively phosphorylated by Csk, but a substantial proportion of pY505 is either inaccessible for dephosphorylation by CD45 or is dephosphorylated over a longer timescale. This, however, does not explain how the small reduction in pY505, particularly so in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, results in a large increase of pY394."

To address this question, we utilized a panel of well-characterized altered OVA peptides (<a href=\"#bib7\">Daniels et al., 2006</a>). When Csk<sup>AS</sup>;OTI CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were stimulated by APCs preloaded with peptides of different agonist potency during strong Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition (5 \u03bcM), we observed marked augmentation of CD69 expression in responses to weak (T4, Q4H7, G4) agonists, contrasting with only slight enhancement of the responses to strong (OVA, Q4R7) agonists (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Although the OVA response was not fully saturated at this early time point (4 hr), it was only slightly enhanced by strong Csk inhibition. Upon stimulation with OVA, but not altered peptides, the TCR is quickly downregulated due to its phosphorylation and retention in intracellular vesicles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cai et al., 1997</a>). Csk inhibition alone induced some ligand-independent TCR downregulation, but additional downregulation was observed with all peptides, even the weakest G4, which argues for altered signaling of low-affinity peptides at a very upstream step (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, the null agonist VSV-loaded APCs did not induce similar activation or TCR downregulation, demonstrating that Csk inhibition works strictly in synergy with a cognate TCR ligand.

To test the extent of Csk inhibition necessary to boost weak agonist signaling, we titrated 3-IB-PP1 and assayed responses to weak agonists Q4H7 and G4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Surprisingly we observed dose-dependent enhancement of signaling at 100\u20131000 nM 3-IB-PP1, where increased Lck pY394 was weakly detectable and at most 50% above the basal level. Beyond this inhibitor dose, we observed a saturating effect, despite the lower overall plateau with lower peptide dose. Thus, relatively weak Lck hyperactivation was sufficient to enhance the recognition of weak agonists. The lower plateau suggests that there are Csk-independent mechanisms for sensing agonist dose. Remarkably, the EC50 concentration of Csk inhibition for CD69 upregulation was still dependent on agonist quality and dose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). At a lower agonist dose, the weaker peptide G4 required double the amount of 3-IB-PP1 than Q4H7. Similarly, the EC50 depended on peptide dose.

Strong agonists have a long half-life of pMHC-TCR and have sufficient time to recruit active Lck and initiate downstream events, while weak agonists with short half-lives are most sensitive to the availability of active Lck before the pMHC-TCR complex falls apart. The different amounts of Lck loaded on the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors can explain the different half-life range of positively and negatively selecting ligands for CD4 and CD8 cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Stepanek et al., 2014</a>); however, this is a genetically established parameter. Our data supports the model that recruitment of active Lck is critical for affinity discrimination, but offers an alternative mechanism for its regulation. By controlling the fraction of active Lck, Csk can also modulate the activation threshold and affinity discrimination of T cells. Notably, since Csk localization and activity is dynamically controlled by phosphorylation-dependent recruitment to transmembrane and cytoplasmic adaptors, this could enable flexibility in affinity recognition in different settings. For example, Csk has been found to be differentially localized in naive and antigen-experienced T cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Borger et al., 2013</a>). Our results add to the emerging understanding of how signaling by agonists of dissimilar affinity are differentially regulated. Recently, the adaptor molecule Themis was characterized as critical for the suppression of weak agonists in thymocytes, while PTPN22 serves a similar role in in effector cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Salmond et al., 2014</a>).

Surprisingly, even very small changes in Lck activity, caused by Csk<sup>AS</sup> inhibition at 200 nM 3-IB-PP1, led to relatively large pY394 changes in the setting of small changes in pY505. Since Y394 phosphorylation is the result of trans-autophosphorylation, it seems likely that a small reduction in pY505 induced by low levels of Csk inhibition, could lead to autoactivation of a large pool of Lck. Such a larger pool of active Lck could then show strong synergy with the TCR stimulus and is sufficient to markedly enhance the response to very weak agonists. The synergy we observed between TCR stimulus and Csk inhibition, strikingly, had its greatest impact on the activation of downstream signaling molecules. This is most likely due to positive feedback/signal amplification along the pathway. Eventually, the integration of stronger signaling over hours led to profound differences in the fraction of cells upregulating CD69 or proliferating. On the other hand, this minimal change in Lck activity highlights how tightly it must be regulated in both the basal and inducible states by kinases and phosphatases and their respective adaptors. It is possible that, although small changes in Lck activity greatly sensitize the TCR to weak agonists, such small changes do not as effectively engage negative feedback mechanisms."

This model is contradicted by the lack of appreciable change in Lck phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation and by unaltered signaling in cells deficient in the lipid-raft-resident Csk adapter PAG (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dobenecker et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Xu et al., 2005</a>). Our data demonstrate that acute activation of Lck, via weak or strong Csk inhibition, does not lead to full TCR signaling. Strong Csk inhibition in mature T cells leads to small amounts of phosphorylation of downstream targets like ZAP-70 and PLC-\u03b31, but not ERK activation or long-term proliferation in the absence of TCR engagement. Thus, Lck activation alone is insufficient to trigger complete TCR signaling. However, when combined with cognate TCR ligands, very small amounts of Csk inhibition and resultant larger amounts of Lck activation, synergize to enhance early biochemical events and downstream activation. Therefore, it is possible that during physiological TCR stimulation, localization of only a small number of Csk molecules is altered and leads to the activation of a small fraction of Lck molecules that would be difficult to detect with current biochemical or imaging methods (<a href=\"#bib22\">Paster et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Nika et al., 2010</a>) but might be sufficient to influence downstream signaling."

In thymocytes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Tan et. al. 2014</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ni.2772\">doi:10.1038/ni.2772</a>) only partial loss is observed at high drug doses, even after prolonged treatment, while in bone marrow derived macrophages, the inhibitory tyrosines of the SFKs are rapidly and almost completely de-phosphorylated (Freedman, et al., manuscript in revision for <i>eLife</i> #02-06-2015). Moreover, similar more complete dephosphorylation of the inhibitory site is observed in B cells (unpublished). Likewise, in Jurkat T cells expressing a membrane targeted CskAS construct that functions a dominant inhibitory allele, inhibition of Csk led to near complete dephosphorylation of the Lck inhibitory site (Schoenborn, et al., Sci. Signal., 2011). We conclude that the SFKs are differentially regulated in different cell types, perhaps via differential sequestration from CD45, the contribution of other phosphatases such as CD148, or pools that are prone to autophosphorylation of the activating site pY394. To address the difference between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we immunoblotted lysates from equivalently stimulated cells side by side (new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). The main observation is that both respond similarly to Csk inhibition, with a smaller change in pY505 than in pY394. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have \u223c 15% more Lck and higher pY505 level at basal state, which may account for the higher residual pY505 level in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, especially at low levels of Csk inhibition. Moreover, it is possible that small reductions in pY505 allow for initial increases in pY394 but the small increase in pY394 could lead to trans-phosphorylation of other Lck molecules at pY394, i.e., an auto-catalytic function."

Most of the biochemical work with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was also performed at lower drug doses than used for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; so, one cannot directly compare the data presented in the paper from the two different cell types. We believe the new supplemental figure clarifies the reviewer's concern."

By acute Csk inhibition, we were able to activate significantly more Lck molecules and based on the plateau level, we inferred an estimate of the basally active fraction. Although it is consistent with Nika et al.'s results, it is possible that there remains a pool of Lck that cannot be activated acutely by Csk inhibition, due to sequestration away from Csk, proximity to CD45 or another mechanism. Therefore our approach is not suited to quantitatively answer this question. This distinction has been noted in the revised text."
