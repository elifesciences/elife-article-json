Yet, mutations in apoptosis regulators cause only minor defects in vertebrate development, suggesting that another developmental cell death mechanism exists. While some non-apoptotic programs have been molecularly characterized, none appear to control developmental cell-culling. Linker-cell-type death (LCD) is a morphologically conserved non-apoptotic cell death process operating in <i>C. elegans</i> and vertebrate development, and is therefore a compelling candidate process complementing apoptosis. However, details of LCD execution are not known. Here we delineate a molecular-genetic pathway governing LCD in <i>C. elegans</i>. Redundant activities of antagonistic Wnt signals, a temporal-control pathway, and MAPKK signaling control HSF-1, a conserved stress-activated transcription factor. Rather than protecting cells, HSF-1 promotes their demise by activating components of the ubiquitin proteasome system, including the E2-ligase LET-70/UBE2D2 functioning with E3 components CUL-3, RBX-1, BTBD2, and SIAH-1. Our studies uncover design similarities between LCD and developmental apoptosis, and provide testable predictions for analyzing LCD in vertebrates."
