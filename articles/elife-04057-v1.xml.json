As transmitter release is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent biochemical process, one would expect that both the extent and kinetics of release will depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. In contrast to this expectation, the time course of release (TCR) at the neuromuscular junction is independent of the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Datyner and Gage, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Van der Kloot, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Parnas et al., 1989</a>). However, the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the TCR is less well established at central synapses (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sargent et al., 2005</a>). Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Several potential explanations were proposed, including adaptation of transmitter release (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hsu et al., 1996</a>) and additional voltage sensors that control the timing of release (<a href=\"#bib30\">Parnas et al., 2000</a>; See; <a href=\"#bib16\">Felmy et al., 2003</a>). Recent results suggested that in several central synapses presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sensors are tightly coupled (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eggermann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Scimemi and Diamond, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>). Tight coupling might be another factor contributing to the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the TCR (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yamada and Zucker, 1992</a>). However, this possibility has not been directly examined."

Analysis of the dependence of evoked IPSC peak amplitude on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> revealed that the amount of transmitter release was steeply [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent, with a high power coefficient (n = 3.02 in the low-concentration limit; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Thus, release at the BC\u2013PC synapse was highly cooperative (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967</a>). We next measured the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence of release kinetics. To determine the TCR, we first recorded unitary IPSCs at a given [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, and subsequently in reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to isolate quantal IPSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We then computed the TCR by deconvolution of unitary and quantal IPSC waveforms (<a href=\"#bib11\">Diamond and Jahr, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Neher and Sakaba, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sakaba, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). When [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was changed in the range from 0.7\u20134 mM, peak release rate changed by a factor of 34.4. In contrast, the half-duration of the TCR was only minimally affected (0.49 \u00b1 0.05 ms at 0.7 mM; 0.43 \u00b1 0.05 ms at 1 mM; 0.47 \u00b1 0.01 ms at 2 mM; 0.47 \u00b1 0.02 ms at 4 mM; 5\u201311 pairs; p = 0.56; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Furthermore, the decay time constant of the TCR was similar in the different conditions (p = 0.38; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). These results show that the TCR is largely [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-independent at a central synapse. Similar conclusions were reached at lower recording temperature, which would be expected to markedly slow down the kinetic rates of channels and sensors, but to only minimally change the rates of diffusional processes. At \u223c12\u00b0C, changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> had no detectable effects on the half-duration of the TCR (2.84 \u00b1 0.42 ms at 1 mM, 2.97 \u00b1 0.24 ms at 2 mM, and 2.79 \u00b1 0.25 ms at 4 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>; 5 pairs; p = 0.93) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering were computed by solving the full set of partial differential diffusion and reaction equations, and the TCR was simulated using a previously established release sensor model (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Finally, the half-duration of the TCR was plotted against the peak release rate (PRR). Computational analysis revealed that the TCR was markedly dependent on the PRR in both low and high PRR limit. In the low PRR limit, the half-duration of the TCR decreased with PRR in a model with fixed coupling distance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This dependence was accentuated after slowing of release sensor rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, top), indicating that rate-limiting sensor kinetics are responsible. Furthermore, this dependence was inverted in a model with variable coupling distance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In such a configuration, small Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow may selectively release proximal vesicles, whereas large Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow may recruit all vesicles, resulting in a broadening of the TCR. In the high PRR limit, the half-duration of the TCR increased with PRR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This behavior was particularly prominent in small boutons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, bottom), suggesting that saturation of the endogenous buffers leads to broadening of the TCR. In all configurations, the dependence of the TCR on the PRR was substantially more prominent in loose (200 nm, blue colors) than in tight coupling configurations (20 nm, red colors). Similar conclusions were reached when the concentration and unbinding rate of fixed buffers were altered (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gilmanov et al., 2008</a>). Thus, whereas several factors influence the shape of the TCR\u2013PRR relation, the coupling distance plays a key role in all conditions examined."

To test this hypothesis quantitatively, we probed the distance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sensors, using exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Neher, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eggermann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

Our model reveals that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence is substantially more prominent in loose than in tight coupling regimes in a variety of conditions. These include different Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor rates, different bouton diameters, various concentrations and affinity values of endogenous buffers, and uniform vs non-uniform coupling. Specifically, our model predicts that slowing of sensor rates should markedly enhance the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence of the TCR in a microdomain, but not in a nanodomain coupling regime. We tested this prediction by lowering the temperature, which, among other potential effects, is expected to slow sensor rates. Whereas lowering the temperature had large effects on the absolute value of the half-duration of the TCR, its [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence was unchanged. These findings provide experimental evidence that tight source\u2013sensor coupling is a key factor that ensures the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the TCR."

Our results suggest another functional benefit: conveying [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence to the TCR. Is the invariance of the TCR relevant for microcircuit function under physiological conditions? Maintenance of speed and temporal precision at the GABAergic BC\u2013PC synapse is of critical importance for the operation of the cerebellum, since feedforward inhibition mediated by BCs sets the temporal window of signal integration in PCs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mittmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bao et al., 2010</a>). However, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> has been shown to fluctuate during repetitive activity, high-frequency network oscillations, and in pathophysiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heinemann et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Borst and Sakmann, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rusakov and Fine, 2003</a>). Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow will be changed by neuromodulators, which often act via inhibition of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib39\">Takahashi et al., 1998</a>). Thus, nanodomain coupling at BC\u2013PC synapses may ensure constant timing of fast feedforward inhibition under a variety of network conditions."

PDEs were solved numerically with NDSolve of Mathematica 8.01 running under Windows 7 on a PC. A release unit was implemented as a hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The diameter was assumed to be 1 \u00b5m, approximately corresponding to the radius of inhibitory boutons, unless specified differently. PDEs were integrated over the radial coordinate (2000 grid points) and solved at a concentration accuracy of 0.01 nM."

The Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow, relative to that of a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, was varied between 1 and 100.

For standard simulations, both a fixed buffer (100 \u00b5M) and a mobile buffer with BAPTA-like properties (10 \u00b5M) were incorporated. Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer concentrations were considered to be spatially uniform. The resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was set to 40 nM (<a href=\"#bib8\">Collin et al., 2005</a>). Vesicular release rate was computed using a model of transmitter release originally established at the calyx of Held (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lou et al., 2005</a>). This model was preferred over alternative models because it is based on the most extensive set of experimental data. The occupancies for the different states of the model were obtained by solving the corresponding first-order ordinary differential equations with a Q-matrix approach. Release rate was computed as the sum of the product of occupancy and release rate for each state; pool depletion was not considered."

The maximal release rate in the model was 6008 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lou et al., 2005</a>). In a subset of simulations, a distributed arrangement of release sensors was assumed, with a coefficient of variation for the coupling distance of 0.3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In these cases, release rates were obtained at various distances, and the average release rate was computed as the weighted mean, with weight factors set according to a normal distribution."

They include a study of latencies at two temperatures, a pharmacological analysis of synaptic calcium channel subtypes, a deconvolution-based analysis of release rate as a function of external calcium, and an investigation of the effects of added EGTA and BAPTA on synaptic efficacy. The results are then simulated using a variant of the previously published Eggermann-Jonas model at the same synapse."

As detailed below, the possibility remains open that other aspects of the synapse function such as width of the AP, speed of the release reactions, or effects of endogenous buffers, may play a key role as well. Repeating the experiments of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a> at room temperature should help to solve this problem.

If this is done it appears that the changes in TCR duration are only near 15 or 20% for the loose coupling (roughly decreasing from 0.65 to 0.55). A similar analysis made on panel e (including a dispersion in coupling distances) leads to even smaller changes. Looking at these simulations, it does seem like the dependence on external calcium is less for tight coupling than for loose coupling. But in either case the dependence is modest, presumably because the model has been constrained to mimic a very fast synapse (fast AP, fast calcium channel, fast SV release).

We continue to think that the manuscript provides interesting data, as also stated by the editor\u2019s summary that the paper addresses an \u201cinteresting and under-studied question\u201d. Furthermore, not all papers converge on the conclusion that coupling is tight. For example, we have recently shown loose coupling in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses (<a href=\"#bib41\">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</a>), and earlier papers suggested loose coupling at CA3\u2013CA1 cell synapses based on the properties of synaptic dynamics (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nadkarni et al., 2012</a>). Likewise, previous studies using membrane-permeant Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators indicated loose coupling in CCK interneuron output synapses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</a>). Finally, the suggestions of the editor / reviewers have helped to convey an additional novel aspect to the paper, because, to the best of our knowledge, nobody ever studied the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence of the TCR at different temperatures."

While it is true that latency variations have been little investigated in the CNS, the literature is not as empty as the manuscript would suggest. For example, Boudkkazi et al (Neuron 56, 1048, 2007) found that delays vary with release probability at cortical synapses, including when increasing the extracellular calcium concentration. Gilmanov IR et al 2008 also approached these issues at NMJ with similar conclusions. Furthermore, the Ca independence of release has long been noted at NMJ (as the authors acknowledge), but the authors don't refer to any studies of this in neurons, though there are several which could be cited and discussed, starting perhaps with Silver et al. 1996 in granule cells</i>."

Although the TCR is not directly reported in those studies, we agree that these papers are relevant to our work, because they report Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the EPSC time course. We have incorporated <a href=\"#bib17\">Gilmanov et al., 2008</a> and <a href=\"#bib34\">Sargent et al., 2005</a>, as suggested. However, we would like to add that latency and time course of release should not be confused.
