                    "text": "In the mouse retina, three different types of photoreceptors provide input to 14 bipolar cell (BC) types. Classically, most BC types are thought to contact all cones within their dendritic field; ON-BCs would contact cones exclusively via so-called invaginating synapses, while OFF-BCs would form basal synapses. By mining publically available electron microscopy data, we discovered interesting violations of these rules of outer retinal connectivity: ON-BC type X contacted only ~20% of the cones in its dendritic field and made mostly atypical non-invaginating contacts. Types 5T, 5O and 8 also contacted fewer cones than expected. In addition, we found that rod BCs received input from cones, providing anatomical evidence that rod and cone pathways are interconnected in both directions. This suggests that the organization of the outer plexiform layer is more complex than classically thought."

Classically, most BC types are thought to contact all cones within their dendritic field; ON-BCs would contact cones exclusively via so-called invaginating synapses, while OFF-BCs would form basal synapses. By mining publically available electron microscopy data, we discovered interesting violations of these rules of outer retinal connectivity: ON-BC type X contacted only ~20% of the cones in its dendritic field and made mostly atypical non-invaginating contacts. Types 5T, 5O and 8 also contacted fewer cones than expected. In addition, we found that rod BCs received input from cones, providing anatomical evidence that rod and cone pathways are interconnected in both directions. This suggests that the organization of the outer plexiform layer is more complex than classically thought."

The precise connectivity rules between photoreceptors and bipolar cell (BC) types determine which signals are available to downstream circuits. Therefore, the connectome of the outer retina is essential for a complete picture of visual processing in the retina."

The other BC types are thought to contact all M-cones within their dendritic field, but their connectivity to S-cones is unclear (<a href=\"#bib44\">W\u00e4ssle et al., 2009</a>). In addition, two fundamental cone-BC contact shapes have been described: invaginating contacts with the dendritic tips extending into the cone pedicle and flat (basal) contacts that touch the cone pedicle base, commonly associated with ON- and OFF-BCs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dowling and Boycott, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kolb, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hopkins and Boycott, 1995</a>)."

However, we found interesting violations of established rules of outer retinal connectivity: The newly discovered CBCX (<a href=\"#bib22\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>), likely an ON-CBC (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ichinose et al., 2014</a>), had unexpectedly few and mostly atypical basal contacts to cones. CBC5T, CBC5O and CBC8 also contacted fewer cones than expected from their dendritic field. In addition, we provide anatomical evidence that rod and cone pathways are connected in both directions: Not only OFF-types CBC3A, CBC3B and CBC4 get direct input from rods but also RBCs from cones."

We found 48 contacts of CBC9s and cones, involving 43 cones (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We visually assessed all contacts and found that 29 of these were in the periphery of the cone pedicle, where no synapses are expected (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dowling and Boycott, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chun et al., 1996</a>). This left 14 potential S-cones with invaginating contacts from at least one CBC9. It has been shown that S-cones are contacted by the dendrites of all neighboring CBC9s and that these contacts occur mostly at the tip of dendritic branches (<a href=\"#bib20\">Haverkamp et al., 2005</a>). Out of the 14 candidate cones, eight cones had only one CBC9 contact. Some of these cones were contacted by a CBC9 dendritic branch that continued past the contact site. Other cones \u2013 although contact by one CBC9 \u2013 were not contacted by passing dendrites from other CBC9s. The other six cones had at least two invaginating contacts from CBC9s. These originated from two different CBC9s or \u2013 in case they originated only from a single CBC9 \u2013 at least one of them was formed by a dendritic branch ending at the cone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We labeled the eight cones that featured only a single CBC9 contact as M-cones (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), and defined the remaining six candidate cones as S-cones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). This corresponds to a fraction of 4.8% S-cones (6/124 cones within the dendritic field of at least one CBC9), matching the 3\u20135% reported in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib35\">R\u00f6hlich et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haverkamp et al., 2005</a>)."

As the tissue in the dataset was stained to enhance cell-surface contrast to enable automatic reconstruction, it is not possible to distinguish between synaptic contacts based on explicit ultrastructural synaptic markers, such as vesicles, synaptic ribbons or postsynaptic densities (see also discussion in <a href=\"#bib22\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to the synaptic contacts in the inner plexiform layer studied by Helmstaedter et al. (<a href=\"#bib22\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>), the highly stereotypical morphology of synapses at photoreceptor axon terminals allowed us to classify the contacts (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haverkamp et al., 2000</a>): The ribbon synapses of the cones are placed exclusively in the presynaptic area at the bottom of the cone pedicles. Here, ON-cone bipolar cells (ON-CBCs) make invaginating contacts, where the dendritic tips reach a few hundred nanometers into the presynaptic area of cone pedicles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dowling and Boycott, 1966</a>). In contrast, OFF-cone BCs (OFF-CBCs) make basal contacts in the same area (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These \u2018true\u2019 contacts have to be distinguished from contacts in the periphery or at the (out)sides of the cone pedicle as well as contacts between dendrites and cone telodendria, which can happen, for instance as dendrites pass by (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

We trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish whether or not an individual BC obtains input from a cone (as opposed to classifying each individual contact site, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). To this end, we defined a set of seven features, including contact area, eccentricity and contact height, which allowed distinguishing between potential synaptic contacts and \u2018false\u2019 contacts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For training of the classifier, we manually labeled a randomly selected set of contacts (n\u00a0=\u00a050 for OFF-CBCs, n\u00a0=\u00a0108 for ON-CBCs and n\u00a0=\u00a067 for RBCs). Given the highly stereotypical anatomy of the photoreceptor-BC synapse, labeling performed by an experienced human observer is expected to be very accurate \u2013 we here consider therefore the human labels as \u2018ground-truth\u2019. We trained separate classifiers for ON-CBCs, OFF-CBCs and RBCs and found that they could reliably distinguish between true and false contacts, with a success rate of\u00a0~90% (leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013I</a>). Deviations between the labels of the automatic classifier and the human labels did not vary systematically with BC type (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Such deviations typically occurred when human labels were assigned based on more global structural features of a contact; such more contextual features were not included in the features used for automatic classification (examples of misclassified contacts are shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>)."

It has a compact dendritic tree but a relatively wide axonal terminal system that stratifies narrowly at approximately the same depth as CBC5O and 5I do.

In fact, dendrites of CBCX oftentimes passed underneath cones or even stopped shortly before cone pedicles without making contacts at all (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>).

We checked if CBCX receive rod input instead but did not observe any rod contacts (see below).

These contacts were typical ON-CBC contacts with invaginating dendritic tips into the cone pedicles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To quantify the cone-to-RBC connectivity in more detail, we counted the number of cones contacted by an individual RBC. While the vast majority (75%) contacted at least one cone, only 25% of all RBCs (n\u00a0=\u00a0141) did not contact any (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, we did not find a preference of RBCs to connect S- or M-cones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Conversely, 45% of cones contacted a single RBC,\u00a0~35% spread their signal to two to four RBCs, and only 20% of the cones did not make any contact with an RBC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Our finding provides an anatomical basis to the physiologically postulated direct cone input into a subset of RBCs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pang et al., 2010</a>). Next, we evaluated whether RBCs contacting only rods or both cone(s) and rods represent two types of RBC, as hypothesized by <a href=\"#bib33\">Pang et al. (2010)</a>. However, the two groups of RBCs did not differ regarding the stratification depth of their axonal arbor (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), number of rod contacts (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) or potential connectivity to AII amacrine cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), and did not form independent mosaics (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). In addition, the\u00a0dendritic field size (116 vs 131 \u00b5m\u00b2, p=0.1, n\u00a0=\u00a0139 RBCs) and the number of dendritic tips (46 vs. 45.5, p=0.8, n\u00a0=\u00a012 manually counted RBCs) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Therefore, the available anatomical data argue against two types of RBC."

This is not the first finding to challenge the traditional view that ON-CBCs form only invaginating and OFF-CBCs only basal synaptic contacts. In the primate fovea, diffuse ON-CBCs (DBs) form basal contacts with foveal cones since almost all invaginating sites are taken by midget bipolar cell dendrites (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calkins et al., 1996</a>). This spatial limitation is less evident in mid-peripheral primate retina.

Second, they form sparse contacts relative to their axon terminal size with comparatively few cells. Thus, the CBCX seems to be an exception, an unusual BC type in many respects in addition to its sparse and atypical connectivity properties in the OPL, reminiscent of a recently described dendrite-less interneuron type that expresses BC-specific genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shekhar et al., 2016</a>) and was named GluMI (glutamatergic monopolar interneuron) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Della Santina et al., 2016</a>). It is conceivable that \u2013 similar to the GluMI \u2013 the CBCX is evolutionary on its way to retracting its dendrites. Alternatively, CBCX develops a tad later than other CBC types and most potential synaptic sites at cone ribbons are already occupied, such that the CBCX can only form few connections \u2013 reminiscent of the situation in primate (see above)."

First, we grouped all contacts for a specific cone-BC pair, in the following referred to as a contact-set. We obtained a training data set by randomly selecting 10 contact-sets per CBC type and 50 RBC-cone contact-sets. We excluded CBCX from the training data because of their atypical contacts. To increase classifier performance we added 17 additional RBC-cone contact-sets manually classified as invaginating contacts as well as all 48 CBC9-cone contact-sets classified for the S-cone identification. For those contact-sets, we visually inspected each individual contact point in the raw data combined with volume segmentation overlay using KNOSSOS. Then we classified it either as a central basal contact (potentially synaptic) or peripheral contact (e.g. at the side of a cone or contact with telodendria, likely non-synaptic) for OFF-CBCs or as invaginating contact vs. peripheral contact for ON-CBCs and RBCs. Next, we extracted a set of seven parameters for each contact (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>):"

To automatically classify the contacts to rods, we followed a similar scheme as for the cones. Again, we grouped the contacts for each pair of BC and rod spherule. As training data, we selected all putative contact sites with CBC1s (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and CBC2s (n\u00a0=\u00a032), 20 random contacts to CBC types 3A, 3B and four as well as 100 random contacts to RBCs. Again, we classified these contacts by visual inspection in KNOSSOS using the raw data with a\u00a0colored segmentation overlay. In addition, we manually inspected all 132 contact points between rod spherules and ON-CBCs, but could not identify a single potential synaptic contact. We trained SVM classifiers for contacts between rods and RBCs/OFF-CBCs using the same parameters as for the contacts to cones. As synaptic contacts between OFF-CBCs and rod spherules are basal contacts situated close to the invaginating RBC contacts, we added the minimum distance to the next (synaptic) RBC contact as an\u00a0additional classification parameter for OFF-CBCs. As a consequence, we restricted the analysis of OFF-CBC-to-rod contacts to those rods were RBC contacts could be identified (n\u00a0=\u00a01685).

These assumptions result in an approximately correct number of S cones given past estimates of their density. Nonetheless, the process seems almost certain to misidentify some cones. It is not entirely clear how important this is for the conclusions of the paper. The section in the Discussion presenting an alternative identification of S cones is quite helpful in this regard, but in my view, comes too late. I would like to see a more thorough analysis of the potential errors in identification and the impact of those errors on the conclusions of the paper. Doing that from the start should help build a reader's confidence. Related to this point, it would help to lay out the criteria very directly (e.g. I was not entirely clear from the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cIdentification of S- and M-cones\u201d if contacts only at the end of the dendrites was a hard criterion)."

Synapses were identified automatically based on extracted features of each close apposition. These identifications were compared with those from manual identification to verify the accuracy of the automated process. At present, it is hard for a reader to evaluate and confirm the accuracy of identification of true contacts vs. false contacts, since this relies on a \"ground truth\" that itself has some uncertainty at least for the reader. I think it is important to construct as strong an argument as possible that manual inspection and classification indeed provides nearly unambiguous identification of true synapses. As for the point above, I would suggest doing this from the start of the paper. It would be very helpful to have a better sense for the impact of classification errors (which are not so rare from the analysis described in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cClassification of photoreceptor-BC contacts\u201d) on the conclusions. Related to this point is the possibility of distant contacts or near contacts detecting diffusing transmitter. This is brought up late in the paper (subsection \u201cSparse contacts between some ON CBC types and cones\u201d, last paragraph), but it would help to deal with the issue earlier (e.g. around subsection \u201cClassification of photoreceptor-BC contacts\u201d, first paragraph). Another point related to this is the uniqueness of identification of basal contacts \u2013 e.g. how certain can we be that rod-Off CB basal contacts are real synapses?"

The original reconstruction by Helmstaedter and colleagues identified a new bipolar cell type (the CBCX) and focused on reconstructing the inner plexiform layer. The authors of the current study perform a reconstruction of the synaptic connections in the outer plexiform layer. This study offers significant novel findings that add to and also challenge the existing knowledge of outer retina connectivity. Most importantly, they show that there is a potential cross-over of input from cones to rod bipolar cells with the majority of RBCs (~75%) contacting cones. This further challenges the status quo of separate and isolated channels for parallel processing in the vertebrate retina. Furthermore, the authors show that the newly discovered CBCX makes surprisingly few contacts with the cones (~20%) available within the cell's dendritic reach. The work also challenges the assumption that there is equal divergence between one cone and all cone bipolar cell types."

The authors' statements about connectivity should be qualified for this reason. The authors describe \"true\" and \"false\" synapses, but these judgements are unclear given that the dataset did not contain synaptic information that could be used to verify contacts. Furthermore, the authors did not illustrate \"false\" contacts, making the interpretation of the \"true\" contacts ambiguous. To this point, the subsection \u201cDoes a \u2018contact\u2019 represent a synaptic connection?\u201d of the Discussion mentions contacts and synaptic connections and \"errors\" in classifying a contact. Can the authors show examples in a supplementary figure of what these human and algorithm errors look like?

It is not entirely clear how important this is for the conclusions of the paper. The section in the Discussion presenting an alternative identification of S cones is quite helpful in this regard, but in my view, comes too late. I would like to see a more thorough analysis of the potential errors in identification and the impact of those errors on the conclusions of the paper. Doing that from the start should help build a reader's confidence. Related to this point, it would help to lay out the criteria very directly (e.g. I was not entirely clear from the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cIdentification of S- and M-cones\u201d if contacts only at the end of the dendrites was a hard criterion).</i> "

At present, it is hard for a reader to evaluate and confirm the accuracy of identification of true contacts vs. false contacts, since this relies on a \"ground truth\" that itself has some uncertainty at least for the reader. I think it is important to construct as strong an argument as possible that manual inspection and classification indeed provides nearly unambiguous identification of true synapses.

The authors describe \"true\" and \"false\" synapses, but these judgements are unclear given that the dataset did not contain synaptic information that could be used to verify contacts. Furthermore, the authors did not illustrate \"false\" contacts, making the interpretation of the \"true\" contacts ambiguous. To this point, the subsection \u201cDoes a \u2018contact\u2019 represent a synaptic connection?\u201d of the Discussion mentions contacts and synaptic connections and \"errors\" in classifying a contact.
