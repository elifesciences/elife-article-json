However, the processes that underlie increased vascular permeability and pathological plasma leakage during viral hemorrhagic fevers are largely unknown. Mast cells (MCs) are activated in vivo during DENV infection, and we show that this elevates systemic levels of their vasoactive products, including chymase, and promotes vascular leakage. Treatment of infected animals with MC-stabilizing drugs or a leukotriene receptor antagonist restores vascular integrity during experimental DENV infection. Validation of these findings using human clinical samples revealed a direct correlation between MC activation and DENV disease severity. In humans, the MC-specific product, chymase, is a predictive biomarker distinguishing dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Additionally, our findings reveal MCs as potential therapeutic targets to prevent DENV-induced vasculopathy, suggesting MC-stabilizing drugs should be evaluated for their effectiveness in improving disease outcomes during viral hemorrhagic fevers."

However, the processes that underlie increased vascular permeability and pathological plasma leakage during viral hemorrhagic fevers are largely unknown. Mast cells (MCs) are activated in vivo during DENV infection, and we show that this elevates systemic levels of their vasoactive products, including chymase, and promotes vascular leakage. Treatment of infected animals with MC-stabilizing drugs or a leukotriene receptor antagonist restores vascular integrity during experimental DENV infection. Validation of these findings using human clinical samples revealed a direct correlation between MC activation and DENV disease severity. In humans, the MC-specific product, chymase, is a predictive biomarker distinguishing dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Additionally, our findings reveal MCs as potential therapeutic targets to prevent DENV-induced vasculopathy, suggesting MC-stabilizing drugs should be evaluated for their effectiveness in improving disease outcomes during viral hemorrhagic fevers."

Moreover, levels of an enzyme called chymase, another mast cell product, are higher in human patients with DHF than in those with dengue fever. Since chymase release occurs early in infection, tests for the presence of this enzyme could be used to predict which patients are likely to develop DHF."

MCs are also versatile detectors of infection that respond strongly to direct activation by DENV (<a href=\"#bib45\">St John et al., 2011</a>) as well as indirect, antibody-mediated activation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sanchez et al., 1986</a>).

However, systemic or aberrant activation of MCs is a contributing factor to many pathological conditions associated with leakage of blood vessels, including anaphylaxis, asthma, aneurysm, and others (<a href=\"#bib16\">Frangogiannis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Williams and Galli, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Finkelman, 2007</a>).

This inoculating dose was used since it approximates our understanding of the infective dose instilled into the skin by mosquito injection (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bente and Rico-Hesse, 2006</a>). Control, saline-injected tissues contained apparently unactivated MCs, located proximal to intact blood vessels, which were densely packed with intra-cellular granules. Several changes to the ultrastructure of DENV-injected tissues were noted, contrasting the quiescence of saline-injected tissues. DENV-injected tissue contained many activated MC located near vessels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These could be identified by the characteristic lengthened cellular protrusions that remain after degranulation and the presence of residual intracellular granules. Occasionally granules could be identified in the process of being released (circled in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition to MC degranulation, evidence of fluid pooling or edema could be observed in infected tissues, also in close proximity to MCs, extracellular MC granules, and vascular endothelium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These images are representative of our initial observation that MC activation and loss of vascular structure appear intimately associated in DENV-injected tissues and they led us to undertake further studies to examine the role of MCs in DENV-induced vascular leakage."

For DENV, a prominent portion of the literature raises doubt as to whether wild type (WT), immunologically intact, mice can be productively infected by DENV or are valid hosts for undertaking studies to investigate the mechanisms of vascular permeability (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yauch and Shresta, 2008</a>). In spite of this, studies to address the role of MC-promoted inflammatory responses to DENV require the context of a host that is able to generate normal immune responses, whether productive or pathological (<a href=\"#bib44\">St John et al., 2013</a>). Although WT mice have been shown to be less susceptible to infection than mice lacking the capacity of innate immune activation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shresta et al., 2004</a>), we, like others (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boonpucknavig et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Atrasheuskaya et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Paes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>), observe and have previously reported WT mice can sustain replicating DENV infection (<a href=\"#bib45\">St John et al., 2011</a>). Others have also used WT mice to examine DENV-induced vascular hemorrhaging or pathology (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Assuncao-Miranda et al., 2010</a>). Based on these multiple lines of evidence supporting the feasibility of undertaking studies in the WT mouse model, we optimized a system of infecting WT mice to generate systemic DENV infection, by injecting 1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) of DENV, intra-peritoneally (i.p.). This route of infection was chosen in order to bypass the stages of natural, peripheral infection when WT mice can also clear virus quickly. Cohorts of infected WT mice were monitored for evidence of vascular events consistent with DENV symptoms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) and for evidence of productive DENV replication (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>) for 5 days after the initiation of systemic infection. Two measures of vascular function that are associated with DENV pathology in human patients are thrombocytopenia and elevated hematocrit values, the latter of which is a key test used to diagnose DENV mild to moderate vascular leakage or hemorrhaging and vascular pathology clinically, although severe hemorrhaging can be accompanied by suddenly lowered hematocrit values (<a href=\"#bib53\">World Health Organization and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, 2009</a>). Since hematocrit measures the packed red blood cell volume as a percentage of the total blood volume, it is a measure of plasma loss from the circulation. WT mice experimentally infected with this DENV clinical isolate experience a rise in hematocrit values that peaks 24\u201348 hr after infection and remains significantly increased over naive mice for 4 days post-infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), demonstrating that measureable evidence increased vascular permeability can be detected in the WT mouse model over a prolonged time course. In line with additional symptoms of DENV infection in humans, WT mice also experienced a drop in platelets over the first 48 hr of infection before recovering by day 3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, with regards to quantitative measures of vascular pathology, WT mice display multiple symptoms consistent with human DENV during infection."

By real time PCR for DENV NS1, we were able to determine that viral replication peaked in the liver at 48 hr and in the spleen at 72 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This evidence of productive DENV infection was supported by a secondary technique of immunofluorescence staining for the replication intermediate, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). As expected, dsRNA staining could not be observed only 1 hr after infection, prior to when systemic replication could have been initiated on a detectable scale (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). However, dsRNA staining could be observed in the spleen beginning at the 24 hr time point and this staining remained apparent throughout the time course, although greatly visually reduced by day 4 post-infection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), consistent with real time PCR quantification of splenic viral copies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

To reveal any contributions of MC to vascular leakage during DENV infection, we compared the responses of immunologically intact WT hosts to mice lacking MCs (Sash). Sash mice are a well-established MC-deficient model, where MCs are almost entirely absent due to a key point mutation in the promoter of the <i>ckit</i> gene that predominately affects its expression within the MC lineage (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grimbaldeston et al., 2005</a>). To determine if DENV-infected WT mice can display systemic levels of MC activation, we measured the MC-specific product, MCPT1, in mouse serum by ELISA in na\u00efve and DENV-infected mice. After intra-peritoneally. injection of DENV as described above, MCPT1 was detectable in the serum of WT mice at 24 hr and continuing beyond 48 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). As expected, Sash mice had undetectable serum levels of MCPT1 at baseline, as did uninfected congenic wild-type (WT) controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Having verified that our infection model allows systemic detection of a key MC-derived vasoactive product, we next examined readouts of vascular leakage in this system by hematocrit analysis, again, since this is a key measure of both mild and severe vascular leakage with clinical relevance. The results of hematocrit analysis supported a MC-dependency to vascular leakage since MC-sufficient WT animals had elevated hematocrit values with DENV infection, but Sash mice did not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Importantly, since a few other processes (such as melanocyte migration) are affected in Sash mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grimbaldeston et al., 2005</a>), repletion studies were performed in these experiments as a control. To replete MCs in order to establish that MCs are sufficient to restore the WT functional phenotype, bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were passively infused intra-venously. Since repletion of Sash mice with MCs, alone, was able to restore elevated vascular leakage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), the DENV-induced affect of increased vascular permeability appears to be MC dependent."

Evans blue leakage studies are commonly used to assess models of viral hemorrhaging (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gowen et al., 2010</a>), however, we modified the standard technique so as to improve the sensitivity to detect sub-hemorrhagic vascular leakage by flushing excess dye from the vascular system by saline perfusion, prior to quantitation. Following this strategy, mice were injected by tail vein with the tracking dye, Evans blue, 30 min prior to euthanasia at a 24-hr time point after infection. Initial examination of the internal organs of mice did not reveal visible leakage of dye (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is consistent with the observations by others that immunocompetent WT mice do not always exhibit gross pathological vascular leakage with DENV infection (<a href=\"#bib39\">Raut et al., 1996</a>). However, when mice were perfused with saline, increased in vascular permeability was visible in infected mice due to residual blood and dye remaining in the tissues (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Since the liver of mice contains very few MCs compared to other species such as humans (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bois et al., 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Koda et al., 2000</a>), these findings suggested that systemic MC effects were likely responsible for the observed vascular changes.

Informed by our studies suggesting that MCs augment DENV-induced vascular leakage in animal models (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we attempted to block this vascular leakage using a panel of these drugs. We chose two well-established MC-stabilizing compounds that are clinically available, cromolyn and ketotifen (<a href=\"#bib47\">Theoharides et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McClean et al., 1989</a>), and two treatments that block MC products that are known to promote vascular leakage, an anti-TNF blocking antibody and montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist (<a href=\"#bib9\">Busse et al., 1999</a>). None of these drugs act exclusively on MCs or MC-derived products but they are known to modulate the functions of MCs effectively in a clinical context. Drugs were administered once, 30 min after intra-peritoneally instillation of 1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> DENV and vascular leakage was assessed 1 day after infection. Both MC-stabilizing compounds significantly decreased vascular leakage compared to untreated DENV alone, quantitated by Evans blue leakage as well as hematocrit analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Blocking TNF has previously been shown to be effective in limiting vascular leakage at late time points of infection in immunocompromised mice lacking Type I and II Interferon receptors (IFN-\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3-R<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>, or AG129), which is a mouse model of DENV viremia (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zellweger et al., 2010</a>). In our WT mouse model, when TNF-blocking antibodies were administered 1 hr after systemic infection was initiated by intra-peritoneally injection, the average Evans blue dye leakage and hematocrit values were lower; however, this did not reach statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Blocking leukotriene function using the drug montelukast also allowed striking, significant reductions in dye leakage compared to untreated mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting leukotrienes can also contribute to DENV-induced vascular permeability. Although cromolyn\u2019s inhibitory influence on MCs is well established (<a href=\"#bib47\">Theoharides et al., 1980</a>), to support a direct effect of the MC-stabilization strategy on MCs in this DENV infection model, we again compared serum MCPT1 in untreated and cromolyn-treated DENV-infected mice. As expected, levels of MCPT1 were reduced by cromolyn treatment at 24 hr, and by 48 hr, serum MCPT1 was undetectable in treated mice, yet still elevated in untreated mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). By 24 hr, there was a trend towards a slight increase in the average number of DENV genome copies in the serum, but this did not reach levels of statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Since three drugs from this panel, cromolyn, ketotifen and montelukast, all were successful in restoring both the levels of dye detection in the liver tissue and hematocrit values to levels that were not statistically different from baseline levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), these data highlight the potential of MCs to serve as therapeutic targets to limit DENV pathology."

To determine if DENV elicits products from MCs, directly, that act on vascular endothelial cells, we performed trans-well assays to measure the responses of mouse endothelial cell (EOMA) monolayers to MC-derived products. Supernatants from DENV activated or control mast cells were transferred to monolayers of EOMA cells and the trans-endothelial resistance (TER), a measure of the barrier function of a cell monolayer that decreases as permeability increases, was measured after 24 hr to determine if DENV-activated MCs specifically promote loss of barrier function. We observed a significant drop in the TER reading relative to the baseline for EOMA cells exposed to DENV-activated MC supernatant but not to unactivated MCs or virus alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Cromolyn treatment of MCs also prevented this reduced barrier function, as did both blockade of leukotrienes with montelukast or inhibition of chymase with a cocktail of specific inhibitors including chymostatin and soybean trypsin inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). To confirm the role of MC-derived leukotrienes in promoting endothelial cell permeability in an additional experimental system, we tested whether leukotriene-deficient MCs are able to induce comparable vascular permeability to WT MCs. For this, we purified MCs from the peritoneal and pleural cavities of mice that lack 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO-KO), the enzyme required for leukotriene synthesis for use in trans-well assays. For comparison, MCs were also purified from WT and TNF-KO mice. Purified MCs were stained to verify that the isolated cells demonstrated a granulated MC morphology (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, inset). We observed a significant reduction in the TER relative to baseline in EOMA cells exposed to supernatants from DENV-activated WT or TNF-KO MCs that did not occur in EOMA cells exposed to supernatant from DENV activated 5-LO-KO MCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). 5-LO appears to mediate direct activity of DENV-activated MCs on endothelial cells since DENV-exposed WT MCs have a significantly greater impact on the TER of EOMA cells compared to MCs from 5-LO-KO mice. These data also provide evidence that MCs products have the potential to be direct intermediaries in promoting vascular permeability of endothelial cells that is not induced by virus alone treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>)."

To determine if MC activation occurred in human DENV patients, we tested serum from patients for the MC-specific product, chymase, by ELISA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This human homologue of mouse MCPT1 is also known to increase vascular leakage over a prolonged time course (<a href=\"#bib21\">He and Walls, 1998</a>). All sera were obtained from a previously described DENV clinical study (<a href=\"#bib30\">Low et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fink et al., 2007</a>), where early serum samples were obtained during acute DENV infection (1\u20133 days after onset of fever), followed by a second sample during the defervescent stage of infection (4\u20137 days after onset of fever). The sera tested fell into the following groups: (1) control healthy human sera, (2) control sera from individuals with fever that were referred to the study as possible DENV cases but were negative for DENV by laboratory tests employing RT-PCR for DENV RNA, (3) sera from patients that were positive for DF by clinical diagnosis as well as RT-PCR and (4) sera from patients that were DENV positive by clinical diagnosis, molecular tests, and were also diagnosed during the study to have DHF, rather than the less severe DF. Strikingly, we found that those patients that were diagnosed with DF or DHF showed chymase levels in serum obtained during the acute phase of infection were significantly higher than levels in the serum of either healthy controls or individuals with fever that were DENV negative by RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This trend of heightened levels of chymase in the blood of DF and DHF patients persisted to the second time point of blood collection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), illustrating a prolonged course of elevated MC products occurs during infection. During the acute phase of infection, DF patients displayed an increase in serum chymase that was approximately 10 times higher than to healthy individuals or DENV-negative patients while, in DHF patients, chymase levels 30 times higher than healthy controls were detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Heightened levels of serum chymase were also maintained in DF and DHF patients relative to healthy controls during the defervescent stage of infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since there is an approximate threefold increase in the levels of serum chymase in the blood of DHF patients compared to DF patients, this finding also illustrates a correlation between the levels of chymase and the severity of vasculopathy experienced in DENV-infected humans (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). Patient serum samples were DENV serotypes 1-, 2-, or 3-positive, and the infecting serotype also appeared to be a significant, but minor influence to levels of chymase detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). For example, chymase concentrations in DENV2-infected individuals were highest on average in both DF of DHF patients compared to DENV1- and DENV3-infected patients (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Although the serum used here was derived from a study where there was no increased incidence of DHF diagnosis in patients with secondary infection over primary infection (<a href=\"#bib30\">Low et al., 2006</a>), secondary infection is considered to be a risk factor for increased likelihood of DHF (<a href=\"#bib20\">Halstead, 2007</a>). For this reason, we also compared the levels of chymase in these two groups of primary and secondary infection and found that while there were no differences in the chymase levels in patients diagnosed with DF between primary and secondary infection groups (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), interestingly, significantly higher chymase levels were detectable in DHF patients with secondary infection compared to DHF patients diagnosed during their primary infection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). We also observed that for DF, there was no discernable correlation between the amount of virus in the serum and serum chymase levels; however, for DHF patients, there appeared to be a strong correlation between high levels of chymase and lower DENV genome copies in the serum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), perhaps, highlighting the potential of MCs to contribute to virus clearance. Human DENV-infection follows a disease course where acute infection is characterized by high viremia and fever, followed by either resolution or hemorrhagic complications that usually occur during the defervescent phase, as viral titers decline (<a href=\"#bib20\">Halstead, 2007</a>). These opposing outcomes are difficult to predict early in infection. Our results suggest that, beyond the potential role of chymase in directly promoting vascular events, it may be a useful biomarker for prediction of severe DENV disease outcomes."

Since animals that lack MCs have reduced vascular permeability during DENV infection, to baseline levels, it appears that these cells are highly consequential to the initiation of vasculopathy, which is characteristic of severe DENV cases. TNF has previously been identified to promote the severe vascular leakage that occurs in DENV-infected animals (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atrasheuskaya et al., 2003</a>) and our data that leukotrienes and proteases also promote vascular leakage during infection with DENV suggests that multiple mediators, a substantial portion of them MC-derived, likely act in concert to effectuate the vascular complications that occasionally occur during severe DENV infections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Since DENV is naturally a primarily human-restricted pathogen and information gleaned from each animal model of disease has inherent caveats (<a href=\"#bib44\">St John et al., 2013</a>), we have verified our findings that MCs are activated during DENV by examining human clinical samples. Surprisingly, for those few patients that progress beyond normal DENV-associated malaise to develop hemorrhagic complications, we observe that heightened responses of MCs are associated with DHF and are apparent in an extreme elevation of serum chymase. If corroborated in independent patient populations and prospective human studies, this connection may be of great clinical utility since severe cases are notoriously difficult to predict early in infection at the time points where elevated chymase was first detected in this study. Patient serum was also derived in this case from adults experiencing DENV1, DENV2, or DENV3 infections and further studies will also be required to extend these results to children, a patient group that frequently experiences DHF (<a href=\"#bib20\">Halstead, 2007</a>), and to additional strains of virus. In support of the potential role of MC proteases during DENV infection, another recent study has also observed elevated chymase and tryptase in the serum of human patients (<a href=\"#bib17\">Furuta et al., 2012</a>). Chymase, itself, can promote vascular leakage over a notably prolonged timecourse (<a href=\"#bib21\">He and Walls, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kunder et al., 2011</a>) and its presence in the serum would signify that additional vasoactive cytokines and mediators would have been released from MCs, potentially, also contributing to vascular permeability."

These factors act in concert to promote vascular leakage that, when occurring on a systemic level, has pathological consequences for the host. Drugs that target MC products can limit this leakage and vascular pathology. Similarly, the MC-specific product chymase can also be used to predict the severity of hemorrhagic disease in human patients."

In some studies, but not others, high viral titers have been associated with DENV disease severity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vaughn et al., 2000</a>). Interestingly, we observe that for DHF patients, a decrease in serum virus genome copies is correlated with increased levels of MC products in the serum. We believe that this observation points to the dual role of MCs in immune protection and pathology. Our findings may provide one mechanistic explanation of how systemic infection may translate into a substantial pro-inflammatory response with negative implications for vascular integrity in terms of its barrier function. Just as many risk factors have been identified for DENV patients that are associated with severe infection and vascular leakage, many factors can theoretically influence the degree of MC activation in vivo in response to a stimulus, including the stimulus concentration, the presence of pre-existing antibodies such as IgE and their concentration, and host-specific differences in the intracellular signaling and sensitization of MC that can result from genetic diversity or existing allergy."

Interestingly, all of these drugs would be expected to limit host immune activation without antiviral activity. Although use of the Sash MC-deficient mouse model suggests that MCs are major contributors of the vasoactive factors that promote vascular permeability during DENV infection, we have used drugs to block MCs and MC products that are not entirely specific to inhibiting MC function. For example, cromolyn can reduce the activation levels of additional cell types (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holian et al., 1991</a>). Although leukotrienes were targeted because they are produced by MCs in copious amounts and we show that MC-derived leukotrienes can directly induce permeability of endothelial cell monolayers, they are also produced by cell types in addition to MCs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dahlen et al., 1981</a>). Therefore, the benefits of MC targeting may be in part due to the blockade of inflammatory products from other cellular sources. Our observation that MC stabilization also promotes modestly increased viremia, at least when used in an immunocompromised mouse model where virus replication cannot be effectively controlled, also appears to support the contrasting role of MCs in the effective containment of DENV infection (<a href=\"#bib45\">St John et al., 2011</a>), occurring in this case independent of interferon responses. Although we do see that viral replication occurs in our WT mouse model over a time course of several days, it is interesting to point out that the mechanism of MC degranulation in response to DENV is not dependent upon intracellular replication of virus (<a href=\"#bib45\">St John et al., 2011</a>). Experimental infection of MCs with DENV is possible in vitro and could potentially occur in vivo where it would likely enhance the cytokine responses to infection; however, MCs appear to directly detect the structure of DENV virus particles during degranulation. When this occurs as an early detection event during cutaneous infection, detection of DENV can be protective for the host, for example, by promoting the recruitment of NK cells and NKT cells into a site of infection to aid in viral clearance (<a href=\"#bib45\">St John et al., 2011</a>). Widespread MC activation may become pathological when viral titers are high on a systemic level and, as in additional pathological contexts, MC responses in the context of systemic infection could reach a point where they become detrimental to the host. In addition to the evidence that direct sensing of DENV structure occurs by MCs (<a href=\"#bib45\">St John et al., 2011</a>), other indirect mechanisms exist for MCs to degranulate in response to pathogens in vivo which could provide additional activating stimuli for MCs during infection. For example, MCs are able to degranulate in response to components of the complement pathway (<a href=\"#bib35\">McLachlan et al., 2003</a>) and complement activation has also been associated with DENV severity and plasma leakage in human patients (<a href=\"#bib32\">Malasit, 1987</a>)."

MCs appear to have highly specific responses to unique viruses and very few viruses have been identified that are capable of causing direct degranulation of MCs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham and St John, 2010</a>). Interestingly, respiratory viruses are primarily thought to not induce direct degranulation of MCs (without antibody sensitization or augmentation of MC responses due to host factors) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham and St John, 2010</a>). This is consistent with our data from non-DENV febrile human patients, most of which had been diagnosed as having respiratory viral infections (<a href=\"#bib30\">Low et al., 2006</a>), where systemic MC activation was not detected in terms of chymase levels. Another virus that was recently recognized to induce MC-degranulation is vaccinia virus, which is not a hemorrhagic virus and is also primarily a cutaneous and not blood borne virus (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). These observations point to a DENV-specificity of the MC response that may be dependent on the ability of virulent DENV to reach systemic titers and elevate MC products in the blood. This may have further implications in the context of related and unrelated viral hemorrhagic fevers and suggests that further investigations are warranted into the role of MCs in hemorrhaging induced by additional viral pathogens."

Since those individuals with the highest levels of MC products during this study also experienced the most clinically severe disease, defined by vascular leakage or hemorrhaging, our data also highlight the possibility of using MC products as biomarkers to identify individuals at highest risk for hemorrhagic complications. Investigating the mechanism of DENV-induced degranulation may also reveal additional targets for blocking MC activation by DENV. For additional pathogens, such as <i>E. coli</i>, unique receptors on MCs have been identified to promote MC activation. Identification of receptors and signaling components involved in the direct activation of MCs by DENV is likely to impact our understanding of both DENV protection and pathology."

Cells were then washed and resuspended in anti-c-kit primary antibody (eBioscience) at a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml and incubated for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C. After washing, the MACS method was used to purify MCs by incubating labeled cells with anti-rat-IgG magnetic beads prior to isolation using LS columns (both from Miltenyi), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Some purified cells were cytospun onto slides and stained to visualize MC morphology. Isolated cells were resuspended in culture medium and either incubated alone, or treated with DENV at an MOI of 5 for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C in a tissue culture incubator. Media containing DENV alone was incubated concurrently for use as a control. To isolate MC supernatants, after incubation, cells were centrifuged to pellet them and a volume equivalent to supernatant from 5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) was applied gently to the trans-well insert for a final volume of 400 \u03bcl. The TER of the endothelial monolayers was measured at baseline, prior to treatment and at 12 or 24 hr after exposure."

Immediately prior to exposing cells to MC \u00b1 DENV supernatants, inhibitors for leukotrienes (montelukast, 10 \u03bcM final concentration; Sigma) or chymase (Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor, 100 \u03bcM final concentration and Chymostatin, 30 \u03bcM final concentration; both from Sigma) were added to trans-wells.

It is important to note that it was previously reported that the patients in this study were not more likely to develop DHF with secondary infection [1]. Heightened mast cell activation could be due to dose-dependent responses to antigen (in this case, virus) or due to other mechanisms resulting in sensitization of mast cells (such as the presence of antigen-specific IgE), or other mechanisms prompting mast cell activation. Interestingly, rather than observing high virus titers concurrently with high levels of mast cell activation, we see the opposite. For DHF patients but not DF patients, heightened mast cell products in the serum are strongly correlated with a decline in detectable virus genome copies in the serum. This could point to the dual role mast cells play in both immune protection and immune pathology. Perhaps the enhanced activation of mast cells reduces the virus titer but also contributes to vascular leakage in DHF patients. This point has been discussed in the main text, as suggested by the reviewers."

It is possible that in that system the role of TNF and virus replication is enhanced. This may indicate that TNF is a particularly important mediator if the host does not adequately contain viral replication. Certainly, humans experience a more prolonged infection than WT mice and it is possible that different mediators contribute to varying extents along the time course of infection."

Based on this trend and the data in Figure 5b in the context of immunocompromised mice, it may be that mast cells still have a role in immune protection from dengue virus with i.p. inoculation but, conversely, it also appears that mast cell stabilization does not have widespread detrimental immunosuppressive effects. The limitations to their contributions in dengue clearance in mice could potentially be because we have given a systemic infection, bypassing the stages of progression where MCs are important for peripheral immunosurveillence and, thus, bypassing many of their functions. Since there is a slight increase in pfu equivalents that is not significant, a potential remains that at certain inoculating doses or time points, a significant increase in titer would be perceivable even in wild type mice that are immunocompetent. The dual role in protection and pathology for mast cells revealed in both mouse models here and in our previous studies [3] has implications for human infection as well, as discussed in response to the next question."

In the context of human infection, the incubation period for dengue virus between inoculation and the onset of clinical symptoms is around 3 days, minimally, with an average of just under 6 days [2]. We have shown previously that mast cells are key to the initial immune-surveillance for dengue virus, which should occur in the skin just subsequent to the injection of virus particles [3]. Mast cells are also important for promoting the initiation of adaptive immune responses in local draining lymph nodes [4]. Based on our understanding of the kinetics of localized inflammatory and adaptive immune responses, these localized mast cell-accelerated processes that limit early replication and promote adaptive immune responses should have been initiated even before the onset of symptoms that occurs \u22653 days after exposure. Increasingly, we understand that localized responses of mast cells to pathogens are protective, but pathological mast cell activation can result from widespread or systemic triggering of mast cells. We agree that treatment too early with mast cell stabilizers could be detrimental and it might be counter-active to test mast cell stabilizers as a preventative treatment before dengue diagnosis or with possible exposure. We would hypothesize that testing of mast cell activators at the time of dengue diagnosis, which is generally after the onset of fever and after the development of systemic infection, would be a promising strategy to limit overwhelming systemic activation of mast cells while allowing the early and protective mast cell responses to occur without hindrance."
