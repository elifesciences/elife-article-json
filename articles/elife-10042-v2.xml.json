Despite recent advances characterising one of these populations, the neuromesodermal progenitors, their nature and relationship to other populations remains unclear. Here we show that neuromesodermal progenitors are a single Sox2<sup>low</sup>T<sup>low</sup> entity whose choice of neural or mesodermal fate is dictated by their position in the progenitor region. The choice of mesoderm fate is Wnt/\u03b2-catenin dependent. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling is also required for a previously unrecognised phase of progenitor expansion during mid-trunk formation. Lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors represent a distinct committed state that is unable to differentiate to neural fates, even upon overexpression of the neural transcription factor Sox2. They do not require Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling for mesoderm differentiation. This information aids the correct interpretation of <i>in vivo</i> genetic studies and the development of in vitro protocols for generating physiologically-relevant cell populations of clinical interest."

Despite recent advances characterising one of these populations, the neuromesodermal progenitors, their nature and relationship to other populations remains unclear. Here we show that neuromesodermal progenitors are a single Sox2<sup>low</sup>T<sup>low</sup> entity whose choice of neural or mesodermal fate is dictated by their position in the progenitor region. The choice of mesoderm fate is Wnt/\u03b2-catenin dependent. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling is also required for a previously unrecognised phase of progenitor expansion during mid-trunk formation. Lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors represent a distinct committed state that is unable to differentiate to neural fates, even upon overexpression of the neural transcription factor Sox2. They do not require Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling for mesoderm differentiation. This information aids the correct interpretation of <i>in vivo</i> genetic studies and the development of in vitro protocols for generating physiologically-relevant cell populations of clinical interest."

Population fate maps at early somite stages have identified two regions of dual neurectoderm and mesoderm fate: the dorsal layer of the bilayered Node-Streak Border (NSB) and the Caudal Lateral Epiblast (CLE) on either side of the PS. The NSB also gives rise to the majority of the neuromesoderm-fated chordoneural hinge (CNH) in the tail bud (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cambray and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2007</a>).

This suggests that NMP maintenance is intimately linked with preserving a balance between neurectoderm and mesoderm production. <i>Tbx6</i> expression in the midline PS represses <i>Sox2</i> in mesoderm-fated cells, ensuring suppression of the neural transcription program (<a href=\"#bib48\">Takemoto et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, in zebrafish, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation influences the decision of cells in both gastrula- and somite-stage embryos to enter neural or mesodermal lineages (<a href=\"#bib35\">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</a>). More recently, lineage-tracing experiments showed that conditional deletion of Wnt3a or \u03b2-catenin in the T<sup>+</sup> cell compartment leads to a switch of primitive streak progenitors towards a neural fate (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garriock et al., 2015</a>). However, constitutive Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity in the T<sup>+</sup> cell compartment is not sufficient to divert all neural progenitors to mesoderm fates: providing cells in the caudal progenitor region with a stabilised form of \u03b2-catenin results in an enlarged PSM domain, but does not lead to loss of neural cell production (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aulehla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jurberg et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, enhanced \u03b2-catenin activity does not necessarily compromise the presence of NMPs in the CLE (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garriock et al., 2015</a>). While these experiments point to an important role of Wnt signalling in axial progenitors, the promoters used do not specifically target NMPs. Grafting of precise NMP areas can provide a complementary approach that allows a direct assessment of the currently unresolved roles of Wnt signalling in NMPs and the caudal-most CLE."

We find that NMPs are committed to neuromesodermal lineages and choose between retention as progenitors, and differentiation as either neurectoderm or mesoderm based on their location within the progenitor region; the latter choice is \u03b2-catenin dependent. We show that NMPs express low levels of T and Sox2, and that during mid-trunk formation, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling expands the number of Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> NMPs and maintains the appropriate level of T in the NMP population. We further show that lateral/ventral mesoderm progenitors are exclusively mesoderm-committed yet show plasticity within the mesoderm lineage, and respond to distinct signalling and transcription factor cues from those that govern NMPs."

In contrast, E8.5 (2\u20136 somite) grafts gave rise to smaller tissue masses containing only well-differentiated tissues and no EC cells. NSB, CLE (L1-3) and most (4/5) CNH grafts gave rise only to neural and mesodermal derivatives, although one CNH graft included keratinised epithelium, possibly through contamination from neighbouring specified surface ectoderm cells.

At E8.5 the expression of Sox2 transcripts and protein was strong in the differentiating neurectoderm, and weaker in the CLE, while T expression in the CLE was most prominent caudally in the PS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). During trunk and tail formation, Sox2/T coexpression persisted in the CNH and surrounding areas (E9.5\u201313.5; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">9Ca\u2013c</a>). At E13.5, just before elongation had ceased, a few Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells could still be detected, whereas once axial elongation was complete, Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells had disappeared. At E14.5, T expression was detected in the caudal notochord, while Sox2 expression was absent, consistent with the absence of the NT by this stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Using a <i>Cited1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></i>-labelling system (tracing mesodermal and hindgut lineages), Garriock et al. found that some ingressed PS cells behave similarly to cells in the epiblast when <i>Wnt3a</i> is lost (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garriock et al., 2015</a>), implying that some Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells in the PS might retain NMP potential during early mesoderm differentiation. Interestingly, at E8.5, the numbers of Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells were highest in L1, declining towards L3. Furthermore, the medial CLE contained more Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells than lateral CLE ( <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bc\u2013f</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4A</a>). Together with the graded rostral-to-caudal decline in Sox2 and increase in T, these results suggest cellular heterogeneity within the CLE."

In chick, the exact location in the node influences cell fate. To test whether exact position within the NSB could predict neural versus mesodermal contribution, we grafted L1-3 cells to the rostral, middle, or caudal aspects of the NSB (Br, Bm or Bc respectively; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>.

In contrast to the previous series, these grafts produced distinct and reproducible patterns of labelled cell distribution (<i>embryos 6.01\u20136.21</i>). Rostral CLE cells placed in either Br or Bm tended to contribute entirely, or predominantly, to neural tube, while grafts to Bc resulted in a high proportion of embryos with mesoderm-only contribution. In several embryos, the position within the NSB reversed the predicted fate bias of L1 towards neural and L2-3 towards mesodermal fates: 5/5 L2-3-to-Br grafts contributed to the NT, while <i>embryo 6.21</i>, an L1 graft, gave rise exclusively to mesoderm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Thus our data indicate that assignment of rostral CLE cells to neural or mesodermal fates is dependent on environmental cues, with no detectable cell-intrinsic biases.

Therefore, although they were able to enter the notochord domain, they were unable to differentiate correctly, suggesting that E8.5 NMPs are not notochord progenitors. This is consistent with fate mapping studies indicating that the posterior notochord is derived from nodal positive cells in the mesoderm adjacent to the node (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brennan et al., 2002</a>) and that convergent extension is the main driver of notochord extension at early somite stages (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yamanaka et al., 2007</a>).

Conditional deletion of Wnt3a or \u03b2-catenin in the T-expressing population, followed by lineage tracing, has confirmed that, in mouse, \u03b2-catenin is required for mesoderm differentiation in PS/TB cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Garriock et al., 2015</a>). However the above study does not directly address the role of \u03b2-catenin in NMPs, which form a subset of the T<sup>+</sup> population.

We utilised embryos carrying a conditional (floxed) <i>\u03b2-catenin</i> mutation, a conditionally active (floxed stop) <i>GFP</i> marker and a ubiquitously expressed tamoxifen-inducible <i>Cre</i> transgene (termed here <i>\u03b2catCKO:sGFP</i>), which delete \u03b2-catenin and activate <i>silent GFP (sGFP)</i> upon 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

Graft-derived cells in the PXM correctly expressed Pax3, while those in the NT expressed neural markers (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>), showing that \u03b2-catenin deletion does not preclude either neural or mesoderm differentiation after cells have exited from the NMP compartment. Thus, the decision of NMPs to form mesoderm depends absolutely on \u03b2-catenin, and in its absence, cells differentiate to neural derivatives."

T immunostaining intensity per cell was subdivided into five levels, quantitated and plotted on the reconstructed 3D scaffold (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>). The number of cells expressing all but the highest levels of T was significantly reduced in 4-OHT-treated <i>\u03b2catCKO</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), whereas the T<sup>-</sup> fraction was significantly increased. Moreover, levels of T protein were dramatically downregulated in the area containing <i>\u03b2catCKO</i> NMPs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Ga,Ga\u201d\u201d,Ga\u201d\u2019,Gc,Gc\u201d\u201d and Gc\u201d\u2019</a>), as well as in their descendants in the PSM (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Ga,Ga\u2019,Ga\u201d,Gc,Gc\u2019 and Gc\u201d</a>). Interestingly, the LPMP-derived ventral mesoderm of the cloaca of \u03b2-catenin-depleted embryos still retained higher levels of T compared to the PSM (compare <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Ga\u201d\u201d and Gc\u201d\u201d</a>). Thus, Wnt signalling is required for NMP expansion, at least in part through the maintenance of T. Moreover, our data suggests the maintenance of T in LPMPs and their descendants is less dependent on \u03b2-catenin. Therefore, LPMPs may represent an alternative, \u03b2-catenin-independent route towards mesoderm formation."

In this location, L/St5 cells contributed robustly to both PXM and LVM. Similar to homotopic St1 grafts, L/St5 to St1-3 grafts contributed to the TBM but not CNH (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10Aa\u2013e</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Cambray and Wilson (2007</a>)).

We did not observe obvious differences in the mediolateral distribution of PXM descendants in any of the L/St5 grafts (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Thus, \u03b2-catenin is not required for L/St5 cells to undergo mesoderm differentiation. To determine whether L/St5 progenitors are capable of forming neural tissue using regional cues similarly to the rostral CLE, we grafted L/St5 cells to the rostral border (<i>embryos 8.01\u20138.09</i>). All L/St5 to Br grafts showed exclusively mesodermal contribution except for a small patch in the NT of one embryo (<i>embryo 8.03</i>; <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10Ak\u2013o,C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Our immunohistochemical analysis shows that Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup>cells are found in all NMP-containing regions: the NSB, rostral CLE, and the ectoderm of the CNH during throughout axis elongation, and are undetectable once somitogenesis ceases, suggesting they are associated with NMP activity. Therefore, are Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup>cells equivalent to NMPs? Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup>cells are found at low frequency in regions not expected to be NM potent: the E8.5 midline primitive streak, the region caudal to the CNH at E10.5, the hindgut and notochord (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cambray and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McGrew et al., 2008</a>). Conversely, the rostro-lateral CLE (L1-2lat) is NM potent but contains very few Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup>cells. Importantly, however, <i>T</i> transcripts extend more laterally in the epiblast than protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wilson et al. (1995</a>)), suggesting that Llat may already be poised to accumulate T protein. We demonstrate that the levels of T and Sox2 correlate precisely with likelihood of mesodermal and neural fate respectively, while NMPs are excluded from high-expressing areas (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Moreover, the level of T in NMPs is significantly reduced when the capacity for mesodermal differentiation is lost in <i>\u03b2catCKO</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>). Finally, Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells first appear at late neural plate stage, several hours before pluripotency is lost in the epiblast (<a href=\"#bib41\">Osorno et al., 2012</a>).

This increase is similar to the 2.4-fold increase in number of Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells during this period (960 \u00b1 85 versus 2338 \u00b1 176; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, in vitro data shows that single positive T<sup>+</sup> and Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells can be derived from Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsakiridis and Wilson, 2015</a>), and cell clusters comprising 60\u201380% Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells derived from pluripotent populations in vitro contribute to neural and mesoderm lineages when engrafted in the E8.5 embryo (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gouti et al., 2014</a>). Taken together, this indicates that this marker combination is useful for prospectively identifying NMPs both in vivo and in vitro."

This is consistent with single-cell labelling experiments HH4-9 chick embryos, which show that very few cells in the node region are fated solely for neural tube (<a href=\"#bib44\">Selleck and Stern, 1991</a>). Clonal analysis in the mouse shows that medium-length mesoderm-only clones outnumber neuromesodermal clones (50 in mesoderm vs 8 NM; (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</a>). Since the volume of differentiated paraxial mesoderm is always greater than that of the neurectoderm, the overproduction of mesoderm relative to neurectoderm may begin to be implemented in the primitive streak/tail bud region in the NMPs themselves. Together with the correlation between the mid-trunk expansion of NMPs and the size of the somites (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tam, 1981</a>), this implies that regulation of NMP proliferation/survival and differentiation may begin the process of determining the final proportions of neurectoderm and mesoderm in the embryonic axis."

A decline in <i>Wnt3a</i> expression in the elongating tail (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cambray and Wilson, 2007</a>) occurs in tandem with the gradual loss of Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> cells. Therefore it is likely that Wnt signalling is required for NMP maintenance. This suggests that the short axis of mutants with lowered Wnt3a levels (<a href=\"#bib28\">Greco et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Takada et al., 1994</a>) is due to a failure to maintain NMPs. Since, we show that T is dramatically downregulated in the caudal epiblast when \u03b2-catenin is depleted, (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>), this raises the possibility that T is necessary for NMP maintenance. Interestingly, a recent study (<a href=\"#bib21\">Denans et al., 2015</a>) shows that posterior <i>Hox</i> gene activation in chick leads to downregulation of Wnt signalling, and of <i>T</i> expression, slowing of cell ingression from the ectoderm layer and shortening of the PSM. The equivalent late axial elongation period in mouse begins around the trunk/tail transition (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gomez et al., 2008</a>), when the number of NMPs begins to decline.

Here we show that, when \u03b2-catenin is deleted, Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> NMPs are significantly reduced in number, but are not completely eliminated from the caudal region. Taken together, these results show that elevated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling alone is not enough to commit NMPs to a mesoderm fate, but its absence is sufficient to block mesoderm differentiation. This implicates additional signalling pathway(s) in driving NMPs towards mesoderm formation. Moreover, despite the requirement for Wnt signalling in expanding NMP numbers, at least some NMPs can tolerate both elevated and reduced levels of Wnt signalling, at least for short (24\u201348\u2009hr) periods."

Nuclear \u03b2-catenin staining in the zebrafish tail bud has shown that canonical Wnt signalling is only moderately active in NMPs and high in early differentiating mesodermal cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bouldin et al., 2015</a>). Since <i>Wnt3a</i> is expressed uniformly in the E8.5 caudal region (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cambray and Wilson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Takada et al., 1994</a>), it is unlikely that localisation of Wnt3a itself can provide the specificity to direct mesoderm formation from NMPs. It is therefore possible that Wnt modulators might provide this signal. R-spondin3, an extracellular Wnt activator, is transcribed in the PSM (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kazanskaya et al., 2004</a>) and has recently been shown to drive pluripotent cells towards skeletal muscle derivatives in vitro (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chal et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, the ability to both maintain progenitors and permit their differentiation may lie in its coordination with other signalling pathways. Fgf signalling, as well as steroid biogenesis and chondroitin sulphate biosynthesis were identified as differentially regulated between NMPs and committed neural progenitors in chick (<a href=\"#bib40\">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2014</a>), and it remains to be seen whether these play a role in coordinating the balance between neural and mesoderm differentiation in all vertebrates. There also appear to be temporal differences in cell responses to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling. The data presented here and shown by Martin and Kimelman (<a href=\"#bib35\">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</a>) shows that prospective neurectoderm can be re-fated to mesoderm.

Together with the inability of forced Sox2 expression to direct integration in the NT, our results indicate that LPMPs are regulated differently from NMPs. We also show that LPMPs can participate in PXM production, consistent with clonal data showing that mesoderm-restricted clones can contribute to both PXM and LVM (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</a>).

Despite the structural aberrations in <i>\u03b2catCKO</i> embryos, the level of T in the notochord is far less affected compared to other tail bud domains (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Gd</a>), suggesting T expression is uncoupled from Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling in these cells. Notochordal cells are found close to NMPs in the NSB but not in the CLE, arguing against the idea that the presence of the notochord environment is absolutely essential for NMP identity.

Dissected PS regions shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, corresponding to about 100\u2013150 cells were dissected and grafted as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cambray and Wilson, 2007</a>) with the exception that for CLE dissection, underlying mesoderm was manually dissected away from the ectoderm using hand-pulled solid glass needles. Since the L5 region is small, we could not exclude that a part of the midline (St5) was included in L5 grafts. Therefore, this region is termed L/St5. An overview of all grafting experiments is shown in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>. In homotopic grafts, L1-3 cells often colonised a short stretch of rostral\u00a0somites unilaterally on the grafted side. In more caudal sections of the axis, somite contribution in L1AT, L2-3 and L1-2med homotopic grafts were\u00a0often bilateral (17/21 grafts). Therefore, it seems some of the grafted cells are able to encroach on the midline and produce mesoderm. In contrast, most L1AT and L2lat homotopic grafts (6/8 grafts) colonised the paraxial mesoderm to one side only (see also <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Importantly, unilateral PXM contribution might have arisen from pre-existing presomitic mesoderm that was co-grafted along with the NMPs of the CLE. This is likely not to be the case for the majority of the PXM contribution observed (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). We estimated this presomitic mesoderm contamination to be less than 20% of the total section number. In addition, bilateral PXM contribution is present in almost all homotopic CLE grafts, indicating that cells must have encountered the midline PS at some point in their history (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nicolas et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Eloy-Trinquet and Nicolas, 2002</a>), despite being grafted lateral to the streak (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). The bilateral PXM contribution of most grafts also argues that most grafted cells are derived from CLE, which experiences a net movement towards the midline PS, while PSM progenitors would normally move away from it (<a href=\"#bib42\">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Voiculescu et al., 2007</a>). Thus, the bulk of the PXM contribution in CLE grafts has most likely descended from NMPs rather than from pre-existing PSM progenitors. To verify grafted cell locations, embryos were imaged immediately following grafting in a fluorescent dissecting microscope (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9A</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">10A and F</a>)."

For some samples, the brightness and/or contrast was increased in the blue channel (DAPI) to enhance weakly fluorescing nuclei, using ImageJ (imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The best parameters for nuclear segmentation were defined in cropped regions of greyscale DAPI z-stacks using FARSIGHT v0.4.5 software (<a href=\"http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Nuclear_Segmentation\">www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Nuclear_Segmentation</a>). These defined parameters were used on all original greyscale DAPI z-stacks and resulted in a segmented images (in the blue field), in which each nuclear volume could be identified by a unique greyscale-based identifier (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Kofahi et al., 2010</a>). The segmented blue field (DAPI) was then overlaid with the red (Sox2) and far red (T) field. Single-cell fluorescence quantification and 3D rendering was performed using a software program, designed by GB (manuscript in preparation; for more information, see <a href=\"#bib19\">Davies et al. (2013)</a>). The nuclear debris size (the minimum size below which a \u2018nucleus\u2019 identified by the segmentation algorithm is too small to be real and is therefore considered as debris in the analysis) was set as nuclear volume \u22642000 pixels. Initially, a threshold of detection was set for both fields using four internal controls for each individual sample. These controls were cropped and saved from the original z-stack to have (a) only Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells, (b) only T<sup>+</sup> cells, (c) both Sox2 or T single positive cells and (d) neither Sox2 nor T positivity within the region of interest (ROI). The threshold for Sox2 and T positivity was defined by comparing how accurately the obtained quantification result could predict the expected values for each ROI (pre-set as clearly separated or negative for both factors). The same software package and parameters were then used to analyse the sample. The statistical significance between developmental stages and Sox2/T fractions were tested with a standard unpaired Student's t-test, using Prism v6.0 software (GraphPad,\u00a0La Jolla, CA). To correct for differences in image acquisition, especially those at greater optical depths (e.g. image acquisition was optimised to capture the Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> population in E9.5 tails), an additional Welch correction was carried out to compare Sox2/T populations, though it did not alter the statistical significance; p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significant (*, p-value&lt;0.05; **, p-value&lt;0.0001; ns, not significantly different)."

This resulted in a segmented image that was processed as before. Six different embryonic regions were cropped from two different confocal stacks (in E8.5 and E10.5 samples) and their segmentation was compared for both methods. The degree of error at E8.5 is 15% (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and 18% in E10.5 samples (n\u00a0=\u00a02 regions). Our automated segmentation thus provides a reasonably accurate measure of the number of nuclei in any region of interest.

This complements developmental genetic approaches to target such cell populations and uncovers several important new findings. The work carefully documents Sox2 and T expression and co-expression (a potential indicator of neuromesodermal progenitor identity) during development and correlates co-expression of these proteins with contribution to both neural and mesodermal lineages. They further show that CLE fates are plastic; for example, rostral CLE although fated to be largely neural can make mesoderm when transplanted medially into the node streak border (NSB). Furthermore, variability in fates from such grafting can be further mapped to the precise position within the NSB into which the grafts are placed \u2013 allowing the authors to conclude that there is no localized potency within the epiblast regions and that cell fates depend on environmental cues, which must be regionally distributed in the NSB. These are useful new data for the field, which help define the neuromesodermal progenitor cell population through development and elucidate how it is regulated."

However, the authors provide here further important detail of the involvement of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, demonstrating a requirement for expansion of the neuromesodermal progenitor pool during axis elongation and the Wnt-independent generation of paraxial mesoderm by more caudally located primitive streak cells."

However, Jurberg et al. 2014 use not only T-Cre but a further line driving expression in the epiblast (as well as mesoderm) via a Cdx2 enhancer, which appears to allow an earlier test of function in the CLE. Importantly, this work reveals a severe phenotype that affects generation of neural and to some extent mesodermal progenitors, when Wnt3a is over-expressed. In addition, Wnt3a deletion using a T-Cre line (which is shown to drive expression in cells that make neural tissue as well as mesoderm) (Garriock et al. 2015) shows very a similar requirement for mesoderm differentiation to grafting experiments reported here. These works need to be mentioned further in the Introduction and in the Discussion their data and interpretation should be discussed in detail along with conclusions from the authors' experiments."

This is important for their claim that their grafting experiments with \u03b2-catenin mutant tissue represent a test of requirement specifically in NMPs (subsection \u201cWnt/\u03b2-catenin Signalling is required for Mesodermal Fate in NMPs\u201d)."

Although I can see their logic here this \"contaminating\" mesoderm rather undermines the grafting approach; to get a sense of the accuracy, can the authors state the number of grafts placed laterally that are mesoderm free? Can they improve this? Is it also possible that grafting into the epiblast layer (though the mesoderm?) leads to grafted epiblast cells being misplaced in the mesoderm? Is this apparent using a fluorescence-dissecting microscope?"

There is some literature on notochord progenitor cell populations that could be discussed here (e.g. Yamanaka et al. 2007). This further relates to use of the term CNH and significance of the few Sox2/T positive cells in the region at the caudal tip of the notochord \u2013 as these seem unlikely to contribute to the notochord.

They compared two transgenic lines: a <i>T-Cre: del<sup><i>(ex3)/-</i></sup></i>(a conditionally active \u03b2-catenin allele) and a <i>Cdx2P-Wnt3a</i> overexpressing transgene. The authors argue that the epiblast expression of the latter is responsible for its more severe phenotype. However, this is not a like-for-like comparison. The expression of activated \u03b2-catenin in descendants of T-expressing cells in <i>T-Cre:c del<sup>(ex3)/-</sup></i>embryos or the difference between expressing a ligand, Wnt3a, and one of its downstream effectors, \u03b2-catenin, may account for aspects of the differences in phenotype. Moreover, there is expression of <i>T-Cre</i> in the epiblast, as shown by Perantoniet al. (Development 2007).

However, constitutive Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity in the T<sup>+</sup> cell compartment is not sufficient to divert all neural progenitors to mesoderm fates: providing cells in the caudal progenitor region with a stabilised form of \u03b2-catenin results in an enlarged PSM domain, but does not lead to loss of neural cell production (Aulehla, 2008; Jurberg, 2014). Moreover, enhanced \u03b2-catenin activity does not necessarily compromise the presence of NMPs in the CLE (Garriock, 2015). While these experiments point to an important role of Wnt signalling in axial progenitors, the promoters used do not specifically target NMPs. Grafting of precise NMP areas can provide a complementary approach that allows a direct assessment of the currently unresolved roles of Wnt signalling in NMPs and the caudal-most CLE.\u201d"

Providing the T<sup>+</sup> caudal region with a stabilised form of \u03b2-catenin, or overexpressing Wnt3a in T<sup>+</sup> or Cdx2<sup>+</sup> progenitors, results in an enlarged PSM domain (Aulehla, 2008; Jurberg, 2014; Garriock, 2015) but not an obvious reduction in Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> NMPs in the CLE (Garriock, 2015). However in the converse experiment, when Wnt3a was deleted in the T<sup>+</sup> caudal region, it was not clear to what extent Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> NMPs were affected (Garriock, 2015). Here we show that, when \u03b2-catenin is deleted, Sox2<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup> NMPs are significantly reduced in number, but are not completely eliminated from the caudal region. Taken together, these results show that elevated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling alone is not enough to commit NMPs to a mesoderm fate, but its absence is sufficient to block mesoderm differentiation. This implicates additional signalling pathway(s) in driving NMPs towards mesoderm formation. Moreover, despite the requirement for Wnt signalling in expanding NMP numbers, at least some NMPs can tolerate both elevated and reduced levels of Wnt signalling, at least for short (24-48 hour) periods.\u201d"
