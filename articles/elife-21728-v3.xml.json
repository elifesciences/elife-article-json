Using an approach to map DNA replication at high resolution in <i>C. elegans</i>, we show that replication origins are marked with specific histone modifications that define gene enhancers. We demonstrate that the level of enhancer associated modifications scale with the efficiency at which the origin is utilized. By mapping replication origins at different developmental stages, we show that the positions and activity of origins is largely invariant through embryogenesis. Contrary to expectation, we find that replication origins are specified prior to the broad onset of zygotic transcription, yet when transcription initiates it does so in close proximity to the pre-defined replication origins. Transcription and DNA replication origins are correlated, but the association breaks down when embryonic cell division ceases. Collectively, our data indicate that replication origins are fundamental organizers and regulators of gene activity through embryonic development."

Using an approach to map DNA replication at high resolution in <i>C. elegans</i>, we show that replication origins are marked with specific histone modifications that define gene enhancers. We demonstrate that the level of enhancer associated modifications scale with the efficiency at which the origin is utilized. By mapping replication origins at different developmental stages, we show that the positions and activity of origins is largely invariant through embryogenesis. Contrary to expectation, we find that replication origins are specified prior to the broad onset of zygotic transcription, yet when transcription initiates it does so in close proximity to the pre-defined replication origins. Transcription and DNA replication origins are correlated, but the association breaks down when embryonic cell division ceases. Collectively, our data indicate that replication origins are fundamental organizers and regulators of gene activity through embryonic development."

Within <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Xenopus</i>, the onset of zygotic transcription is accompanied by a marked increase in S phase length, caused by a reduction in the number of replication initiation events, rather than changes in the rate of replication fork progression (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blumenthal et al., 1974</a>). Numerous studies in metazoa have found particular chromatin signatures that typify transcriptionally active chromatin are enriched at replication initiation sites and also influence the relative time in S phase that origins are active (<a href=\"#bib17\">MacAlpine and Almouzni, 2013</a>). Yet a specific signature within chromatin that marks distinct sites in a genome where replication initiates has not been identified (<a href=\"#bib26\">Urban et al., 2015</a>)."

By sequencing Okazaki fragments we, and others, have provided high-resolution maps of DNA replication across budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib18\">McGuffee et al., 2013</a>) and human genomes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Petryk et al., 2016</a>). One advantage of sequencing Okazaki fragments is that replication signatures can be deduced from a population of cells growing at steady state. Thus, providing that Okazaki fragments can be harvested in sufficient quantity, DNA replication can be mapped in cells, tissues or organisms without need for synchronization (<a href=\"#bib24\">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</a>)."

As <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> shows, there is a remarkable concordance between the location of replication origins and acetylation of histone H3 and methylation of H3 at lysine 4 (K4). Analyzing H3 K27ac (H3 K4me2 is near identical), we find that 75% of efficient origins (&gt;30% efficiency) are within 1 kb of the histone mark and most H3 K27ac peaks overlap origins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

By surveying the abundance of various modifications present at replication origins, we tested whether other modifications behaved similarly to H3K27ac (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>); this revealed that acetylation of H3 at K18, K23, K27 and dimethylation of H3 at K4 are not only present at origins, but the level of modification increases according to origin efficiency.

In this scenario, replication origins become defined once zygotic transcription has initiated; DNA replication in pre-gastrula embryos (PG), where transcription is limited and non essential (<a href=\"#bib21\">Robertson and Lin, 2015</a>), would presumably initiate from many, seemingly random sites \u2013 much like the apparent situation in <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> embryos prior to the Mid Blastula Transition (MBT). To investigate this, we harvested pre-gastrula embryos from a hyperactive egg laying strain (PG: median 9, mean 13 cells/embryo, n\u00a0=\u00a050; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and late embryos from wild-type worms (L:\u00a0~200\u2013558 cells/embryo), which represent different levels and extent of gene expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We compared origin location and efficiency for each population and found that the patterns of replication were highly similar (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) \u2013 especially for the most efficient origins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Evidently, even though gene transcription is fundamentally altered through this time course, replication origin usage is globally similar through early development. Thus, the establishment of specific replication origins in <i>C. elegans</i> occurs prior to the broad onset of zygotic transcription \u2013 meaning that the replication origins we define are unlikely to be dependent upon transcription. This finding is in keeping with data showing that isolated embryonic cells treated with \u03b1-amanitin divide normally up to approximately 100 cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Edgar et al., 1994</a>). Indeed, S phase length, lineage-specific cell cycle timing, asymmetric cell division and cleavage patterns all proceed normally in the absence of transcription in pre-gastrula early embryos (<a href=\"#bib21\">Robertson and Lin, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Edgar and McGhee, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Edgar et al., 1994</a>)."

                        "text": "Coupling of DNA replication with gene enhancers within rapidly dividing embryonic cells likely imposes particular constraints upon genome duplication. S phase in pre-gastrula embryonic cells ranges from\u00a0~10\u00a0to\u00a025 min, depending on the lineage (<a href=\"#bib8\">Edgar and McGhee, 1988</a>). In an ideal system, where all origins fire in each S phase (100% efficiency), complete genome duplication could be achieved in\u00a0~15 min if origins are uniformly spaced every\u00a0~75 kb and replication forks progress at 2.5 kb/min. We find that the median origin spacing is\u00a0~40 kb (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which reflects that not all origins are fired within each S phase. Given that DNA replication appears to initiate at enhancers, the requirement for closely spaced origins to achieve timely genome duplication would seemingly constrain the positions of enhancers across the genome. Thus, enhancers, and the genes they regulate, may be organized to facilitate the execution of the DNA replication and transcription programs in rapidly dividing embryonic cells. To investigate this, we first performed a gene ontology analysis of genes at varying distances from replication origins: this revealed that genes whose products are involved growth, embryonic development, cell cycle, gene expression, and chromatin are clustered near replication origins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, we compared origins with the whole embryo transcriptome time series derived from individual embryos from the one-cell stage through hatching (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hashimshony et al., 2015</a>). For each of the 50 time points, we removed maternally derived transcripts and plotted the sum of normalized transcript levels for each gene relative to the midpoint of replication origins. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, transcript abundance accumulates through the early time points with no apparent trends in the data; but, beginning at time point\u00a0~9 and coincident with gastrulation, there is an apparent clustering of actively transcribed genes near replication origins. The association of transcription with origins spans to time point\u00a0~25 and broadly scales according with origin efficiency (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Beyond time point 25, the association breaks down; yet, as gene expression changes, the pattern evolves such that from time point 40 onwards, sites of active transcription now appear anti-correlated with replication origins. As we have shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, replication origins are defined prior to the onset of global zygotic gene activation, yet <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> reveals that when the genome becomes broadly transcriptionally active, transcription generally occurs in close proximity to the pre-defined origins. At time point 25, which is\u00a0~300 min into embryogenesis, transcription begins to shift away from the origins, and by 500 min, peak transcription occurs some 15\u201325 kb from the origin. Since the median spacing between origins is 40 kb, the shift in transcription late in embryogenesis ensures that gene transcription is as far removed as possible from sites of replication initiation. The alteration in transcription that occurs after\u00a0~300 min is coincident with ventral enclosure and has been shown previously to underlie a developmental milestone wherein the \u2018morphogenesis\u2019 transcriptome is activated (<a href=\"#bib15\">Levin et al., 2012</a>). Given the close association between replication origins and expressed genes, we considered whether global alterations in the transcriptome may be related to origin activity. Thus, we compared the origin/transcript profiles with a time course that measured living nuclei per embryo during embryogenesis from Sulston et al (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sulston et al., 1983</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Significantly, the shift of transcription from origins that begins at\u00a0~300 min is coincident with the completion of the last wave of cell division that occurs within the embryo \u2013 indicating that the inactivation of replication origins may be coupled with the restructuring of the transcriptome to facilitate post replicative development."

                        "text": "Our finding that replication initiates at specific sites in PG embryos is in marked contrast to the seemingly random patterns observed in the rapid and synchronous cycles in both <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> embryos (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blumenthal et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Callan, 1974</a>). However, early development in <i>C. elegans</i> differs from these organisms: initial cell divisions are asynchronous, and the cell cycle does not slow abruptly near gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bao et al., 2008</a>). Thus, the rapid establishment of the defined replication landscape in <i>C. elegans</i> may be related to the very early stage at which cell lineages are specified. Indeed, several histone modifications, including H3K27ac and H3K4me2, are potentially passaged with the maternal genome and are known to be present in two cell embryos (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arico et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Samson et al., 2014</a>). Replication origins appear to be tied with gene expression: in general terms, origin proximal genes experience the first wave of zygotic transcription and are expressed in replicating cells; origin distal regions encode genes whose transcription is delayed until later in development when DNA replication has ceased. Our results indicate that the <i>C. elegans</i> genome has evolved to couple embryonic transcription with replication; yet, such coupling would appear to impose constraints on a system that needs not only to transcribe a diverse array of genes, but also replicate the\u00a0~100 mb genome in\u00a0~15 min. <i>C. elegans</i> seemingly resolves this issue as follows: first, replication origins appear to be co-localized with gene enhancers which can activate transcription of genes at a distance; second, genes required for cell division and early development are clustered near replication origins (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Such association is likely to be functionally important in rapidly cycling cells with limited gap phases: most obviously, genes near to origins such as histones, will be replicated at the start of S phase and have a higher effective copy number than those further away. Relatedly, the passage of the replication fork may trigger genes to be reactivated that were presumably repressed during mitosis; thus ensuring replication-transcription conflicts do not occur. Finally, the inactivation of replication origins may serve as a trigger to relieve the gene expression program from replication origin-associated spatial constraints \u2013 allowing the expression of genes whose products are required for the many aspects of development that occur in the absence of cell division. The spatiotemporal coupling and uncoupling of gene expression with replication may be a general principal underlying the profound transcriptional and morphological changes that occur during embryogenesis across species: genes expressed early are characterized by proteins involved in proliferation, while those expressed late are typically involved in differentiation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Levin et al., 2016</a>). Separating early and late genes is a comparatively short phase termed the \u2018mid-developmental transition\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Levin et al., 2016</a>); in <i>C. elegans,</i> we find that this transition is coincident with the uncoupling of transcription from replication origins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). It will be of great interest to learn whether this is a ubiquitous feature of the mid-developmental transition across species."

At least one biological replicate was performed for each DNA replication map; Ion Torrent (Proton) generally had a higher background and lower reproducibility than Illumina so direct comparisons between different embryonic stages were made using only the Illumina data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Sequencing reads were mapped to the WS220 genome using Bowtie2 with \u2013local function (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005476\">SCR_005476</a>). Reads with q\u00a0&lt;\u00a030 were removed using Samtools (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002105\">SCR_002105</a>). Remaining reads were binned in 100 bp intervals using Bedtools (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006646\">SCR_006646</a>), maintaining strand identity. Data were partially smoothed by calculating the median with a sliding window of 1.5 kb (<a href=\"#bib22\">Royce et al., 2007</a>). Data were normalized (such that the sum of Watson and Crick reads\u00a0=\u00a01) and positions of origins were mapped using custom program described earlier, using a 12 kb window (<a href=\"#bib18\">McGuffee et al., 2013</a>). Because replication initiates in a broad zone at most origins, we found that the method of McGuffee significantly underestimated the true origin efficiency; therefore, origin efficiencies are defined by the maximum value of normalized reads within 20 kb of the origin. The distance between normalized maxima on the Watson and Crick strands defined the size of transition zone at origins. Histone modification data used in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> were downloaded from ModEncode consortium (<a href=\"http://www.modencode.org/\">http://www.modencode.org/</a>). Regions of ChIP enrichment were calculated using Macs2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) with default parameters. Regions of enrichment were defined as peaks with\u00a0&gt;5 fold enrichment over background. Associations of ChIP peaks with replication origins was calculated using intervalstats (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chikina and Troyanskaya, 2012</a>); replication origins were defined as a 5 kb region centered on the origin midpoint. Transcriptomics data from the whole embryo time course from (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hashimshony et al., 2015</a>) were used in this study. Data for each gene were individually normalized such that the sum of all 50 time points\u00a0=\u00a01. Data were then clustered (unsupervised) and genes with highest transcription within the first five time points were defined as \u2018maternal\u2019 all other expressed genes are defined as \u2018zygotic\u2019."

In this paper, they further develop this technique to map origins in C.elegans. This is an important step forward, and, together with a paper from the Hyrien lab earlier this year using a related approach, represents the first time this technique has been applied to a metazoan. This has great value because this technique has been shown to accurately and sensitively identify origins in budding yeast. For this reason alone the reviewers believe this a significant paper. The authors go on to show that most of the origins used before gastrula are also used later in development. This is in contrast to the well-studied situation in <i>Xenopus</i> and <i>Drosophila</i> development where initiation sites before the mid-blastula transition are dense and poorly defined, perhaps truly random (although random is perhaps a poorly defined concept in this context), and then becomes restricted to specific sites only thereafter. They show that origins co-localise with the potential enhancers of genes expressed through the proliferative stages of development. They show that the position of these replication origins correlates with specific histone marks, and that these origins are active before significant levels of transcription are seen. Finally, they show that the cessation of transcription potentially associated with these cis acting enhancers correlates with the cessation of proliferation. The reviewers all felt that certain key points needed to be addressed before publication and these are listed."

Lois G Edgar, Nurit Wolf and William B. Wood, Development 120, 443-451 (1994). To our knowledge, all previous studies indicate that zygotic transcription is inessential in early rounds of division.
