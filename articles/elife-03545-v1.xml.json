Enteric fever is spread by bacteria belonging to the Salmonella genus, with two sub-species\u2014<i>Salmonella</i> Typhi and <i>Salmonella</i> Paratyphi A\u2014being responsible for most cases of the disease. And although the number of cases of enteric fever has fallen significantly over recent decades, there is a clear need for a diagnostic test for Salmonella that is rapid, affordable and accurate. Moreover, it is important to be able to distinguish between enteric fever caused by <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi and enteric fever caused by <i>Salmonella</i> Paratyphi A in order to ensure that the correct drugs are prescribed and to combat the development of antibiotic resistance."

The current gold standard diagnostic tool for enteric fever is blood culture, but this has a low specificity and it is also challenging to perform consistently in regions with limited resources. As a consequence, misdiagnosis and mistreatment of enteric fever is common, which leads to poor clinical outcomes and the potential spread of antibiotic resistance. The development of nucleic acid and antigen-detection tests to diagnose enteric fever has faced similar challenges, with lower than expected sensitivity and specificity. One explanation for this could be that the levels of Salmonella in the blood tend to be very low at all stages of the disease (<a href=\"#bib2\">Darton et al., 2014</a>)."

Instead of trying to detect Salmonella in the blood during infection, they used a technique called metabolomics. The basic idea of this approach is that infection leads to metabolic changes, such that a person with enteric fever (or any infection) could have a profile of metabolites in their blood that is different to the metabolite profile of a healthy person. The challenge, therefore, is to identify a \u2018metabolic fingerprint\u2019 that can be used to detect enteric fever with high levels of sensitivity and specificity."

Despite this, screening the metabolome in blood plasma has identified useful prognostic profiles of several diseases, including sepsis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Langley et al., 2013</a>). One of the major benefits of this technique is that it utilizes a pattern of biomarkers (that is, the various metabolites), as opposed to relying on just one host biomarker, as has been the focus of previous approaches."

Using a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m et al. identified 695 distinct peaks that were associated with different metabolites: from these they selected six peaks that had significantly different heights in the three groups of patients. This meant that they were able to tell if the patient had <i>S.</i> Typhi, <i>S.</i> Paratyphi A, or neither. That this mass spectrometric analysis was able to distinguish two Salmonella groups that share many similarities is remarkable. Moreover, in addition to its diagnostic potential, this new approach might also provide insights into the antigenic and physiological differences between the two strains."

N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m et al. also acknowledge that they did not perform any external validation, so it is not clear that the six biomarkers they identified will be relevant in other populations. It will be necessary to address these two points in future trials. Lastly, while negative controls were included, an expanded set of all-cause fever samples (that is, samples in which the enteric fever was caused by other organisms) will be needed to determine how well this panel of six biomarkers will perform in a real clinical setting."
