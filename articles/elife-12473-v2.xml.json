These parasites live in the vasculature, producing eggs that spur a variety of chronic, potentially life-threatening, pathologies exacerbated by the long lifespan of schistosomes, that can thrive in the host for decades. How schistosomes maintain their longevity in this immunologically hostile environment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that somatic stem cells in <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> are biased towards generating a population of cells expressing factors associated exclusively with the schistosome host-parasite interface, a structure called the tegument. We show cells expressing these tegumental factors are short-lived and rapidly turned over. We suggest that stem cell-driven renewal of this tegumental lineage represents an important strategy for parasite survival in the context of the host vasculature."

These parasites live in the vasculature, producing eggs that spur a variety of chronic, potentially life-threatening, pathologies exacerbated by the long lifespan of schistosomes, that can thrive in the host for decades. How schistosomes maintain their longevity in this immunologically hostile environment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that somatic stem cells in <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> are biased towards generating a population of cells expressing factors associated exclusively with the schistosome host-parasite interface, a structure called the tegument. We show cells expressing these tegumental factors are short-lived and rapidly turned over. We suggest that stem cell-driven renewal of this tegumental lineage represents an important strategy for parasite survival in the context of the host vasculature."

However, the role these cells play in the biology of the parasites in their mammalian host was unexplored. To decipher the cellular functions of schistosome neoblasts, we compared the short-term and long-term transcriptional consequences for the parasite following neoblast depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>)."

Previously, we demonstrated that many genes down-regulated at 48\u2009hr following irradiation were associated with the schistosome neoblasts (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we reasoned that by comparing the gene expression profiles of parasites shortly after neoblast ablation (48\u2009hr) to parasites two weeks after their neoblasts had been killed, we could characterize the long-term consequences of neoblast depletion. Specifically, we expected genes down-regulated at both early and late time points to be neoblast-enriched factors, whereas genes only down-regulated at later time points would be genes that require neoblasts for maintaining their expression. To add specificity to this dataset, removing genes whose expression could be influenced non-specifically by irradiation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Solana et al., 2012</a>), we also profiled parasite transcriptomes after long-term RNA interference (RNAi) targeting either of two genes required for the maintenance of proliferating neoblasts: <i>fgfrA</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 2013</a>) or <i>histone H2B</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

More importantly, we identified 105 genes that were not down-regulated at D2 post-irradiation but were significantly down regulated (\u22651.25x, p&lt;0.05) at D14 post-irradiation and following RNAi of either <i>fgfrA</i> or <i>histone H2B</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).\u00a0For brevity, we will refer to these 105 genes as delayed irradiation-sensitivity (DIS) genes. We also noted a small class of genes that were modestly down regulated at early time points and highly down regulated after long-term stem cell depletion (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The most striking example of this class was the schistosome orthologue of the planarian <i>p53</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Pearson and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2010</a>), which was down-regulated ~2 fold at 48\u2009hr and nearly 150 fold at D14 post-irradiation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

As anticipated, expression of <i>cathepsin B,</i> a gene expressed in differentiated intestinal cells, was unaffected at either time point (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Conversely, the expression of genes associated with the neoblasts (<i>fgfrA</i> and <i>nanos2</i>) was substantially reduced at D2 and the expression of these genes did not return by D7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), confirming that stem cells are irreversibly depleted by irradiation. Consistent with our RNAseq data, the number of cells expressing <i>p53</i> is modestly reduced at D2 post-irradiation and dramatically reduced by D7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). In contrast to the neoblast-expressed genes and <i>p53</i>, at D2 the number of cells expressing the DIS genes <i>tsp-2, sm13, sm29,</i> and <i>val-8</i> was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). However, by D7 post-irradiation the expression of these genes was severely depleted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). We did note in our RNAseq experiments, and in independent qPCR experiments, a modest increase in <i>val-8</i> mRNA levels 48\u2009hr post-irradiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Since, the number of\u00a0<i>val-8<sup>+</sup></i> cells did not appear to dramatically change at 48\u2009hr post-irradiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), it is possible that some <i>val-8<sup>+</sup></i> cells had elevated levels of the <i>val-8</i> mRNA. To directly examine the relationship between genes expressed in neoblasts and the DIS genes, we performed double fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with <i>histone H2B, p53</i>, and <i>tsp-2</i>. We observed no co-expression of the DIS gene <i>tsp-2</i> with <i>histone H2B</i> <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, suggesting that DIS genes are expressed in a population of cells other than neoblasts. Consistent with our observations following irradiation, we observed that <i>p53</i> was expressed in both the <i>histone H2B<sup>+</sup></i> neoblasts and <i>tsp-2</i><sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The schistosome surface is covered by a continuous syncytial structure, called the tegument (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), which serves as the primary barrier between the parasite and its host. This unique tissue is connected by cytoplasmic bridges to nucleated cell bodies that sit in the mesenchyme, beneath the parasite\u2019s body-wall muscles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Morris and Threadgold, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Wilson and Barnes, 1974</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). To determine if these DIS genes are expressed in a tegument-associated cell population, we performed double FISH experiments. We first examined the distribution of the mRNA for a Tetraspanin, TSP-2, that\u00a0encodes a well-characterized tegument-specific factor (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braschi and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Tran et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Pearson et al., 2012</a>). TSP-2 is currently being explored as an anti-schistosome vaccine candidate due to its presence on the parasite surface (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hotez et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with <i>tsp-2</i> being expressed in a tegument-associated cell population, we found that a majority of <i>tsp-2<sup>+\u00a0</sup></i>cells are located immediately beneath the parasite\u2019s body-wall muscle layer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). To further examine this <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cell population, we performed double FISH with other DIS genes known to encode proteins expressed in the tegument. We observed that DIS genes encoding a panel of known tegumental factors, including <i>sm13</i> (Smp_195190), <i>sm29</i> (Smp_072190), <i>sm25</i> (Smp_195180), an amino acid transporter (Smp_176940) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wilson, 2012</a>), a dysferlin protein (Smp_141010) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braschi and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Wilson, 2012</a>), an endophillin B1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Castro-Borges et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Wilson, 2012</a>), and a cd59-like molecule (Smp_081920) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wilson, 2012</a>) were expressed in a largely overlapping population of cells with <i>tsp-2</i> immediately beneath the dorsal body-wall muscles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>).

We envision two models to explain these observations. First, <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells could represent a relatively long-lived population that requires the continual presence of the somatic neoblasts for their survival. Alternatively, the <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells could be a short-lived cell population that requires a pool of stem cells for its continuous renewal. In the absence of this renewal, the <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells are rapidly depleted. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed pulse-chase experiments with the thymidine analogue EdU (<a href=\"#bib19\">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</a>). This approach allows us to specifically label neoblasts at S-phase and monitor their differentiation over time (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 2013</a>). In these experiments, parasite-infected mice were injected with EdU and the distribution of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells relative to the <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells was monitored every other day for 11 days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). If the <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i>cells are long-lived and turn over slowly, we would anticipate that few <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i>cells would become EdU<sup>+</sup> over the chase period. However, if these cells were renewed rapidly by the neoblasts, we would expect a large fraction of <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells to become EdU<sup>+</sup>. Furthermore, since EdU levels are diluted following cell division, over time differentiating neoblasts would contain less EdU, resulting in a reduction in the EdU levels in <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells."

After a 3-day chase period, however, we noted that over 40% of <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i>cells were newly born EdU<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>). This result suggests that stem cells initially incorporating EdU were capable of replenishing nearly half of the <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells within three days. Beyond D5, we noted a rapid reduction in the number of <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> EdU<sup>+</sup> cells and an overall reduction in the EdU levels per cell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>). These data suggest that <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells are a short-lived cell population that is continuously renewed by the neoblasts during the parasite\u2019s life in its definitive host. To determine if this rapid rate of neoblast-driven renewal was unique to <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells, we also examined the kinetics of EdU labeling of the schistosome intestine. In contrast to the <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells, only 2.5% of <i>cathespin B<sup>+</sup></i> intestinal cells were EdU<sup>+</sup> at D3, and this level remained fairly constant throughout the 11D time course (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,d</a>). Thus, the kinetics of tegumental cell birth differs from that of intestinal cells. Taken together, our data suggest that on a population level neoblasts are 'biased' toward the rejuvenation of <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells over other lineages."

These planarian neoblast progeny similarly express a p53-like protein as well as a large collection of planarian-specific molecules (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Zhu et al., 2015</a>). Most importantly, these planarian cells serve as progenitors to terminally differentiated epidermal cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">van\u00a0Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Tu et al., 2015</a>). Thus, it appears that free-living and parasitic flatworms utilize similar developmental strategies for epidermal maintenance. Presently, electron microscopy is the only methodology to unambiguously identify tegumental cell bodies in schistosomes. Therefore, with current technology, it is not possible to determine which of the irradiation-sensitive cells expressing DIS genes are terminally differentiated\u00a0tegumental cell bodies. In light of this limitation, our data are consistent with two models (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). In the first model, proliferating neoblasts differentiate to produce a short-lived population of terminally differentiated\u00a0tegumental cell bodies expressing <i>tsp-2</i> and other DIS genes (i.e., <i>sm13, sm25, sm29</i>, etc.). In the alternative model, cells expressing <i>tsp-2</i> (and other DIS genes) represent a population of short-lived progenitors to terminally differentiated tegumental cell bodies. Regardless of which model (or combination of these models) is correct, our data suggest that a primary function of the schistosome neoblasts is to generate cells that contribute to the tegument."

Indeed, numerous ideas have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including tegumental absorption of host antigens (<a href=\"#bib21\">Smithers et al., 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Clegg et al., 1971</a>) and the turnover of the unique tegumental outer membranes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Perez and Terry, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Wilson and Barnes, 1977</a>). Based on our data, we suggest that neoblast-driven tegumental regeneration may play a key role in the parasite\u2019s ability to survive in the mammalian host. By undergoing continuous tegumental renewal, the parasite is likely capable of rapidly turning over the tegument and regenerating damage inflicted inside the host (e.g., via immune attack). Thus, an important goal for future studies is to address the role of neoblasts in parasite survival and tegumental function in vivo."

Here they report on the participation of these cells in the constant renewal of the tegument of these organisms. The authors show that the adult stem cells (neoblasts) generate a short-lived cell population of terminally differentiated tegumental cell bodies/progenitors expressing several of formerly characterized tegumental factors associated with the parasite's surface. The study sheds new light on the function of neoblasts for parasite survival. This is a significant contribution to our understanding of how these organisms can survive for decades within the hostile bloodstream of its final mammalian host while defending immune attacks. Moreover, given the importance of many of the molecules found in the tegument in terms of vaccine discovery and development, the work presented here on their biogenesis has important ramifications for the development of future control strategies for this important human disease."

We find that in addition to being expressed in neoblasts the schistosome <i>p53</i> homolog is also highly expressed in <i>tsp-2</i> cells. Based on this observation we interpret our transcriptional profiling results as follows: At 48 hours following irradiation <i>p53</i> is partially down-regulated due to neoblast loss and then by day 14 the transcript is highly down regulated due to loss of the <i>tsp-2<sup>+</sup></i> cells. This result also adds value to the paper since the planarian orthologue of this gene is expressed in a similar manner (i.e., in the neoblasts and their immediate progeny, see Pearson &amp; S\u00e1nchez Alvarado (2010) Development 137, 213\u2013221). This provides additional evidence supporting the evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms regulating planarian and schistosome epidermal lineages."

Why do we observe differing levels of fold change down regulation? One possibility is that one of these genes is a histone variant. In other organisms histone variants can be regulated differently than the conical histones (see Kamakaka and Biggins. (2005) Genes and Dev. 19:295-316). Indeed, Smp_002930 shares &gt;90 identity to histone H2A isoforms in Humans, whereas Smp_086860 only shares about 75-80% identity with human H2A proteins. Thus, Smp_086860 may encode a neoblast-enriched H2A variant."

However, there are several challenges we need to tackle before we can address this issue in a comprehensive manner and therefore we feel this extends beyond the scope of this manuscript. We first must determine when the tegumental cell bodies are depleted following neoblast loss. The data presented here do not address this point. In principle, the <i>tsp-2</i> mRNA<sup>+</sup> cells could represent the entire tegumental cell pool, a subset of the tegumental cell bodies, or progenitors to the definitive tegument (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Addressing this point will allow us to determine the proper time point to examine the tegument microscopically. As far as microscopic analyses the preferred methodology would be Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), ideally using the methodology developed by Hockley and McLaren (Hockley DJ, McLaren DJ. 1973 Int J Parasitol. 3(1):13-25) that allows for visualization of both the inner and outer tegumental membranes. Unfortunately, our efforts to robustly reproduce this approach have yet to be successful, and therefore we are exploring other methodologies, including High Pressure Freezing and Freeze Substitution that should better preserve the membranes. Finally, since it has been noted that the tegument does not behave normally in vitro (see pg., 252 in Skelly, P. J. and R. A. Wilson (2006). \"Making sense of the schistosome surface.\" Adv Parasitol 63: 185-284) the ideal experiment would be to examine the tegument of neoblast-depleted parasites during the course of an experimental infection. While we are developing the methodologies to perform these experiments, they are still at least a year from reaching a publishable endpoint."
