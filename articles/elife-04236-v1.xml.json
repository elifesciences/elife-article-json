However, the 3D spatial organization of cis-elements and how such sub-nuclear structures influence TF activity remain poorly understood. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet imaging, single-molecule tracking, numerical simulations, and ChIP-exo mapping to localize and functionally probe Sox2 enhancer-organization in living embryonic stem cells. Sox2 enhancers form 3D-clusters that are segregated from heterochromatin but overlap with a subset of Pol II enriched regions. Sox2 searches for specific binding targets via a 3D-diffusion dominant mode when shuttling long-distances between clusters while chromatin-bound states predominate within individual clusters. Thus, enhancer clustering may reduce global search efficiency but enables rapid local fine-tuning of TF search parameters. Our results suggest an integrated model linking cis-element 3D spatial distribution to local-versus-global target search modalities essential for regulating eukaryotic gene transcription."

However, the 3D spatial organization of cis-elements and how such sub-nuclear structures influence TF activity remain poorly understood. Here, we combine lattice light-sheet imaging, single-molecule tracking, numerical simulations, and ChIP-exo mapping to localize and functionally probe Sox2 enhancer-organization in living embryonic stem cells. Sox2 enhancers form 3D-clusters that are segregated from heterochromatin but overlap with a subset of Pol II enriched regions. Sox2 searches for specific binding targets via a 3D-diffusion dominant mode when shuttling long-distances between clusters while chromatin-bound states predominate within individual clusters. Thus, enhancer clustering may reduce global search efficiency but enables rapid local fine-tuning of TF search parameters. Our results suggest an integrated model linking cis-element 3D spatial distribution to local-versus-global target search modalities essential for regulating eukaryotic gene transcription."

However, these earlier classical studies were unable to capture the three dimensional (3D) spatial organization or the temporal dynamics of the functional interactions between sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) and distal enhancers. The more recent development of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and high throughput sequencing based techniques have provided additional insights into long-distance chromatin looping, genome folding, and topological domains in the context of whole animal genomes but without providing direct spatial information (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dostie et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">van de Werken et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that proximity ligation frequency based distances measured by 3C assays may be limited in its capacity to accurately capture 3D molecular proximity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gavrilov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">O'Sullivan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belmont, 2014</a>). The inherent constraints of using fixed cells or population based assays to dissect the nature of 3D enhancer organization and transcription factor search dynamics can, however, be partly overcome by single live-cell imaging. Recent advances in fluorescence super resolution microscopy and protein labeling chemistry make possible the visualization and tracking of individual transcription factors as they diffuse and bind to specific targets in the nucleus of living mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mazza et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gavrilov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Izeddin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). If specific and stable TF:DNA binding events can be localized and visually reconstructed at single-molecule resolution within an intact nucleus, we would have an opportunity to map and decipher critical spatial features linked to the 3D organization of the functional genome and simultaneously measure differences in the dynamic nature of the TF target search process in distinct compartments within living cells."

We found that Sox2 and Oct4 search for their cognate targets via a trial-and-error mechanism in which these two TFs undergo multiple rounds of diffusion and non-specific chromatin collisions before stably engaging with a specific target via an ordered assembly mechanism. Single-molecule in vitro measurements indicate that Sox2 can also slide along short stretches of naked DNA to search for its target. Although our findings revealed significant mechanistic insights of the in vivo TF target search process, these initial single molecule tracking (SMT) studies were constrained to investigate the average behavior of TF dynamics in single cells. We were not able to address whether TFs behave differently within distinct sub-nuclear territories such as active gene enriched euchromatic regions vs the more tightly compacted regions of heterochromatin nor whether the 3D spatial distribution of enhancer sites might affect target search dynamics."

We applied lattice light-sheet single-molecule imaging to selectively localize, track, and map endogenous Sox2 binding sites in single, living ES cells. Two-color imaging enabled us to quantify the spatial distribution of Sox2 binding sites (enhancers) with respect to euchromatic vs heterochromatic regions. We also measured potential differential rates of Sox2 diffusion and binding modes within enhancer clusters compared to heterochromatic regions. SMT and Monte Carlo simulations of the Sox2 target search process revealed two distinct behaviors\u2014a 3D diffusion dominant long-range mode when traveling between clusters and a local binding dominant search mode within individual binding clusters. These studies suggest that enhancer clustering may reduce global target search efficiency but enable rapid local fine-tuning of search parameters that govern spatially controlled gene regulation in the nucleus. We also probed potential links between enhancer clustering and epigenetic regulation. Together, these results reveal principles that integrate 3D enhancer organization with dynamic in vivo TF-DNA interactions that may play a key role in regulating stem cell pluripotency. The combination of methods described here also open new avenues for studying single live-cell genome spatial organization and function."

This aspect of dissecting TF function presents a particular challenge, because the majority of Sox2 molecules (&gt;74%) in the nucleus are in a dynamically diffusing state (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kaur et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). Our recent single-molecule tracking (SMT) experiments found that Sox2 interactions with DNA consist of two distinct populations: non-specific collisions of short duration (residence time \u223c0.7 s) and specific \u2018stable\u2019 interactions of much longer duration (residence time \u223c12 s) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). Since only \u223c3% of the Sox2 molecules in the nucleus are bound to specific DNA sites at a given window of time, it is impossible to infer the spatial distribution of Sox2 enhancer sites simply from fluorescence fluctuations captured by wide-field imaging or from conventional super resolution images of live or fixed cells."

                                "text": "Currently, the only information we have that can distinguish site-specific binding from non-specific binding events or rapidly diffusing molecules is the relatively long specific residence times of Sox2 at putative cognate recognition sites (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). Therefore, we set out to devise a time-resolved, live-cell imaging strategy to selectively localize, track, and map these longer lived \u2018stable\u2019 Sox2 binding events that likely represent site specific Sox2 binding events to generate a super resolution 3D Sox2/enhancer site map for the whole nucleus. To achieve this, we implemented a lattice light-sheet based single-molecule imaging strategy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a> for details of optical layout). We first used an improved labeling method in which a HaloTag ligand based on a newly developed fluorophore, Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grimm et al., 2015</a>), at ultralow concentrations (\u223c0.1 fM) was gradually diffused into HaloTag-Sox2 expressing ES cells to fluorescently tag individual Sox2 molecules. During the labeling, we performed iterative cycles of z tiling by light-sheet microscopy of ES cell nuclei that allowed us to image Sox2 at single molecule resolution in 3D in a series of time-lapse movies. Background fluorescence contributed by rapidly diffusing free JF549-HaloTag ligand was negligible under these imaging conditions as single molecules were only detectable inside cell nuclei but not in the cytoplasm or other regions lacking Sox2 binding sites (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Light-sheet imaging turned out to be critical for the success of this strategy because the selective plane illumination not only preserved the photon budget by preventing out-of-focus molecules from photo-bleaching but also significantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio. With 3D localization at high precision (xy: 14 nm, z: 34 nm, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) coupled to single molecule tracking, we were able to selectively preserve the global positions where single Sox2 molecules dwell (&lt;50 nm) for at least 3 s. The average residence time of selected molecules was \u223c6.92 \u00b1 0.51 s (n = 9 cells) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), consistent with the notion that most of these events likely reflect the longer residence times representing specific Sox2-enhancer interactions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). We next calculated the number of local neighbors for each Sox2 enhancer site to generate a color-coded heat map for visualizing this data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, many local density hot spots were observed within a single nucleus, suggesting that instead of being uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, Sox2 bound enhancers form locally enriched distinct higher density clusters (EnCs)."

A collimated circular laser beam is passed through two pairs of cylindrical lenses to illuminate a thin stripe across the width of a ferroelectric spatial light modulator (SLM, Forth Dimension Displays, SXGA-3DM). The remainder of the excitation optical path serves to create a demagnified image of the SLM (81.6 nm pixels) at the focal plane of the excitation objective. First, a lens is used in a 2F configuration to create a diffraction pattern at its front focal plane that is the Fourier transform of the electric field reflected from the SLM. A custom opaque mask with transmissive annuli (Photo-Sciences Inc.) is placed at this plane, and a specific annulus is chosen to remove the unwanted diffraction orders and enforce a limit on the minimum field of view. The electric field transmitted through the mask is then imaged in series onto each of a pair of galvanometers (Cambridge Technology, 6215H) and the rear pupil plane of the excitation objective. The galvanometers serve to translate the light sheet through the specimen in x and z. Finally, the field is reverse transformed by the excitation objective to create the desired lattice light sheet at its front focal plane. The fluorescence generated within the specimen is collected by a detection objective (Nikon, CFI Apo LWD 25XW, 1.1 NA, 2 mm WD) whose focal plane is co-incident with the light sheet. Its high NA is essential to maximize the xy resolution and to optimize the light collection for single molecule detection. The excitation objective (Special Optics, 0.65 NA, 3.74 mm WD) was custom designed to fill the remaining available solid angle above the cover slip. A tube lens images the fluorescence from the illuminated slice within the specimen onto a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 v2) capable of frame rates down to 1 ms. A 3D image is produced from a stack of such 2D slices, either by moving the light sheet and detection objective together through the specimen (the former with the z galvo, the latter with a piezoelectric stage [Physik Instrumente, P-621.1CD]) or, far more commonly, by translating the specimen with a second piezo stage through the stationary light sheet along an axis s in the plane of the specimen cover slip. The specimen holder and specimen piezo are mounted on a trio of closed loop micropositioning stages (Physik Instrumente M-663 for horizontal motion in the cover slip plane, M-122.2DD for vertical travel).

                                "text": "To test whether the clustering behavior of stable Sox2 binding sites was due to potential artifacts introduced by our imaging strategy, we also inspected ES cells that stably expressed a control HaloTag fusion protein, the histone subunit (HaloTag-H2B) using the same imaging set-up followed by an identical computational pipeline and presentation scheme (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In contrast to Sox2, we observed dramatically decreased clustering behavior of HaloTag-H2B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In order to establish a more quantitative description of the Sox2-enhancer clustering behavior, we adapted a pair-correlation function used by cosmologists to describe the clustering behavior of stars in galaxies (<a href=\"#bib37\">Peebles, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Peebles and Hauser, 1974</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, see details in <a href=\"#equ3 equ4 equ5 equ6 equ7\">Equations 3\u20137</a>). Briefly, the pair correlation function, <i>g(r)</i>, describes the density of spots in a volume element at a separation r from single spots relative to the average density in the whole volume. If enhancer sites were uniformly distributed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) the pair correlation function would equal 1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, gray diamonds) because the local densities around each position would be invariant and equal to the average density in the entire volume. However, when spots are highly clustered, the <i>g(r)</i> will start with values much greater than 1 and gradually decrease as <i>r</i> increases, indicating that the local molecular densities around individual spots would be much higher than the average density in the volume. As expected, the <i>g(r)</i> function of Sox2 stable binding sites agreed well with a highly clustered behavior while by contrast, the <i>g(r)</i> function of H2B suggests a much more random and uniform distribution in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We next extended the previously established fluctuation model for describing two dimensional heterogeneous protein distribution in membranes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sengupta et al., 2011</a>) to fit the <i>g(r)</i> function calculated from our 3D dataset (<a href=\"#equ10 equ11 equ12 equ13\">Equations 10\u201313</a>). This model extracted two key parameters related to molecular clustering: the fluctuation range (<i>\u03b5</i>) and the fluctuation amplitude (<i>A</i>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Specifically, <i>\u03b5</i> is proportional to the average size of clusters while <i>A</i> is proportional to the relative molecular density within clusters. We observed, on average, a 14 fold higher fluctuation amplitude of Sox2-enhancers compared with those of H2B. However, we did observe a certain degree of H2B density fluctuations at much larger scales (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), probably reflecting chromatin density variations in the nucleus as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib52\">Young et al., 1986</a>). Because we use the 7000 most stable H2B spots to calculate the pair-correlation functions, according to Nyquist sampling theorem, our results are more sensitive to large-scale H2B density fluctuations in the nucleus and may overlook smaller-scale local H2B clustering. The mathematic tools established here should also serve as the basis for future comparisons when we carry out perturbation experiments that will be instructive for dissecting the function and molecular mechanisms underlying enhancer clustering. To determine whether the blinking of stably bound fluorescently tagged Sox2 molecules might influence or distort the observed \u2018stable\u2019 binding of Sox2 in the clusters, we plotted the number of detected events as a function of frame number. These plots show an initial decay that eventually reaches a plateau (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Such a temporal decay profile is more consistent with a bleaching dominant mechanism in which an equilibrium has been achieved between photo-bleaching and the ongoing fluorescent labeling of HaloTag-Sox2 molecules. Perhaps the strongest argument that the Sox2 clustering pattern we observe is not likely an artifact of the imaging modality can be derived from the fact that chromatin bound HaloTag-H2B molecules using precisely the same imaging strategy failed to show such a prominent clustering pattern."

If the recorded Sox2 stable binding events mainly reflect random non-specific interactions, the clustering behavior of shorter lived binding sites should be similar to that observed for the long lived putative \u2018specific\u2019 binding sites. Instead, we found the shorter-lived Sox2 binding sites showed greatly reduced fluctuation amplitudes of the pair correlation function curves (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). We also note that in many cases, we observed little or no clustering of short-lived Sox2 binding sites within the same territories where longer-lived stable Sox2 binding site clusters can clearly be observed (<a href=\"#media3 media6\">Videos 3 and 6</a>). These results suggest that the long-residence time filtering strategy that we deployed here likely enriches for specific binding site signals above the background of non-specific interactions consistent with what we observed previously (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>)."

Interestingly, we did not observe significant bursting behaviors as described for Pol II clusters (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). These results are consistent with a model wherein Sox2 EnCs are relatively stable during the period (\u223c20 min) of image acquisition. Because Sox2 bound enhancers are chromatin based structures, we note that previous FRAP (Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) experiments on core histone components (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kimura and Cook, 2001</a>) found that large-scale chromatin structures in live cells appeared stable with a half-life of &gt;2\u20134 hr which is much longer than the duration of our imaging experiments. These findings suggest that the enhancer clustering we observed here likely reflects the average 3D genome organization within reasonably short temporal length scales."

                                "text": "It has long been proposed that the 3D space inside a cell nucleus is sub-divided into highly active gene enriched regions (so-called \u2018euchromatin\u2019) and largely inactive gene regions (i.e., \u2018heterochromatin\u2019). To probe the spatial relationship between Sox2 EnCs and heterochromatic regions (HCs), we generated dual labeled ES cell lines that stably express HaloTag-Sox2 and GFP-HP1. HP1 protein is enriched in peri-centromeric and peripheral HCs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grewal and Elgin, 2002</a>) that form non-diffraction limited structures in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, and <a href=\"#media7 media8 media9\">Videos 7,8,9</a>). To map the EnCs and HCs in the same cell, we first deployed a wide-field, two-color imaging scheme (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) in which we used a low-excitation, long-acquisition time imaging condition (2 Hz) to map Sox2 stable binding sites in the nucleus while we recorded the images of GFP-HP1 before and after the SMT experiment (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). After localization and tracking of stable binding sites, we used a 2D kernel density estimator to generate an intensity map of EnCs in the nucleus (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details of image acquisition and registration; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and then superimposed the EnC intensity map with the HC map as two different color channels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We observed that EnCs and HCs are generally not co-localized spatially (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To gain a more quantitative measurement of these two distinct sub-nuclear regions, we tested the pixel-to-pixel correlation between EnC and HC intensity maps from individual cells. Pixels with high levels of EnC intensities generally showed low levels of HC intensities and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The Pearson correlation test gave an averaged coefficient (Rho) of 0.11 \u00b1 0.028 (n = 8) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that the location of EnCs and HCs is indeed very weakly correlated in the nuclear volume of ES cells. We also used pair cross-correlation analysis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Veatch et al., 2012</a>) to characterize the spatial relationship between EnC and HC regions (see <a href=\"#equ8 equ9\">Equations 8\u20139</a> for details of calculation). Unlike autocorrelation which measures the degree of self-clustering, pair cross-correlation examines the degree of co-clustering and co-localization between two types of molecules. As expected, the EnC and HC were shown to be clustered as their self-cross (auto) correlation curves start with values significantly above 1 and gradually converge to 1 with increased correlation radii (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). By contrast, the pair cross-correlation function between EnC and HC intensity maps showed no apparent spatial correlation other than weak exclusion in the range of radii smaller than 600 nm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To minimize the possibility that some bias may have been introduced by our 2D wide-field imaging and analysis pipeline, we also analyzed the spatial distributions of HCs and EnCs in single cells by lattice light-sheet imaging. Indeed, single molecule tracking confirmed and further strengthened the segregated relationship between HCs and EnCs in the 3D nucleus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Importantly, these results, taken together, suggest that Sox2 specific binding sites appear less frequently in HCs as most of the stable/specific binding sites were found to be outside of HCs. Consistent with this notion, we observed that levels of Sox2 in HCs are generally significantly lower than Sox2 levels in surrounding sub-nuclear regions, consistent with a reduced association of Sox2 to HCs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "To investigate the spatial relationship and inferred functional correlation between Sox2 enhancers and RNA Pol II distribution in the nucleus, we generated an ES cell line stably expressing HaloTag-Sox2 and a Dendra2 tagged Rpb1 mutant that is resistant to \u03b1-amanitin (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cisse et al., 2013</a>). These dual labeled ES cells were able to proliferate in the presence of \u03b1-amanitin, indicating that the tagged Rbp1 replaced the endogenous subunit in the RNA Pol II complex without interfering with its normal transcription function. To acquire super-resolution images of Pol II and Sox2 EnCs in the same cell, we first mapped Sox2 EnC clusters by deploying low-excitation and long-acquisition times (2 Hz) for detecting stable DNA bound JF646\u2013HaloTag-Sox2 molecules. Next, we performed live-cell PALM experiments by photo-activating Dendra2 tagged Pol II molecules (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details of image acquisition and registration). The final reconstructed images are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. We also performed pair auto- and cross-correlation analysis with Pol II and EnC intensity maps (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Interestingly, results from autocorrelation analysis suggested that Pol II molecules are somewhat more evenly distributed in the nucleus than the highly clustered Sox2-enhancers. Specifically, Sox2 EnC autocorrelation curves generally start with higher values (higher packing densities) and more quickly converge to 1 with increased correlation radii (tighter packing) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) compared with Pol II autocorrelation curves. However, it is worth noting that we did detect significant and distinct local Pol II density fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>) consistent with previous reports using other imaging modalities (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cisse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>). To better quantify the spatial relationship between the distribution patterns of Pol II and Sox2 EnCs, we next determined the pixel-to-pixel correlation between EnC and Pol II intensity maps generated from individual cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The Pearson correlation test gave an average coefficient (Rho) of 0.44 \u00b1 0.046 (Pol II high mask) (n = 8, average p-value from each test &lt;4.36E-45), suggesting that unlike the relationship between EnCs and HCs, EnC regions are generally correlated with Pol II occupancy in ES cells. Pair cross-correlation function also suggested a significant degree of co-localization/clustering between Sox2 EnCs and Pol II\u2013enriched regions as the cross-correlation curves start with values significantly greater than 1 and gradually converge to 1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, we note that, due to the tighter clustering of Sox2 enhancers, most Sox2 EnC regions contained significant levels of Pol II whereas only a subset of Pol II enriched regions overlap with Sox2 EnCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). The partial overlap between Sox2 EnCs and Pol II enriched regions is entirely consistent with previous genome-wide analysis showing that Sox2 only targets a subset of transcribed genes involved in maintaining ES cell identity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Many actively transcribed genes (including house-keeping genes) are likely subject to regulation by TFs other than Sox2 or Oct4. These results also suggest that Sox2 enhancer driven gene regulation is largely confined locally within distinct EnCs. Although not detectable in our assays, we assume that sub-nuclear regions outside Sox2 EnCs contain different actively transcribed cis-element clusters that also overlap with other Pol II enriched regions."

                                "text": "In our recent study, we found that in ES cells, Sox2/Oct4 search for their target binding sites via a 3D diffusion dominant mechanism with an average dynamic 3D searching time (\u03c4<sub>3D</sub>) of 3\u20134 s (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). However, we were not able to determine whether Sox2 might actually behave differently in distinct sub-nuclear compartments and how enhancer clustering might influence the TF search process. In light of our new finding that the 3D space within the ES cell nucleus can be divided into distinct EnC and HC regions, it became possible to probe the behavior of Sox2 target search dynamics in different chromatin compartments. To address this important and functionally relevant question, we took advantage of recently developed HaloTag dyes (JF549 and JF646) for multiplexing SMT experiments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grimm et al., 2015</a>). We dual labeled HaloTag-Sox2 molecules in the same cells with JF549 and JF646 HaloTag-ligands (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Next, we mapped Sox2 EnC clusters by deploying low-excitation and long-acquisition times (2 Hz) for detecting stable bound JF646\u2013HaloTag-Sox2 molecules. At the same time, we tracked the fast diffusing/binding dynamics of JF549-HaloTag-Sox2 molecules by using high-excitation and short-acquisition times (100 Hz) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). We also generated a binary mask for enhancer cluster regions and divided the Sox2 single-molecule tracks into in-mask fragments and out-mask fragments (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). We note that tracking was performed without knowledge of the mask thus ensuring an unbiased track division. We calculated diffusion coefficients from in-mask track segments (n = 6 cells) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and found that most of the molecules inside EnCs are in the bound state (64 \u00b1 7.8%) and only \u223c36% are rapidly diffusing. These results suggest that Sox2 molecules in EnCs generally spend less time in diffusion before engaging with chromatin and thus have a shorter \u03c4<sub>3D</sub>. Similarly, we investigated the fast diffusing/binding population of Sox2 within HCs using an analogous strategy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>). Consistent with our previous observations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), stable DNA binding events/sites are distinctly low (16 \u00b1 4.5%) in HCs, compared with their frequency in EnCs (64 \u00b1 7.8%) and in whole nuclei (38 \u00b1 4.3%) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). However, interestingly, we observed a significant population of Sox2 molecules (26 \u00b1 8.4%) within HCs that diffuse with much slower rates (0.61 \u00b1 0.13 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) than the average Sox2 diffusion rates (\u223c2.7 \u00b1 0.63 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) in whole nuclei (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). This finding suggests that, in certain regions inside HCs, Sox2 diffuses slower. In good agreement with this observation, a previous report demonstrated via Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) measurements that even GFP molecules diffuse much slower in heterochromatic regions possibly due to molecular crowding effects (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bancaud et al., 2009</a>). We pooled and analyzed all the SMT tracks obtained from single cells together and found that the majority of Sox2 molecules are in a diffusing mode (62 \u00b1 4.3%, n = 12 cells) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), consistent with a 3D diffusion dominant search mechanism."

The manipulations required to modulate enhancer clustering posed significant experimental challenges. Moreover, because of its probabilistic nature, the target search process cannot be adequately described by ordinary differential equations nor traditional binding kinetic equations, because they typically rely on mass reaction rates and assume that substrate concentrations are invariant across a large field of view. As discussed extensively in the literature (<a href=\"#bib41\">Robert and Casella, 2005</a>), one of the most effective ways to dissect a random process based behavior is through computer-generated Monte Carlo algorithms that simulate the Brownian motion of TFs in a confined 3D sphere (cell nucleus) with multiple target traps (<a href=\"#equ14 equ15\">Equations 14\u201315</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>, See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for parameter selection criteria. See <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a> for the validation of TF Brownian simulation). With such a set-up, we can arbitrarily manipulate the distribution of target sites in the nucleus, precisely control the initial TF injection position and then record the first 3D passage time (\u03c4<sub>3D</sub>)\u2014the duration from the initial injection to the point when the TF hits a target for the first time in the nucleus."

It is important to note that overlaps between targets were not allowed in our simulation experiments. Specifically, the minimal distance (80 nm) allowed between the centers of two targets is twice that of the target radius (40 nm). Interestingly, we found that it took increasingly longer \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> for TFs to reach their target as enhancer sites became more densely packed. This suggests that enhancer clustering may actually decrease global TF target search efficiency in the nucleus. In support of this result, other groups observed similar effects of receptor clustering on ligand binding (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldstein and Wiegel, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Care and Soula, 2011</a>). Specifically, the \u2018apparent\u2019 macroscopic ligand binding association rates decrease with increased densities of receptors within clusters while the microscopic rates remained the same. To further minimize the possibility that merged targets might create larger binding sites, we reduced the radius of targets to 30 nm while maintaining the minimal distance between the centers of two targets at 80 nm. In this case, there was no possibility of contact or merging between targets. Under these conditions, very similar simulation results were observed (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Thus, it seems unlikely that the effects of target site clustering on \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> would be due to target site fusion. It is also important to note that, in our simulation experiments, the TF binding probability to target is 1. Since we defined the \u2018Fold of Delay\u2019 as \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> in the \u2018clustered\u2019 case normalized by \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> in the \u2018uniform\u2019 case, the binding probability (1 or not) should be identical under both uniform and cluster conditions. Consequently, the trends that we observe for \u2018Fold of Delay\u2019 should not alter significantly when the TF binding probabilities vary."

Under these conditions, we essentially increased the degree of randomness of enhancer distribution by dispersing the same amount of targets into more randomly localized clusters. We next probed the TF rebinding time in an individual cluster (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Specifically, we injected TFs at different radii of release relative to the center of an enhancer cluster. We found that \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> becomes reduced as the injection site approaches the center of the EnC (or when the local concentrations of enhancer sites increase). This result suggests that the TF target search dynamics is spatially modulated by enhancer density fluctuations in the nucleus such as we find in EnCs vs HCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Specifically, the higher the local concentration of target sites, the shorter the time (\u03c4<sub>3D</sub>) it will take for a TF to reach a target site within an EnC. This relationship can also be verified mathematically by the Smoluchowski equations (<a href=\"#equ19 equ20 equ21\">Equations 19\u201321</a>)."

Interestingly, a single component model failed to fit the data when the enhancer sites become more and more densely clustered while a two-component model fits the entire range of cluster density data well (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results suggest that the enhancer clustering behavior itself may be sufficient to bifurcate the target search process into at least two components: a local search mode inside enhancer clusters and a long-range mode for searching outside of clusters. Together, these simulation results help clarify the effect of enhancer clustering on global TF target search efficiency in a non-equilibrium state and also reinforce the notion that the Sox2 target search process can follow two distinct modes: a local search process dominated by a binding dominant mechanism and a long-range mode for TFs to search between EnCs that is dominated by a 3D exploration mechanism as suggested previously by our independent SMT experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

Specifically, we applied our single-molecule, light sheet imaging strategy to map Sox2-enhancer 3D organization in TSA treated ES cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media13\">Video 13</a>). Interestingly, the pair correlation function of Sox2 EnCs in TSA treated cells showed profiles of significantly decreased clustering, more similar to those of H2B, indicated by the decreased fluctuation amplitudes and increased fluctuation ranges (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Thus, it seems that TSA treatment, thought to decondense chromatin, makes specific and stable Sox2 binding sites become more randomly distributed in the nucleus. One possibility is that dysregulation of histone deacetylation activities after TSA treatment significantly alters the Sox2 binding profile in the genome to a more random state; the other possibility is that TSA treatment redistributes the 3D localization of existing Sox2 binding sites in the nucleus. To distinguish between these two possible mechanisms, we performed Sox2 ChIP-exo experiments in TSA treated ES cells and compared the resulting Sox2 genome-wide binding profile to Sox2 chromosomal localizations in wild type (WT) ES cells. Upon TSA treatment, we observed a much more random distribution of Sox2 ChIP-exo peaks across different chromosomes and with regard to transcription start sites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), favoring the scenario that TSA treatment significantly increased the chances for Sox2 to bind more randomly throughout the genome. These results suggest that a finely balanced epigenetic regulation can influence the maintenance of normal enhancer clustering in the nucleus."

Despite more than 30 years of intense investigation, the dynamic TF target seeking process in live mammalian cells has remained poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib23\">Halford, 2009</a>). Part of the problem is that, currently, there are few options available to directly investigate spatial enhancer organization in living cells. Here, we report a single-molecule, light-sheet imaging based strategy to reconstruct, in 3D, the Sox2-enhancer organization within live ES cells. We found that Sox2 enhancer sites form locally enriched clusters providing us an opportunity to tackle several fundamental questions. In particular, could the target search process be differentially regulated in distinct sub-nuclear regions such as enhancer clusters (EnCs) vs heterochromatic regions (HCs)? Using a suite of assays, we probed the transcription factor (TF) target search process and how the formation of enhancer clusters (EnCs) might modulate TF search parameters. We also determined the influence of spatially segregated and functionally distinct chromatin territories on transcription factor search modes within the mammalian nucleus. These findings support a model wherein gene regulation in eukaryotic cells operates in a manner dependent on the 3D spatial distribution of cis-elements that in turn influences differential target search features associated with local sub-nuclear environments (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

In particular, we find that inside enhancer clusters, Sox2 displays significantly faster forward association rates (<a href=\"#fig5 fig6\">Figures 5 and 6</a>), thereby increasing local TF concentrations, allowing rapid rebinding to stretches of open chromatin and probably also facilitating the local target acquisition process. The shortened \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> provides a greater opportunity for re-cycling pre-assembled TF complexes and taking advantage of cooperative interactions between TFs on chromatin. Interestingly, our simulation studies suggest that even subtle changes in the position of target genes within individual clusters can lead to alterations in local target search features. For example, gene targets at the center of EnCs can capitalize on different target search features relative to genes in the periphery of enhancer clusters (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). These results suggest that the local TF target search mode may be exquisitely modulated within distinct sub-nuclear environments and serve as an important mechanism for fine-tuning the rates of TF complex assembly at specific cis-regulatory elements."

Single molecule tracking of Sox2 binding and diffusion dynamics in EnCs vs HCs indicates that in contrast to the previously estimated fraction (\u223c74%) of Sox2 molecules engaged, on average, in 3D diffusion, the majority (\u223c64%) of Sox2 molecules within EnCs were found to be in a chromatin bound state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This new finding suggests that local higher concentrations of \u2018open\u2019 chromatin in EnCs likely give rise to a dramatically reduced \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> leading the target search process to switch from a 3D diffusion dominant mode to a binding dominant search mechanism perhaps more similar to the action of LacI in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elf et al., 2007</a>). By contrast, we found a relatively low Sox2 bound fraction in heterochromatic regions. Intriguingly, in certain HC regions, Sox2 diffuses with slower rates compared to the average rate in the nucleus. This result is consistent with a previous report that even GFP molecules diffuse much slower in HCs possibly due to molecular crowding effects (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bancaud et al., 2009</a>). Our findings suggest that the Sox2 target search process can be divided into at least two distinct modes in the ES cell nucleus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), (1) a chromatin binding dominant, local mode within individual EnCs possibly involving Sox2 sliding along short stretches of naked DNA as demonstrated by our in vitro TIRF single-molecule experiments (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>) and (2) a 3D diffusion dominant long-range mode in which Sox2 molecules must tunnel through HCs and travel between EnCs. Our simulations also suggest that enhancer clustering itself is sufficient to generate these two modes of target search. Together, these findings reveal previously unappreciated principles governing Sox2 target search patterns within distinct sub-nuclear regions of ES cells and provide insights into how enhancer clustering can modulate local target search dynamics that could ultimately influence local transcription rates."

                                "text": "From the earliest cloning and characterization of classical sequence specific transcription factors, a striking yet puzzling feature was the discovery of simple repetitive largely unstructured amino acid motifs (i.e., Gln-rich, Pro-rich, acidic repeats) that serve as \u2018activation domains\u2019 (ADs) coupled to DNA binding domains (<a href=\"#bib10\">Courey and Tjian, 1988</a>). More recent evidence suggests that such simple repetitive amino acid motifs, now referred to as low-complexity (LC) sequences, are found in a variety of regulatory proteins (such as FUS, TAF15, and EWS) and can be induced to form fibrous polymers in vitro to mediate interactions with the CTD of RNA polymerase in a phosphorylation-state dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>). However, in vitro polymer formation required protein concentrations (0.7\u20132 mM), \u223c1000\u00d7 greater than typical concentrations of TFs (low micro-molar) found in vivo (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). One mechanism proposed to enhance polymer formation involves RNA molecules seeding higher-order assemblies via the intrinsic RNA binding capacity of select regulatory proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schwartz et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, the activation domains of Sox2 are predicted to be unstructured LC domains enriched for G/S/P residues. Importantly, the C-terminal Sox2 AD contains five repeats of degenerate (G/S/D/H) Y (G/S/D/H) sequences that have been reported to form fibrous polymers in vitro (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>). We speculate that the in vivo Sox2-enhancer clustering observed in our live cell studies opens the possibility that local higher concentrations of both TFs and specific DNA binding sites within EnCs may promote the formation of Sox2 LC AD containing polymers at least transiently. We envision that these Sox2-enhancer clusters could serve as multivalent docking sites for dynamic TF recruitment via weak protein:protein interactions potentially directed by LC containing proteins. Such \u2018clouds\u2019 of weak multivalent protein:protein interactions would be assisted by stronger sequence specific protein:DNA transactions that together build an activated enhanceosome. These transiently formed EnC clusters may, in turn, regulate local TF concentrations and dictate local target search dynamics of key transcriptional pre-initiation components including Pol II, GTFs, and chromatin remodeling complexes. It is tempting to speculate that the Sox2 enhancer cluster and its associated co-factors could thus form the local hub for coordinated and synergistic gene regulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Whether the EnCs we observe represent actively transcribed regions remains unclear but the significant co-localization between EnCs and Pol II would be consistent with such an interpretation. Since interactions between classical LC activation domains such as those reported in the original studies of Sp1-Sp1 and Sp1-TAF4 interactions have also been suggested to be important for DNA loop formation and transcription activation in vitro (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mastrangelo et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Su et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Freiman and Tjian, 2002</a>), it will be instructive in the future to probe whether these prevalent LC mediated transactions also contribute to the maintenance and structural integrity of enhancer clusters."

We envision that enhancer clustering with its higher local TF/cofactor concentrations accompanied by altered target search features may be sufficient to serve as an alternative mechanism for achieving distal enhancer directed transcription activation long recognized as a hallmark of mammalian gene control. Our results also suggest that gene and promoter positioning in relationship to EnC and HC territories is critical for optimal fine-tuning of transcriptional activities. Important questions left unresolved by our present study include: how many genes/promoters are present within a cluster; what is the relationship between our 3D clusters and TADs (topologically associated domains); and are the enhancer binding sites within a cluster all from a given chromosome or is there evidence of transvection occurring as well?"

These studies, taken in aggregate, suggest that gene transcription is compartmentalized within topological or spatial territories in the nucleus segregated from other silent regions. However, given the orthogonal nature of these diverse methods of probing genome organization, it is difficult at this stage to firmly establish either direct structural or functional links between the genome-wide ensemble studies and our observation of enhancer clustering by single molecule imaging. We note, for example, that enhancer clustering does not appear simply to result from differential chromatin packaging. Specifically, the fluctuations of Sox2 enhancer densities in the nucleus are smaller in sizes (<i>\u03b5</i>) but much larger in amplitudes (A) than chromatin (H2B) densities (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Two distinct mechanisms could account for this observation, (1) Sox2 binding sites are already clustered in the linear genome and chromosome folding based on the polymer model (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib47\">Tark-Dame et al., 2011</a> and <a href=\"#bib16\">Fudenberg and Mirny, 2012</a>), automatically leads to 3D cluster formation even without TF directed chromatin looping interactions; (2) extensive active and TF directed long distance chromatin looping brings distal Sox2-enhancer sites along the linear chromosome to form local 3D clusters. To distinguish between these two potential scenarios, we analyzed the linear arrangement of Sox2 binding sites genome wide using ChIP-exo. Indeed as suspected, many Sox2 binding sites already form clustered arrays along the linear chromosome (<a href=\"#bib50\">Whyte et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, disrupting the epigenome alters the accessibility of linearly arranged Sox2 binding sites as well as the extent of 3D enhancer clustering (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This finding suggests that linearly arrayed Sox2 binding sites likely contribute substantially to the formation of enhancer clusters in 3D but do not exclude the possibility that TF directed chromatin looping also contributes to such an organization of actively transcribed loci. Future modeling and simulation experiments will be required to functionally link the linear genomic localization of different TF binding sites with their 3D spatial distributions in the nucleus to gain further insights into genome organization and chromatin folding. It also remains unclear what forces or exogenous structures are in play to maintain the star-burst arrangement of enhancers in the nuclear volume."

Our imaging analysis of live ES cells suggests that the nucleus is partitioned into multiple levels of spatially segregated functional domains. For example, many Pol II enriched regions do not overlap with Sox2 EnCs although, as might be expected, most Sox2 EnCs do overlap with Pol II clusters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We also observed extensive residual \u2018dark\u2019 spaces that are not significantly occupied by either heterochromatin or Sox2 binding sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). It seems likely that other uncharacterized enhancer bearing sub-nuclear domains occupy these \u2018dark\u2019 territories and influence local gene activity not detected by our current assays. We speculate that galaxies of such 3D clusters of cis-regulatory domains are formed by specific binding of different combinations of TFs we have long suspected but could not discern from classical bulk biochemistry. It will be interesting in the future to complete this 3D mapping of the nucleome to discern which other cadre of factors might reside in these \u2018dark\u2019 regions. Another aspect to address will be the degree of spatial overlap between different functional regions created by the stable binding and local concentrations of different classes of TFs. Ultimately we would like to have a more complete understanding of how the 3D organization of these cis-elements specifically influences gene activity and what gene products and mechanisms underlie the formation of these clusters. Addressing these questions will be essential for a deeper understanding of how enhancer-mediated gene regulation works. The ongoing development of simultaneous multi-color super-resolution imaging systems, enhanced dye chemistry, and single gene locus labeling strategies will be essential to address these fundamental questions."

The modification consists of a massively parallel array of coherently interfering beams comprising a non-diffracting 2D optical lattice, rather than a set of seven noninterfering Bessel beams. This creates a coherent structured light sheet that can be dithered to create uniform excitation in a 400 nm thick plane across the entire field of view. The experimental hardware is the same as before, except that a binary spatial light modulator (SXGA-3DM, Forth Dimension Displays, Valencia, CA) is placed conjugate to the sample plane, and a binarized version of the desired structured pattern at the sample is projected on the display. For imaging, a 500 mW cw488 nm (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) or a 500 mW cw561 laser (MPB Lasertech, Edmonton, AB) were used. A custom 0.65 NA objective for excitation (Special Optics, Wharton, NJ) and a 25\u00d7, 1.1 NA objective for detection (Nikon, USA, MRD77220) are employed. A multi-band pass filter (Semrock, FF01-446/523/600/677-25) is placed before a CMOS camera (ORCA-flash4.0, Hamamatsu, Japan) to filter the excitation wavelengths. Single molecule imaging of individual cells was performed by serially scanning the entire cell nucleus through the light sheet at 20\u201350 ms exposure per 2D image and 300 nm z-steps resulting in a 3D imaging rate of 3 s per volume. Although significantly faster imaging rates are possible, these conditions were chosen to minimize photo-bleaching and phototoxicity, while specifically selecting stably bound (&gt;3 s) molecules. Correlation of stable binding sites with heterochromatin regions was performed by first acquiring a single 3D volume of GFP-HP1 followed by single molecule imaging as described above."

After background subtraction, the intensity map for heterochromatin regions in single cells was directly calculated by normalizing pixel intensity in the GFP-HP1 channel with the highest pixel intensity in the image. The intensity map for Dendra2 Pol II or stable Sox2 binding sites was calculated by 2D Gaussian kernel density function implemented by Matlab. Specifically, the density probability of X, Y localizations of stable binding events was evaluated in a 100 \u00d7 100 matrix with arbitrary units. The bandwidth for density estimation is 2 units. The resulting probability map was rescaled to the original image size. Composite images were constructed by superimposing the two intensity maps as two independent color channels.

The target search problem was reduced to random walk trapping problem with boundary and multiple traps. Specifically, we limited the 3D diffusion of the TF in a nucleus with a radius of 5 \u00b5m. Considering the average length of nucleosome depleted regions as 100\u2013200 base pairs and the persistent length (<i>l</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>) of naked DNA as about 45 nm (135 bps) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Williams and Maher, 2011</a>), target site radius was set as 40 nm. Overlaps between targets were not allowed in our simulation experiment. Specifically, the minimal distance (80 nm) allowed between the center of two targets is two times of the target radius (40 nm). In our simulation experiment, the TF binding probability to target is 1 when the TF reaches individual targets. The number of target sites was 7000 as estimated in our previous work. The mean diffusion coefficient (D) of the TF is 10 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>; the sampling interval (<i>\u03b4t</i>) is 10 ms. Under this condition, the X, Y, Z step sizes are about 14 nm (when <i>N</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 1) much smaller than the target size, suggesting that the space is not under-sampled. We computationally manipulated the spatial distribution of target site and injection site position of the TF in the nucleus as indicated in the specific experiment and we recorded the first passage (3D) time and trajectory of each trial before the TF was reaching the first target according to the first-hitting-time model in the survival theory."

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed according to <a href=\"#bib4\">Boyer et al. (2006)</a> with minor modifications. Briefly, cross-linked ESC chromatin was sheared using Covaris S2 system to a size range of 100 bp\u2013400 bp. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with either specific antibody conjugated Protein A Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). ChIP-exo library was prepared by following the published protocol with minor modifications (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</a>). Specifically, we adapted the SoLid sequencer adaptors/primers to make the final library compatible with the illumina Tru-seq seq small-RNA system. Anti-Sox2 (R&amp;D; Systems, Minneapolis, MN Cat. # AF2018, Lot # KOY0112011) antibody was used for the ChIP experiment.

After removal of the 3\u2032 most 24 bp (Sox2 TSA) or 14 bp (Sox2 Wild type: 50 bp reads) which tend to have higher error rates, we mapped our sequencing data back to the mouse reference genome (mm10) by Bowtie 2 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</a>). After mapping, we normalized the total mapped reads for each factor to 40 million. We further reduced the mapped read regions to single 5\u2032-end point, which reflects the cross-linking point between protein and DNA. The resulting cross-linking point distribution was used to identify peaks on the forward (Left) and reverse (Right) strand separately using the peak calling algorithm in GeneTrack (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albert et al., 2008</a>). For bound-region calculation, we first identified any pairs of left and right peaks that were located within 20 bps to each other. Then, we defined the window between the middle point of the left peak and that of the right peak as the bound-region. Peak-pairing and bound-region calculation were performed with Python programming (the script is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/Jameszheliu/PeakPairingProgram\">https://github.com/Jameszheliu/PeakPairingProgram</a>). Sox2 ChIP-exo sequencing data using wild type ES cells were obtained from GEO with the accession number of GSM1308179 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>). Sox2 ChIP-exo data using TSA treated ES cells were deposited to NCBI GEO with the accession number of GSE62972."

Sox2 is one of the most important pluripotent TFs that has been studied widely. However, due to its high copy number and numerous targeting sites, it has not been possible to visualize its dynamic organization, which is crucial for understanding how Sox2 differentiates its targeting genes. The authors developed novel in-nucleus single molecule imaging approaches and corresponding analyzing tool sets that are of general value for live cell single molecule studies. In combination with numerical simulations and ChIP-exo mapping, the authors came up with two important conclusions that are new for eukaryotic regulation of gene expression."

If the Sox2 stable binding sites only reflected random non-specific interactions, the clustering behavior of short lived binding sites would be the same as that of the long lived binding sites. However, in contrast to this prediction, shorter-lived Sox2 binding sites showed dramatically decreased clustering as reflected in the greatly reduced fluctuation amplitudes of the pair correlation function plots. Instead, we found the shorter-lived Sox2 binding sites showed very little clustering and greatly reduced fluctuation amplitudes of the pair correlation function curves (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We also note that in many cases, we observed little or no clustering of short-lived Sox2 binding sites within the same territories where longer-lived stable Sox2 binding site clusters can clearly be observed (<a href=\"#media3 media6\">Videos 3 and 6</a>). These results suggest that the long-residence time filtering strategy that we deployed here likely enriches for specific binding site signals above the background of non-specific interactions consistent with what we observed previously (Chen et al., 2014)."

In addition, the halo-Sox2-TAD protein is highly unstable in ES cells and thus its expression levels are too low to be compatible with the imaging strategy required to comprehensively map global binding sites. We have now included these findings in the revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

These plots show an initial decay that eventually reaches a plateau (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>. Such a temporal decay profile is more consistent with a bleaching dominant mechanism in which an equilibrium state has been achieved between photo-bleaching and diffusive labeling. Moreover, Sox2 specific residence times (\u223c12s) are relative short compared to the total imaging time (\u223c20 mins). Perhaps an even stronger argument that the Sox2 clustering pattern we observe is not likely an artifact of the imaging modality can be derived from the fact that imaging chromatin bound halo-H2B molecules failed to show such a prominent clustering pattern. We have modified the revised MS accordingly to include this important point."

The resulting 3D map is aimed at resolving where stable Sox2 bound enhancers are located in the live cell nucleus rather than to precisely map all Sox2 cognate binding sites and link these sites to specific sequences in the genome defined by ChIP-exo. Clearly, that is a goal that we are working towards but have not yet achieved. Currently, we can make a qualitative conclusion that a reduced Sox2 binding site clustering in the linear genome after TSA treatment correlates with reduced Sox2 stable binding site clustering in 3D. It would be premature for us to make quantitative statements of exactly how many Sox2 binding sites are within each cluster and how many binding sites are scattered outside of clusters. We expect that depending on different cut-offs, analysis methods and sampling depths, the fraction of clustered sites versus scattered sites could vary considerably. Much more theoretical work needs to be conducted with the 3D stable binding site maps from different TFs to determine the optimal cut-offs and methods that should allow us to better define \u201cclustered\u201d versus \u201cscattered\u201d categories."

We have emphasized this point in the revised manuscript and the reason for us to choose 40nm as the target radius is based on DNA polymer model is now described in the text."

                    "text": "Finally, it is important to note that in our simulation experiments, one constraint for generating targets is that there is no overlap between target sites. Specifically, the minimal distance (80nm) allowed between the center of two targets is two times of the target radius (40nm). However, we note that in this case two targets might still in contact with each other on surface. To further eliminate the possibility that targets might create a continuous larger binding site, we reduced to radius of targets to 30nm while maintaining the minimal distance between the centers of two targets as 80nm. In this case, there are no possible contacts between targets. Under this condition, we essentially got very similar simulation results. Thus, it\u2019s highly unlikely that the effects of target site clustering on \u03c4<sub>3D</sub> that we observed was due to target site fusion. The new simulation results have been included in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>. As the reviewer suggested, we have more explicitly described the parameters for simulation experiments in the revised manuscript."

Interestingly, we didn\u2019t observe significant bursting behaviors as described for Pol II clusters. These results are consistent with a model that Sox2 EnCs are relatively stable during the period (\u223c20mins) of the imaging acquisition. Because Sox2 bound enhancers are chromatin based structures, it\u2019s worth noting that previous FRAP (Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) experiments on core histone components (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kimura and Cook, 2001</a>) found that large-scale chromatin structures in live cells appeared stable with a half-life of &gt; 2\u223c4 hours which is much longer than the duration of our imaging experiments. These findings together suggest that the enhancer clustering we observed here likely accurately reflect the average 3D genome organization within reasonably short spatiotemporal length scales.
