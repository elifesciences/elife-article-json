Here, we show the receptor transporting protein (RTP) family members play a dual role in both normal OR trafficking and determining OR gene choice probabilities. <i>Rtp1</i> and <i>Rtp2</i> double knockout mice (RTP1,2DKO) show OR trafficking defects and decreased OSN activation. Surprisingly, we discovered a small subset of the ORs are expressed in larger numbers of OSNs despite the presence of fewer total OSNs in RTP1,2DKO. Unlike typical ORs, some overrepresented ORs show robust cell surface expression in heterologous cells without the co-expression of RTPs. We present a model in which developing OSNs exhibit unstable OR expression until they choose to express an OR that exits the ER or undergo cell death. Our study sheds light on the new link between OR protein trafficking and OR transcriptional regulation."

Here, we show the receptor transporting protein (RTP) family members play a dual role in both normal OR trafficking and determining OR gene choice probabilities. <i>Rtp1</i> and <i>Rtp2</i> double knockout mice (RTP1,2DKO) show OR trafficking defects and decreased OSN activation. Surprisingly, we discovered a small subset of the ORs are expressed in larger numbers of OSNs despite the presence of fewer total OSNs in RTP1,2DKO. Unlike typical ORs, some overrepresented ORs show robust cell surface expression in heterologous cells without the co-expression of RTPs. We present a model in which developing OSNs exhibit unstable OR expression until they choose to express an OR that exits the ER or undergo cell death. Our study sheds light on the new link between OR protein trafficking and OR transcriptional regulation."

Olfactory neurons in the nose can detect and distinguish between tens of thousands of different odor producing substances. They do so by using hundreds of unique sensors called olfactory receptors, each of which responds to a specific type of odor. During development, each olfactory neuron \u201cchooses\u201d to produce only one type of olfactory receptor. Once the neuron recognizes that the functional receptor is being generated and transported to the cell surface, it will stop making all the other olfactory receptors."

To investigate how the loss of these chaperones affects how the olfactory system develops, Sharma et al. studied mice that were unable to produce the olfactory chaperone proteins. In these mice, developing neurons that chose to produce a type of olfactory receptor that depends on chaperone protein transport could not fully shut off other olfactory receptor genes. This led either to the neuron attempting to produce another type of receptor, or the death of the neuron. As a result, more neurons than usual produced receptors that do not require chaperone proteins to transport them to the cell surface. The olfactory neurons therefore produced only a fraction of all possible olfactory receptors, which decreased the ability of the mice to respond to odors."

Therefore, we used M71-IRES-tauGFP mice in which Olfr151 (also known as M71 and MOR171-2) expressing OSNs co-express tauGFP to examine the OSNs for OR trafficking defects (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feinstein et al., 2004a</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In the RTP1,2DKO;M71-IRES-tauGFP OE, GFP staining was observed in the dendrites of Olfr151 positive OSNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), indicating that the morphology of their OSNs remains unchanged. In contrast, immunostaining against Olfr151 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barnea et al., 2004</a>) was restricted to the cell body, indicating these OSNs are unable to traffic the OR to the dendrite (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

In an attempt to causally identify the basis of the bias, we used a mouse expressing \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR-IRES-LacZ from the Olfr151 locus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feinstein et al., 2004b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and asked whether the numbers of OSNs expressing Olfr151 or \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR are similarly affected in RTP1,2DKO. We chose Olfr151 as it is a uOR and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR because it is a non-OR GPCR, capable of reaching the cell surface without the RTPs in heterologous culture and can replace a functional OR in native OSNs (<a href=\"#bib59\">Omura et al., 2014</a>). We saw that fewer Olfr151 expressing OSNs were present in RTP1,2DKO (p=0.0028, Mann-Whitney U test), as expected for a uOR.

We carried out live cell surface staining of HEK293T cells transfected with either Rho tagged uORs or oORs in the absence of RTP1 and RTP2. In order to quantify the surface staining, we carried out FACS to measure the surface OR levels. oORs as a group showed more OR surface expression than uORs (p&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>). Notably, the ORs that show most robust cell surface expression were all oORs. Even though trafficking mechanisms between OSNs and HEK293T cells are likely to be different, our data are consistent with the idea that RTP-independent trafficking of ORs may be related to increased frequencies of OSNs expressing oORs."

Previous studies have shown that the\u00a0unfolded protein response (UPR) plays an important role in OR gene choice mechanisms. During the initial phase of OR expression, the UPR pathway gives rise to an increased translation of nuclear activating transcription factor (nATF5) over an upstream inhibitory ORF via eIF2\u03b1 signaling (<a href=\"#bib25\">Godin et al., 2016</a>). Once the OSN has matured, OR gene choice is stabilized and the UPR is relieved (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dalton et al., 2013</a>). We hypothesized that the lack of RTP1 and RTP2 causes persistent UPR in OSNs expressing uORs, leading to unstable OR gene choice in these OSNs, which in turn contributes to the skewed OR repertoire in mice lacking RTP1 and RTP2. We first asked whether the expression of nATF5, a marker for UPR, is different in RTP1,2DKO. Indeed, we observed that there were more nATF5 positive OSNs in RTP1,2DKO mice (p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U Test) and some of these OSNs were located closer to the apical surface, a phenomenon that was not observed in the wild-types, suggesting that nATF5 expression persists during the OSN development in RTP1,2DKO animals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>). Similarly, expanded expression was observed for LSD1, a histone demethylase whose expression depends on nATF5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Next, we asked whether the\u00a0ectopic expression of nATF5 in RTP1,2DKO is due to their protein sequence or the gene locus. We first compared the co-expression of nATF5 and Olfr151 between the wild-type and RTP1,2DKO using M71-IRES-tauGFP mice, and then asked whether the same co-localization occurs for \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR expressed from the Olfr151 gene locus using \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR-IRES-LacZ mice. We observed that the number of OSNs co-expressing Olfr151 and nATF5 was significantly higher in RTP1,2DKO than in the wild-type (p&lt;0.05, Fisher\u2019s exact test). In contrast, the number of OSNs co-expressing \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR and nATF5 in the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR:IRES:tauLacZ mouse was not different from the wild-type (p=1, Fisher\u2019s exact test)(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013F</a>). As Olfr151 but not \u03b2<sub>2</sub>ARs require RTPs for surface expression, these data suggest that delivery of ORs to the membrane plays a role in terminating the UPR."

As expected, higher numbers of OSNs expressing uORs colocalized with nATF5 in RTP1,2DKO as a group (p=0.007, Mann-Whitney U test), whereas no significant difference was observed when oORs were tested (p=0.937, Mann-Whitney U test) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013H</a>).

This led us to hypothesize that OSNs that initially express a uOR may later turn off the OR and stabilize the expression of another OR. To directly address this, we used a lineage tracing strategy to study the stability of OR gene choice in RTP1,2DKO (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shykind et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dalton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdus-Saboor et al., 2016</a>). In our assay (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), we crossed a mouse that had one allele expressing Cre recombinase under the Olfr151 promoter, M71-IRES-Cre, to a mouse that had the Cre inducible fluorescent reporter Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato (<a href=\"#bib48\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>). In this mouse, any OSN expressing the M71-IRES-Cre allele at any point in time, would give rise to the permanent expression of tdTomato even if the OSN went on to express a different OR gene. We counted the number of tdTomato positive neurons that were also Olfr151 positive (double positive), which reflect the OSNs that initially chose as well as stably express Olfr151. OSNs that were tdTomato positive but not Olfr151 positive are the ones that switched their initial gene choice. We found that only 17% of tdTomato positive cells from RTP1,2DKO OE (n\u00a0=\u00a024/140 neurons) also express Olfr151 in comparison to 31% OSNs from the wild-type (n\u00a0=\u00a079/258 neurons) (p&lt;0.05, Fisher\u2019s exact test) and 38% (n\u00a0=\u00a066/172 neurons) in the heterozygotes (p&lt;0.05, Fisher\u2019s exact test) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013C</a>).

                                "text": "Previous studies have suggested the UPR protein nATF5 is induced once an OSN starts actively expressing an OR and is lost when OR expression is stabilized (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dalton et al., 2013</a>). Our results show an expanded expression of nATF5 in RTP1,2DKO OSNs, suggesting persistent UPR during OR gene choice. Importantly, the frequency of co-localization between nATF5 and uORs increases in RTP1,2DKO whereas this increase is not observed for oORs. This suggests that the persistent UPR phenotype observed in RTP1,2DKO is due to the OSNs that express uORs resulting in unstable OR gene choice for these OSNs. This is reinforced by our observation that OSNs initially expressing Olfr151, a uOR, are more likely to terminate their expression in RTP1,2DKO mice. We present a model for the role played by RTP1 and RTP2 in the gene choice made by an OSN (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). In our model, the RTPs suppress UPR response by allowing ORs to exit the ER and be transported to the plasma membrane. uORs are not trafficked to the cell surface in the absence of the RTPs, giving rise to persistent UPR in the OSNs that express them; as a consequence, destabilization of the initial OR gene choice leads to cell death or to the stabilization of another OR. In contrast, oORs are trafficked to the cell surface as functional proteins in the absence of the RTPs, allowing these OSNs to terminate UPR and stabilize gene expression. Although we cannot rule out that RTPs themselves play a role in the elimination of the UPR response, the lack of increase in nATF5 observed in OSNs expressing oORs in RTP1,2DKO suggests interaction between the RTPs and the UPR pathway through ORs. Even for OSNs expressing oORs and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, UPR is likely to be induced in the initial stage (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dalton et al., 2013</a>). Recent reports utilizing single cell RNA-Seq suggest that immature OSNs express as many as 12 ORs at low levels but mature OSNs only show the expression of one dominant OR (<a href=\"#bib70\">Saraiva et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hanchate et al., 2015</a>). Low-level expression of uORs precedes the expression of the RTPs and may be sufficient to trigger UPR in the developing OSNs. Alternatively, both oORs and uORs induce UPR at the initial stage."

Irrespective of this our data show greater gene instability for Olfr151 expression without the RTPs.

Previous studies suggest that anosmic mice often die in the first few days after birth (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brunet et al., 1996</a>), but the RTP1,2DKO mice seem to have the\u00a0sufficient olfactory ability for postnatal development. Our data show that OSNs expressing oORs are likely to mature and be functional in RTP1,2DKO, explaining the residual responses observed in the mutant. These OSNs become more abundant in the mutant OE as the mouse ages indicating that these ORs help maintain the olfactory ability of these mice. It will be interesting to assess olfactory-mediated behaviors of the RTP1,2DKO mice in which only a minor fraction of the ORs are functional, since this could address a fundamental question of why most mammals have so many ORs."

These tdTomato-positive glomeruli could be formed by OSNs that initially chose Olfr151 and then switched and/or stabilized the expression of the same OR, presumably an oOR. Previous reports have shown that OR gene switching tend to take place within the same gene locus (<a href=\"#bib67\">Roppolo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Pacifico et al., 2012</a>) leading us to test the hypothesis that the tdTomato-positive axons forming these glomeruli in RTP1,2DKO mice could be stabilizing the expression of Olfr143, an oOR near the Olfr151 gene locus. However, we found no tdTomato-positive OSNs that also expressed Olfr143. This suggests that at least a portion of tdTomato positive OSNs stabilize the expression of the same OR, which is probably an oOR other than Olfr143. Further investigation of the identities of tdTomato-positive OSNs could further our understanding of the OR gene switching mechanism."

Probes against their ORFs were prepared by the addition of the T3 start site to the 3\u2019 end of the pCI plasmid primer followed by incorporation of digoxigenin (DIG) using T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) and alkaline degradation to get labeled probes of around 200 bp. Slides were prepared as described above and fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min and washed twice in PBS. They were acetylated in 1.2% triethanolamine and dropwise addition of acetic acid. They were washed in PBS for 5 min and prehybridized in buffer for an hour in large plates soaked in 5XSSC and 50% formamide at 58\u00b0C. 1 \u03bcl of the aforementioned labeled probe in 200 \u03bcl of the prehybridization buffer was pipetted on to the slides and covered with a layer of parafilm and kept overnight at 58\u00b0C. The slides were thoroughly washed in 5XSSC and then in 0.2XSSC twice for 30 min, 5 min in PBS and then blocked for an hour. The slides were stained with alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody against DIG (Roche) for an hour and then kept in development buffer for 5 min before being subject to NBT-BCIP in development buffer overnight. Slides were then stained with bisbenzimide and mounted in Mowiol as described above."

The authors' group previously identified RTP1 and RTP2, which are specifically expressed in OSNs and promote surface expression of ORs in heterologous systems (Saito et al., Cell 2004). The authors now address the function of RTP1 and RTP2 in vivo by using RTP1,2 double knockout mice. Generation of the double knockout is not trivial as the two genes are 500 kb apart on the same chromosome. The authors achieved this by consecutive manipulation of the same ES cell. The authors show that OR proteins, at least for OR M71, accumulated in the soma and do not traffic to the dendrite and cilia in RTP1,2(-/-) OSNs, thus demonstrating that RTP1 and RTP2 are necessary for proper OR trafficking in OSNs. Consistently, RTP1,2(-/-) olfactory epithelium exhibits substantially reduced odor response, and M71 OSNs exhibit axon targeting defect. The authors also show that the RTP1,2(-/-) OE has less mature OSNs, increased cell death and altered representation of OR transcripts with about half of OR genes being downregulated and, very interestingly, 8% OR genes upregulated. The authors further conducted experiments examining the unfolded protein response, a process that has been suggested to play roles in OR gene choice, by correlating OR expression with nATF5 translation and the stability of OR gene choice by a clever lineage tracing strategy. The results of these experiments support a role of RTP1,2 in alleviating UPR and stabilizing OR gene choice for ORs that are dependent on RTP for surface trafficking."

This evidence, combined by the selective expression of these proteins in OSNs, suggest that a similar important role exists in vivo. Previous evidence from several laboratories, including the author, suggest that RTPs are required for, or contribute significantly to, the plasma membrane trafficking of some ORs expressed from CMV promoters in modified HEK cells while other ORs can achieve significant levels of surface expression in the absence of these proteins. Presumably, in these heterologous cell lines the process of OR choice is not operative. Given the requirement for trafficking of ORs to OSN surface membranes to achieve proper axon targeting and cell survival, the most likely explanation is that RTPs produce the observed selective enrichment of some ORs (oORs) over others (uORs) through a passive mechanism."

Over time, this will enrich the tissue for the observed subset of all ORs. Other data, including the findings from b-2 AR are consistent with this model. Finally, the persistent expression of nATF5 in the M71-expressing population of cells reflects the fact that these cells are immature and fated to shortly die. This model contrasts with that proposed in the Abstract and the body of conclusions of the paper \u2013 \u201cWe present a model in which developing OSNs exhibit unstable OR expression until they choose to express an OR that exits the ER. Our study sheds light on the new link between OR protein trafficking and OR transcriptional regulation\u201d.

For this study, the authors appear to have conflated the two. It is not clear to what extent the redistribution of OR expression reflects the change in receptor gene choice at single cell level per se. There are two potential mechanisms that can result in the underrepresentation of some ORs and overrepresentation of others at the population level. First, RTPs have direct impact on receptor gene choice at individual cell levels, by facilitating receptor protein transport and stabilizing receptor gene expression. In the absence of RTPs, OR gene expression is only stabilized for receptors that do not require RTPs for surface expression is expressed. In this scenario, the cell keeps switching ORs until an oOR is expressed. Therefore, the overrepresentation of oORs is the result of switching that settles on the oOR. Alternatively, protracted instability of receptor gene expression leads to apoptosis, resulting in the loss of cells that express ORs requiring RTP. In this scenario, the redistribution of OR expression is the result of displacement of these dying neurons by those expressing ORs not requiring RTPs. The authors clearly favor the former as they conclude as such, when it is equally possible that the second mechanism can completely or partially account for the observations."

This evidence, combined by the selective expression of these proteins in OSNs, suggest that a similar important role exists in vivo. Previous evidence from several laboratories, including the author, suggest that RTPs are required for, or contribute significantly to, the plasma membrane trafficking of some ORs expressed from CMV promoters in modified HEK cells while other ORs can achieve significant levels of surface expression in the absence of these proteins. Presumably, in these heterologous cell lines the process of OR choice is not operative. Given the requirement for trafficking of ORs to OSN surface membranes to achieve proper axon targeting and cell survival, the most likely explanation is that RTPs produce the observed selective enrichment of some ORs (oORs) over others (uORs) through a passive mechanism.</i>"

Although it is manifest as population frequency of expression in the OE, receptor choice is fundamentally a process at single cell level. For this study, the authors appear to have conflated the two. It is not clear to what extent the redistribution of OR expression reflects the change in receptor gene choice at single cell level per se. There are two potential mechanisms that can result in the underrepresentation of some ORs and overrepresentation of others at the population level. First, RTPs have direct impact on receptor gene choice at individual cell levels, by facilitating receptor protein transport and stabilizing receptor gene expression. In the absence of RTPs, OR gene expression is only stabilized for receptors that do not require RTPs for surface expression is expressed. In this scenario, the cell keeps switching ORs until an oOR is expressed. Therefore, the overrepresentation of oORs is the result of switching that settles on the oOR. Alternatively, protracted instability of receptor gene expression leads to apoptosis, resulting in the loss of cells that express ORs requiring RTP. In this scenario, the redistribution of OR expression is the result of displacement of these dying neurons by those expressing ORs not requiring RTPs. The authors clearly favor the former as they conclude as such, when it is equally possible that the second mechanism can completely or partially account for the observations.</i>"
