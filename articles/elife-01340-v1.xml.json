We present the 2.3 \u00c5 crystal structure of the extracellular cysteine rich domain (CRD) of vertebrate Smo and show that it binds to oxysterols, endogenous lipids that activate Hh signaling. The oxysterol-binding groove in the Smo CRD is analogous to that used by Frizzled 8 to bind to the palmitoleyl group of Wnt ligands and to similar pockets used by other Frizzled-like CRDs to bind hydrophobic ligands. The CRD is required for signaling in response to native Hh ligands, showing that it is an important regulatory module for Smo activation. Indeed, targeting of the Smo CRD by oxysterol-inspired small molecules can block signaling by all known classes of Hh activators and by clinically relevant Smo mutants."

We present the 2.3 \u00c5 crystal structure of the extracellular cysteine rich domain (CRD) of vertebrate Smo and show that it binds to oxysterols, endogenous lipids that activate Hh signaling. The oxysterol-binding groove in the Smo CRD is analogous to that used by Frizzled 8 to bind to the palmitoleyl group of Wnt ligands and to similar pockets used by other Frizzled-like CRDs to bind hydrophobic ligands. The CRD is required for signaling in response to native Hh ligands, showing that it is an important regulatory module for Smo activation. Indeed, targeting of the Smo CRD by oxysterol-inspired small molecules can block signaling by all known classes of Hh activators and by clinically relevant Smo mutants."

Many such tumors are driven by the unrestrained activation of a membrane-bound protein called Smoothened, which has led to the development and clinical use of small molecules that prevent Hedgehog from activating Smoothened. The existing anti-tumor drugs all bind to the same region of the Smoothened receptor, namely the part that sits within the cell membrane. A second group of molecules, known as oxysterols, can activate Smoothened, but exactly how they do this has been unclear. Now, Nachtergaele et al. have shown that oxysterols bind to a region of the Smoothened receptor that lies outside the cell, and that is rich in the amino acid cysteine."

Even quantitative abnormalities in Hh signaling can lead to human birth defects (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bale, 2002</a>). After development, Hh signaling regulates tissue stem cells and regenerative responses to injury (<a href=\"#bib41\">Machold et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Shin et al., 2011</a>). Aberrant Hh signaling can be oncogenic, and genes encoding Hh pathway proteins can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (<a href=\"#bib69\">Scales and de Sauvage, 2009</a>). The most commonly damaged step in Hh-driven cancers involves the poorly understood interaction between two transmembrane (TM) proteins, Patched 1 (Ptch1) and Smoothened (Smo) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib9\">Briscoe and Therond [2013]</a>). Ptch1, encoded by a tumor suppressor gene, is a 12-pass TM protein that serves as the receptor for Hh ligands, including Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marigo et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Stone et al., 1996</a>). In the absence of Hh ligands, Ptch1 inhibits the function of Smo, a 7-pass TM protein that is encoded by a human oncogene. Shh binds and inactivates Ptch1, unleashing Smo\u2019s activity and allowing the Gli transcription factors to initiate target gene transcription. Despite the fact that Smo has become a drug target in oncology, with an FDA-approved Smo inhibitor in clinical use (<a href=\"#bib83\">Von Hoff et al., 2009</a>) and others in ongoing trials, the mechanism by which Smo is regulated by Ptch1 remains a mystery. Current models suggest that Ptch1, a protein with some homology to bacterial small molecule transporters, regulates Smo through an endogenous ligand whose identity is unknown (<a href=\"#bib19\">Davies et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Taipale et al., 2002</a>)."

Previous work on Smo has largely focused on the 7TM domain, which contains a binding site for cyclopamine, a sterol-like plant alkaloid that was the foundational Hh inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2002a</a>). A battery of subsequent small-molecule screens uncovered a set of exogenous ligands that regulate Smo activity through this site, either as agonists such as SAG or antagonists such as SANT-1 and the FDA-approved Hh-inhibitor Vismodegib (<a href=\"#bib29\">Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Robarge et al., 2009</a>).

Full-length zebrafish Smo was poorly expressed in mammalian cells, precluding tests of its responsiveness to oxysterols in cultured cells. Hh pathway activity underlies the specification of distinct muscle cell types in the zebrafish embryo, in part through the activation of the <i>engrailed2</i> (<i>eng2</i>) gene in subsets of slow-twitch and fast-twitch myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib90\">Wolff et al., 2003</a>). To investigate the in vivo significance of the interaction between 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC and Smo, we treated embryos carrying an eng2a:GFP reporter construct (<a href=\"#bib43\">Maurya et al., 2011</a>) with either 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC or cyclopamine. As expected, cyclopamine treatment suppressed expression of the reporter gene; by contrast, 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC treated embryos showed a significant increase in the number of GFP positive fast twitch muscles compared to vehicle treated embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with this, 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC treated embryos also showed a modest expansion of the expression domain of the endogenous Hh target gene, <i>ptch2</i>. These data show that 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC can induce Hh signaling in the context of a living vertebrate embryo and suggest that the in vitro interaction between zebrafish Smo and 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC induces its activation in vivo."

To investigate the putative oxysterol binding site in the Smo CRD, we calculated the volumes of potential binding pockets in our zSmo CRD structure.

First, the stereochemistry at position 20 that determines the spatial relationship between the ring system and the <i>iso</i>-octyl chain is critical for the ability of 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC to activate Smo, since 20(<i>R</i>)-OHC is inactive. Second, the replacement of the <i>iso</i>-butyl group at the end of the <i>iso</i>-octyl chain with an alkyne group increased Hh-activation potency by \u223c10-fold (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Starting from this high-potency Smo activator 20(<i>S</i>)-yne, we inverted the stereochemistry at position 20 to make 20(<i>R</i>)-yne or oxidized the hydroxyl group to a ketone, changing carbon 20 to a planar <i>sp</i><sup>2</sup> hybridized center, to make 20-keto-yne (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

The alkyne group was an important structural feature required for competition, as both 20(<i>R</i>)-OHC and 20-keto-cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) failed to inhibit the CRD\u201320(<i>S</i>)-OHC interaction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

We hereafter call these molecules oxysterol-based inhibitors or OBIs. This activity profile shows that the OBIs are CRD-targeted partial agonists of Smo that can reduce signaling by Smo activators and by clinically relevant Smo mutants.

Cyclopamine and cyclopamine derivatives (that contain a sterol-like tetracyclic ring structure) do not block Smo ciliary accumulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>) and in fact can drive Smo accumulation in cilia even in the absence of Shh (<a href=\"#bib64\">Rohatgi et al., 2009</a>). On the other hand, non-sterol 7TM antagonists like SANT-1 and Vismodegib prevent Shh-induced Smo accumulation in cilia (<a href=\"#bib64\">Rohatgi et al., 2009</a>). The CRD-targeted OBIs both behaved like cyclopamine in this assay\u2014they induced Smo accumulation in cilia when added alone and also did not block Shh-induced ciliary accumulation of Smo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). This similarity between the OBIs and cyclopamine led us to consider the possibility that cyclopamine might not be a pure 7TM inhibitor like SANT-1 and Vismodegib but instead may also engage the CRD. Indeed, unlike the non-sterol 7TM inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), cyclopamine blocked the interaction between the mSmo CRD-Fc and 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC beads (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>), suggesting that it is capable of binding the CRD in this in vitro assay."

                        "text": "Our work provides both structural and mechanistic insights into the enigmatic CRD of Smo in Hh signaling. The CRD of Fz proteins binds to Wnt ligands. While the Fz CRD is related to the Smo CRD, no protein ligand has been identified to date that directly binds to the Smo CRD, and its role in Smo function has not been defined. In <i>Drosophila</i>, deletion of the Smo ectodomain or the mutation of specific cysteine residues in the CRD completely inactivates the protein (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nakano et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, in cultured mouse cells, \u0394CRD-Smo has basal activity in overexpression experiments (<a href=\"#bib51\">Murone et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Taipale et al., 2002</a>). In zebrafish embryos, \u0394CRD-Smo can rescue phenotypes dependent on low-level signaling but not on high-level signaling, and it shows higher levels of basal accumulation in cilia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aanstad et al., 2009</a>). Our work now shows that the Smo CRD in vertebrates binds to oxysterols and mediates the ability of these lipids to activate Hh signaling. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies revealed that the Smo CRD binds to 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC in the region that was previously identified as the binding site for small hydrophobic molecules in other CRDs, formed by the evolutionary conserved helical bundle of the CRD core. This supports the hypothesis that CRDs evolved from an ancestral domain that sensed hydrophobic molecules (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bazan and de Sauvage, 2009</a>). Our structural analysis showed that the Smo CRD oxysterol binding site is most similar to the palmitoleyl-binding site in Fz CRDs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Janda et al., 2012</a>); however, the binding grooves are built of divergent residues (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that they accommodate different classes of hydrophobic ligands."

Oxysterols and their derivatives regulate Smo through the CRD site, while SANT-1, SAG, and Vismodegib bind to the 7TM segment. Binding of agonists like 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC and 20(<i>S</i>)-yne to the CRD must be communicated to the 7TM helix bundle for transduction across the membrane. Indeed, while the 7TM and CRD sites are separable, the dramatic synergy between 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC and SAG we have previously reported suggests a positive allosteric link between these domains (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nachtergaele et al., 2012</a>). This synergy also implies that 7TM and CRD ligands can bind to Smo simultaneously."

This result was unexpected because oxysterols do not decrease the binding of bodipy-cyclopamine to cells expressing full-length Smo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#bib24\">Dwyer et al., 2007</a>). We believe that this discrepancy is due to the fact that the cell-based bodipy-cyclopamine binding assay is mostly measuring the interaction between cyclopamine and its high affinity (K<sub>d</sub>\u223c10 nM, <a href=\"#bib66\">Rominger et al., 2009</a>) binding site in the 7TM domain. Cell (or membrane) binding assays can often miss lower affinity (\u223c1\u201310 \u03bcM) interactions, which can be detected by ligand affinity chromatography assays (<a href=\"#bib59\">Phizicky and Fields, 1995</a>). It is also possible that cyclopamine binds the CRD more weakly when the CRD is embedded in the context of the whole protein."

One possibility is that cyclopamine can bridge the two ligand-binding sites on Smo and engage both a high-affinity interaction with the 7TM segment and a lower affinity interaction with the CRD. Alternatively, two molecules of cyclopamine could engage the CRD and 7TM sites separately or cyclopamine could be involved in a \u2018hand-off\u2019 interaction between the CRD and the 7TM segments analogous to the manner in which cholesterol is transferred between NPC2 and NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kwon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). While the relevance of this interaction for the inhibition of Smo by cyclopamine in cells remains to be established, the puzzling ability of cyclopamine to induce Smo accumulation in cilia (while inhibiting Smo activity) may be related to its ability to engage the CRD. This represents a third mechanism by which ligands can engage Smo, one that is distinct from pure 7TM and CRD ligands. Interestingly, glucocorticoids have been shown to fall into two distinct classes of Smo modulators\u2014cyclopamine-competitive ligands that presumably bind to the 7TM potentiate signaling and a second class of inhibitors that do not compete with cyclopamine but appear to engage a distinct site (<a href=\"#bib87\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)."

This difference in the degree of Shh-responsiveness may be due to the position of the fluorescent protein tag, differences in the tendency of the YFP and mCherry tags to oligomerize or differences in the expression systems used in the two studies."

Our mutagenesis of the putative oxysterol binding site in the CRD sheds light on the first question. We find mutations in the mSmo CRD (Y134F and G115F, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) that can dissociate the Shh and oxysterol responses. These mutants fail to bind or respond to 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC but can still respond to Shh. The simplest interpretation of these data is that the endogenous Smo ligand regulated by Ptch1 does not bind Smo in precisely the same site as 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC. In fact, we have previously reported (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nachtergaele et al., 2012</a>) that cyclopamine is much less potent against Shh-activated Smo compared to 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC-activated Smo, likely because the conformation adopted by Smo is different in response to these two agonists. Both of these findings suggest that 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC is not the Ptch1-regulated ligand that modulates Smo activity in response to Shh reception. It remains possible that a Shh-regulated ligand binds to the CRD in a manner that is distinct from that of 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC."

In this view, the CRD would serve as a domain that allosterically activates the 7TM helix bundle in response to Shh. Some mutations (Smo Y134F, P168A) that abolish 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC responses do indeed substantially dampen the ability of Shh to activate Smo. The observation that CRD point mutations in Smo that block oxysterol binding also impair signaling by Hh ligands has been used to infer that oxysterol binding is required for physiological Smo signaling (<a href=\"#bib55\">Nedelcu et al., 2013</a>). While this hypothesis has substantial implications for Hh regulation in development and cancer, it remains to be determined if the CRD site in cells is occupied by oxysterols or by a different ligand, or if perturbations in endogenous oxysterol levels can modulate Hh signaling. Finally, testing the activity of oxysterol binding site mutants in the context of embryonic development or Hh-driven tumors is essential for elucidating the physiological function of this site and whether it plays a role in graded, low-level or high-level signaling."

Understanding the structural and mechanistic basis for this partial agonism is an important future goal. Remarkably, the simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-20 converts a potent agonist into a weak partial agonist and an effective inhibitor of signaling. This stereochemical inversion presumably allows the molecule to trap Smo in a poorly active confirmation, likely one similar to that stabilized by cyclopamine, in which Smo is localized in cilia but is inactive. The structures of the OBIs suggest that Smo activation potential depends critically on the spatial orientation between the ring system and the <i>iso</i>-octyl chain of 20(<i>S</i>)-OHC. Regardless of the mechanism, inhibitors targeting the Smo CRD would provide an orthogonal approach to modulate Hh signaling in regeneration and cancer. Partial agonists offer the possibility of blocking unrestrained signaling (such as that seen in cancer) while preserving lower-level, physiological signaling (<a href=\"#bib61\">Riese, 2011</a>). This ability to attenuate Smo activity may be useful since currently used Smo antagonists cause significant side-effects, leading nearly half of the patients in some trials to discontinue treatment (<a href=\"#bib80\">Tang et al., 2012</a>)."

The positions of three selenium atoms were determined using SHELXD (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schneider and Sheldrick, 2002</a>). This solution was used as an input into the AutoSol module of the PHENIX suite (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2002</a>) for phase calculation and improvement. The resulting map was of high quality and allowed tracing of the whole polypeptide chain (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). An initial model was built automatically using RESOLVE (<a href=\"#bib81\">Terwilliger, 2003</a>) and completed manually using COOT (<a href=\"#bib25\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>). Iterative rounds of refinement in autoBUSTER (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blanc et al., 2004</a>), PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2002</a>) and REFMAC (<a href=\"#bib52\">Murshudov et al., 1997</a>) applying non-crystallographic symmetry restraints as well as manual building in COOT (<a href=\"#bib25\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>) resulted in a well-defined model for zSmo ectodomain that included two molecules in the asymmetric unit both composed of residues 41\u2013158 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The zSmo ectodomain N- and C-terminal regions could not be traced due to missing electron density and were not included in the final model. The native structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (<a href=\"#bib45\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) with the SeMet-labeled structure as a search model and refined as described above for the SeMet-labeled protein. Crystallographic and Ramachandran statistics are given in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Stereochemical properties were assessed by MolProbity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Davis et al., 2007</a>). Superposition of CRD structures and root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were calculated for equivalent C\u03b1 atoms using program SHP (<a href=\"#bib76\">Stuart et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Riffel et al., 2002</a>).

The program VOLUMES (RE Esnouf, unpublished) was used with a 1.4 \u00c5 radius probe to analyze the CRD binding grooves of zSmo and Fz8. The analysis of evolutionary conserved residues among the CRDs of the Smoothened family members was based on 80 amino acid sequences of vertebrate Smo CRDs and was mapped onto the zSmo CRD crystal structure using ProtSkin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Deprez et al., 2005</a>)."

Nachtergaele et al. build on previous work from their and other laboratories showing the ability of specific hydroxysterols to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway through interactions with the 7TM protein Smoothened (Smo). In this new work, Nachtergaele and colleagues show that (i) hydroxysterols interact specifically with the N-terminal, extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Smo (and their binding site is thus distinct from the well-characterized antagonist/agonist binding site in the 7 TM region), (ii) hydroxysterols interact with the Smo CRD at a site that homologous to the site on Frizzled CRDs that interacts with the palmitoleyl group attached to Wnt, (iii) hydroxysterol analogs can be created that show partial inhibition of Hedgehog signaling and hold promise as Hedgehog pathway-targeting therapeutics, (iv) interactions between Smo CRDs and hydroxysterols appear to be specific to vertebrate Smos, (v) hydroxysterols can activate Hedgehog signaling in fish embryos, and (vi) determine the 2.3 \u00c5 crystal structure of the Smo CRD from zebrafish."

The Salic group recently published similar results in Nature Chemical Biology and we are aware of a paper in press at Developmental Cell also reporting similar results. There is overlap in many of the experiments and conclusions mapping the oxysterol binding domains of vertebrate Smoothened, the relationship between oxysterol engagement here and the action of inhibitors and activators within the 7 TM domain, and the reasons why <i>Drosophila</i> Smoothened works differently. Actual structural data on the CRD for Smoothened rather than inferred structural information in the Nedelcu based on lipid interactions with related CRDs for Frizzled family members distinguishes the paper under review. However, an actual structure with the CRD bound to oxysterol is not presented. Nevertheless, that all of these authors come to similar conclusions strengthens the impact of their work, and given the importance and interest in this molecule and the pathway it regulates, having more than one excellent report on this topic is no bad thing. Further, there are interesting differences in the behavior of \u201cintelligent\u201d drugs developed from an oxysterol base that adds an intriguing element to the current work."

These data create confusion regarding the interplay the 7 TM and CRD sites). There are also recent data suggesting glucocorticoid interactions from Wang et al. that the authors might bring into the discussion. The authors are encouraged to open up some more in their discussion, making it very clear where their data agrees or disagrees with conclusions in Nedelcu et al., how they interpret disagreement and how they perceive the role of oxysterols in normal HH signaling."

This observation is the basis of our hypothesis that cyclopamine can engage both the CRD and the 7 TM domains. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> is an assay that measures binding of bodipy-conjugated cyclopamine to cells expressing full-length Smo. In this assay (as shown previously) 20(S)-OHC does not block binding of bodipy-cyclopamine to Smo-expressing cells. Thus, we detect competition between 20(S)-OHC and cyclopamine when using the isolated, purified Smo CRD but not when using cells expressing full-length Smo. We believe the difference is because the cell-binding assay is significantly less sensitive than the affinity chromatography assay and is largely reporting on the higher affinity interaction between cyclopamine and the 7 TM site (which cannot be competed with oxysterols). Alternatively, it is possible that cyclopamine binds the CRD more weakly when it is embedded in the context of the whole protein."
