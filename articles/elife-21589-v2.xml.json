Most of our knowledge on adaptation in single cells is based on experiments in anesthetized animals. How responses adapt in awake animals, when stimuli may be behaviorally relevant or not, remains unclear. Here we show that contrast adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex depends on the behavioral relevance of the stimulus. Cells that adapted to contrast under anesthesia maintained or even increased their activity in awake na\u00efve mice. When engaged in a visually guided task, contrast adaptation re-occurred for stimuli that were irrelevant for solving the task. However, contrast adaptation was reversed when stimuli acquired behavioral relevance. Regulation of cortical adaptation by task demand may allow dynamic control of sensory-evoked signal flow in the neocortex."

Most of our knowledge on adaptation in single cells is based on experiments in anesthetized animals. How responses adapt in awake animals, when stimuli may be behaviorally relevant or not, remains unclear. Here we show that contrast adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex depends on the behavioral relevance of the stimulus. Cells that adapted to contrast under anesthesia maintained or even increased their activity in awake na\u00efve mice. When engaged in a visually guided task, contrast adaptation re-occurred for stimuli that were irrelevant for solving the task. However, contrast adaptation was reversed when stimuli acquired behavioral relevance. Regulation of cortical adaptation by task demand may allow dynamic control of sensory-evoked signal flow in the neocortex."

Neural circuits in sensory systems have been shown to reduce responses to sustained stimuli (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adrian and Zotterman, 1926</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Albrecht et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Maffei et al., 1973</a>) or selectively enhance aspects of the sensory input that are relevant to a behavioral task (<a href=\"#bib11\">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ito and Gilbert, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kato et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reynolds and Heeger, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). In visual cortex, neural responses to a sustained stimulus adapt over the course of a few seconds. Thus, a proposed function of adaptation is to redistribute processing resources to behaviorally relevant or novel stimuli. Most experiments on adaptation, however, were carried out in anesthetized animals. While sensory-evoked responses are known to be modulated by task engagement or attention (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ito and Gilbert, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004</a>), it is still unclear if cortical adaptation is modulated by the behavioral relevance of the stimulus."

Consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carandini and Ferster, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Vidyasagar, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Keller and Martin, 2015</a>), we found that the responses of neurons in anaesthetized mouse primary visual cortex (V1) adapt to sustained high-contrast grating stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and that this adaptation depends on local cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">King et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie such contrast adaptation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carandini and Ferster, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Vidyasagar, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Keller and Martin, 2015</a>), including tonic feedforward inhibition mediated by parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Keller and Martin, 2015</a>). Accordingly, we found that PV+ neurons adapt less than putative excitatory neurons and that adaptation is only weakly orientation-specific for both neuron types (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To test if neural responses also adapt in awake mice, we compared adaptation measured in the same neurons using two-photon calcium imaging under anesthesia and during wakefulness. As opposed to data obtained under anesthesia, we found that adaptation was absent and neural activity even increased during sustained grating presentations in awake recordings (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2i\u2013l</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">4</a>). Adaptation was stronger (i.e. slope of adaptation more negative) for almost all cells in anesthetized compared to awake mice (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>). This reversal of adaptation in awake mice could be explained neither by response saturation, nor locomotion, nor eye movements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2i,k</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). We hypothesize that an attentional mechanism could prevent adaptation when a stimulus is of unknown relevance to the animal. If so, adaptation should reappear if mice divert attention away from the stimulus and learn that the stimulus is behaviorally irrelevant."

Moreover, iso- and cross-orientation adaptation had similar effects on the population (see also <a href=\"#bib35\">Stroud et al., 2012</a>). In mouse V1, PV+ neurons are much less selective to a grating of different orientations than excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atallah et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hofer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kerlin et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, an adaptation mechanism based on PV+ neurons would result in adaptation that is only weakly dependent on the orientation of the stimulus. Indeed, adapting putative excitatory cells to their preferred or null (orthogonal to preferred) orientation results in a significant, but small difference in adapted firing rates. Moreover, no difference was found when adapting PV+ cells with either iso- or cross-orientation\u00a0under\u00a0anesthesia (with respect to test orientation). (<b>a</b>) Neural activity was recorded with multi-tetrode arrays in anesthetized mice (same cells as in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). Averaged and normalized responses of tuned putative excitatory and PV+ cells to a moving square-wave grating at 100% contrast presented for 7 s in anesthetized mice. Curves plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM (shading). (<b>b</b>) Adaptation is quantified as the mean decrease in the\u00a0normalized spike rate per second during the stimulus presentation (tuned putative excitatory: 109 cells; PV+: 27 cells; p=0.010; Wilcoxon rank-sum). Bars plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM. (<b>c</b>) The\u00a0neural activity of tuned putative excitatory compared to PV+ cells recorded with two-photon calcium imaging. Averaged and normalized calcium responses to a moving sinusoidal grating at 50% contrast presented for 7 s in anesthetized mice. Curves plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM (shading). (<b>d</b>) Adaptation is quantified as the mean decrease in normalized \u2206F/F per second during the stimulus presentation (tuned putative excitatory: 545 cells; PV+: 78 cells; p=3.7\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum). The initial rise was excluded in the estimation of the slope (see Materials and methods).

The first stimulus was either presented at the optimal (solid traces) or the orthogonal orientation of the neurons (dotted traces). The second stimulus was always presented at the optimal orientation.

(<b>f</b>) Iso-orientation compared to cross-orientation adaptation (50% contrast) of tuned putative excitatory cells measured at 25% or 100% contrast.

Consistent with the lack of adaptation in the passively observing awake mouse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we found that adaptation to the grating stimulus was absent initially. As mice learned to perform the navigation task, however, adaptation of neural responses to the grating stimulus reappeared (\u2018grating-irrelevant\u2019 condition, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e,g,h</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This reappearance of adaptation suggests that mice, as they learned to interact with the task-relevant part of the visual field, diverted attention away from the grating stimulus that contained no task-relevant information. Based on this finding, we predicted that for an identical visual input, but when the grating stimulus is behaviorally relevant, neural responses should not adapt with experience. To test this prediction, we showed a different group of mice a replay of the visual stimulus sequence generated by one of the mice in the grating-irrelevant group but increased the behavioral relevance of the grating stimuli by delivering a water reward at the offset of the grating (\u2018grating-relevant\u2019 condition, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f\u2013h</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). We found that adaptation remained absent over training sessions in the grating-relevant group, despite visual experience being identical to the grating-irrelevant group. Moreover, when mice exhibited anticipatory licking to the reward, neural responses showed an effect opposite to adaptation and activity increased over the course of the stimulus presentation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013i</a>). We verified that the differences in adaptation between the grating-relevant group and the grating-irrelevant group cannot be explained by learning-related changes in mean running speed, time spent running or number of saccades (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2j\u2013l</a>). These results suggest, therefore, that in behaving animals contrast adaptation is modulated bidirectionally by stimulus relevance (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2f,i</a>)."

Inset: Average anticipatory lick frequency (\u22120.5\u20130 s) is significantly higher in session five compared to session one in these two animals (session 1: 111 trials, session 5: 144 trials, p&lt;10<sup>\u22124</sup> and session 1: 146 trials, session 5: 143 trials, p&lt;10<sup>\u221210</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum). (<b>b</b>) Same as <b>a</b>, but for the animals with no significant increase in anticipatory licking (session 1: 145 trials, session 5: 144 trials, p=0.093; session 1: 108 trials, session 5: 131 trials, p=0.083; session 1: 108 trials, session 5: 135 trials, p=0.20 and session 1: 144 trials, session 5: 135 trials, p=0.49; Wilcoxon rank-sum). (<b>c</b>) Average pre-reward lick frequency (\u22120.5\u20130s) for all animals over all sessions. (<b>d</b>) Averaged responses of tuned excitatory cells of the same animals as in <b>a</b>, to a moving sinusoidal grating (displayed in the probe patch) for sessions 1 and 5. Ten percent of the neurons were excluded to match the initial conditions of the grating-relevant traces to the grating-irrelevant traces (see Materials and methods for details). Note that this did not change the results. Curves plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM (shading). (<b>e</b>) Averaged responses of tuned excitatory cells of the same animals as in <b>b</b>, to a moving sinusoidal grating (displayed in the probe patch) for sessions 1 and 5. Ten percent of the neurons were excluded to match the initial conditions of the grating-relevant traces to the grating-irrelevant traces (see Materials and methods for details). Note that this did not change the results. Curves plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM (shading). (<b>f</b>) Traces show the differences in averaged responses of tuned excitatory cells between session 1 and 5 for the three conditions: grating-irrelevant; grating-relevant without anticipatory licking; and grating-relevant with anticipatory licking. (<b>g</b>) Slopes of adaptation of the same cells as in <b>d</b> and <b>e</b> are shown. For reward anticipating mice, the slope significantly increases from the first to the following sessions (putative excitatory: 77 cells; p=0.0022; Wilcoxon signed-rank). For the non-anticipating mice, the slope did not show any significant difference from the first to the following sessions (putative excitatory: 226 cells; p=0.45; Wilcoxon signed-rank). The trials of each session were divided into four quarters. The vertical dashed lines separate the individual sessions. The solid curve is an exponential fit to the data. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SEM. (<b>h</b>) Same as <b>g</b> but for mean response to the grating. For reward anticipating mice, the mean response significantly increases from the first to the following sessions (putative excitatory: 77 cells; p=0.020; Wilcoxon signed-rank). For the non-anticipating mice, the mean response did not show any significant change from the first to the following sessions (putative excitatory: 226 cells; p=0. 23; Wilcoxon signed-rank). (<b>i</b>) Bar plot shows the mean response difference (session 5 \u2013 session 1) for the three traces in <b>f</b>. Reward anticipating mice have a significantly larger response difference compared to mice under grating-relevant condition (77 cells and 332 cells, respectively; p&lt;10<sup>\u22124</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum) or non-anticipating mice (77 cells and 226 cells, respectively; p=9.0\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>; Wilcoxon rank-sum). There is no significant difference between grating-irrelevant and non-anticipating mice (332 cells and 226 cells, respectively; p=0.13; Wilcoxon rank-sum). (<b>j</b>) Proportion of time spent running over sessions for grating-irrelevant and grating-relevant conditions. The time spent running is not significantly different for the grating-irrelevant compared to the grating-relevant condition (7 and 6 mice; session 1: p=0.84; session 2: p=0.18; session 3: p=0.53; session 4: p=0.45; session 5: p=0.23; Wilcoxon rank-sum). Curves plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM (shading). (<b>k</b>) Same as <b>j</b>, but for mean speed. The mean speed is not significantly different for the grating-irrelevant compared to the grating-relevant condition (7 and 6 mice; session 1: p=0.84; session 2: p=0.45; session 3: p=0.95; session 4: p=0.84; session 5: p=0.29; Wilcoxon rank-sum). Curves plotted as mean \u00b1 SEM (shading). (<b>l</b>) Same as <b>j</b> but for saccade frequency. The saccade frequency is not significantly different for the grating-irrelevant compared to the grating-relevant condition (7 and 6 mice; session 1: p=0.63; session 2: p=0.84; session 3: p=0.53; session 4: p=0.45; session 5: p=0.073; Wilcoxon rank-sum).

The probe consisted of 4 evenly spaced shanks, spanning 600 \u03bcm of visual cortex in a medial-lateral plane. Each shank contained eight electrode sites, split between two tetrode configurations that were separated by a vertical distance of 150 \u03bcm. A reference electrode was also inserted into the cortex, away from the recording site, via a separate craniotomy. In order to target superficial cortical layers, the array was slowly lowered until visually responsive neurons were first encountered. Visual responsiveness was assessed online from multi-unit PSTHs obtained during full-field flash stimuli. Signals were digitized at a sampling frequency of 25 kHz (Tucker Davis Technologies,\u00a0Florida, RZ2 Bioamp processor). For the optogenetic stimulation of the PV+ cells, illumination (470 nm) was provided by a high-power LED light source (Thorlabs,\u00a0New\u00a0Jersey), and directed via a fiber optic cable (400 \u03bcm, Thorlabs) which was positioned 3\u20134 mm from the surface of the cortex, where it dispersed to cover an area approximately 3 mm in diameter.

The position of the monitor with respect to the mice was kept constant in the following two-photon experiments. In a circular region with a diameter of 10\u00b0 in the center of the monitor, a square-wave grating was presented for 5 s. Reflectance images were collected through a 4x objective (Olympus,\u00a0Japan) with a CCD camera (Toshiba,\u00a0Japan, TELI CS3960DCL). Intrinsic signal changes were analyzed as fractional reflectance changes relative to the prestimulus average. Injections of the calcium indicator were made based on the intrinsic signals."

The treadmill, eye-tracking and visual stimulation have been described previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Leinweber et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dombeck et al., 2007</a>). Briefly, head-restrained mice ran on a spherical air-supported treadmill. Throughout all imaging sessions, we measured the trajectories of the mice in the tunnel and eye\u00a0movements with a CMOS based video camera at 30 Hz (Imaging Source,\u00a0DMK 22BUC03). Mice were learning to use a part of the visual field to navigate to a target location in a virtual reality environment. Each mouse had five training sessions on consecutive days (sessions were spaced by 16\u201332 hr). Starting two days before the first experimental session, mice were water restricted and given a total of at least 1 ml water daily. The\u00a0weight of the mice was measured daily before and after the training sessions. Before each session, orientation tuning was measured (4 s grating interleaved with 4 s grey screen). During the training session, movement in the virtual tunnel was coupled to the movements of the mice on the spherical treadmill. Mice were trained to orient and run to the end of the tunnel for a water reward (~10 \u00b5l per reward) and were immediately teleported back to the start after passing the end of the tunnel. The difficulty of the task (length of the tunnel) was increased during learning to keep the number of rewards approximately constant (~100 per session). Fraction of time spent running across sessions was kept approximately stable by applying occasional air-puffs. Throughout all imaging sessions, we presented a horizontal sinusoidal moving grating (both directions) at 100% contrast in a circular patch (50 degrees in diameter) centered on the retinotopic location of the recording site (45 degrees to the left from the point of view of the mice). This probe patch took up only about an eighth of the entire field of view of the toroidal screen (approximately 200 degrees horizontally, 90 degrees vertically). Grating presentations in the probe patch lasted 10 s (120\u2013163 repetitions per session) and were interspersed with random intervals of grey (10\u201320 s).

One potential concern with a choice of paradigm in which the animal has control of the visual flow feedback in the grating-irrelevant condition is that the difference between predicted and actual visual feedback in the probe patch could result in a\u00a0mismatch response (<a href=\"#bib22\">Keller et al., 2012</a>). Mismatch responses are confined to spatially localized regions in visual space that align to the visual retinotopy (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</a>). For this reason, grating-relevant and grating-irrelevant conditions were designed to have an\u00a0equivalent visual flow mismatch in the retinotopic region of the probe patch. Therefore, any potential influence of mismatch responses is equivalent in both conditions. Moreover, neurons are either mismatch responsive, visually driven, or driven by a combination of both (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</a>). The neurons we select for in our analysis are the most visually responsive neurons and hence are unlikely to respond to mismatch (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</a>)."

Overall, the study addresses an interesting and important question: might adaptation act as a mechanism to dynamically modulate the gain of cortical responses to relevant vs irrelevant stimuli? They conclude that adaptation might work in this way. The authors primarily rely on two photon calcium imaging from unidentified L2/3 cells in the anesthetized, awake/na\u00efve, and awake/trained mice. Their first result is a striking difference in the contrast adaptation between awake and anesthetized conditions, finding much weaker adaptation in awake/na\u00efve mice. Their second, perhaps more interesting result, is that adaptation in awake conditions reappears for stimuli that become 'irrelevant' over a training task, but then can disappear when that same stimulus becomes 'relevant'. The behavioral paradigm the authors use to make this conclusion is a bit problematic. To measure responses for 'irrelevant' stimuli a grating is presented over the imaged area's receptive field, while the rest of the visual field is a feedback controlled virtual reality environment. I understand why the authors set it up this way, but this necessarily leads to an optic flow mismatch for the receptive field portion. Since prior experiments have shown that optic flow mismatch can strongly modulate V1 responses in mouse, I wonder if this contributed to the effects observed here. To then test adaptation for 'relevant' stimuli, some mice are trained on a movie generated from the 'irrelevant' visual data (from a different mouse) and given a water reward immediately after the previously 'irrelevant' grating appears, presumably providing some 'relevance' as it should act as a classical conditioning cue \u2013 which seems to be supported by the anticipatory licking. However, while a clever design, the interpretation is a bit muddied again by the complete mismatch between the virtual visual data and any movement (or lack of movement) of the mouse. It seems like a far simpler and more conventional behavioral paradigm in which a grating is either predictive of reward or not would be much easier to interpret, than a virtual reality system that engages optic flow and locomotion related circuits. Thus, I find the data interesting, but the confusing nature of the behavioral paradigm makes the conclusions the authors propose to draw not entirely convincing."

If this were true, then PV neuron activity should also strongly depend on the relevance of the grating stimulus during the behavioral paradigm. Was this true? Perhaps the authors do not have this data, but labeling the PV cells with a reporter would make this trivial, and substantially add to any proposed mechanism for adaptation. Alternatively, these experiments could just as easily be done with extracellular probes and analysis of FS units. Of course, the synapse between PV neurons and excitatory neurons is known to show strong adaptation and changes in synaptic adaptation could well be important as well, even if adaptation at the level of spiking does not correlate well with stimulus relevance."

In those experiments, there was adaptation not facilitation to exposure to high contrast patterns before behavioral tests. It is not clear how the present results could explain pattern adaptation in those old experiments. Adaptation is also used as a tool frequently in fMRI experiments on awake humans, and again it is not clear how the present results in mouse V1 are consistent with those many adaptation experiments in awake humans. The authors should address this question and explain what they think the relevance of their results is to prior results on human adaptation."

Taking these two things together suggests that only local mismatch (which is identical in both conditions) would influence mismatch responses in the retinotopic region of our probe patch.

Alternatively, these experiments could just as easily be done with extracellular probes and analysis of FS units.

On the other hand, considering changes in adaptation of inhibitory interneurons as potential mechanism as suggested by the reviewer is interesting. In fact, we have a dataset from experiments in VGAT animals (where we have monitored activity of inhibitory neurons) to argue the behavioral modulation of adaptation cannot easily be explained by changes in inhibitory adaptation \u2013 hence the source of this signal is unlikely to be local. In these experiments, we find that inhibitory neurons essentially follow the activity of putative excitatory cells.
