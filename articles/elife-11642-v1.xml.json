Here we show that the <i>osm-9</i> TRPV channel gene is a target of developmental programming and is down-regulated specifically in the ADL chemosensory neurons of postdauer adults, resulting in a corresponding altered olfactory behavior that is mediated by ADL in an OSM-9-dependent manner. We identify a <i>cis</i>-acting motif bound by the DAF-3 SMAD and ZFP-1 (AF10) proteins that is necessary for the differential regulation of <i>osm-9,</i> and demonstrate that both chromatin remodeling and endo-siRNA pathways are major contributors to the transcriptional silencing of the <i>osm-9</i> locus. This work describes an elegant mechanism by which developmental experience influences adult phenotypes by establishing and maintaining transcriptional changes via RNAi and chromatin remodeling pathways."

Here we show that the <i>osm-9</i> TRPV channel gene is a target of developmental programming and is down-regulated specifically in the ADL chemosensory neurons of postdauer adults, resulting in a corresponding altered olfactory behavior that is mediated by ADL in an OSM-9-dependent manner. We identify a <i>cis</i>-acting motif bound by the DAF-3 SMAD and ZFP-1 (AF10) proteins that is necessary for the differential regulation of <i>osm-9,</i> and demonstrate that both chromatin remodeling and endo-siRNA pathways are major contributors to the transcriptional silencing of the <i>osm-9</i> locus. This work describes an elegant mechanism by which developmental experience influences adult phenotypes by establishing and maintaining transcriptional changes via RNAi and chromatin remodeling pathways."

In mammals, this 'cellular memory' of early life stress has been shown to correlate with behavioral phenotypes that persist into adulthood (<a href=\"#bib93\">Weaver et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">McGowan et al., 2009</a>). For example, transcription levels of the <i>glucocorticoid receptor</i> (GR) gene in the mouse hippocampus are programmed by the maternal care behaviors of the mother towards her pups during the first postnatal week (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fish et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Weaver et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Szyf, 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib80\">2008</a>). High maternal care behaviors (such as frequent licking and grooming) lead to high GR expression and low stress responses in the pups as adults, whereas low maternal care results in increased DNA methylation, transcriptional silencing of the GR gene, and high stress responses. Intriguingly, this mechanism of gene regulation appears to be conserved in humans, as childhood adversity correlates with increased transcriptional silencing of the GR gene and mental disorders in adults (<a href=\"#bib50\">McGowan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Labont\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Labonte et al., 2012</a>).

The <i>C. elegans</i> life cycle is regulated by environmental cues during a critical period in the first larval stage. If conditions are favorable (low temperature, high food availability, low pheromone concentrations), worms continue to develop through four larval stages to become reproductive adults (control adults, CON). However, if conditions are unfavorable, worms enter the alternative stress-induced dauer diapause stage (<a href=\"#bib23\">Golden and Riddle, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">1984</a>). The <span class=\"underline\">da</span>uer <span class=\"underline\">f</span>ormation (<i>daf</i>) decision is regulated by the differential expression of conserved insulin and TGF-\u03b2 pathways in sensory neurons in response to environmental conditions (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib17\">Fielenbach and Antebi, 2008</a>). Once conditions improve, dauer animals re-enter the reproductive cycle and continue development to become reproductive adults (postdauer adults, PD). We have shown previously that CON and PD adults retain a cellular memory of their developmental history through changes in gene expression, genome-wide chromatin state, and life history traits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hall et al., 2010</a>). In addition, these altered adult phenotypes are in part dependent on endogenous small interfering RNA pathways (endo-siRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hall et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "In recent years, our knowledge of <i>C. elegans</i> endo-siRNA pathways and their gene targets has increased substantially. Endo-siRNAs are ~20 to 30 nt in length, antisense to coding transcripts, and are categorized into two major groups based on their biogenesis pathways (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gent et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Vasale et al., 2010</a>). Primary endo-siRNAs are 26 nt long, have a characteristic 5\u2019 monophosphate, and are derived from Dicer processing of double-stranded\u00a0RNA template (26G-siRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib86\">Vasale et al., 2010</a>). In somatic tissue, biogenesis of ERGO-1 class 26G-siRNAs is dependent upon the <i><span class=\"underline\">e</span>nhanced <span class=\"underline\">R</span>NA<span class=\"underline\">i</span></i> (ERI) complex, which consists of the core proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) RRF-3, Dicer-related helicase DRH-3, and Tudor domain-containing protein ERI-5 that associate with Dicer DCR-1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duchaine et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pavelec et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gent et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Thivierge et al., 2012</a>). Through an unknown mechanism, 26G-siRNAs stimulate the production of secondary endo-siRNAs, which are 22 nt in length, have a 5\u2019 triphosphate, and\u00a0are produced through reverse transcription of mRNA templates by RdRPs (22G-siRNAs) (<a href=\"#bib78\">Smardon et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Simmer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maine et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Vought et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">She et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Vasale et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Pak et al., 2012</a>). Downstream effector functions of 22G-siRNAs, such as mRNA degradation or chromatin remodeling, are mediated by their associated <i><span class=\"underline\">w</span>orm-specific <span class=\"underline\">A</span>r<span class=\"underline\">go</span>naute</i> protein (WAGO) in the cytoplasm or nucleus (<a href=\"#bib96\">Yigit et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, <i>Mutator</i> proteins have been shown to be essential for the biogenesis and siRNA amplification of AGO ERGO-1 class 26G- and WAGO class 22G-siRNAs (<a href=\"#bib98\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Phillips et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">2014</a>). Although components of the <i>Mutator</i> complex are expressed throughout the worm, their functions and cellular localization are specific to the germline or soma (<a href=\"#bib67\">Phillips et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">2014</a>). Despite our understanding of endo-siRNA biogenesis, how siRNAs target and regulate endogenous genes, particularly in response to environmental cues, is poorly understood."

We identify a <i>cis</i>-acting motif bound by the DAF-3 SMAD and ZFP-1 (AF10) proteins that is necessary for the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD adults and demonstrate that both chromatin remodeling and endo-siRNA pathways are major contributors to <i>osm-9</i> regulation.

We used a transgenic strain expressing GFP in ADL neurons under a promoter whose expression is unaffected upon dauer passage (<i>sre-1</i>p::<i>gfp</i>) to identify the correct neuron and to quantify the <i>gfp</i> mRNA molecules present as a control (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). For both the <i>osm-9</i> and <i>gfp</i> smFISH probes, we observed that the fluorescent foci within ADL exhibited unequal sizes and intensities; thus, we were not confident that we could resolve the number of individual mRNA molecules simply by counting the number of smFISH loci. Instead, we quantified the fluorescence intensities of ADL neurons as a measure of the <i>osm-9</i> and <i>gfp</i> mRNA molecules present. We found that ADL neurons in CON adults exhibited significantly greater mean and maximum fluorescence intensities for the <i>osm-9</i> mRNA probes compared to PD adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, fluorescence intensities for the <i>gfp</i> mRNA probes exhibited overall similar mean and maximum fluorescence levels for PD compared to CON adults (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

To address this question, we allowed wild-type embryos to hatch on plates containing crude pheromone as previously described (<a href=\"#bib55\">Neal et al., 2013</a>). Animals that bypassed dauer entry and animals that entered the dauer stage were recovered separately and examined for <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in adults. We found that animals that bypassed dauer entry when exposed to high concentrations of dauer pheromone continued to express GFP in ADL neurons, similar to CON animals in our egg plate preparation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, animals that passed through the dauer stage exhibited the expected decrease in <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in ADL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Similarly, animals that were transiently starved in early development continued to express GFP in ADL if they bypassed the dauer stage, but exhibited decreased GFP expression following passage through dauer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results indicate that the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> in adults is dependent on passage through the dauer stage regardless of the environmental trigger inducing dauer entry."

Wild-type hermaphrodites avoid high concentrations of the dauer pheromone component ascr#3; this avoidance behavior requires the OSM-9 and OCR-2 TRPV channels in the ADL neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jang et al., 2012</a>). We hypothesized that if the endogenous <i>osm-9</i> gene were down-regulated in ADL neurons of PD animals, these animals would fail to avoid ascr#3 similar to <i>osm-9</i> mutants. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of wild-type and <i>osm-9</i> mutant CON and PD adults to avoid 100 nM ascr#3 using drop-test assays (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hilliard et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jang et al., 2012</a>). We observed that wild-type PD adults exhibited a significantly reduced avoidance response to ascr#3 compared to CON adults (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, these animals retained the ability to avoid glycerol, an OSM-9-dependent behavior mediated by the ASH neurons, and were attracted to the odorant diacetyl, an OSM-9-dependent behavior mediated by the AWA neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sengupta et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colbert et al., 1997</a>).

Since <i>sre-1</i> expression is not detectably altered upon passage through the dauer stage (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), we predicted that both CON and PD adults expressing <i>sre-1</i>p::<i>osm-9 cDNA::gfp</i> transgene would continue to avoid ascr#3. However, while the transgene rescued the <i>osm-9</i> mutant phenotype in CON animals indicating that the fusion protein is functional, avoidance behavior was again decreased in PD animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We also attempted to rescue the decrease in ascr#3 avoidance in wild-type PD adults by expressing the same <i>sre-1</i>p::<i>osm-9 cDNA::gfp</i> transgene in ADL neurons. Again, we observed ascr#3 avoidance behavior similar to wild-type animals without the transgene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Although our results thus far have indicated that <i>osm-9</i> is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to developmental history, these results suggest that silencing mechanisms might also target the <i>osm-9</i> coding sequences or mRNA, or alternatively, additional genes contributing to the ascr#3 behavior."

Using bioinformatics-based analyses of <i>osm-9</i> upstream regulatory sequences, we identified a 29 bp motif (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) that is present in the upstream regulatory sequences of 977 (4.9%) genes in the genome. This conserved sequence was slightly enriched (121 genes, 5.6%; Z-test, p=0.056) in the regulatory regions of genes that were differentially expressed between CON and PD adults (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hall et al., 2010</a>). We also identified an additional motif, a predicted DAF-3 SMAD binding site, located 22 bp upstream of the conserved sequence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Thatcher et al., 1999</a>). We will henceforth refer to this combined regulatory sequence as the PD motif. To test the functional relevance of this motif, we generated a series of <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> transcriptional fusion constructs lacking portions of the <i>osm-9</i> regulatory sequences and examined their expression in ADL neurons of CON and PD adults (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Deletion of the PD motif in the context of the 375 bp <i>osm-9</i> regulatory sequences (Deletion 1) resulted in continued expression of <i>gfp</i> in ADL in PD adults without affecting expression in CON animals, indicating that this <i>cis</i>-regulatory motif is required for the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Deletion of sequences that did not include the PD motif (Deletion 2) resulted in <i>gfp</i> expression changes in PD ADL neurons similar to that observed with the full length <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> transgene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Deletion 3, which contained the 18 bp of <i>osm-9</i> coding sequence in addition to the 375 bp of upstream regulatory sequence, also exhibited down-regulation of <i>gfp</i> expression in ADL neurons of PD adults (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>).

In addition to the potential DAF-3 SMAD binding site, further scrutiny of the <i>osm-9 cis</i>-regulatory sequences yielded potential binding sites for the DAF-12 nuclear hormone receptor (NHR), which functions downstream of TGF-\u03b2 and insulin signaling pathways in the regulation of dauer formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To investigate a potential role of the TGF-\u03b2 and insulin/IGF dauer formation pathways in the regulation of <i>osm-9</i>, we examined <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in CON and PD adults of strains carrying mutations in genes implicated in dauer formation. First, we found that mutations in <i>daf-3</i> SMAD and <i>daf-5</i> SNO/SKI significantly increased the <i>gfp</i> expression observed in PD ADL neurons compared to wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). DAF-3 binds to DAF-5 (<a href=\"#bib11\">da Graca et al., 2004</a>), and may act together as negative regulators at the <i>osm-9</i> locus. In contrast, the <i>daf-7</i> TGF-\u03b2 mutant strain exhibits a partial but significant decrease in <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in ADL neurons of both CON and PD animals compared to wild-type, but expression in PD animals is again down-regulated as compared to CON animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This result suggests that dauer formation, and not reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling alone, is required for the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons. In addition, since DAF-7 TGF-\u03b2 signaling antagonizes DAF-3/DAF-5 function, this result is also consistent with increased DAF-3/DAF-5 activity in a <i>daf-7</i> mutant promoting down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib88\">Vowels and Thomas, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Thomas et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Patterson et al., 1997</a>).

To test whether DAF-3 does indeed bind to the <i>osm-9</i> PD motif, we performed protein immunoprecipitation of DAF-3 from whole animals using a commercially available antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), followed by quantitative PCR (IP-qPCR) in CON and PD adult, dauer, and larval L2/L3 animals.

We also examined DAF-3 enrichment at the <i>daf-8</i> and <i>daf-14</i> promoters as positive and negative controls, respectively, since their regulation by DAF-3 has been characterized previously (<a href=\"#bib62\">Park et al., 2010</a>). Although these results do not address DAF-3 enrichment at the PD motif specifically in ADL neurons, nor the precise binding site of DAF-3 (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), they are consistent with our model that DAF-3 negatively regulates <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons through a direct interaction at the PD motif."

Based on their role in the regulation of <i>osm-9</i> transcription (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), we expected to observe an elimination of the difference between the PD and CON ascr#3 avoidance behavior in <i>daf-3</i> and <i>daf-5</i> mutant strains and a reduced effect in <i>daf-7</i>. Indeed, we observed that mutations in <i>daf-3</i> SMAD and <i>daf-5</i> SNO/SKI genes eliminated the difference between CON and PD avoidance response to ascr#3, consistent with DAF-3 and DAF-5 acting as negative regulators of ascr#3 avoidance in PD animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In addition, a mutation in the <i>daf-7</i> TGF-\u03b2 gene significantly disrupted the PD/CON ascr#3 avoidance levels compared to wild-type, through a decrease in CON adult ascr#3 avoidance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

However, the <i>pdk-1</i> mutant strain and two different mutations in <i>daf-16</i> FOXO, which functions downstream in insulin signaling, exhibited wild-type levels of GFP in ADL neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Furthermore, we tested <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in a <i>daf-12</i> NHR mutant strain, which has a potential binding site (GGTGTGAC) located 362 bp upstream of the <i>osm-9</i> translational start site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ao and Gaudet, 2004</a>). Interestingly, the <i>daf-12</i> mutant also exhibited significantly decreased GFP in CON adults compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Together, these results suggest a model where TGF-\u03b2 and insulin signaling, as well as DAF-12 NHR, promote constitutive <i>osm-9</i> expression in ADL neurons during favorable growth conditions, resulting in ascr#3 avoidance in adult animals. In unfavorable conditions, reduced TGF-\u03b2 signaling in conjunction with dauer formation results in the programmed down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons through the action of DAF-3 and DAF-5, resulting in the failure of adult animals to avoid ascr#3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

                                "text": "Although our data thus far strongly indicate that the developmental programming of <i>osm-9</i> is established by upstream regulatory sequences, the inability to rescue the ascr#3 avoidance behavioral defect in PD adults of wild-type or <i>osm-9</i> mutants upon expression of <i>osm-9</i> coding sequences suggests that the coding sequence may also be a target of developmental programming (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In plants, fungi, and animals, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been shown to act in <i>trans</i> to silence homologous sequences either by inhibiting transcription (transcriptional gene silencing, TGS) or through the destruction of mRNA (post-transcriptional gene silencing, PTGS) (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib7\">Castel and Martienssen, 2013</a>). To examine whether endogenous RNAi pathways play a role in the developmental programming of <i>osm-9,</i> we examined <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in a subset of strains carrying mutations in genes with known functions in RNAi pathways (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These strains included animals mutant for components of the <i>Mutator</i> focus, a protein complex that localizes adjacent to P-granules and is thought to contribute to siRNA amplification in the germline (<a href=\"#bib98\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Phillips et al., 2012</a>). However, whether <i>Mutator</i> proteins form a complex in somatic tissue and their functions in neurons remain unclear. We found that mutations in five of the seven proteins known to associate with the <i>Mutator</i> focus (<i>mut-2/rde-3, mut-14, mut-15, mut-16</i>, and <i>rrf-1</i> RdRP) resulted in a significant increase in GFP expression in PD ADL neurons compared to CON (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In previous work, we identified low abundance siRNAs mapping to the <i>osm-9</i> locus with a bias for exon sequences (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hall et al., 2013</a>), indicative of siRNA biogenesis through the action of RdRPs such as RRF-1 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sijen et al., 2007</a>). To confirm that endogenous RNAi pathways are contributing to the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons, we again performed smFISH to measure <i>osm-9</i> mRNA abundance in ADL neurons of CON and PD adults carrying a mutation in the <i>mut-16</i> gene. For all three trials performed, we observed a significant increase in the mean and maximum fluorescence intensities of PD ADL neurons in <i>mut-16(mg461)</i> strain compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). When the trials were combined, the <i>mut-16(mg461)</i> strain exhibited only a 7% change in mean fluorescence intensity of PD/CON ADL neurons compared to a 42% difference in wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that functional MUT-16 is required for the full down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> mRNA levels in PD ADL neurons. As a control, we also measured <i>gfp</i> mRNA abundance in the <i>mut-16</i> strain and observed no significant differences in mean and maximum intensity levels between CON and PD ADL neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Together, these results indicate a role for the <i>Mutator</i> proteins in the PD control of <i>osm-9</i> expression in ADL neurons."

To address this question, we expressed the <i>mut-16</i> cDNA under an ADL (<i>srh-220</i>p) or ASI (<i>gpa-4</i>p) specific promoter in the <i>mut-16(mg461)</i> strain and examined their ascr#3 avoidance phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We chose to examine MUT-16 function in ASI neurons as well, since <i>daf-7</i> and other TFG-\u03b2 pathway genes are expressed in ASI (<a href=\"#bib69\">Ren et al., 1996</a>). We observed that cell-specific rescue of MUT-16 in ADL partially rescued the ascr#3 avoidance in CON and PD animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

ERGO-1 AGO associates with 26G-siRNAs to target mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm and acts upstream of the 22G-siRNA-mediated NRDE nuclear RNAi silencing complex, which has been shown to promote heterochromatin formation at targeted gene loci in somatic tissue (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gent et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Guang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Vasale et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burkhart et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burkhart et al., 2011b</a>).

Moreover, the ERI complex also plays a role in the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that the <i>Mutator</i> proteins, along with the endo-siRNA ERGO-1/NRDE pathway are playing a role in the developmental programming of <i>osm-9</i>. Consistent with a role for the ERGO-1 and NRDE pathways in the regulation of <i>osm-9</i> expression in PD adults, we found that mutations in <i>ergo-1</i> and <i>nrde-3</i> also resulted in the elimination of ascr#3 avoidance differences between CON and PD adults (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Although we have not shown that <i>osm-9</i> is a direct target of endo-siRNA pathways, these results indicate that the <i>Mutator</i> proteins and ERGO-1/NRDE nuclear silencing pathways play a critical role in the developmental programming of <i>osm-9</i> and mediating the ascr#3 avoidance behavior due to developmental history."

To ask whether functional chromatin remodeling pathways are necessary for the differential expression of <i>osm-9</i> we examined <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in CON and PD animals of strains carrying mutations in genes involved in chromatin remodeling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although both SET-2 histone H3K4 methyltransferase and HDA-2 histone deacetylase act broadly to regulate histone modifications in the genome, their functions are antagonistic and correlate with gene activation or silencing, respectively (<a href=\"#bib77\">Simonet et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hao et al., 2011</a>). We found that mutations in <i>set-2</i> and <i>hda-2</i> resulted in a significant increase in GFP expression in PD ADL neurons compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Thus, our results suggest the possibility that SET-2 and HDA-2 are targeting additional gene loci that play a role in the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons. We also examined the role of ZFP-1 in the regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD adults, since it has been shown to bind chromatin and is predicted to play a role in the regulation of actively expressed genes through interactions with both chromatin remodeling and RNAi pathways (<a href=\"#bib25\">Grishok et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Avgousti et al., 2013</a>). The known function of ZFP-1 is to negatively regulate RNA polymerase II elongation at loci of highly expressed genes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cecere et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, we observed that a mutation in the <i>zfp-1</i> zinc finger protein gene eliminated the developmental programming of <i>osm-9</i>p::<i>gfp</i> expression in ADL neurons by significantly increasing GFP in PD adults (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Thus, ZFP-1 is an interesting candidate to play a role in the connection of the chromatin remodeling and the ERGO-1/NRDE-3 pathways in the developmental programming of <i>osm-9</i>."

Since dauer formation is required for <i>osm-9</i> down-regulation, we hypothesized that DAF-3 SMAD binds to the <i>osm-9</i> promoter during dauer and recruits ZFP-1 and RNAi machinery to the <i>osm-9</i> locus to maintain the silencing to adulthood. To test our hypothesis, we again immunoprecipitated DAF-3 in <i>mut-16(mg461)</i> and <i>zfp-1(ok554)</i> strains and performed qPCR to examine for DAF-3 enrichment at the <i>osm-9</i> DBS. If DAF-3 binds to <i>osm-9</i> first and recruits ZFP-1 and RNAi machinery, we would expect to observe DAF-3 enrichment at the <i>osm-9</i> PD motif in mutant PD adults.

During continuous growth of <i>C. elegans</i> larvae in favorable conditions, DAF-7 TGF-\u03b2 binds to the DAF-1 and DAF-4 receptors, resulting in a signaling cascade where DAF-3 SMAD is inhibited (<a href=\"#bib84\">Thomas et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Patterson et al., 1997</a>).

Our results showed that DAF-3 enrichment at the <i>osm-9</i> PD motif is dependent upon ZFP-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), which may be a direct interaction since both DAF-3 and ZFP-1 are enriched at the DBS in PD adults (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5C</a>).

One question that arose from this observation was how the dauer developmental signal results in establishment of tissue-specific programmed changes in gene expression. DAF-3 SMAD and DAF-5 SNO/SKI are expressed throughout the worm and are required for dauer formation in unfavorable conditions (<a href=\"#bib63\">Patterson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">da Graca et al., 2004</a>). Here, we argue that DAF-3 and DAF-5 not only promote dauer formation, but also establish altered expression levels of genes due to developmental programming. First, we showed that the differential expression of <i>osm-9</i> is dependent upon functional TGF-\u03b2 signaling during dauer formation, and not just upon passage through the dauer stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In addition, we have shown that DAF-3 binds to the PD motif, and is required for the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A,B</a>). Direct regulation by DAF-3 is an attractive model for how developmental history can result in established gene expression changes for target genes such as <i>osm-9</i>. Moreover, competitive binding to the PD motif between DAF-3 and other cell or tissue specific transcription factors can make the developmental programming specific to a cell type (such as ADL) without affecting expression in other cell types (such as AWA). A similar model of regulation by DAF-3 has been postulated for the <i>myo-2</i> gene in the pharynx (<a href=\"#bib82\">Thatcher et al., 1999</a>). TGF-\u03b2 signaling has also been shown to regulate neuronal receptor genes based on environmental cues via DAF-3-dependent and independent mechanisms in ASI, AWC, and interneurons (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nolan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lesch and Bargmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McGehee et al., 2015</a>). Since 977 genes in the genome contain the PD motif and the DAF-3 binding site is enriched in chemoreceptor genes (<a href=\"#bib46\">McCarroll et al., 2005</a>), we predict that DAF-3 might play a larger role in broadly establishing gene expression changes in response to environmental cues. We are currently testing our model by identifying additional proteins that bind to the PD motif in the <i>osm-9</i> gene and by examining expression patterns of other genes containing the PD motif."

Temporal regulation of neuronal gene expression has been shown previously in AWC neurons, whereby DAF-3 establishes expression levels of chemoreceptor genes during early larval stages that are maintained in adults by the homeobox transcription factor ortholog, HMBX-1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lesch and Bargmann, 2010</a>). We propose a similar model where DAF-3/DAF-5 contributes to the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in animals that enter the dauer stage, which is dependent upon functional RNAi pathways (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). At this time, we are unable to distinguish whether the requirement of MUT-16 for DAF-3 enrichment at the PD motif is indirect or direct. Our results are consistent with MUT-16 contributing to the positive regulation of <i>daf-3</i> expression, silencing of <i>osm-9</i> expression, or both (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5D</a>). We detected lowly abundant siRNAs homologous to <i>osm-9</i> in whole animals (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hall et al., 2013</a>); however, the <i>daf-3</i> locus is targeted by significant numbers of siRNAs that require MUT-16 and CSR-1 AGO for biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Claycomb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), which is predicted to positively regulate gene expression by promoting a euchromatic chromatin state at target loci (<a href=\"#bib97\">Youngman and Claycomb, 2014</a>). Furthermore, we find that components of the <i>Mutator</i> focus play a significant role in the differential regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in ADL neurons and modulation of ascr#3 avoidance behavior (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). To date, the localization and function of <i>Mutator</i> proteins in somatic tissue has been unclear, and some evidence suggests that <i>Mutator</i> component MUT-14 only functions within the germline (<a href=\"#bib98\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Phillips et al., 2014</a>). However, MUT-2, MUT-7, and the NRDE silencing complex have been shown to play a role in olfactory adaptation mediated by AWC neurons (<a href=\"#bib38\">Juang et al., 2013</a>), and our results indicate that the <i>Mutator</i> proteins, MUT-2, MUT-14, MUT-15, and MUT-16, and the associated RdRP RRF-1, function to regulate <i>osm-9</i> expression in ADL (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, we show that MUT-15, MUT-16, and RRF-1 contribute to modulation of ascr#3 avoidance behavior, and that MUT-16 is required in ADL neurons for the plasticity of ascr#3 avoidance due to developmental history (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

Since the NRDE complex is associated with transcriptional gene silencing, our results suggest that <i>osm-9</i> regulation in PD ADL neurons by NRDE is more likely to be a direct interaction. We hypothesize that <i>Mutator</i>-amplified siRNAs direct the targeting of the NRDE nuclear silencing complex to the <i>osm-9</i> locus, which results in transcriptional gene silencing of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons. Furthermore, we speculate that siRNAs generated to target the endogenous <i>osm-9</i> locus could also direct targeting of the NRDE complex to the ADL-specific <i>osm-9</i> rescue transgene, resulting in the transcriptional silencing of the <i>osm-9</i> coding sequence in the absence of the upstream regulatory sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Although we have not shown directly that NRDE-3 targets <i>osm-9</i>, regulation by the NRDE complex is an attractive hypothesis, since we have evidence of both RNAi and transcriptional silencing mechanisms playing a role in regulating <i>osm-9</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2,</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4A</a>)."

Dauer pheromone has been shown to have both primer and releaser effects on <i>C. elegans</i> larval development and adult behaviors, respectively (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib43\">Ludewig and Schroeder, 2013</a>). We speculate that it is advantageous to down-regulate <i>osm-9</i> expression in animals that have entered the dauer stage. One possibility is that decreased <i>osm-9</i> expression during dauer results in a failure to respond to ascr#3, allowing worms to exit the dauer stage in areas of local high pheromone concentration. <i>C. elegans</i> animals that enter the dauer stage due to high population density and do not disperse would have their dauer exit suppressed by the local high concentrations of pheromone (<a href=\"#bib23\">Golden and Riddle, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">1984</a>). Although ADL has not been implicated in dauer recovery to date, down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> could allow dauer animals to become more sensitive to changes in their environment and allow faster dauer recovery when conditions improve (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gruner et al., 2014</a>). Second, failure to avoid high concentrations of ascr#3 in postdauer hermaphrodites may serve as a mechanism for increased outcrossing in stressful environments. <i>C. elegans</i> males recover from long periods in the dauer stage at higher rates than hermaphrodites, increasing the opportunities for outcrossing in a postdauer population (<a href=\"#bib53\">Morran et al., 2009</a>). We postulate that down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in postdauer hermaphrodites suppresses their dispersal to avoid high concentrations of pheromone, further increasing the opportunities for outcrossing. Thus, we speculate the differential regulation of <i>osm-9</i> via developmental programming mechanisms potentially serves to suppress both the primer and releaser effects of pheromone in order to promote survival and reproduction in stressful environmental conditions."

Controls were obtained by bleaching gravid adults to NGM plates without egg white. To induce worms by high crude pheromone concentrations, dauer formation assays were performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib55\">Neal et al., 2013</a>). Strains with dauer deficient phenotypes were exposed to a starvation protocol and grown at 25\u00b0C to produce dauers. To induce dauer formation by starvation, well-fed worms were plated onto seeded 100mm NGM plates, and were monitored daily for the depletion of food and the appearance of dauers. Dauer larvae were obtained by treating starved plates with 1% SDS for 24\u2009hr."

The question of what molecular mechanisms trigger and maintain this changes is outstanding. In mammals, the circuits involved and their outputs are complex and poorly understood and thus invertebrate models with very simple circuits underlying imprinted behaviors are very attractive. This paper shows that an imprinted locus can be stably regulated by developmental experience by the action of the repressive co-SMAD DAF-3 binding to a specific region of the promoter. The authors used the <i>osm-9::gfp</i> as a convenient marker to mark this channel in the ADL neuron. Upon dauer formation via any of 3 mechanisms, the <i>osm-9</i> signal in the ADL neuron is eliminated. This ion channel is central to the olfactory sense in the worm, and consistent with this, the postdauer animals show reduced responses to a worm pheromone asc#3. The <i>osm-9::gfp</i> approach is clever, and the paper makes full use of worm genetics to narrow down the promoter region, and the mechanisms of transcriptional silencing in these animals. All three reviewers recognized the importance of the question and agree that the authors took the right approach to answer this question."

I continue to find the observations that developmental history reduces <i>osm-9</i> expression, and concomitant reduced sensitivity to pheromone, very interesting. Unfortunately, many of the experiments requested by one of the reviewers produced equivocal or incomplete results. In some cases, necessary controls were unavailable due to technical problems and time constraints for resubmission to <i>eLife</i>. Here is a case where the paper was actually weakened, rather than strengthened, through peer review.

The options would be to give the authors additional time to complete the missing experiments mentioned in the response to reviewers. Alternatively, the authors could back off from the strong conclusions, remove the incomplete data, and resubmit a paper more narrowly focused on the observations that seem robust, but removing the speculation not supported by the data."

Since a strain carrying <i>sre-1</i>p::<i>daf-3::gfp</i> did not exist, we 1) cloned the ADL-specific <i>daf-3</i> transgene, 2) created stable, extrachromosomal transgene lines, 3) bulked the strains to obtain synchronous stage-specific populations, and 4) performed the IP-qPCR. In order to complete this experiment in a timely manner, we chose to inject wild-type, <i>mut-16</i>, and <i>zfp-1</i> strains directly with the transgene. We regret that we were unable to obtain a wild-type transgenic line on our first attempt, so that the data may be included in this resubmission. We now have this strain, and are performing the ADL-specific DAF-3 IPs currently. If the editors feel that this experiment is pivotal to our manuscript acceptance, we would happily include this data if granted an extension. We approximate ~ 3 weeks would be necessary to complete the ADL-specific IPs in wild-type animals. Instead, we have included the original DAF-3 enrichment data using an anti-DAF-3 antibody (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) with new positive and negative controls. Our results indicate that DAF-3 enrichment at the potential DAF-3 binding site is significantly higher than CON adults. This observation is consistent with our model that DAF-3 binds <i>osm-9</i> after dauer to facilitate silencing."

We were able to detect DAF-3 enrichment above background for the positive control in <i>zfp-1</i>, indicating that our experiment was successful. Interestingly, the results of this experiment indicate the novel finding that DAF-3 enrichment is dependent upon ZFP-1 activity. In addition, our data showed that both DAF-3 and ZFP-1 bind to the DAF-3 binding site region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5C</a>), suggesting the possibility of a direct interaction between these two proteins. However, we did not see enrichment of DAF-3 in the <i>mut-16</i> background, even at the positive control locus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This observation could be due to experiment failure, or alternatively, could reflect the requirement of RNAi pathways to regulate <i>daf-3</i> expression as the reviewers suggested. Biogenesis of siRNAs mapping to the <i>daf-3</i> locus require functional MUT-16 and CSR-1 proteins (Zhang et al. 2011, Claycomb et al. 2009). Since CSR-1 AGO (bound by MUT-16 amplified siRNAs) promotes gene expression, we hypothesize that <i>daf-3</i> expression is decreased in a <i>mut-16</i> background. We have preliminary qRT-PCR data that support this hypothesis using mRNA from whole animals; however, additional experiments would be needed to examine MUT-16 dependent <i>daf-3</i> expression in ADL specifically. Our overall results cannot distinguish whether RNAi pathways affect <i>osm-9</i> regulation by promoting <i>daf-3</i> expression, silencing <i>osm-9</i> expression, or both. Our results examining the contribution of the NRDE complex to <i>osm-9</i> regulation, which promotes transcriptional gene silencing, is consistent with RNAi pathways acting to silence <i>osm-9</i> expression in PD ADL neurons and is not consistent with its potential regulation of <i>daf-3</i>. Thus, our current model is that RNAi pathways promote <i>daf-3</i> expression and silence <i>osm-9</i> expression through the action of different Argonaute proteins in PD ADL neurons. Our new model of <i>osm-9</i> regulation predicts that DAF-3 and ZFP-1 act cooperatively at the <i>osm-9</i> promoter to promote silencing."

First, we examined ZFP-1 enrichment at the <i>osm-9</i> promoter and gene body in CON and PD wild-type animals. We found that ZFP-1 binds to the <i>osm-9</i> gene body in both populations, but shows significant enrichment at the DAF-3 binding site in PD compared to CON (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This interesting result suggests the possibility that ZFP-1 and DAF-3 may be interacting directly in PD ADL neurons to promote silencing of <i>osm-9</i>. Our results showing that DAF-3 enrichment is dependent upon ZFP-1 supports this hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We also examined ZFP-1 enrichment at the <i>osm-9</i> locus in <i>mut-16</i> and <i>daf-3</i> strains, but we were unable to detect ZFP-1 enrichment above background for the positive controls (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). Since the <i>sre-1</i>p::<i>zfp-1::gfp</i> transgene was genetically crossed into these strains and worked well in the <i>zfp-1</i> background (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), we suspect that our unsuccessful experiment in the mutant strains was due to the presence of the endogenous ZFP-1 protein out-competing our tagged version. Ideally, we would need to generate <i>zfp-1; daf-3</i> and <i>zfp-1; mut-16</i> double mutants carrying the transgene to test this hypothesis, but we did not have the time. However, we were able to show that ZFP-1 differentially binds at the <i>osm-9</i> locus in ADL neurons due to developmental history, and contributes to the down-regulation of <i>osm-9</i> in PD ADL neurons."

We have since performed DAF-3 immunoprecipitations in <i>mut-16</i> and <i>zfp-1</i> mutant strains using an \u03b1-DAF-3 antibody, and found that DAF-3 binding at the <i>osm-9</i> locus in postdauer animals is dependent upon functional ZFP-1 and RNAi pathways (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). To our knowledge, this would be the first report of an interaction between DAF-3 with ZFP-1 and RNAi pathways.
