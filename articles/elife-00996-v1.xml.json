Pregnancy causes several changes to the normal breast that raise barriers to transformation, but how pregnancy can also increase cancer risk remains unclear. We show in mice that pregnancy has different effects on the few early lesions that have already developed in the otherwise normal breast\u2014it causes apoptosis evasion and accelerated progression to cancer. The apoptosis evasion is due to the normally tightly controlled STAT5 signaling going astray\u2014these precancerous cells activate STAT5 in response to pregnancy/lactation hormones and maintain STAT5 activation even during involution, thus preventing the apoptosis normally initiated by oncoprotein and involution. Short-term anti-STAT5 treatment of lactation-completed mice bearing early lesions eliminates the increased risk after a pregnancy. This chemoprevention strategy has important implications for preventing increased human breast cancer risk caused by pregnancy."

Pregnancy causes several changes to the normal breast that raise barriers to transformation, but how pregnancy can also increase cancer risk remains unclear. We show in mice that pregnancy has different effects on the few early lesions that have already developed in the otherwise normal breast\u2014it causes apoptosis evasion and accelerated progression to cancer. The apoptosis evasion is due to the normally tightly controlled STAT5 signaling going astray\u2014these precancerous cells activate STAT5 in response to pregnancy/lactation hormones and maintain STAT5 activation even during involution, thus preventing the apoptosis normally initiated by oncoprotein and involution. Short-term anti-STAT5 treatment of lactation-completed mice bearing early lesions eliminates the increased risk after a pregnancy. This chemoprevention strategy has important implications for preventing increased human breast cancer risk caused by pregnancy."

Instead, pregnancy weakened the protective process that culls pre-existing precancerous cells.

In the global context of increasing age at first pregnancy, it has become critical to identify the molecular mechanism underlying increased long-term breast cancer risk in parous women who had a late-age first pregnancy, so that prevention strategies may be developed to reduce this risk. When a very young woman becomes pregnant, her breast epithelia are unlikely to have accumulated cells with oncogenic mutations (<a href=\"#bib12\">Crowley and Curtis, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Nielsen et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lynch, 2010</a>). Normal breast epithelia, following extensive remodeling by a pregnancy, have been reported to become more differentiated, less proliferative, and indolent to tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Medina, 2004</a>). However, why a first pregnancy at an older age stimulates life-long breast cancer incidence remains mysterious. As a woman reaches the age of 35 or older, her breast epithelia are more likely to have accumulated cells with oncogenic mutations and to harbor precancerous early lesions than a woman in her 20s, based on autopsy studies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartow et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Nielsen et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Welch and Black, 1997</a>). The effects of a pregnancy on these preexisting cancer-precursor cells have not been rigorously tested. If pregnancy instigates cancer evolution from these premalignant cells, the result may explain the age-dependent impact of pregnancy on breast cancer."

We have reported intraductal injection of a Rous sarcoma virus-based vector, RCAS, as a means of introducing oncogenes into a small subset of cells in the normally developed mammary gland that has been made susceptible to infection by transgenic expression of the gene encoding the RCAS receptor TVA from the MMTV promoter (MMTV-<i>tva</i>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Du et al., 2006</a>). The transgenic <i>tva</i> is only required for the initial infection, while the oncogene is transcriptionally controlled by the proviral RCAS LTR, which is constitutive and not influenced by reproductive hormones (<a href=\"#bib66\">Toneff et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Using this method, we tested here the effect of a single pregnancy on carcinogenesis from a small number of oncogene-activated mammary cells in the context of normal mammary epithelia and explored the underlying mechanism of, and means to prevent, increased long-term breast cancer risk caused by a pregnancy."

We injected 5\u20137-week-old MMTV-<i>tva</i> mice (MA) intraductally with RCAS (10<sup>8</sup> IUs per gland) expressing either a constitutively activated version of <i>Erbb2</i> (RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Reddy et al., 2010</a>) or <i>Wnt1</i> (RCAS-<i>Wnt1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dunn et al., 2000</a>). This dosage leads to infection of approximately 0.3% of the luminal epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Du et al., 2006</a>). 4 to 7 days later, half of the mice were impregnated and then allowed to lactate for 3 weeks. By introducing the oncogene before exposing the mice to a full-term pregnancy, we ensured that an equal number of cells expressed the oncogene in both parous and control virgin mammary glands. This approach allowed us to examine the effects of pregnancy on preexisting precancerous cells and on breast cancer risk while keeping aging-associated variables constant. While caErbB2 induced tumors much more rapidly than Wnt1, each parous group developed tumors significantly faster than its corresponding virgin control cohort (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and with higher tumor multiplicity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Of note, this experimental design was intended to test the effect of pregnancy on precancerous lesion progression and long-term breast cancer risk, and not on pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC). The great majority of tumors initiated by <i>Erbb2</i> appeared at least 7 weeks after the completion of pregnancy, beyond the equivalent window of time considered to be PABC in women (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borges and Schedin, 2012</a>), and all tumors initiated by <i>Wnt1</i> appeared more than 36 weeks after the completion of pregnancy. In accord with their longer latency, the great majority of tumors arising in our mouse models did not display any of the cardinal features of PABC, including aggressive growth rate, high Ki67, and stromal involvement (data not shown) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schedin, 2006</a>). Therefore, we conclude that pregnancy stimulates the long-term cancer risk from mammary cells that have already acquired an oncogenic mutation."

Tumor growth rates and angiogenesis were comparable between the parous and virgin groups (data not shown), indicating that the impact of pregnancy on tumorigenesis occurs primarily prior to the formation of frank tumors. To identify the effect of pregnancy on premalignant lesions, we compared mammary glands of RCAS-<i>caErbb2-</i>infected mice at 1.5, 5.5, and 8.5 weeks post infection, which are equivalent to pregnancy day 7.5 (P7.5), lactation day 12 (L12), and involution day 10 (I10) in the parous group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). At 1.5 weeks post injection, the number of total early lesions (defined as any hyperplastic ductal foci comprised of more than three layers of epithelial cells that stained positive for the provirus-encoded oncogene product) was similar between the virgin and P7.5 mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), consistent with their similar rates of initial infection. By 5.5 and 8.5 weeks post-viral injection, however, the total number of early lesions was greater in L12 and I10 groups than in the respective age-matched virgin mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). By 8.5 weeks post infection, the average lesion area was also significantly larger in I10 mice than in the age-matched virgin animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). Therefore, we conclude that pregnancy accelerates carcinogenesis by promoting the advancement of early lesions from cells that have already activated oncogenic signaling. We confirmed that these parity-induced effects were not due to incidental increase of RCAS-expressed oncogene (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also demonstrated that this observation was not caused incidentally by a particular vectoring system: using intraductal injection of a lentiviral vector (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bu et al., 2009</a>) to introduce <i>caErbb2</i> to ductal epithelia, we also observed accelerated tumorigenesis in the parous group relative to the virgin group (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Early lesions in P7.5 and virgin control mice had similar proliferative indices based on staining for Ki67 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and pHistone3 (data not shown), suggesting that the already high proliferation in oncogene-activated cells cannot be further elevated by pregnancy. Proliferation remained comparable between the early lesions of L12 mice and those of age-matched virgin mice. It was even lower in the early lesions of I10 mice than in those of age-matched virgin mice, suggesting that the molecular network activated in normal epithelia at involution to arrest the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) also operates in these premalignant cells. Collectively, these results suggest that pregnancy-induced acceleration of carcinogenesis from mutated cells does not result from increased proliferation."

We have reported potent apoptosis induction in mammary early lesions of virgin mice initiated by RCAS-<i>caErB2</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Reddy et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we asked whether this apoptotic reaction was impaired as a result of pregnancy. Early lesions from the above cohorts of RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i>-infected mice were stained for cleaved caspase 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and also examined with the TUNEL assay (data not shown). As expected, apoptosis was activated in the early lesions of virgin mice at all three time points (1.5, 5.5, and 8.5 weeks post infection) compared to normal ducts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>). However, the level of apoptosis was significantly lower in early lesions of the parous group at all three time points than those in early lesions of the respective virgin mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>); it became either comparable to the baseline level in normal ducts during pregnancy and lactation or even significantly lower than that during involution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). These observations demonstrate that with a pregnancy preexisting premalignant mammary cells overcome both the apoptotic response to an oncoprotein and the robust cell death at involution, which normally clears the large mass of cells gained during pregnancy/lactation."

This is because placental lactogen and prolactin (PRL) activate PRLR, leading to the recruitment of Jak2 and Jak2-mediated phosphorylation and activation of STAT5 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hennighausen and Robinson, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haricharan and Li, 2014</a>). At the onset of involution, STAT5 is rapidly deactivated to allow programmed death of excess cells accumulated during pregnancy and lactation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hennighausen and Robinson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kreuzaler et al., 2011</a>). Transgenic expression of constitutively active <i>Stat5</i> mutants in mammary glands leads to increased mammary cell survival, hyperplasia, and even occasional tumors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Iavnilovitch et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vafaizadeh et al., 2012</a>), while <i>Stat5</i> heterozygosity delays mammary tumorigenesis in mice carrying a transgenic oncogene (<a href=\"#bib30\">Humphreys and Hennighausen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ren et al., 2002</a>). pSTAT5 is also detected frequently in human breast early lesions (ductal carcinomas in situ) and to a lesser degree in invasive breast cancers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cotarla et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nevalainen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Peck et al., 2011</a>)."

The average percentage of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells per lesion was significantly higher in the parous mice at P7.5, L12, and I10 than in the corresponding age-matched virgin groups, while cells positive for total STAT5 were readily detectable with comparable frequency in virgin vs parous lesions as expected (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kazansky et al., 1995</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, &gt;70% of the preneoplastic lesions in the parous cohort harbored &gt;5% pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and were thus defined as pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> lesions (this cut-off was chosen because pSTAT5 positivity at this frequency correlated significantly with increased survival as shown below in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), while &lt;25% of the lesions in the virgin cohort were scored pSTAT5<sup>+</sup>.

                                "text": "PRLR is normally deactivated by GSK3\u03b2-initiated phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation as circulating prolactin diminishes at involution (<a href=\"#bib58\">Plotnikov et al., 2009</a>). However, transformed cells frequently phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3\u03b2 and thus can aberrantly maintain PRLR (<a href=\"#bib57\">Plotnikov et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, we next tested whether oncogenic signaling inactivated GSK3\u03b2 in early lesions, thereby allowing the PRLR molecules activated specifically in the parous mice to remain at the membrane longer than otherwise expected. Indeed, the inactivated form of GSK3\u03b2, pS9-GSK3\u03b2, was readily detected by immunohistochemistry in <i>caErbb2</i>-initiated early lesions in parous mice while it was not found in normal mammary cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In early lesions of virgin mice, an elevated and similar level of pS9-GSK3\u03b2 was also detected due to ErbB2-mediated oncogenic signaling. Together, these data suggest that during pregnancy and lactation preexisting premalignant mammary cells activate the PRLR-Jak2-STAT5 signaling cascade as normal mammary cells do, but after the onset of involution, these oncogene-activated cells aberrantly maintain an activated state of this pathway likely via oncoprotein-mediated inactivation of GSK3\u03b2 preventing timely PRLR degradation. However, precancerous cells in virgin mice do not activate PRLR and therefore cannot exploit ErbB2-mediated GSK3\u03b2 inactivation for aberrant activation of PRLR-STAT5. Of note, by 6 months post involution, as few pSTAT5+ cells (5.7 \u00b1 2.2%) could be detected in early lesions of parous mice, as in virgin mice (p=0.3; n = 4 mice; data not shown), suggesting that with time, parity-induced elevated levels of pSTAT5 in parous mice subside."

First, we asked whether forced activation of STAT5 in virgin mice lowers apoptotic levels in caErbB2-expressing mammary epithelial cells. We used RCAS-<i>caStat5a</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dong et al., 2010</a>) and RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i> viruses to co-infect MMTV-<i>tva</i> virgin mice (the co-infection efficiency is 8 \u00b1 4%; data not shown). At 2 weeks post infection, the resulting early lesions displayed either caErbB2 alone (69%) or both caErbB2 and caSTAT5a (31%), and none had caSTAT5a alone (data not shown), confirming our previous observation that the activation of STAT5 alone is not strongly tumorigenic (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dong et al., 2010</a>). Enrichment of early lesions positive for both caErbB2 and caSTAT5a relative to the low frequency of co-infection suggests that caSTAT5a promotes lesion initiation by caErbB2. Importantly, the lesions that were positive for both caErbB2 and caSTAT5a were less apoptotic than the lesions induced in the contralateral glands by caErbB2 alone (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Proliferation rates in these two sets of lesions were similar (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As expected, the mice that were infected only with RCAS-<i>caStat5a</i> did not form tumors, while the co-infected mice developed tumors much more rapidly than the mice infected with RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i> alone (p=0.0002; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), consistent with previous reports of a pro-tumorigenic role for STAT5 in the breast (<a href=\"#bib17\">Furth et al., 2011</a>). Significantly, the Kaplan\u2013Meier tumor-free survival curve of the co-infected virgin mice became superimposable on that of the parous cohort of mice from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> that was infected with RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i> alone and subsequently impregnated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, red line). These results suggest that forced STAT5 activation in virgin mice is sufficient to mimic breast cancer promotion by pregnancy."

Among the experimental MMTV-<i>tva</i> virgin mice that were euthanized at 8.5 weeks post RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i> infection (described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>), a small subset (20%) exhibited high baseline levels of pSTAT5 in both the normal mammary epithelium and early lesions, while the rest had barely detectable pSTAT5 in either (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We termed these mice the pSTAT5<sup>hi</sup> and pSTAT5<sup>lo</sup> groups, respectively. Apoptosis levels were inversely correlated with levels of pSTAT5 in early lesions from these two groups of mice (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Moreover, when we reanalyzed the data among the experimental virgin mice from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, the pSTAT5<sup>hi</sup> sub-cohort exhibited a shorter tumor-free survival than the pSTAT5<sup>lo</sup> mice and, remarkably, became indistinct from that of the parous cohort from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These observations suggest that high baseline pSTAT5 levels in virgin mice mimic stimulation of breast carcinogenesis by pregnancy. Not surprisingly, in the parous group from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, mice with pSTAT5<sup>lo</sup> and pSTAT5<sup>hi</sup> baseline levels (same criteria as in virgin mice) had similar tumor latency (data not shown), probably because profound STAT5 activation during pregnancy and lactation masks the effect of baseline pSTAT5 variations among individuals."

As predicted, the infected cells in this line harbored significantly more pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells (threefold) than did the infected cells in MMTV-<i>tva</i> mice, while the pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> proportion among the uninfected cells remained comparable between the two lines of mice (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). We further confirmed that RCAS infected equivalent numbers of mammary epithelial cells in WAP-<i>tva</i> and MMTV-<i>tva</i> mice (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). As predicted, there were many more pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells in the resulting early lesions in WAP-<i>tva</i> mice than in MMTV-<i>tva</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The apoptosis rate was lower in the early lesions in WAP-<i>tva</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), while proliferation remained comparable (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Mammary tumors also arose more rapidly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and with greater multiplicity (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) in WAP-<i>tva</i> mice than in MMTV-<i>tva</i> mice, consistent with previous evidence of alveolar or alveolar progenitor cells as the preferred cell of origin for ErbB2-initiated mammary tumors (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andrechek et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Henry et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jeselsohn et al., 2010</a>). These data demonstrate that the STAT5-activated subset of mammary epithelial cells has a compromised apoptotic response to oncogenic insult and is highly vulnerable to oncogene-induced carcinogenesis even without a pregnancy. More importantly, in WAP-<i>tva</i> mice infected by RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i>, pregnancy could no longer accelerate the already hastened tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), directly implicating STAT5 in mediating pregnancy\u2019s stimulation of breast carcinogenesis. Together, we conclude that STAT5 activation during pregnancy is sufficient to increase the survival of precancerous cells and to promote their progression to cancer."

We first used two inhibitors to block the upstream activators of STAT5 and assessed the effect of these inhibitors on lesion cell apoptosis and lesion progression. AG490 is a small molecule inhibitor that blocks several tyrosine kinases including Jak2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gazit et al., 1991</a>); Ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor that specifically suppresses Jak kinases (<a href=\"#bib60\">Quintas-Cardama et al., 2010</a>). AG490 (75, or 200 mg/kg body weight) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Levitzki and Gazit, 1995</a>) or diluent (DMSO) was administered every other day for 5 days starting from I2 to early lesion-bearing mice that had already completed lactation. AG490 decreased pSTAT5, Bcl<sub>XL</sub>, and cell survival in parous early lesions, and induced lesion regression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In virgin mice, AG490 did not have any significant impact on precancerous cell pSTAT5 positivity, apoptosis or early lesion regression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>), in accordance with the low levels of pSTAT5 in these lesions. This finding also indicates that AG490, which has been reported to inhibit EGFR and ErbB2, did not inhibit oncogenic signaling from caErbB2 in our model, perhaps due to the mutations in this ErbB2 variant (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bargmann and Weinberg, 1988</a>). Of note, AG490 did not affect pSTAT1, pSTAT3 or pSTAT6 positivity in either parous or virgin early lesions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Using a similar experimental approach, we found that in parous mice ruxolitinib also decreased pSTAT5, blocked cell survival, and induced regression of early lesions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a>). Together, these findings suggest that Jak2 signaling is required for early lesion survival and progression and that blocking the upstream tyrosine kinase activity of STAT5 can prevent the progression of early lesions in parous mice."

This inhibitor targets the phosphotyrosyl peptide-binding pocket within the SH2 domain of STAT5, STAT3, and possibly other STAT proteins, thereby blocking two steps in their activation\u2014recruitment to ligand-activated receptor complexes and dimerization (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). C188-9 (100 mg/kg BW) or diluent (DMSO) was injected intraperitoneally into mice bearing RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i>-initiated early lesions only twice (I2 and I9). 1 day after the second injection (I10), C188-9 caused a significant decrease in pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> and Bcl<sub>XL</sub><sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) but did not significantly reduce the low frequency of cells positive for pSTAT1, pSTAT3, or pSTAT6 (p=0.2, 0.6, and 0.8, respectively; <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Further, C188-9 caused a significant rise in apoptosis in the lesions of parous mice, (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) while having no detectable effect on proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Importantly, C188-9 caused a dramatic regression of parous premalignant lesions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). This effect is unlikely to be caused by off-target impact: in virgin mice, even four doses of C188-9 did not result in a significant decrease of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells, increase of apoptosis, or decrease of size in early lesions (p=0.6, 0.8, and 0.7, respectively; n = 3 mice; data not shown). Therefore, C188-9, like AG490, can block mammary early lesion survival and progression specifically in parous mice."

This short-term treatment led to a significant reduction in tumor incidence: by 3 months post ErbB2 activation, only three of the eight C188-9-treated mice had developed palpable tumors, while all 10 diluent-treated parous mice had done so (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). For comparison, eight of the 15 C188-9-treated virgin control mice had also developed palpable tumors at this time point. This regimen also led to a significant improvement in tumor-free survival in the parous group (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). In fact, the tumor-free survival curve became superimposable on that of the age-matched virgin group that was similarly treated. It is important to note that C188-9 did not significantly affect either tumor incidence or latency in virgin mice (p=0.6 and 0.5, respectively; <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Therefore, a short-term treatment with C188-9 hindered the progression of preexisting early lesions and removed the stimulatory effect of pregnancy on breast cancer risk. Together, these preclinical data suggest that a short-term prophylactic treatment with inhibitors blocking Jak2-STAT5 signaling may lower breast cancer risk for women who have had a late-age first pregnancy and have already completed lactation."

Indeed, when we compared 14 cases of DCIS (preinvasive lesions) from women who had a pregnancy 6\u201325 years prior to diagnosis with 13 cases from age-matched nulliparous women in a tissue bank from the University of Colorado (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1A</a>), we detected significantly more pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> lesions in the parous cases than in the nulliparous cases (p=0.01; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Of note, only the cases with &gt;5 years between last pregnancy and diagnosis were included for comparison in order to focus on pregnancy\u2019s long-term impact on cancer risk rather than on the relatively rare pregnancy-associated breast cancer subset. Interestingly, patients with higher percentages of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells within their lesions also had higher percentages of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells in the lesion-adjacent, histopathologically benign breast epithelium (which may be abnormal at genetic, epigenetic and gene expression levels) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). This observation suggests that pSTAT5 levels in histopathologically \u2018normal\u2019 breast epithelia may predict breast cancer risk in women. Therefore, we also quantified pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cell frequencies in tumor-adjacent breast epithelia (\u22655.0 cm away from an invasive cancer) from a cohort of 24 breast cancer patients diagnosed at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Higher pSTAT5 in these breast epithelia retrospectively predicted accelerated development of breast cancer following a full-term pregnancy (p=0.007; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>) with all other characteristics being comparable (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1B</a>). Although the sample size of these two cohorts is relatively small, they nevertheless suggest an involvement of STAT5 in pregnancy\u2019s promotion of long-term risk of sporadic human breast. Of note, BRCA mutation tests were negative in all 10 patients screened in the University of Colorado cohort (27 cases), and in 22 out of 24 patients screened in the MD Anderson Cancer Center cohort."

To ascertain that the normal mammary epithelium in fully involuted mammary glands responds differently to a future oncogenic insult compared to preexistent oncogene-activated cells responding to a pregnancy, we injected RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i> into fully involuted mammary glands of MMTV-<i>tva</i> mice (age = 20 weeks). The normal mammary cells in these involuted older mice had the same baseline levels of total STAT5a protein and pSTAT5 as the normal mammary cells in the 6-week-old mice used for oncogene introduction prior to a pregnancy (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, when challenged by an oncogene, the normal mammary epithelial cells in these involuted glands did not aberrantly activate STAT5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) when compared to mammary cells that gained caErbB2 first and were later exposed to pregnancy hormones (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consequently, their pSTAT5 level was comparable to the low level in early lesions arising in age-matched virgin mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The apoptotic index was also high and comparable to that of the lesions in the age-matched virgin control (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Therefore, normal breast epithelial cells in the fully involuted mammary gland\u2014in the event of suffering an oncogenic mutation\u2014do not aberrantly activate STAT5 signaling and can successfully initiate an apoptosis response to evade carcinogenesis."

In contrast, if mammary cells activate oncogenic signaling following the completion of a pregnancy and lactation, they acquire no survival advantage over cells that activate oncogenic signaling in nulliparous mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Moreover, these cells become indolent to oncogene-induced aberrant proliferation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These results, when combined with our data on pregnancy\u2019s instigation of preexisting precancerous cells, suggest the following overall hypothesis: pregnancy causes mammary cells that have not mutated to become resistant to transformation by a future oncogenic insult, but instigates whichever mammary cells have already mutated to progress to cancer. Therefore, the age-dependent effect of pregnancy on breast cancer risk in women may be due to age-associated gradual accumulation of mutated cells and early lesions which are stimulated by a delayed pregnancy to progress to cancer."

This brief treatment induced apoptosis in early lesions and caused them to regress, and importantly led to significant delay in tumor appearance. Although all mice eventually developed tumors, this significant delay in age of cancer diagnosis is what matters clinically in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our data predict that intermittent treatment with anti-Jak2/STAT5 may inhibit newly formed early lesions and further delay tumor appearance or may even completely prevent cancer in some of them. pSTAT5 is detected in human breast early lesions, especially in women who have had a pregnancy; therefore, prophylactic therapy targeting Jak2-STAT5 signaling may lower breast cancer risk in high risk women."

Even for these inhibitors to be effective, women have to take them continuously for several years, sometimes with prolonged side-effects (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hutchinson, 2011</a>). The alternative prevention modality indicated by our results may require only a short-term treatment after pregnancy and lactation; thus, it may be more acceptable to women who are as yet breast cancer-free. Additionally, unlike current prevention strategies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bode and Dong, 2009</a>), this alternative regimen may prevent ER-positive cancer as well as other subtypes: ER is negative in 71% of caErbB2-initiated tumors and in 63% of Wnt1-induced tumors in our parous mice although ER is present in the great majority of early lesions induced by either caErbB2 or Wnt1 (data not shown). Therefore, this new chemoprevention strategy may potentially have a significant impact on breast cancer prevention."

However, this result should not be interpreted to conclude that STAT5 inhibition has no value in preventing breast cancer in nulliparous mice or humans. Prophylactic treatment with Jak2/STAT5 inhibitors for a longer time, in a large cohort, or in a subgroup selected for high baseline pSTAT5 may very well yield significant preventive benefit. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, forced STAT5 activation indeed accelerated tumor formation in virgin mice that were infected by RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i>. Some virgin mice had higher baseline levels of pSTAT5 in the normal glands, and their early lesions harbored more pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells and fewer apoptotic cells and consequently evolved into cancer faster than the early lesions in the virgin mice with lower baseline levels of pSTAT5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In addition, in any virgin mouse, some of the early lesions had relatively high percentage of pSTAT5 cells, and they correspondingly showed reduced levels of apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These observations suggest that even in nulliparous mice or women, increased pSTAT5 in precancerous cells promotes tumorigenesis, and blocking STAT5 activity may also reduce their risk of breast cancer. In support of this notion, we have found that a 2-week-treatment with AG490 caused RCAS-<i>caErbb2</i> early lesions in virgin WAP-<i>tva</i> mice to deactivate STAT5 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and to induce apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Therefore, pSTAT5 promotes early lesion progression to cancer in both nulliparous and parous mice, and chemoprevention targeting Jak2/pSTAT5 may lower the risk of breast cancer in both nulliparous and parous women."

Our data suggest that pSTAT5 in premalignant breast lesions in women may predict a higher chance of progression to clinical cancer, and therefore may help differentiate high risk vs low risk patients and may affect treatment and prevention options. Moreover, increased pSTAT5 even in histopathologically normal breast epithelia may predict a high risk of breast cancer: as discussed in the preceding paragraph, increased baseline levels of pSTAT5 in normal mammary epithelia in nulliparous mice were correlated with higher pSTAT5 levels and lower apoptosis in early lesions of nulliparous mice and predicted an accelerated evolution to overt cancer; pSTAT5 levels were also higher in histologically normal mammary epithelium in MMTV-<i>Erbb2</i> mice; and importantly, pSTAT5 was elevated in histologically normal breast epithelia adjacent to DCIS with increased pSTAT5, and high pSTAT5 in tumor-adjacent normal appearing breast epithelia predicted shorter time from the last pregnancy to cancer diagnosis. It is also possible that pSTAT5 levels in normal breast epithelia may serve as a biomarker for estimating the efficacy of anti-Jak2/STAT5 and other chemopreventive strategies. Observation of a larger drop in baseline pSTAT5 levels in breast biopsies following prophylactic chemotherapeutic intervention might indicate a more effective elimination of the threat of potential malignancy."

Incubation with the primary antibody for IF staining was overnight at 4\u00b0C, while incubation with primary antibody for IHC was 1 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-containing mounting medium and hematoxylin, respectively, for IF and IHC. IHC for pSTAT5 in all human samples was controlled for quality of fixation and paraffin embedding of tissues by scoring the quality of pHistone3 staining of all tissues that were negative for pSTAT5. Only those samples that passed this quality control test were included in the final analysis. Bright field images were captured using a Leica DMLB microscope, and images were processed with Magnavision and Adobe Photoshop software. Fluorescent images were captured with a Zeiss Axiskop2 plus microscope. Images were processed with Axiovision and Adobe Photoshop software."

The murine experimental model used for the study involves introduction of oncogenes like ERBB2 and WNT1 through RCAS viral infection in 5-7 week old mice, impregnated &lt;=1 week later, followed by assessment of the effect of pregnancy on premalignant lesions at weeks 1.5, 5.5 and 8.5 post infection (pregnancy day 7.5, lactation day 12, and involution day 10). Through a series of cleverly crafted experiments, the authors propose that STAT5 activation during pregnancy causes apoptosis evasion in premalignant lesions that accumulate in the breast with age. The study concludes with experiments to show that anti-STAT5 treatment post pregnancy could lower breast cancer risk."

Based on our data, we suggest that persistent pSTAT5 can serve as a biomarker for unsuccessful chemoprevention. If STAT5 activation in premalignant cells increases or remains the same after exposure to chemopreventive agents, this might well indicate that the strategy was not effective in the patient. But the most important implication of our findings would be to use STAT5 as the target for chemoprevention, in which case it would also serve as the optimal biomarker. We have included a short discussion on this implication of our results in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript."

Moreover, as the oncogene in our mouse model system was tagged and therefore visible through immunofluorescence, it was easy to distinguish premalignant cells from completely normal cells independent of histopathology in our mice. In contrast, in our human tissue, the \u201cnormal\u201d cells were determined pathologically in the absence of any molecular indications of normality. These discrepancies between the mouse experiments and human data are likely responsible for the difference in pSTAT5 levels of normal breast cells in the two sets of experiments."

Since pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells occur at 10-fold higher frequency than pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cells in early lesions from our mouse model (18% vs 1.8%), C188-9 is effectively a STAT5 inhibitor in this setting. In accord, the number of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> parous early lesions decreases significantly on C188-9 treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3A</a>) while the low number of pSTAT3<sup>+</sup> cells in these early lesions remains constant even on treatment with C188-9 (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3B</a>).
