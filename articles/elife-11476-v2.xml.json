However, direct evidence for such a system, and the physiological basis of its computations, is lacking. Using an auditory stimulus whose pitch value changed according to specific rules, we controlled and separated the three key computational variables underlying perception, and discovered, using direct recordings from human auditory cortex, that <i>surprise</i> due to prediction violations is encoded by local field potential oscillations in the gamma band (&gt;30 Hz), changes to <i>predictions</i> in the beta band (12-30 Hz), and that the <i>precision</i> of predictions appears to quantitatively relate to alpha band oscillations (8-12 Hz). These results confirm oscillatory codes for critical aspects of generative models of perception."

However, direct evidence for such a system, and the physiological basis of its computations, is lacking. Using an auditory stimulus whose pitch value changed according to specific rules, we controlled and separated the three key computational variables underlying perception, and discovered, using direct recordings from human auditory cortex, that <i>surprise</i> due to prediction violations is encoded by local field potential oscillations in the gamma band (&gt;30 Hz), changes to <i>predictions</i> in the beta band (12-30 Hz), and that the <i>precision</i> of predictions appears to quantitatively relate to alpha band oscillations (8-12 Hz). These results confirm oscillatory codes for critical aspects of generative models of perception."

That is to say that, at first, the volunteers heard a selection of similarly pitched sounds.

These can be explained if perceptual systems are based on internal generative models of the environment which are constantly updated based on experience. Predictive coding (<a href=\"#bib25\">Rao and Ballard, 1999</a>) is a popular account of perception, in which internal representations generate <i>predictions</i> about upcoming sensory input, characterised by their mean and <i>precision</i> (inverse variance) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Friston, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</a>). Sensory information is processed hierarchically, with backward connections conveying predictions, and forward connections conveying violations of these predictions, namely <i>prediction errors</i>. Qualitatively, prediction errors are the mismatch between the prediction and incoming sensory information, but the term is often used without a quantitative definition. One quantitative formulation of prediction error is <i>surprise</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Friston and Kiebel, 2009</a>), which is the negative log probability of a sensory event, given the prior prediction. This definition takes into account the <i>precision</i> of predictions, such that the same prediction violation causes greater surprise where predictions are more precise. Prediction errors act to produce changes in predictions, thereby updating and refining internal models of the environment, and reducing subsequent prediction errors. These variables are illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. There is substantial overlap between predictive coding and other accounts of perception based on internal generative models (<a href=\"#bib14\">Friston, 2008</a>). The crucial common feature of any generative model of perception is the brain\u2019s use of hidden states to predict observed sensory inputs, thus the methods and findings of this study are applicable to all generative perceptual models."

This prediction is characterised by its mean (\u03bc<sub>t</sub>) and precision (\u03a0<sub>t</sub>), which is the inverse of its variance (\u03c3<sup>2</sup>). The incongruence between the actual f<sub>t</sub> and the prediction can be expressed either as a (non-precision-weighted) prediction error (\u03be<sub>t</sub>), that\u00a0is, the absolute difference from the prediction mean, or as surprise (S<sub>t</sub>), that\u00a0is, the negative log probability of the actual f<sub>t</sub> value according to the prediction distribution. As a result of a mismatch with bottom up sensory information, the prediction changes (dashed line). The change to the prediction (\u0394\u03bc<sub>t</sub>) is calculated simply as the absolute difference between the old (\u03bc<sub>t</sub>) and new (\u03bc<sub>t+1</sub>) prediction means. Note that the curves on the graph display changing predictions on account of a stimulus (i.e. Bayesian belief updating) as opposed to the more commonly encountered graph in this field of research where the curves indicate the prior prediction, the sensory information and the posterior inference about the individual stimulus (i.e. Bayesian inference)."

It is thus hypothesised that superficial cell populations calculate prediction errors, manifest as gamma-band oscillations (&gt;30\u2009Hz), and pass these to higher brain areas, while deep cell populations encode predictions, which manifest as beta band oscillations (12\u201330\u2009Hz) and pass these to lower brain areas (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bastos et al., 2012</a>). The layer-specific separation of higher and lower frequency oscillations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Spaak et al., 2012</a>), and the forward/backward asymmetry of high/low frequency oscillations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buschman and Miller, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fontolan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">van Kerkoerle et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Bastos et al., 2015</a>), are supported by direct evidence. A number of studies have found oscillatory gamma magnitude to correlate with the unexpectedness of incongruence of stimuli (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arnal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brodski et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Todorovic et al., 2011</a>), but it remains unclear exactly what computational variable they represent. While there is a strong case that beta oscillations are involved in top-down neural communication, evidence specifically linking beta oscillations to predictions is presently limited and indirect (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</a>), but includes observations that there is interdependence of gamma and subsequent beta activity in both in\u00a0vivo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haenschel et al., 2000</a>) and in\u00a0silico (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kopell et al., 2011</a>) studies and that omissions of expected stimuli induce a beta rebound response (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fujioka et al., 2009</a>). An oscillatory correlate of precision, to our knowledge, has not been proposed, though precision might affect the magnitude of gamma responses to prediction violations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feldman and Friston, 2010</a>). While an oscillatory correlate is possible, a case has been made that neuromodulatory connections alone, for instance from the basal forebrain cholinergic system, may be sufficient to dynamically mediate precision in sensory hierarchies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feldman and Friston, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kanai et al., 2015</a>). Direct evidence for correlates of processes inherent in perceptual inference requires being able to quantitatively manipulate predictions during an experiment, which has not so far been achieved."

To ease computational demands, the model space was discretised. Each point in model space corresponds to the probability of a particular f, given a specific \u03bc and \u03c3, that\u00a0is, P(f|\u03bc,\u03c3). Therefore each column (along the f dimension) gives the probability distribution P(f|\u03bc,\u03c3), and corresponds to the forward model. The planes of the model space, conversely, indicate the probability of each given combination of \u03bc and \u03c3, given a particular f value, that\u00a0is, P(\u03bc,\u03c3|f), or in other words the inverse model. To generate priors based on a series of observed f values, the scalar product of the planes for each of these f values is taken, and the resulting plane scaled to a sum of 1. This plane represents the estimates of the hidden states \u03bc and \u03c3 and is then used to weight the columns of the model space. The weighted model space is averaged into a single column (forward model), and scaled to a sum of 1, thus providing optimal priors on the assumption that the f population does not change. The priors assuming a population change are derived from the same procedure, but with uniform weighting across the model space. The change and no change priors are then weighted according to the probability of a population change, and then summed. The only part of the process not illustrated here is the inference of population changes, determining how many preceding f values form part of the model inversion, which is explained in Equation 2."

                        "text": "<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows, at group level, the spectrotemporal pattern of induced and evoked oscillations uniquely attributable to each of the three perceptual variables of interest: surprise (S), change in prediction mean (\u0394\u03bc), precision of predictions (\u03a0), as well as the change in f value from one stimulus to the next (\u0394f). The latter measure was not a perceptual variable of interest but was included for comparative purposes as it approximately represents the \u2018pitch onset response\u2019 which is a robust and familiar response in auditory neurophysiology (<a href=\"#bib17\">Griffiths et al., 2010</a>). Data significant at p&lt;0.05 corrected (based on a non-parametric permutation approach [<a href=\"#bib24\">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</a>]) are shown in the left column of each group, and all data in the right column. Individual subject data are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. As these perceptual variables were highly correlated (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), instantaneously and over time, regression for the main analysis was based on the residuals after partialling out these correlated influences, such that only the unique explanatory contribution of each variable, with respect to the LFP data, was measured. While the correlation values observed were small in absolute terms (Pearson\u2019s r &lt; 0.1), reassuringly these r values were of the same scale of magnitude as those for change in frequency (\u0394f), which represents a robust auditory response. Furthermore, the LFP data variance explained by the entire model (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was around 1%. In accordance with our hypotheses, <i>surprise</i> (S) correlated positively, across subjects, with gamma oscillations, beginning at around 100 ms from segment onset, and this was significant by 200 ms. Also in accordance with our hypothesis, changes to <i>predictions</i> (\u0394\u03bc) correlated positively with beta oscillations coinciding with the onset of the subsequent stimulus segment (about 100 ms after), which again was significant. Prediction <i>precision</i> (\u03a0) correlated positively with delta-alpha (2\u201312\u2009Hz) frequency oscillations (for the whole 0\u2013300 ms period from segment onset), although this was only significant in the alpha frequency range, and fell slightly below significance in the delta-theta range. Given the strong negative correlation between \u03a0 and the preceding values of S and \u0394f, it seemed likely that the low-frequency correlates of these were being mutually attenuated by the partialisation process. For this reason, and to search for correlates of the commonalities between key variables, we repeated the analyses with only the contemporaneous value of \u0394f being partialled out (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This analysis found highly significant correlates of <i>precision</i> (\u03a0) in the full delta-alpha range, spanning the previous, current and subsequent segments, but we cannot attribute the delta-theta component to \u03a0 with absolute confidence. To respect the exploratory nature of our search for oscillatory correlates of \u03a0, a further variation of the analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) omitted \u03a0 altogether (including the partialisation of other variables with respect to it). Results were quantitatively stronger (due to reduced partialisation), but qualitatively similar except that S contained a strong negative delta-alpha band correlation coincident with the subsequent stimulus segment. As S for one segment is negatively correlated with \u03a0 of the subsequent segment, it is thus not presently clear how much of this low-frequency correlation is with S (negatively), and how much with \u03a0 (positively). However, given its sole significant association in the main analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) is with \u03a0, and that a low-frequency correlate of S is not expected based on prior literature, we favour the interpretation that low-frequency oscillations are a correlate of the precision of prior predictions. Evoked results are shown in the right hand sections of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> plus its figure supplements 3 and 4. Unlike the induced results, there was no qualitative distinction between the timing or frequency profiles of the different variables (this is particularly evident in <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The only significant evoked responses in the main analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) were to \u0394f and \u0394\u03bc, while S only showed significant evoked correlates when \u03a0 was omitted from the analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

We have also found that the precision of predictions is correlated to the magnitude of alpha oscillations, and possibly delta and/or theta also, thereby raising the possibility of an oscillatory mechanism for the control of precision. Interestingly, this correlate of precision was not time-locked to the stimuli (evoked), despite delta-theta oscillations showing strong phase entrainment by stimuli when predicting stimulus timing (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</a>), and the period of the stimulus segments (300 ms) falling within the delta-theta range. Possibilities include that there is an evoked correlate closely shared by both surprise and precision which the present methods are unable to disambiguate, or that this time-locking of low-frequency oscillations is entrained preferentially by low-level stimulus features (such as changes in stimulus power spectrum) as opposed to the higher level feature of temporal pitch employed in the present study. Existing generative accounts of perception have not proposed a specific oscillatory correlate for the precision of predictions in predicting <i>what</i> a sensory stimulus will be. However, the present findings are not without precedent, as theta (4\u20138\u2009Hz) and alpha (8\u201312\u2009Hz) oscillations are implicated in mechanisms to predict <i>when</i> a stimulus will occur, with theta phase aligning to the expected stimulus onset (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</a>), and alpha magnitude has been found to correlate with the probability of a stimulus change occurring (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bauer et al., 2014</a>). Both theta (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canolty et al., 2006</a>) and alpha (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</a>) oscillations modulate higher frequency oscillations, through phase-amplitude coupling, and thereby segregating sensory responses into specific temporal windows. There is also antagonism between theta/alpha and beta/gamma oscillation magnitudes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Spaak et al., 2012</a>) which, in the context of a theta/alpha code for precision, might indicate that over coarse time scales neuronal populations alternate between states of precise predictions (with theta/alpha predominating) and states of prediction violation (with beta/gamma predominating). However, the present results would suggest more than simple reciprocal antagonism and reveal the specific computational role of each oscillation type. While an oscillatory code for precision could have far-reaching implications, we must respect the fact that this is a novel finding and thus requires corroboration from additional studies with alternative methodology."

Furthermore, each oscillatory frequency band correlates with a distinct computational variable. Thus, the present findings may be able to retrospectively aid in the interpretation of a large number of studies examining induced oscillations. As generative accounts of perception are generic across stimulus dimensions and sensory modalities, and perhaps even all of brain function (for instance, if action is understood as a method of resolving prediction errors [<a href=\"#bib13\">Friston et al., 2006</a>]), the applicability of the results may be very broad indeed. The present paradigm is instantly portable to any sensory modality and, given the absence of any training or task requirement, to any species."

These populations constituted hidden states that were not directly observable, but whose parameters (i.e. \u03bc and \u03c3) could be inferred. The populations were randomly changed according to simple rules, such that subjects could be expected to unconsciously learn these rules in order to minimise uncertainty about upcoming stimuli. The rules were that for each stimulus segment, there was a 7/8 chance that its value would be drawn from the existing population, and a 1/8 chance that a new population would come into effect.

Local field potential data were downsampled to 1 kHz, and electrical noise was filtered out. Time-frequency decomposition was performed with Morlet wavelet convolution, oversampled at 2\u2009Hz frequency resolution and 10 ms time resolution, in the time range -300 to 600 ms from segment onset (i.e. spanning previous, current and subsequent segments) and frequency range 2\u2013100\u2009Hz. The upper frequency bound was limited to 100\u2009Hz in light of previous observations of a lack of qualitative response difference to pitch stimuli between the 80\u2013100\u2009Hz range and higher frequencies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Griffiths et al., 2010</a>). The number of cycles per wavelet increased linearly from 1 cycle at 2\u2009Hz to 10 cycles at 100\u2009Hz. The absolute value (i.e. amplitude) of the wavelet coefficients was calculated for artefact rejection purposes, and these were normalised for each frequency (i.e. shifted/scaled to mean 0 and standard deviation 1). For each trial, both the mean (across time and frequency) and maximum normalised amplitude value was recorded, and the frequency histograms of these were plotted. Thresholds for trial rejection were set, by visual inspection, at the upper limit of the normal distribution of responses, beyond which trials were assumed to contain artefacts. After removal of segments at the start of the experiment, following target segments, and with outlying amplitude values, 89, 86 and 87% of segments remained, for the three subjects, respectively. Data were processed for all electrodes either in Heschl\u2019s gyrus or over the superior temporal gyrus. The procedure for selecting electrodes for the final analysis is described later."

First, the complex (i.e. with phase data retained) for every electrode-time-frequency point were regressed against it to yield a pair (real and imaginary) of Pearson product moment correlation coefficients (r). The modulus of these constituted the evoked (time-locked) response. To calculate the induced response, the residuals from this regression (i.e. discarding the evoked component) were converted to amplitude (by taking their modulus), and the regression was performed again. All r values were subjected to a Fisher Z transformation prior to further analysis. Inspection of these responses found no qualitative differences between the responses observed in different divisions of auditory cortex, hence the correlations were averaged over electrodes for further analysis. To quantify the distribution of correlation strengths, the pattern, across time and frequency, of induced correlation coefficients for each regressor was averaged across electrodes and subjects. This pattern was used as a filter, in that it was scalar multiplied with the correlation coefficient pattern for each electrode for each subject, then averaged across time and frequency to yield a single correlation value for that electrode/subject combination. These values, for each regressor, for each subject, were divided by the largest absolute correlation value for that regressor, in order to represent relative correlation strengths on a scale of -1 to 1.

However, I think any disagreement here is over the definition of the term \u2018direct evidence\u2019. We are aware of compelling evidence that there is a spectral asymmetry inherent in hierarchical neuronal communication, with beta being a major feedback frequency (as demonstrated in the two studies mentioned above, and others), and that in predictive coding feedback connections are argued to convey predictions, or updates to predictions. However, we have not been aware of any evidence specifically and quantitatively linking beta oscillations to prediction updates as we have demonstrated in the present work. We therefore would argue that what has been made previously is a strong case on circumstantial evidence, for which our study is the first to provide direct confirmation. Specifically, our understanding of the above two studies is that Buschman and Miller found low-frequency feedback connections from prefrontal cortex to parietal cortex to be relatively selective for top-down attentional control, and that Bastos found asymmetrical spectral Granger causality, with feedback being associated with beta band connections.
