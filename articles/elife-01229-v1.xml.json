FQ-resistance mutations in <i>S.</i> Typhi have become common, hindering treatment and control efforts. Using in vitro competition experiments, we assayed the fitness of eleven isogenic <i>S.</i> Typhi strains with resistance mutations in the FQ target genes, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>parC</i>. In the absence of antimicrobial pressure, 6 out of 11 mutants carried a selective advantage over the antimicrobial-sensitive parent strain, indicating that FQ resistance in <i>S.</i> Typhi is not typically associated with fitness costs. Double-mutants exhibited higher than expected fitness as a result of synergistic epistasis, signifying that epistasis may be a critical factor in the evolution and molecular epidemiology of <i>S.</i> Typhi. Our findings have important implications for the management of drug-resistant <i>S.</i> Typhi, suggesting that FQ-resistant strains would be naturally maintained even if fluoroquinolone use were reduced."

FQ-resistance mutations in <i>S.</i> Typhi have become common, hindering treatment and control efforts. Using in vitro competition experiments, we assayed the fitness of eleven isogenic <i>S.</i> Typhi strains with resistance mutations in the FQ target genes, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>parC</i>. In the absence of antimicrobial pressure, 6 out of 11 mutants carried a selective advantage over the antimicrobial-sensitive parent strain, indicating that FQ resistance in <i>S.</i> Typhi is not typically associated with fitness costs. Double-mutants exhibited higher than expected fitness as a result of synergistic epistasis, signifying that epistasis may be a critical factor in the evolution and molecular epidemiology of <i>S.</i> Typhi. Our findings have important implications for the management of drug-resistant <i>S.</i> Typhi, suggesting that FQ-resistant strains would be naturally maintained even if fluoroquinolone use were reduced."

Such strong selective pressure has stark short and long-term consequences, as evidenced by more than half a century of antimicrobial usage and resistance evolution (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersson and Hughes, 2010</a>). The development of specific antimicrobial resistance patterns within sentinel organisms has spawned the popular term \u2018super-bug\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foster, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Anzaldi and Skaar, 2011</a>). This term is misleading in the sense that resistance to a specific antimicrobial typically confers a reduction in Darwinian fitness (a fitness cost) in the absence of the pressure induced by that antimicrobial (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andersson and Levin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson, 2003</a>). Nevertheless, bacterial mutations that appear to have a low fitness cost or no fitness cost are sometimes observed, and mutations that may induce a fitness benefit in the absence of antimicrobials have been described but are rare (<a href=\"#bib36\">Macvanin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Enne et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Luo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kassen and Bataillon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rozen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Marcusson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bataillon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miskinyte and Gordo, 2013</a>). Understanding the fitness effects of antimicrobial resistance evolution is crucial for controlling the spread of resistance, as the fitness cost induced by antimicrobial resistance is one of the few biological features of resistant organisms that can be leveraged against them."

The increasing usage and dependency on the fluoroquinolones has coincided with resistance to fluoroquinolones becoming common within the <i>Enterobacteriacea</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Le et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Butler, 2011</a>). This change is highly pertinent for diseases like typhoid, a severe invasive infection caused by the bacterium <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (<a href=\"#bib42\">Parry et al., 2002</a>), as antimicrobial therapy is essential for treatment. Typhoid remains common in many developing countries, and increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, correlate with increased fever clearance times and treatment failure (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parry et al., 2011</a>). The elevated MICs to fluoroquinolones observed in <i>S.</i> Typhi are a consequence of mutations in the DNA gyrase gene, <i>gyrA</i>, and secondary mutations in the topoisomerase gene, <i>parC</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parry et al., 2010</a>). Evidence of strong selection for these mutations can be observed within the phylogenetic structure of <i>S.</i> Typhi, as several different <i>gyrA</i> mutations have arisen independently in multiple lineages (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roumagnac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Holt et al., 2008</a>)."

In classical competition assays (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lenski, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lenski et al., 1998</a>), antimicrobial-susceptible and antimicrobial-resistant organisms are competed over many generations, and the frequencies of resistant and sensitive strains are compared at various time points. The relative fitness of the resistant strain to the sensitive strain can be calculated from the population trajectories observed in the experiment (<a href=\"#bib36\">Macvanin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Enne et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gagneux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Balsalobre and de la Campa, 2008</a>). The choice of bacterial strains is critical in performing this type of competitive growth assay. Competing genetically unrelated clinical isolates (<a href=\"#bib30\">Laurent et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wichelhaus et al., 2002</a>), or strains that are otherwise imperfectly isogenic, may make it difficult to isolate the effects of a single mutation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Enne et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Komp Lindgren et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gagneux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">MacLean and Buckling, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">O\u2019Regan et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, bacterial enumeration and selective culturing after serial dilutions are typically used to calculate population sizes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Laurent et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wichelhaus et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Macvanin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gagneux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rozen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Balsalobre and de la Campa, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">MacLean and Buckling, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Randall et al., 2008</a>), and these methodologies can be affected by experimental variation or spontaneous mutations in the target gene(s) as a consequence of exposure to low levels of antimicrobial. To overcome these limitations, we performed competitive growth experiments with isogenic strains containing single and multiple mutations in fluoroquinolone target genes, and we used pyrosequencing to assay allele frequency, avoiding exposing the organisms to antimicrobials."

Our work adds to these finding by demonstrating a pathogen-drug combination in which the majority of resistant genotypes are associated with dramatic fitness benefits in the absence of antimicrobial pressure. Our findings have implications for the control of typhoid as enhanced fitness in the absence of antimicrobial pressure eliminates the option of prudent antimicrobial use as a public health strategy. Additionally, our results show that combinations of these mutations exhibit higher Darwinian fitness than would be expected under a scenario of independent fitness effects, showing that higher fitness in <i>gyrA</i> and <i>parC</i> mutants arises from synergistic epistasis. It has been shown previously that genome-wide epistatic interactions may aid the development of multidrug resistance (<a href=\"#bib54\">Trindade et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Silva et al., 2011</a>), but the described mutations in these studies are not found in genes that are directly related to antimicrobial resistance."

Direct competition of attenuated <i>S.</i> Typhimurium mutants in a mouse model is well described, and <i>gyrA</i> mutations in <i>S.</i> Typhimurium could be generated and compared using in vivo competition assays. One potential limitation of this animal model in determining accurate selection coefficients is the brief duration of infection, which results in a small number of bacterial generations over which to observe fitness differences. The importance of replicating our finding in other systems is highlighted by two previous studies on <i>S.</i> Typhimurium that assessed fitness effects associated with mutations in <i>gyrA</i>, one of which showed a selective disadvantage of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains in the gut of chickens (<a href=\"#bib19\">Giraud et al., 2003</a>), and a second of which demonstrated a reduction in invasion measured in immortalized epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">F\u00e0brega et al., 2009</a>).

Typhi. The past two decades have seen the emergence of <i>S</i>. Typhi strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wain et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Parry et al., 1998</a>), resulting in the widespread distribution of these strains in almost all locations where typhoid is endemic. We now know that the majority of this epidemic is associated with one particular genotype (H58), which has swept across Asia and into Africa (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kariuki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Holt et al., 2011</a>), displacing other genotypes in the process. A potentially crucial factor catalyzing the spread of this genotype is an S83F mutation in the <i>gyrA</i> gene. While this mutation is not unique to this genotype (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roumagnac et al., 2006</a>), there is a strong association between the H58 strains and the S83F <i>gyrA</i> mutation. There are currently no data directly comparing <i>S</i>. Typhi genotype and disease outcome in typhoid patients; there is, however, a strong correlation between reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (caused by the S83F mutation) and prolonged infection (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parry et al., 2011</a>). Our data suggest that the dominance of the H58 genotype, the current global clonal expansion, and the emergence of other strains with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones may not stem solely from therapeutic fluoroquinolone usage. Indeed, positive selection of bacteria with <i>gyrA</i> mutations has been predicted by mechanisms inducing DNA supercoiling continuation via suboptimal topoisomerases and modifications that enhance the functionality of the <i>gyrA</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib37\">Marcusson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Balsalobre et al., 2011</a>)."

(1) Why have certain high-fitness mutation combinations not arisen in natural populations of <i>S</i>. Typhi in the absence of fluoroquinolones? It may simply be improbable for an individual organism to acquire two specific mutations at the same time, especially given the slightly deleterious effects of D87A and D87G. However, this would not explain the absence, until recently, of S83F-D87N (<math id=\"inf19\"><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>s</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><mo>=</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>.074</mn></mrow></math>) or of the S83F mutation itself (<math id=\"inf20\"><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>s</mi><mo>^</mo></mover></mrow><mo>=</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>.013</mn></mrow></math>). Perhaps, for mechanistic reasons, these mutations are unlikely to emerge in the absence of fluoroquinolone pressure. (2) Why have <i>S</i>. Typhi strains with only certain <i>gyrA</i>/<i>parC</i> mutations been described in clinical typhoid? We know that the S83F mutation has emerged and spread recently; therefore, we suggest that strains containing one or two additional resistance mutations may not have had enough time to achieve high frequency in the <i>S</i>. Typhi population. In addition, there is a general lack of systematic cross-sectional analyses for <i>gyrA</i>/<i>parC</i> mutations in <i>S</i>. Typhi. Data from the published studies known to us suggest that, with the exception of S83F and S83Y, the clinical frequencies of the fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants described here are below 3% (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roumagnac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parry et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Emary et al., 2012</a>). However, because the majority of the bacterial isolates described in these studies are not recent, some of these genotypes may now be circulating at higher frequencies. (3) Why do S83F mutants dominate globally? Our results suggest that the S83F and the S80I mutants would be positively selected in nature in the absence of compensatory mutations or any selective pressure induced by antimicrobial usage. Of these two mutations, it is S83F that exhibits both the greatest selection coefficient and the highest MIC to the fluoroquinolones, making the emergence or establishment of S80I variants evolutionary less likely. The S83F mutation provides the most probable primary foundation for the evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant <i>S</i>. Typhi. Phylogenetic investigations have shown that the S83F mutation has arisen on multiple occasions in several lineages (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roumagnac et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Holt et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, the ability of S83F mutants to catalyze positive epistatic interactions with other otherwise neutral mutations suggests that new S83F combinations may be observed more frequently in the future (<a href=\"#bib28\">Koirala et al., 2012</a>)."

Currently, the control of typhoid across Asia and Africa relies on fluoroquinolone treatment (<a href=\"#bib58\">WHO, 2003</a>), often prescribed in endemic settings for any non-specific low-grade febrile disease. However, many locations are observing a preponderance of strains that have elevated MICs to fluoroquinolones, resulting from the <i>gyrA</i> and <i>parC</i> mutations we have assessed here (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kariuki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Holt et al., 2012</a>). These observations are of great concern as incremental increases in MICs to fluoroquinolones correspond directly with treatment failure and disease severity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parry et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance and an inability to clear infection may have obvious consequences for prolonged asymptomatic carriage of these pathogens. As the majority of <i>S</i>. Typhi strains described here do not exhibit a fitness cost, an antimicrobial control strategy, including the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from general usage within the population, is unlikely to reduce the population-level frequencies of antimicrobial resistance to these drugs.

The limitations of this animal model are that both the pathogen and host differ from <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi infections in humans, and that mice typically succumb to infection within seven days limiting the amount of data available in the competition experiment. Paragraph 5 of the Discussion explicitly addresses the challenges of associating fitnesses measured in any experimental system to those that would be observed in the natural epidemiological environment where humans are infected with Typhi.

As <i>S.</i> Typhi is a human-restricted facultative intracellular organism, our findings on fitness differences may not directly reflect the evolution/competition of strains during an acute Typhi infection. However, we wish to highlight that <i>Salmonella</i>, including <i>S.</i> Typhi, can survive for prolonged periods in water supplies and the gallbladder of asymptomatic carriers (Baker et al. 2011, Mermin et al. 1999, <a href=\"#bib12\">Dongol et al. 2012</a>). Therefore, our findings need to be taken in context with the current understanding of <i>Salmonella</i> biology.

There is an extensive literature on Typhimurium infections in animal models and the various pros and cons of this experimental system. To determine if there were any existing data regarding these Salmonella mutations in animal models we performed an extensive literature search over \u201cfluoroquinolone\u201d, \u201cTyphimurium\u201d, \u201cgyrA\u201d, and certain specific mutations of interest (over 400 studies met parts of these criteria).
