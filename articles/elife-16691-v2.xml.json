Here, we show that <i>INO1</i> memory in yeast is initiated by binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor to the <i>cis</i>-acting Memory Recruitment Sequence, targeting <i>INO1</i> to the nuclear periphery. Memory requires a remodeled form of the Set1/COMPASS methyltransferase lacking Spp1, which dimethylates histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2). H3K4me2 recruits the SET3C complex, which plays an essential role in maintaining this mark. Finally, while active <i>INO1</i> is associated with Cdk8<sup>-</sup> Mediator, during memory, Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator recruits poised RNAPII PIC lacking the Kin28 CTD kinase. Aspects of this mechanism are generalizable to yeast and conserved in human cells. Thus, COMPASS and Mediator are repurposed to promote epigenetic transcriptional poising by a highly conserved mechanism."

Here, we show that <i>INO1</i> memory in yeast is initiated by binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor to the <i>cis</i>-acting Memory Recruitment Sequence, targeting <i>INO1</i> to the nuclear periphery. Memory requires a remodeled form of the Set1/COMPASS methyltransferase lacking Spp1, which dimethylates histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2). H3K4me2 recruits the SET3C complex, which plays an essential role in maintaining this mark. Finally, while active <i>INO1</i> is associated with Cdk8<sup>-</sup> Mediator, during memory, Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator recruits poised RNAPII PIC lacking the Kin28 CTD kinase. Aspects of this mechanism are generalizable to yeast and conserved in human cells. Thus, COMPASS and Mediator are repurposed to promote epigenetic transcriptional poising by a highly conserved mechanism."

The other complex was responsible for recruiting an inactive, poised form of RNA polymerase II to the gene, which allowed the gene to be activated when needed. In addition, D'Urso found that other genes that show transcriptional memory in yeast, as well as such genes in human cells, were also marked in the same ways."

Targeting of active <i>INO1</i> to the nuclear periphery requires two Gene Recruitment Sequences (GRSs) in the promoter that interact with the transcription factors Put3 and Cbf1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brickner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016a</a>). However, after repression, <i>INO1</i> remains associated with the periphery through a mechanism that is independent of the GRSs but requires a separate zip code, the Memory Recruitment Sequence (MRS) and the nuclear pore protein Nup100 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brickner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Light et al., 2010</a>).

Furthermore, like <i>INO1, GAL1-10</i> localizes at the nuclear periphery and exhibits a faster rate of transcriptional reactivation for up to 8 generations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brickner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Tan-Wong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kundu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</a>). Also, 77 of the genes induced by oxidative stress are activated more rapidly in yeast cells that have previously experienced salt stress, an effect that persists for four generations and requires the nuclear pore protein Nup42 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berry and Gasch, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gasch et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Guan et al., 2012</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, heat shock alters the responsiveness of plants to heat stress for days and correlates with H3K4 methylation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ding et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">L\u00e4mke et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sani et al., 2013</a>).

This effect persists through 4\u20137 cell divisions, is associated with H3K4 dimethylation and binding of poised RNAPII and requires physical interaction with the nuclear pore protein Nup98 (homologous to yeast Nup100; <a href=\"#bib53\">Light et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, dimethylation of H3K4, binding of poised RNAPII and physical interaction with nuclear pore proteins may play a general, conserved role in memory to epigenetically enhance future gene expression. However, the potential general role of H2A.Z in memory is unclear because loss of H2A.Z has pleiotropic effects (<a href=\"#bib32\">Halley et al., 2010</a>)."

However, transcription can also be stimulated through regulated elongation and, occasionally, through regulated initiation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Kwak and Lis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Smith and Shilatifard, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Spencer et al., 1990</a>). RNAPII often initiates transcription but after synthesizing 30\u201350 nt, becomes paused through the action of DSIF, NELF, GDOWN1 and the PAF complex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gilmour and Lis, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Rougvie and Lis, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wada et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). Paused RNAPII is phosphorylated on serine 5 of the carboxy terminal domain (CTD). Elongation is stimulated by recruitment of the super elongation complex, which phosphorylates serine 2 on the CTD (<a href=\"#bib57\">Marshall et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Ni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Smith and Shilatifard, 2013</a>). However, RNAPII recruitment does not always lead to initiation. A large number of inactive genes are bound by preinitiation RNAPII, suggesting that they are regulated upstream of transcription initiation in yeast and humans (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kouzine et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Radonjic et al., 2005</a>). Likewise, starvation of L1 larvae in <i>C. elegans</i> leads to RNAPII 'docking' over the promoters of ~750 genes involved in growth and development (<a href=\"#bib58\">Maxwell et al., 2014</a>). This form of RNAPII appears to be neither active nor paused, suggesting that it has not initiated. Following previous expression, unphosphorylated, preinitiation RNAPII binds to the promoter of yeast and human genes that exhibit transcriptional memory, along with PIC components (<a href=\"#bib52\">Light, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2013</a>). Finally, the inducible Retinoic Acid Receptor \u03b2 (<i>RARB)</i> promoter is bound to RNAPII and a partially assembled PIC in the absence of inducer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akoulitchev et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Pavri et al., 2005</a>), suggesting that transcriptional poising may be a more general regulatory mechanism. Thus, all three steps of transcription can be regulated: PIC assembly/recruitment, transcription initiation and transcription elongation."

Using the yeast <i>INO1</i> gene as a model, we address these three questions, providing important new insight about the molecular mechanism of transcriptional memory. <i>INO1</i> memory is initiated by binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor to the MRS zip code specifically upon shifting from activating to repressing conditions. Sfl1 is necessary and sufficient to promote targeting to the nuclear periphery and is essential for all aspects of transcriptional memory. <i>INO1</i> memory is lost in strains that lack lysine 4 on histone H3 or upon conditional inactivation of the Set1/COMPASS complex, indicating that H3K4me2 is required for memory. During memory, the Set1/COMPASS histone methyltransferase is remodeled by dissociation of the Spp1 subunit. The resulting Spp1<sup>-</sup> complex is capable of H3K4 dimethylation, but not trimethylation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Miller et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Morillon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Roguev et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schneider et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Takahashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Wood et al., 2003</a>). Set3, the eponymous member of the SET3C HDAC complex, is recruited by H3K4me2 to the <i>INO1</i> promoter through its PHD domain (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Pijnappel et al., 2001</a>). Conditional inactivation of SET3C during memory rapidly disrupts both RNAPII binding and H3K4 dimethylation, suggesting that it is both the reader of this mark and is essential for its persistence. Finally, whereas a core Mediator subunit is required for RNAPII binding under both activating and memory conditions, the form of Mediator containing the Cdk8 kinase module (Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator) binds to the <i>INO1</i> promoter specifically during memory and is specifically required to recruit poised RNAPII and to enhance future expression."

The interaction of recently repressed <i>INO1</i> with the NPC is controlled by the MRS zip code (5\u2019-TCCTTCTTTCCC-3\u2019; <a href=\"#bib52\">Light et al., 2010</a>). Mutations in this DNA sequence abolish all aspects of memory: after repression, <i>INO1</i> is not retained at the nuclear periphery, fails to incorporate H2A.Z or H3K4me2 into the promoter, does not retain RNAPII and exhibits a specific defect in the rate of reactivation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brickner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Light et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">2013</a>). Because the Sfl1 transcription factor binds to a sequence that is similar to the MRS (5\u2019-TTCTTC-3\u2019) and shows genetic interactions with <i>NUP120</i> - a component of the Nup84 subcomplex that is required for transcriptional memory - we hypothesized that the Sfl1 transcription factor interacts with the MRS to promote memory (<a href=\"#bib15\">Costanzo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fujita et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Light et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Robertson and Fink, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Zhu et al., 2009</a>). To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against Sfl-GFP expressed in wild type and <i>mrs</i> mutant strains under activating (-inositol), repressing (+inositol) and memory conditions (-inositol \u2192 + inositol, 3\u00a0hr; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Sfl1 bound to the wild type <i>INO1</i> promoter specifically under memory conditions, but not to the <i>mrs</i> mutant <i>INO1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Insertion of the MRS alone at the ectopic <i>URA3</i> locus leads to constitutive targeting to the nuclear periphery, suggesting that the factor(s) responsible for peripheral targeting is bound constitutively (<a href=\"#bib52\">Light et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, at the ectopic MRS, Sfl1-GFP bound constitutively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, as previously observed, Sfl1-GFP bound to the <i>SUC2</i> promoter under all conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Song and Carson, 1998</a>). Finally, the levels and nuclear localization of Sfl1-GFP were not obviously different between these three conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, Sfl1 binds to the <i>INO1</i> promoter in an MRS-dependent and memory-specific manner that is apparently regulated in <i>cis</i> by its promoter context."

Because the shell constituting the outer 25\u201330% of the nuclear volume (<i>i.e.</i> the 200\u00a0nm closest to the nuclear envelope) is unresolvable from the nuclear envelope by light microscopy, a randomly localized spot within the nucleus is expected to colocalize with the nuclear envelope in ~30% of the cells (blue hatched line, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brickner and Walter, 2004</a>).

Set3 possesses a PHD domain that directly interacts with H3K4me2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kim et al., 2012</a>) and <i>set3\u2206</i> mutants disrupt <i>INO1</i> memory (<a href=\"#bib53\">Light et al., 2013</a>). To confirm that Set3 is recruited to the <i>INO1</i> promoter by 'reading' the H3K4me2 mark, we performed ChIP against Set3-FRB-GFP. Indeed, Set3 binding to <i>INO1</i> reflects the dimethylation of H3K4; Set3 bound under both activating and memory conditions, but not under repressing conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Binding of Set3 during memory was lost in cells lacking Sfl1, consistent with role of Sfl1 in promoting H3K4me2 specifically during memory (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Also, mutation of tryptophan 104 to alanine in the PHD domain of Set3, which blocks binding to H3K4me2 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Pijnappel et al., 2001</a>), disrupted Set3 binding under all conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This mutation also disrupted RNAPII binding during memory (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, Set3C is recruited under both activating and memory conditions to the <i>INO1</i> promoter by recognition of H3K4me2 and this interaction is required for RNAPII binding under memory conditions."

Pairwise comparisons were conducted by the following procedure: For each condition, we pooled the ChIP-seq reads from the two replicates into one sample since the ChIP-seq signal from the two replicates were exceedingly similar. Then we calculated the reads coverage score for each pooled sample. The reads coverage score at a given genomic location is defined as the number reads that cover this location after extending each single-end read from start position downstream 150 bp. This score was further normalized by the total number of aligned reads of each sample for comparisons between samples. Second, we divided the genome into overlapping bins using a sliding window of width = 500 bp and a step size of 250 bp. Under this strategy, two consecutive windows will have 250 bp overlap, such that any ChIP signal, as long as shorter than 250 bp, will be completely covered in one window. This could help better detect the differential ChIP signal (compared to using non-overlap 500 bp windows where signal may split at the window boundary). Third, for each window, we define the total coverage score <i>y</i> as the summation of reads coverage score from all base pairs within the window. To illustrate our method for differential ChIP-seq analysis, we consider comparing the H3K4 tri-methylation between Repressed (REP) vs Memory (STR) conditions.

For biological significance, we only considered the windows whose average signal exceeds the 10% quantile genome-wide. 2. The remaining range of <math id=\"inf8\"><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math> from 0.10 quantile to its maximum is divided into consecutive bins with bin width of 0.1 (in the log scale). 3.

In this study the top 3% was used. All adjacent or overlapping windows were selected from this pipeline and merged together.

Substitution of alanine for tryptophan 140 in the Set3 PHD finger (or loss of Set3; not shown) resulted in loss of H3K4me2 on the <i>INO1</i> promoter under memory conditions, but had no effect on the H3K4me2 over <i>INO1</i> under activating conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). ChIP-seq against H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 in wild type and <i>set3\u2206</i> strains revealed that <i>INO1</i> memory is associated with a Set3-dependent H3K4 dimethylation over the 5\u2019 end of the gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>; complete dataset: doi:10.5061/dryad.93fv2). The pattern of H3K4 dimethylation observed by ChIP-seq was similar to that revealed by ChIP qPCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), although the signal over the promoter was less apparent. This may be due to differences in shearing efficiency, aspects of library preparation or differences in normalization between the two techniques. Regardless, we observed clear Set3-dependent H3K4me2 over the <i>INO1</i> gene during memory. Trimethylation of H3K4 was observed only under activating conditions and was not Set3 dependent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, loss of Set3 resulted in neither trimethylation of H3K4 nor hyperacetylation of H3/H4 over the <i>INO1</i> promoter during memory (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that recognition of H3K4me2 by the Set3 PHD domain is required for the persistence of this mark during memory, but is dispensable for the deposition of H3K4me2 under activating conditions. Although Set3 associates with two different histone deacetylases, loss of Set3 does not alter the acetylation of histones over the <i>INO1</i> promoter under any of these conditions (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To confirm that the role of Set3 is direct and specific, we utilized the Anchor-Away system. Removal of Set3-FRB-GFP from the nucleus upon addition of rapamycin led to rapid loss of both H3K4 dimethylation and RNAPII binding under memory conditions but not under activating conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013I</a>). Therefore, Set3 is required for the persistence of H3K4me2 and RNAPII recruitment under memory conditions. As was observed with inactivation of COMPASS, loss of H3K4me2 preceded loss of RNAPII. This suggests that Set3 has a direct and continuous role in the perpetuation of transcriptional memory by both recognizing H3K4me2 and maintaining this mark after repression."

Furthermore, RNAPII association is <i>epigenetic</i>, persisting for \u22656\u00a0hr (3\u20134 generations) after repression, suggesting that it is bound to the promoter of the gene that had been expressed as well as the promoter of that gene in the daughters, granddaughters and great-granddaughters of that cell (<a href=\"#bib52\">Light et al., 2010</a>). Finally, <i>INO1</i> transcriptional memory is also\u00a0associated with binding of components of the preinitiation complex, including TBP, TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH (<a href=\"#bib53\">Light et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that memory recruits the PIC, leading to a poised form of the promoter that affects future activation rates."

Removal of TBP (Spt15), Mediator (Med1), TFIIH (Tfb1) and TFIIK (Kin28) from the nucleus was monitored by confocal microscopy and the effect of loss of each of these components was measured by ChIP against RNAPII and H3K4me2. Inactivation of Spt15, Med1 and Tfb1 caused RNAPII levels to drop over the <i>INO1</i> promoter under both activating and memory conditions, suggesting that TBP, Mediator and TFIIH are necessary for recruitment and stabilization of both active and poised PIC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B, E, H and K</a>). However, depletion of Kin28 (Cdk7 in mammals), the kinase module of TFIIK that phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII upon initiation, disrupted RNAPII binding to the <i>INO1</i> promoter under activating conditions, but not under memory conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>). This is consistent with the observation that Kin28 is not bound to the <i>INO1</i> promoter under memory conditions and that the RNAPII bound during memory is unphosphorylated on the CTD (<a href=\"#bib53\">Light et al., 2013</a>). Kin28 phosphorylation of the CTD regulates the interaction of Mediator with PIC, permitting promoter escape, which does not occur during memory (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Wong et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that PIC assembly during memory proceeds through a mechanism very similar to PIC assembly during active transcription, but is arrested upstream of Kin28/TFIIK recruitment, which maintains the PIC in a poised state."

ChIP-seq against H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 in wild type and <i>set3\u2206</i> strains under repressing, activating or memory conditions for <i>INO1</i> identified many loci whose dimethylation is Set3-dependent, loci that are induced by inositol starvation but do not show memory, genes whose expression is Set3-dependent and genes that show Set3-dependent H3K4me2 under all conditions (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

This suggests that <i>INO1</i> memory is remarkably specific. Therefore, to test the generality of the molecular mechanism of <i>INO1</i> transcriptional memory, we focused on yeast genes that show salt stress memory (<a href=\"#bib31\">Guan et al., 2012</a>). Previous exposure to 0.7M sodium chloride leads to faster or stronger induction of ~75 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-inducible genes for up to 4 generations and this requires the nuclear pore protein Nup42 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Guan et al., 2012</a>).

Finally, we discovered that salt treatment also induced <i>INO1</i> memory (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting some overlap in the regulation of these two forms of memory.

We propose that memory is initiated by the regulated binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor. Sfl1 is both necessary and sufficient to promote targeting to the nuclear periphery and loss of Sfl1 disrupts all aspects of <i>INO1</i> memory. If Sfl1 binding initiates memory, then the duration and heritability of memory may reflect the regulation of Sfl1 binding to the MRS. Sfl1 binds to the <i>INO1</i> promoter in an MRS-dependent manner specifically during memory. Because Sfl1 binding to other sites is constitutive, it seems that the regulation of Sfl1 binding is context-dependent. Sfl1 binding to the MRS may be influenced in <i>cis</i> by other transcription factors or by\u00a0the changes in chromatin structure that are associated with transcriptional memory. Understanding the regulation of Sfl1 binding to the <i>INO1</i> promoter and how this impacts the persistence and inheritance of memory will provide important insight into such epigenetic mechanisms of regulation."

Despite their similarity, these complexes show specialization in their functions, predominantly\u00a0producing H3K4me1, H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Herz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hu et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mohan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Shilatifard, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Steward et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Wu et al., 2008</a>). Here we show that yeast COMPASS exists in two alternative forms in vivo that can produce either H3K4me3 (complete COMPASS) or H3K4me2 (COMPASS lacking Spp1), supporting previous work showing that COMPASS lacking Spp1 produces H3K4me2 but not H3K4me3 in vitro\u00a0and\u00a0in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib61\">Morillon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Schneider et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Takahashi et al., 2009</a>). Thus, whereas metazoan systems have evolved several dedicated enzymes that separately catalyze mono- di- or trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4, yeast generates these enzymes through regulated complex remodeling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). It remains to be seen if COMPASS remodeling occurs during memory in metazoan cells, or if a different COMPASS-related complex serves this function."

It is unclear if the SET3C deacetylase activity per se is important for establishing a poised state. Although memory is associated with hypoacetylated histones, neither loss of Set3 nor mutation of the MRS leads to acetylation under these conditions. Our results suggest that SET3C either protects H3 lysine 4 from demethylases and/or promotes recruitment of remodeled COMPASS during memory (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>).

Assembly of the poised PIC during memory also requires TBP, Mediator and TFIIH, but is independent of Kin28/TFIIK (Cdk7). This is consistent with our observations that Kin28 is not bound to the <i>INO1</i> promoter during memory and that RNAPII is unphosphorylated on serine 5 of the CTD (<a href=\"#bib52\">Light et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">2013</a>).

However, for the genes that exhibit memory in yeast and humans, Cdk8 binding correlates with memory, when these genes are not transcribed. Furthermore, the role of Cdk8 in <i>INO1</i> memory is specific: inactivation of Cdk8 altered RNAPII recruitment to the <i>INO1</i> promoter under memory conditions and reduced the rate of reactivation, but had no effect on the RNAPII recruitment to the active gene or on the rate of activation. Reminiscent of the effect of Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator on TFIIH recruitment to the poised human <i>RARB</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pavri et al., 2005</a>), Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator occupancy is mutually exclusive with Kin28/TFIIK during <i>INO1</i> memory.

Thus, epigenetic transcriptional memory is a regulatory strategy that impinges upon a more broadly utilized poising mechanism through the action of nuclear pore proteins, remodeled COMPASS and SET3C. The function of H3K4 dimethylation is likely upstream of RNAPII PIC recruitment. This raises the possibility that some genes might be constitutively poised, independent of the memory-specific regulatory factors. Such genes should be bound to Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator and be rapidly induced, but might not be dimethylated on H3K4 or associated with nuclear pore proteins."

Cell suspension was mixed with 500\u2009\u03bcl 0.5\u2009mm glass beads from Biospec (11079105) in a 1.5\u2009ml tube and lysed by vortexing in a TOMY multichannel mixer at 4\u00b0C for 1\u2009hr to lyse cells. The sample was centrifuged at 1000x <i>g</i> at 4\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The pellet was suspended in 1\u2009ml of FA lysis buffer + protease inhibitor cocktail and loaded into a 1\u2009ml milliTUBE AFA Fiber from Covaris (520130). Chromatin shearing is performed with Covaris E220 focused ultrasonicator (Peak Incident Power: 280 W, Duty Factor; 20%, Cycles per Burst; 200, Time; 12\u2009min). Sheared DNA sizes within 200 to 500 bp were confirmed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel following protease K treatment at 65\u00b0C for 2\u2009hr and DNA purification with QIAquick Spin Columns (QIAGEN). Sonicated chromatin was centrifuged in 1.5\u00a0ml tubes at maximal speed, 4\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. The protein concentration of the cleared chromatin was quantified by Bradford method. 800\u2009\u03bcl of 1.5 mg/ml chromatin in FA lysis buffer + protease inhibitor cocktail was mixed with 20\u00a0\u00b5l anti-H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 antibodies and incubated with gentle shaking at 4\u00b0C overnight. 100\u2009\u03bcl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads from Santa Cruz Biotech (sc-2003) equilibrated with FA lysis buffer, was added to the chromatin-antibody complex and incubated with gentle shaking at 4\u00b0C overnight. The beads are washed with FA lysis buffer once, FA lysis buffer supplemented with 1\u2009M NaCl twice, FA-W3 buffer (10\u2009mM TrisHCl pH8.0, 250\u2009mM LiCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) once, and TE buffer once. Both the immunoprecipitated chromatin on the beads and non-immunoprecipitated chromatin for the input DNA were treated with 40\u2009\u03bcg of protease K in 300\u2009\u03bcl PK buffer (100\u2009mM TrisHCl pH7.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 12.5\u2009mM EDTA, 1% SDS) at 42\u00b0C for 3\u2009hr, followed by incubation at 65\u00b0C for 6\u2009hr. The immunoprecipitated DNA and the input DNA were purified with QIAquick Spin Columns, and used for library construction with Illumina\u2019s TruSeq DNA Library preparation kit. DNA libraries were validated with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and sequenced with NextSeq 500 System (Illumina) using default Illumina standards for base calling and read filtering (<a href=\"#bib42\">Keogh and Buratowski, 2004</a>)."

Here, they further address how this memory is established. More precisely, they investigate the chromatin changes from an active state to a repressed state. They characterized a poised state which is supposed to be an intermediate state associated to the transcriptional memory. They show that the transition to active from repressed state (defined as memory condition) correlates with the binding of the transcriptional repressor SfI1 at the <i>INO1</i> promoter. This binding is dependent on the presence of a Memory Recruitment Sequence at the <i>INO1</i> promoter and correlates with high levels of H3K4me2 and PolII, two hallmarks of the poised state. Moreover, SfI1 is required to retain <i>INO1</i> at the nuclear envelope in the memory condition. Next, they show that PolII recruitment is lost in the memory condition when H3K4 methylation is abolishes. They further document this latter point by anchoring away the COMPASS Cps50 (Swd1) subunit which is essential for the assembly of the complex and therefore for the three H3K4 methylation states. By depleting Cps50 from the nucleus, they observed a rapid decrease of H3K4me2 but a slow decrease of PolII occupancy. In parallel of these observations, they found that the COMPASS subunit Cps40 (Spp1) which is only required for H3K4me3 is not recruited to <i>INO1</i> in memory conditions in contrast to other subunits (Cps50 (Swd1), Cps60 (Bre2), and Cps25 (Sdc1)). Consistent with previous studies from Buratowski lab, they show persistent H3K4me2 is correlated with the recruitment of Set3 to <i>INO1</i> in memory conditions in a way that depend on the integrity of the Set3 PHD domain and on SfI1. They show that the presence of Set3 allows H3K4me2 to be maintained in the 5' end and 3' end of <i>INO1</i> in memory conditions. Next they show that nucleus depletion of Spt15, Med1, and Tbf1 prevents PolII to be maintained at the <i>INO1</i> promoter in memory conditions while depletion of Kin28 prevents the binding of PolII under activation but not under memory conditions. Similarly, during memory removal of Kin28 does not affect H3K4me2. Along the same line, they show that the mediator subunit Ssn3 (Cdk8) binds to <i>INO1</i> promoter under memory and that its conditional depletion from the nucleus leads to the loss of PolII from the <i>INO1</i> promoter. Finally, they show that four genes whose expression is induced by H202 and that have been identified as exhibiting a salt stress memory share features of the <i>INO1</i> memory, eg, Set3 recruitment and Set3-dependent PolII occupancy under memory."

This is particularly true in certain strains like BY4741 (see Brickner et al., 2007, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The experiments conducted here, in Light et al., 2010 and in Light et al., 2013 used W303-based strains, for which this difference is less clear. The reason that reactivation is not faster than activation is due to the fact that the Ino1 enzyme is long-lived and cells cannot sense inositol starvation as quickly during reactivation as during activation. This creates a refractory period during reactivation that is not observed during activation, delaying the onset of transcription. However, once they sense starvation, the rate of reactivation is strongly dependent on transcriptional memory. To strengthen our proposal that <i>INO1</i> is primed for faster activation, we now include kinetic analysis of RNAPII binding to both the promoter and the coding sequence during either activation or reactivation in wild type and <i>sfl1\u2206</i> mutant strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This experiment shows clearly that memory promotes association of active RNAPII with the <i>INO1</i> gene during reactivation, enhancing the rate of reactivation."

The RNAPII associated with <i>INO1</i> memory persists for 4 cell divisions, suggesting that it cannot represent the persistent binding of RNAPII to the originally transcribed gene (which constitutes only 6.25% of the loci after 4 generations). Memory lasts for up to 7 generations in HeLa cells (our unpublished data). Thus, RNAPII must be continuously recruited over this time period. Recruitment requires factors upstream of Kin28, but not Kin28, which is incompatible with the model that it is slow disassembly of active PIC (which requires Kin28). Finally, the recruitment of RNAPII during memory requires factors that are bound only after repression and that have no effect on the active promoter (i.e. Sfl1, Cdk8, Nup100)."

                    "text": "One thing that is counter-intuitive about <i>INO1</i> memory is that the rate of reactivation is similar to, or even slightly slower than, the rate of activation. This is particularly true in certain strains like BY4741 (see Brickner et al., 2007, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The experiments conducted here, in Light et al., 2010 and in Light et al., 2013 used W303-based strains, for which this difference is less clear. The reason that reactivation is not faster than activation is due to the fact that the Ino1 enzyme is long-lived and cells cannot sense inositol starvation as quickly during reactivation as during activation. This creates a refractory period during reactivation that is not observed during activation, delaying the onset of transcription. However, once they sense starvation, the rate of reactivation is strongly dependent on transcriptional memory. To strengthen our proposal that <i>INO1</i> is primed for faster activation, we now include kinetic analysis of RNAPII binding to both the promoter and the coding sequence during either activation or reactivation in wild type and <i>sfl1\u2206</i> mutant strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This experiment shows clearly that memory promotes association of active RNAPII with the <i>INO1</i> gene during reactivation, enhancing the rate of reactivation."
