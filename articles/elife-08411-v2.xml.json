We analyzed the genome-wide gene expression patterns of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) growing in rainfed and irrigated fields during two distinct tropical seasons and determined simple linear models that relate transcriptomic variation to climatic fluctuations. These models combine multiple environmental parameters to account for patterns of expression in the field of co-expressed gene clusters. We examined the similarities of our environmental models between tropical and temperate field conditions, using previously published data. We found that field type and macroclimate had broad impacts on transcriptional responses to environmental fluctuations, especially for genes involved in photosynthesis and development. Nevertheless, variation in solar radiation and temperature at the timescale of hours had reproducible effects across environmental contexts. These results provide a basis for broad-based predictive modeling of plant gene expression in the field."

We analyzed the genome-wide gene expression patterns of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) growing in rainfed and irrigated fields during two distinct tropical seasons and determined simple linear models that relate transcriptomic variation to climatic fluctuations. These models combine multiple environmental parameters to account for patterns of expression in the field of co-expressed gene clusters. We examined the similarities of our environmental models between tropical and temperate field conditions, using previously published data. We found that field type and macroclimate had broad impacts on transcriptional responses to environmental fluctuations, especially for genes involved in photosynthesis and development. Nevertheless, variation in solar radiation and temperature at the timescale of hours had reproducible effects across environmental contexts. These results provide a basis for broad-based predictive modeling of plant gene expression in the field."

The experiments show that temperature and levels of sunlight (including UV radiation) have a strong impact on gene expression in the rice plants. Short-term variations in temperature and sunlight levels also have the most consistent effect across the different fields and seasons tested. However, for many genes, the plants grown in the irrigated field responded to the changes in environmental conditions in a different way to the plants grown in the rainfed field."

Variations in environmental signals, including temperature, water levels, solar radiation, biotic interactions and resource availability, are often unpredictable and need to be integrated and transduced to changes in gene expression, which may then be associated with physiological and/or morphological adaptations (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahuja et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Weston et al., 2008</a>). Predicting the adaptive responses occurring in natural environments is a key challenge in plant biology.

This so-called \u201claboratory/field (lab-field) gap\u201d is often referred to when trying to explain why the improvement of crops for resistance to abiotic stresses, for example, has not met the expectations arising from advances in genomics technologies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cabello et al., 2014</a>).

The study of plant response to multiple concurrent stimuli, however, can provide insights into both ecological adaptation and, in the context of crop species, crop performance. Concurrent stresses have a\u00a0major impact: the combination of heat and drought stresses, for example, has been found to be more detrimental to crop yield than the addition of either stress alone (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mittler, 2006</a>). The interplay of multiple dynamic factors also affect plants at the physiological level, particularly in the case of photosynthesis: mesophyll conductance depends on both CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and irradiance\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Kaiser, et al., 2015</a>), while drought can undermine the otherwise positive effect of high temperature on photosynthetic efficiency (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pfannschmidt and Yang, 2012</a>). Some of the effects of combinations of multiple environmental perturbations on gene expression cannot be predicted from the individual treatments, as has been shown in tobacco (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rizhsky et al., 2002a</a>), <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rasmussen et al., 2013</a>) and sorghum (<a href=\"#bib17\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>).

These concerns arise mainly from the known sensitivity of gene expression to the overall environmental background, which in nature cannot be controlled. Thus, the extent to which the climatic or ecological context affects molecular environmental responses of interest in plants remains to be determined. The transcriptional effect of the environmental context is all the more critical considering that, for crop species, different types of agricultural settings or climates will impact dynamic gene expression responses that can translate into key phenotypes."

Moreover, we examine the macro-environmental context of genome-wide gene expression by measuring transcriptome variation in contrasting seasons and field types. We analyzed the\u00a0global gene expression patterns in <i>O. sativa</i> over a period of 1 month in two fields typical of the main modes of rice cultivation.\u00a0We conducted these experimentsover two seasons, dry and wet, in three rice landraces. We used model selection methods to relate the main variations in global gene expression to variation in several environmental/developmental parameters with simple linear equations. The genetic background of the plants had limited effect on the environmental response of the global transcriptome. We show that additive effects of several environmental factors drive the\u00a0field expression of multiple co-expressed gene clusters. We also found that the field context reshaped a large part of transcriptional patterns, while the effect of season was more limited. This sensitivity to the environmental context was particularly important for groups of co-expressed genes involved in photosynthesis and development. Finally, we used previously-published\u00a0field expression data from <a href=\"#bib34\">Nagano et al.

The\u00a0plants were cultivated in two adjacent fields typical of two different systems of rice cultivation. One field was cultivated following irrigated lowland practices: it was flooded with shallow water under constant irrigation and seedlings were transplanted to the field after being raised for 3 weeks in seedbeds (referred to as irrigated field). The second field was managed according to upland cultivation practices: it was rainfed, not irrigated and had been directly seeded (referred to as rainfed field). Each field was divided into two subfields constituting the biological replicates. We grew three different landraces of rice: (i) Azucena, an upland adapted landrace; (ii) Pandan Wangi, traditionally used for lowland cultivation only in the dry season; and (iii) Palawan, another upland adapted landrace\u00a0that\u00a0is used\u00a0only during wet season cultivation."

This approach relies on selecting a linear combination of environmental/developmental (ED) input parameters that both minimizes model mean squared error (MSE), quantifying the difference between the model and the expression data, and limits model complexity (i.e., avoiding over-fitting). A preliminary analysis showed that allowing for more than three parameters per equation over-fit the model more often than improving it, so we limited the number of parameters per linear equation to three. A typical ED equation had the following form: cluster mean = \u03b1ED1\u00a0+ \u03b2ED2 +\u00a0\u03b3ED3, where ED1, ED2 and ED3 are ED parameters, and \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are linear regression coefficients. The ED parameters used in these models were measurements of current conditions at the time of sampling, recent changes in temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation, temperature fluctuations, and short-term and long-term averages for all climatic conditions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We included parameters for non-linear effect of short-term solar radiation on gene expression, because this type of effect has been observed on photosynthesis rate (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2009</a>). There were two parameters for field soil moisture, at 30 and 15 cm below ground (measured with tensiometers in the rainfed field and estimated to be constant at soil saturation value in the irrigated field), and a binary parameter for the field (irrigated or rainfed). A parameter was designed to represent developmental stage, using fixed values for the transplanting stage, end of tillering production and the heading time. Our set of ED parameters included those\u00a0that correlated with each other, so we averaged nearly similar parameters (r &gt; 0.98) and added to our model selection approach the constraint that two parameters with a Pearson correlation coefficient over 0.85 could not be selected in the same equation."

While the median genotype correlation of all genes in the analysis was 0.55, the median of all gene cluster means was 0.90, showing that averaging expression profiles over many genes remarkably reduces sources of non-replicability. We focused on 27 gene expression clusters with a genotype correlation greater than 0.9 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). They encompass 11,371 (63%) of the 17,931 genes in the analysis, as they include most of the largest gene clusters. These clusters are also the ones with the best ED models (i.e., with a small error and low complexity, such as the one depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). For these clusters, we observed extensive field effect on the climatic/developmental response, with only 6 out the 27 clusters (2308 genes) showing high correlation (r &gt; 0.8) between fields in both seasons. As expected from the much lower precipitation levels during the dry season, which accentuated the difference in water availability between fields (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), the dry season climatic conditions generated wider between-field differences in gene expression compared with the wet season (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). The season effect was slightly less prevalent, as 11 out the 27 clusters (4967 genes) were modeled with the same equation for both seasons (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>), indicative of season-independent responses."

This field effect is modeled for cluster 9 by the inclusion of a negative term for soil moisture, indicative of an additive effect of water availability on gene expression over the short-term effect of temperature/solar radiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). Cluster 9 is highly enriched for genes related to response to heat (p&lt;10<sup>\u201318</sup>, hypergeometric test), response to high light intensity (p&lt;10<sup>\u20139</sup>) and, more generally, response to abiotic stimulus (p&lt;10<sup>\u20136</sup>), which is consistent with an induction by drought, solar radiation and/or temperature increase.

This result is consistent with the deleterious effect of abiotic stress on photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chaves et al., 2009</a>) and shows the consequences of that effect on the expression of genes involved in the metabolic processes dependent on photosynthetic products. In contrast, cluster 12 had a higher level of expression in the rainfed field environment in the dry season. Like cluster 9 in group 1, it is modeled with positive terms for short-term temperature/solar radiation across both fields and both seasons and is enriched for several categories of abiotic stimulus response genes. Cluster 12 differs from cluster 9 in that the difference in gene expression between fields during the dry season is more acute, with a higher difference in mean expression and a lower field correlation. This shows that there were two distinct main behaviors of abiotic stress response genes in our experiment, both responding to short-term temperature/solar radiation and drought but to different extents. Clusters 4 and 31 also have an expression pattern consistent with induction by drought. They are both enriched for genes in categories related to development and phenology, like cell cycle for both, anatomical structure development and photomorphogenesis for cluster 4 and photoperiodism for cluster 31."

Few genes have been functionally characterized for a role in the response to combined environmental stresses. We have found multiple clusters with patterns of expression showing additive effects of several environmental signals. Because changes in the expression of a gene in reaction to perturbations in an environmental factor are usually interpreted as this gene having a function in the physiological response to that factor, our results suggest the genes in these clusters are involved in the response to simultaneous environmental changes. We assessed this further by looking at whether genes shown to have a role in the response to a specific abiotic stimulus also responded transcriptionally to other environmental signals. We compiled lists of genes that had already been demonstrated to have a role in the response to light, water availability or temperature in rice as well as rice homologs of such genes in other species (mainly the model system <i>A. thaliana).</i> We looked at whether the expression patterns of these genes were consistent with their putative function.

We used the same climatic measurements as those found in our experiment, which were recorded every minute. We refer to this data as the partial Nagano dataset (PND). To determine to what extent our results would hold true under a different climate, we performed a new analysis of our data that excluded measurements from the rainfed field (using the irrigated field half of the two seasons analysis dataset), as the experiment in Japan was exclusively conducted in an irrigated field (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Consequently, we only tested the transferability of models for those of our clusters with a season-independent model, when the model explained more than half of the variance of the cluster mean.

About a half of the models determined with the method by <a href=\"#bib34\">Nagano et al. (2012)</a> do not have an environmental term and those that do, include the effect of a single climatic factor per gene, with a term that can be non-linear with diurnal changes in sensitivity. This makes their models intrinsically incompatible for a systematic direct comparison with ours. We thus chose to focus on two sets of genes identified by each method as having a clear environmental response and no developmental effect, and then evaluate the results of the alternative method on these genes. First, we selected from the results of our analysis genes highly correlated with their respective cluster means (r &gt; 0.8) and belonging to three clusters with a low error model (MSE &lt; 0.25) that included neither a developmental stage term nor a climatic parameter strongly correlated with the\u00a0developmental stage. Among these 390 genes, 156 (40%) had a <a href=\"#bib34\">Nagano et al. (2012)</a> model that included an environmental term for the timepoints we considered (between 8:00 and 16:00). Second, we chose genes with <a href=\"#bib34\">Nagano et al. (2012)</a> models, including no developmental or circadian terms and with a linear environmental term for either temperature or solar radiation (which have the most reproducible effects) that explained more than 50% of the expression variance. When looking at the results of our analysis for these 214 genes, we found that 155 (72%) of them were in a cluster with at least one environmental term and a model error lower than 0.35 (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.7). Our method was thus more efficient in matching the Nagano et al. models with a clear environmental term than the <a href=\"#bib34\">Nagano et al. (2012)</a> method was in the reciprocal comparison. This indicates that our approach has a higher sensitivity to the effect of climatic factors on gene expression, in addition to its ability to detect the co-occurring effects of multiple environmental parameters."

Our dry season experiment, which included a drought period, presented ideal conditions to understand how limited water availability is integrated with other climatic signals at the transcriptional level in the field in comparison to controlled conditions. One common finding of studies on the combined effects of drought and heat is that a high number of genes are differentially expressed only by the combination of both stresses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rizhsky et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2002b</a>). However, these results might be due to the fact that the differential expression induced by individual stresses is under the threshold of significance, while the addition of both small effects passes the differential expression threshold. Part of the assumed specificity could therefore be an artifact of the analysis. Although we cannot make a direct comparison with our analysis, as we do not have conditions testing the effect of drought alone, we can contrast gene expression responses between irrigated and rainfed fields during the dry season to assess how drought impacts the response to other abiotic stimuli and test whether there is indeed a specific response to drought combined with short-term climatic signals. Excluding clusters from groups 3 and 4, the expression of which is impacted by non-drought related field effects in the wet season, the different effects induced by drought in the rainfed field for clusters modeled with terms for short-term averages of temperature/solar radiation in the irrigated field during the dry season were (i) show the same response to short-term temperature/solar radiation with no or little shift in expression (clusters 18, 21 and 24); (ii) show an additive effect of drought over the short-term climatic response (clusters 4, 9, 12 and 30); or (iii) not display the short-term climatic response under drought (clusters 1, 8, 10 and 11). Only cluster 44, containing 204 genes, responded to short-term temperature/solar radiation variations in the dry season, specifically in the rainfed field. Our results therefore show that the main behaviors under combined drought and short-term abiotic signals are an\u00a0addition of both responses and response to either one of the stimuli (often integrated with a long-term climatic response), while responses specific to the combination of both stresses are rare."

In many cases, these genes also seemed to respond to other abiotic stimuli, demonstrating the extensive connections between environmental pathways occurring in complex natural conditions. Some genes did not, however, have a pattern of expression consistent with what was measured in previous laboratory studies. For example, <i>OsCDPK7</i> and <i>OsMIOX</i> have been shown to be induced by drought (<a href=\"#bib10\">Duan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wan et al., 2007</a>). Nevertheless, in our data, there were no differences in mean expression between the irrigated and rainfed fields in the dry season for <i>OsCDPK7</i>, while <i>OsMIOX</i> was less expressed in the rainfed field than in the irrigated field during both seasons. These discrepancies may be explained by the fact that abiotic stresses are generally analyzed individually. Some genes induced by drought, when water availability is the only varying\u00a0environmental parameter, might be mostly responsive to temperature during a combination of drought and heat stress."

The effect of an abiotic stress is often analyzed within hours of the stress treatment; in our field experiment, we examined climatic variables that changed constantly and gradually over a month. The time-scale of the study is especially critical in the case of drought stress, because in natural conditions, it usually occurs over the course of days or weeks. More generally, covering longer time frames than laboratory studies allowed us to observe environmental effects interact with plant developmental processes in an integrated way (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2015</a>), as well as examine the effects of long-term seasonal climatic effects. Our results thus show that measuring gene expression under natural conditions and for long periods of time can help better assess the effect of multiple abiotic stimuli on gene expression."

Short-term averages of solar radiation and temperature belong to the group of parameters that was used to model most of the 27 gene co-expression clusters, with the highest correlation between genotypes in our two-season analysis. In particular, the exponentially transformed short-term averages (15\u2009min, 1 or 4\u2009hr) of solar radiation (NL\u2212 ) that model stronger effects of variations in the lowest range of irradiance were selected to model at least one entire season or field subset for 12 of the 27 gene clusters of our analysis and could systematically be transferred from the models of our irrigated field data to explain the expression variation of the same clusters of genes observed under the Japanese temperate climate (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>). In the conditions of the <a href=\"#bib34\">Nagano et al. (2012)</a> experiment, short-term solar radiation variation was weakly correlated with variation in temperature and precipitation, showing that this effect is likely to be specific to irradiance level. The reason why variation in the lowest range of solar radiation values seem to have a stronger effect on gene expression (compared with higher irradiance levels) for some clusters needs to be investigated. One hypothesis is that responses to low light can rely mostly on changes in gene expression because they do not require as rapid a response as high light conditions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pfannschmidt and Yang, 2012</a>)."

One explanation is that, as these responses may be integrated over long periods of time, there is greater opportunity for them to be modulated by broad climatic and developmental factors. The only long-term environmental factor that could be transferred to model gene expression under the Japanese climate for several clusters was the 15-day average of wind speed. In our two-season analysis, it was selected to model across both seasons and fields cluster 32, which is enriched for thigmotropism genes. While there have already been studies aiming at identifying genes responsive to mechanical cues (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2005</a>), they were limited to hour-scale laboratory experiments. Our results show that, in nature, the effect of wind on gene expression might be more prevalent on a week-scale, which is consistent with the long-term accommodation to repetitive wind loads observed in poplar (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin et al., 2010</a>). Further study of the genes in cluster 32 should contribute to the understanding of gene regulation in response to wind necessary to unravel the cellular processes involved in the time integration of mechanosensing (<a href=\"#bib33\">Moulia et al., 2011</a>)."

The strong enrichment in nucleic acid metabolic process related genes highlights the importance of a tight transcriptional regulation of this molecular process, probably linked to the control of cell division, in the adaptation of the developmental program to environmental fluctuations (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rymen and Sugimoto, 2012</a>). Both clusters had a negative correlation between field expression profiles in the dry season, while the field correlation was above 0.75 in the wet season, during which both cluster means were modeled with a positive term for the developmental stage parameter. This indicates an extensive impact of drought on the expression pattern of the genes in these clusters.

This is particularly difficult in the context of complex environments found in nature, as it requires unraveling the concurrent effects of multiple, fluctuating environmental signals on transcriptional patterns.

Our results suggest that while field environments can result in complex responses, one can nevertheless identify co-expressed gene clusters the mean expression of which can be accurately modeled with climatic, field, seasonal and developmental factors. Further work can integrate such models with other approaches, including gene network inference (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonneau et al., 2007</a>), genotype-by-environment interactions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Marais et al., 2013</a>) and phenotypic modeling (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aikawa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Satake et al., 2013</a>), to provide a more comprehensive picture of plant responses in natural environments.

Total RNA,\u00a04\u00a0\u00b5g, were depleted of ribosomal RNA using Epicentre Ribo-Zero Magnetic Kit for plant leaf tissue. We purified the depleted RNA with the Agencourt RNAClean XP kit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). We constructed RNA libraries using the Epicentre ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit, purifying the complementary\u00a0DNA and libraries with the Agencourt AMPure XP System. We added barcode index using the Epicentre ScriptSeq Index PCR Primers. We quantified the libraries by Qubit (Life Technologies, Norwalk, Connecticut), with the DNA HS kit. Libraries quality and average fragment size was determined using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with high sensitivity DNA reagents and DNA chip. We quantified the libraries on the LightCycler 480 (Roche, Nutley, NJ) using the KAPA (Wilmongton, MA) Library Quantification Kit. Libraries were sequenced using HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) 51 bp paired-end sequencing, with either 6 or 8 libraries per lane. Each sample provided a mean of 58 million sequencing reads."

We calculated the coefficient of variation of the log-transformed expression over the 240 data points for each expressed gene. We identified 1251 genes with a coefficient of variation below 0.01, which were considered as having a stable expression in our experiment and were removed from the analysis. A preliminary cluster analysis showed that genes with a very low expression level had a weak correlation with the center of their clusters, thus 2962 genes with a mean lower than 1 were not included in the clustering step.

To choose the number of clusters (k) we first used several clustering indices but they gave inconsistent results and usually indicated a k lower than 20. To avoid running the risk of under-clustering, which would have resulted in averaging genes responding to very different ED factors and therefore losing transcriptional signal, we chose to constrain k only on the fact that most clusters should represent a major trend in transcriptional variation. We therefore chose k as the highest number of clusters for which no more than 5% of all the genes in the analysis belonged to \u201cnon-representative\u201d small clusters, defined as containing less than 1% of all the genes in the analysis.

We used only data from sampling points collected at 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00 and 16:00 as these times were far enough from sunrise (around 4:30) and sunset (around 19:00). We only used data from samples collected before flowering, from 15 to 62 days after transplanting. Sunrise time varied little enough during that period (from 4:23 to 4:34) that it could be estimated that a series of samples collected at the same time of day would have negligible variation in circadian clock. There were eight samples collected at 8:00, 12 samples at 10:00, eight samples for single replicates and 24 samples for triplicates of eight sampling points at 12:00, eight samples at 14:00 and eight samples at 16:00. We excluded from the analysis genes with an expression value below \u22127 in more than 17 samples, keeping 19,837 genes, 16,659 of which overlap with the ones in our analysis. We averaged the biological triplicates, resulting in a total of 52 data points. For every gene, we centered individually each of the separate profiles corresponding to a given time of day, thus eliminating potential circadian clock driven differences between these times of sampling. This data constituted the PND."

Using the same gene distribution as our irrigated field clusters, we calculated cluster means for the PND. We calculated climatic parameters in the same way as we did for our experiment. The developmental stage parameter was the number of days after transplanting. Input parameters were centered per time of day to match the expression data. We applied the second step of our model selection method to these profiles to select models common to all five time-of-day profiles, using as a subset of parameters the ones in the model determined for our irrigated field data instead of the hdi pre-selection. We only kept a parameter in the new model if it was fitted with a coefficient of the same sign as in the original model."

Most critically, the authors only state that the hdi package in R was used, without indicating if they used it with the default setting (lasso) for the variable/parameter selection.

For example, model selection on: lm(gene expression ~ genotype*season*timepoint*treatment).

We were only interested in differences between genotypes related to their environmental responses and not in mean differences in expression level. Differences in mean expression level between seasons could be caused by differences in climatic factors as well as other factors that we did not include in our analysis for example day length or non-water related soil characteristics. To avoid attributing mean differences between seasons to the wrong effect, we preferred not to take into account these differences in mean expression level. For these reasons, each quarter of the dataset constituting one genotype in one season was centered, which removed differences in mean level of expression between genotypes and between seasons. This centering was performed once before the data was used in either the dry season only or two seasons analysis. Scaling was done once, for each gene over the whole dataset used in each analysis, prior to clustering. The exact same treatment is applied to the environmental parameters.

To be more consistent across our different analyses, we have now specified a criterion for this limitation: we have constrained the number of clusters so that no more than 5% of all the genes in the analysis belong to \u201cnon-representative\u201d small clusters, defined as containing less than 1% of all the genes in the analysis. To find an optimal number of clusters below this constraint for our main analysis (two-season analysis), we have used the GAP statistic, which had local maxima at 18, 23, 31, 38, 43 and 48 clusters. We then tried other indices, which also had local maxima: 8, 14, 28, 36 and 46 for the silhouette index, 9, 31, 36, 40, 42, 49 and 52 for the Dunn index, 14, 29 and 43 for the SD validity index. If we were to use as a number of cluster the first local maximum provided by one of the indices cited above, it would be between 8 and 18. We have considered the dangers of under-clustering (setting k too small) and over-clustering (setting k to be larger than the \u2018true\u2019 number of co-regulated groups of genes). Upon careful consideration we find it is clear that under-clustering has dire consequences to our downstream analysis (averaging together genes that are unrelated dampens/destroys signal) while over-clustering is of minor consequence (splitting a large cluster into two smaller clusters does not produce spurious results, but simply reduces the efficiency of the summarization afforded by the clustering). To avoid the risk of under-clustering, we therefore chose k as the highest number of clusters that would satisfy our requirement for representativeness of most clusters. This is now discussed more clearly in the Materials and methods section."

For example, model selection on: lm(gene expression ~ genotype*season*timepoint*treatment).

Why is this: because of the extreme difficulty of comparing the results from even slightly different technologies and different experimental designs. In this section of the paper we are trying to do this in spite of the difficulty of comparing apples and oranges. So, part of the motivation for including this comparison is our belief that the lack of comparisons to past studies is a critical void in the genomics community.

Therefore, we have now preferred using a new analysis of our data that includes only irrigated field gene expression and chose to only keep clusters with a single equation for both seasons of our experiment, which can be considered as a first transferability test (from one season to the other). We then used these models determined from our data to test which of the developmental/environmental effects could also be detected on a subset of the Nagano data comparable to our own data in terms of day time and plant age, organized in the same clusters as in our data.

Even though Nagano et al. use a computational approach to analyze gene expression patterns in field grown rice like we do, their experimental design and aims differ from ours so distinctively, that it makes it very difficult to compare their results with ours. First, our purpose is focused on identifying relationships between gene expression and environmental conditions while Nagano et al. are investigating all possible drivers of gene expression in order to be able to predict gene expression. Because of these distinct aims, their sampling spans all of daytime and nighttime and the whole developmental life of the plant when ours is limited to one time of day, and spans only one month of the vegetative stage. A consequence of these differences in experimental design is that we cannot apply our modeling approach to their entire dataset but need to reduce it to include only one developmental stage, one part of the day and remove circadian changes. Furthermore, Nagano et al. have adopted a very different strategy to model environmental effects: their environmental term can only consider one climatic factor per model and includes a threshold, the possibility of rectangular or sinusoidal gate and of a dose-independent response. One other major difference is that they infer models for individual genes while we do it for co-expressed groups of genes. All these differences make it impossible to conduct a valid systematic comparison of the Nagano et al. models with models that we have generated from a subset of their data. To be able to do any comparison, we could only consider extreme cases of each approach that would make the models more or less similar. We had to keep in mind however that the Nagano et al. were inferred on a much larger dataset so that any result from the comparison must be considered with caution."

We found that among the 133 model equations selected for these 53 clusters (one cluster can be modeled with several equations for different field/season partitions), only ten contained four parameters and one had 5 five parameters, showing that equations with three or less parameters are generally enough to model the cluster means. We compared the results for the 11 clusters whose models included equations with more than three parameters with a run of model selection that constrained each equation to no more than three parameters and found that the models constrained for the number of parameters had BICs comparable to the ones with no constraint in five cases and resulted in lower BIC in two cases. The reason for this occasional inability of our method to prevent over-fitting the models resides in its using successive steps of model selection, instead of comparing all possible models at once, which is intractable with the piece-wise modeling approach we are using. In three cases, allowing for more parameters per equation did improve the model significantly, but we estimated that it was preferable to control for the over-fitting occurring in the other cases and therefore chose to limit the number of parameters per equation to three in the final version of the model selection pipeline.

We found it more informative to cluster all genes and work on reproducible cluster means than only model a few genes with reproducible patterns of expression. As explained before, the novel aspects of this dataset compared to Nagano et al. is that we are assessing the integration of multiple environmental signals (including drought) and the effect of different types of environmental context."
