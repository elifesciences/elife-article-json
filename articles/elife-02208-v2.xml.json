                    "text": "Budding yeast Spc110, a member of \u03b3-tubulin complex receptor family (\u03b3-TuCR), recruits \u03b3-tubulin complexes to microtubule (MT) organizing centers (MTOCs). Biochemical studies suggest that Spc110 facilitates higher-order \u03b3-tubulin complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kollman et al., 2010</a>). Nevertheless the molecular basis for this activity and the regulation are unclear. Here we show that Spc110 phosphorylated by Mps1 and Cdk1 activates \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization and MT nucleation in a cell cycle dependent manner. Interaction between the N-terminus of the \u03b3-TuSC subunit Spc98 and Spc110 is important for this activity. Besides the conserved CM1 motif in \u03b3-TuCRs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sawin et al., 2004</a>), a second motif that we named Spc110/Pcp1 motif (SPM) is also important for MT nucleation. The activating Mps1 and Cdk1 sites lie between SPM and CM1 motifs. Most organisms have both SPM-CM1 (Spc110/Pcp1/PCNT) and CM1-only (Spc72/Mto1/Cnn/CDK5RAP2/myomegalin) types of \u03b3-TuCRs. The two types of \u03b3-TuCRs contain distinct but conserved C-terminal MTOC targeting domains."

Biochemical studies suggest that Spc110 facilitates higher-order \u03b3-tubulin complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kollman et al., 2010</a>). Nevertheless the molecular basis for this activity and the regulation are unclear. Here we show that Spc110 phosphorylated by Mps1 and Cdk1 activates \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization and MT nucleation in a cell cycle dependent manner. Interaction between the N-terminus of the \u03b3-TuSC subunit Spc98 and Spc110 is important for this activity. Besides the conserved CM1 motif in \u03b3-TuCRs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sawin et al., 2004</a>), a second motif that we named Spc110/Pcp1 motif (SPM) is also important for MT nucleation. The activating Mps1 and Cdk1 sites lie between SPM and CM1 motifs. Most organisms have both SPM-CM1 (Spc110/Pcp1/PCNT) and CM1-only (Spc72/Mto1/Cnn/CDK5RAP2/myomegalin) types of \u03b3-TuCRs. The two types of \u03b3-TuCRs contain distinct but conserved C-terminal MTOC targeting domains."

For a cell to divide successfully, the chromosomes containing the genetic information of the cell must be duplicated and then separated so that one copy of each chromosome ends up in each daughter cell. To separate the chromosomes, microtubules extend out from two structures called spindle pole bodies, which are found at either end of the cell, and pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell."

In yeast cells, a protein called gamma-tubulin is recruited to the spindle pole body by the protein Spc110, where it combines with two other proteins to form a complex called the gamma-tubulin small complex. Several of these complexes then join together to form a ring, which probably acts as the platform that microtubules grow from. Recent observations suggested that Spc110 may help to construct this ring, but without revealing how."

However, the Spc110 must become active before it can perform this role, and it is only activated during certain stages of cell division, through phosphorylation. The structures in Spc110 that bind to the gamma-tubulin small complex in yeast are also found in gamma-tubulin binding receptor proteins in human cells. The work of Lin et al. demonstrates that proteins that are assumed to have passive roles within cells, such as Spc110, often play more active roles instead."

As soon as MTs emanate from both SPBs, they interdigitate (pole to pole MTs) or attach to the kinetochores (pole to kinetochore MTs) at the end of S phase, forming the bipolar spindle (<a href=\"#bib58\">O'Toole et al., 1999</a>)."

In budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, two molecules of \u03b3-tubulin (Tub4) assemble together with one molecule of Spc97 (ortholog of human GCP2) and Spc98 (ortholog of human GCP3) into a tetrameric \u03b3-tubulin small complex (\u03b3-TuSC), which is conserved in all eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Geissler et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Knop et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Guillet et al., 2011</a>). The purified \u03b3-TuSC of budding yeast is able to self-oligomerize into symmetric ring-like structures under low salt buffer conditions. The diameter and the pitch of the \u03b3-TuSC ring resemble that of MT cylinder, suggesting that the \u03b3-TuSC ring functions as a MT nucleation template. However, the in vitro nucleation activity of the \u03b3-TuSC assemblies remained poor, presumably because of the suboptimal spacing of every second Tub4 within the \u03b3-TuSC ring that blocks interaction with tubulin in the MT cylinder (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kollman et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Choy et al., 2009</a>). The concept of \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization is further supported by in vivo measurements of budding yeast \u03b3-tubulin complex components on detached single MT nucleation sites. The \u03b3-tubulin:Spc97:Spc98 ratio was 2.4:1.0:1.3 with a total of \u223c17 \u03b3-tubulin molecules per nucleation site (<a href=\"#bib21\">Erlemann et al., 2012</a>), suggesting a slight excess of \u03b3-tubulin and Spc98 molecules over Spc97 in the assembled MT nucleation site."

Most of them carry a highly conserved centrosomin motif 1 (CM1) that interacts with GCP subunits of \u03b3-tubulin complexes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sawin et al., 2004</a>). How Mozart1 and \u03b3-TuCRs cooperate is not understood. However, in budding yeast cells that lack a Mozart1 gene, \u03b3-TuCRs are the sole factors responsible for \u03b3-TuSC recruitment to SPBs. Spc110 is the budding yeast homolog of pericentrin (PCNT) and functions as \u03b3-TuCRs at the nuclear side of the SPB (<a href=\"#bib42\">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sundberg and Davis, 1997</a>). The N-terminal Spc110 encompasses the CM1 that interacts with the Spc98 subunit of \u03b3-TuSC (<a href=\"#bib42\">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nguyen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Vinh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sawin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zhang and Megraw, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Samejima et al., 2008</a>). In addition, the N-terminal region of Spc110 is phosphorylated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. Phospho-Spc110 appears as cells progress from S phase, continues accumulating during mitosis, and vanishes at the anaphase onset (<a href=\"#bib27\">Friedman et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Stirling and Stark, 1996</a>). Spc110 phosphorylation accounts for the impact of Cdk1 and Mps1 kinases on spindle dynamics (<a href=\"#bib26\">Friedman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Huisman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Liang et al., 2013</a>).

The nucleation capacity of this purified \u03b3-TuSC-Spc110<sup>1\u2013220</sup> complex exceeded that of the \u03b3-TuSC alone (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kollman et al., 2010</a>).

Single particle analysis of \u03b3-TuSC incubated with phosphomimetic Spc110 mutant proteins showed that Mps1 and Cdk1 promoted MT nucleation through Spc110 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Spc110 and the interaction with the N-terminal domain of Spc98 induce \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization. In addition, bioinformatic analysis revealed a conserved region around T18, that we named Spc110/Pcp1 motif (SPM). SPM and CM1 motifs are both important for \u03b3-TuSC binding and oligomerization. A comparison of \u03b3-TuCRs for the presence of SPM and CM1 identified SPM-CM1 (Spc110, Pcp1, PCNT) and CM1-only types of \u03b3-TuCRs (Spc72, Mto1, Cnn, CDK5RAP2, myomegalin) in most organisms.

Spc110 dimerizes via the coiled-coli region in the centre of the protein (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kilmartin et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Muller et al., 2005</a>). To substitute for the lack of this region, we performed the assays with GST-Spc110<sup>1\u2013220</sup> that dimerizes via GST\u2013GST interactions. We used TB150 buffer in our assay instead of the BRB80 buffer used by <a href=\"#bib45\">Kollman et al. (2010)</a>. BRB80 induces oligomerization of \u03b3-TuSC without the need for addition of Spc110 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). In contrast, in TB150 buffer the majority of \u03b3-TuSC was monomeric (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). TB150 therefore allowed us to monitor the impact of Spc110<sup>1\u2013220</sup> on \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization by gel filtration. Addition of Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-P</sup> shifted \u03b3-TuSC into fractions that eluted earlier than when \u03b3-TuSC was run on the columns on its own (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, shift from fraction 10 to fraction 8). The peak at the void-volume (fraction 8) likely represented \u03b3-TuSC oligomers. In contrast, non-phosphorylated Spc110<sup>1\u2013220</sup> expressed in <i>E. coli</i> did not change the \u03b3-TuSC elution profile. The \u03b3-TuSC pool eluted as monomeric \u03b3-TuSC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, fractions 10\u201311). This result suggests that Mps1 and Cdk1 kinases regulate the interaction between Spc110 and \u03b3-TuSC through phosphorylation of Spc110 N-terminal domain."

The behavior of the phosphomimetic Spc110 mutant proteins reflected that of in vivo phosphorylated Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-P</sup> purified from insect cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that the mutations to acidic residues did mimic phosphorylation.

This conclusion was further supported by the observation that Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-2D</sup> or Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-3D</sup> still possessed oligomerization-promoting activity when combined with non-phosphorylatable mutations (Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-2D3A</sup> and Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-2A3D</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

This indicates the presence of ring-like complexes or even higher-order oligomeric structures in the void-volume. To confirm the existence of structurally organized oligomers, fractions corresponding to the void-volume peak (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, fraction 7) were subjected to EM analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Consistent with the low A<sub>280</sub> absorbance, hardly any oligomeric \u03b3-TuSC species were found in the void fraction of \u03b3-TuSC only or \u03b3-TuSC incubated with the non-phosphorylated Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-WT</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>).

Therefore we performed GST-pulldown assay to measure the binding of the Spc110<sup>1\u2013220</sup> variants to \u03b3-TuSC. A constant amount of \u03b3-TuSC was incubated with increasing concentrations of Spc110<sup>1\u2013220</sup> variants (0\u2013300 nM). Consistent with the \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-5D</sup> showed stronger (p<i>=</i>0.0017 for Spc97/Spc98 and p<i>=</i>0.0006 for Tub4) \u03b3-TuSC binding than Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-WT</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>).

A likely explanation is the 30-fold reduction in concentration that was used in the GST-pulldown assay compared to \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization assays. These results suggested that phosphorylation of Spc110 on S36, S60, T64, T68, and S91 promotes \u03b3-TuSC binding to Spc110."

Since phosphorylation of Spc110 and the presence of a functional SPM regulate \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization into template rings, we expected to see differences in MT nucleation depending on these parameters (<a href=\"#fig2 fig3\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). Compared to the buffer control and \u03b3-TuSC alone, a \u223cthreefold increase (p&lt;0.05) in MT nucleation activity was observed for Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-2D</sup>, Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-3D</sup>, or Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-5D</sup> upon incubation with \u03b3-TuSC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). In contrast, Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-WT</sup> showed levels of MT nucleation that were comparable to the buffer control and \u03b3-TuSC alone.

These results are in accordance with EM particle quantification assays, as Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-2D</sup>, Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-3D</sup>, or Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-5D</sup> induced similar and significantly more \u03b3-TuSC ring assemblies than Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-WT</sup> and Spc110<sup>1\u2013220-5D-T18D</sup> (p&lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>).

Thus, the reduction of the Spc97-GFP signal in G1 and S phase most likely reflects a reduction of \u03b3-TuSC binding to the <i>SPC110</i> mutant molecules at SPBs. The observation that all <i>spc110</i> cells had similar \u03b3-TuSC signals at mitotic SPBs while the MT signal was only reduced in <i>spc110</i><sup><i>T18D</i></sup> and <i>spc110</i><sup><i>5A</i></sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> vs <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), suggests that the SPB-associated \u03b3-TuSC is not fully active in MT organization in these cells. The functions of Spc110 probably extend beyond \u03b3-TuSC binding, most likely to include \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization (\u2018Discussion\u2019). However, compared with <i>spc110</i><sup><i>T18D</i></sup> or <i>SPC110</i> cells, Spc110-GFP at the SPB was reduced in <i>spc110</i><sup><i>\u0394SPM</i></sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>), suggesting the <i>SPM</i> deletion affects incorporation of Spc110 into the SPB. This may contribute to the <i>spc110</i><sup><i>\u0394SPM</i></sup> phenotype and may explain why the growth defect of <i>spc110</i><sup><i>\u0394SPM</i></sup> cells was more pronounced than that of <i>spc110</i><sup><i>T18D</i></sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

To prevent cell cycle progression into anaphase we retained the cells in the HU block (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The re-growth of MTs was measured as a change in GFP-Tub1 intensity at SPBs.

Binding of \u03b3-TuSC to Spc110 is a prerequisite for \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization into the ring-like template that initiates MT assembly. Phosphorylation of Spc110 by Cdk1 and Mps1 regulates \u03b3-TuSC binding and thereby MT nucleation. Thus, Spc110 is a MT nucleation regulator. We thereby provide a molecular understanding of the previously observed spindle length phenotypes (the two Cdk1-Clb5 sites) and genetic interaction with <i>SPC97</i> (three Mps1 sites combined with S36) of <i>SPC110</i> phosphorylation site mutants (<a href=\"#bib26\">Friedman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Huisman et al., 2007</a>).

In late G1, a SPB precursor, named the duplication plaque, assembles on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope at a specialized substructure of the mother SPB, named bridge (<a href=\"#bib8\">Byers and Goetsch, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</a>). In G1/S the duplication plaque then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. This allows binding of the Spc110-calmodulin-Spc29 complex from the nuclear side to the central Spc29-Spc42 layer of the embedded duplication plaque (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bullitt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Elliott et al., 1999</a>). In this cell cycle phase Mps1 and Cdk1-Clb5 phosphorylate the N-terminus of Spc110 at five sites to promote \u03b3-TuSC binding to Spc110 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Consistently, Cdk1-Clb5 associates with SPBs throughout this time window (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huisman et al., 2007</a>). These phosphorylations increase \u03b3-TuSC affinity for Spc110-5P and induce \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization into ring-like complexes that promote MT nucleation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Phospho-regulation of Spc110 is not absolutely essential for viability as indicated by the growth of <i>spc110</i><sup><i>5A</i></sup> cells. However, <i>spc110</i><sup><i>5A</i></sup> cells have growth defects in the absence of the SAC gene <i>MAD2</i> and fail to organize the full set of MTs in S phase and mitosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We therefore suggest that Mps1 and Cdk1-Clb5 coordinate the timing of MT nucleation through Spc110 phosphorylation with SPB duplication. A SAC induced cell cycle delay can temper any defects in this phospho-regulation as indicated by the genetic interaction between <i>spc110</i><sup><i>2A</i></sup> and <i>spc110</i><sup><i>5A</i></sup> with <i>mad2\u0394</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

At least in vitro, Cdk1-Clb2 phosphorylation of Spc110<sup>T18</sup> inactivates in a dominant manner the \u03b3-TuSC oligomerization activity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Thus, it is well possible that Spc110<sup>T18</sup> phosphorylation by Cdk1-Clb2 limits the MT nucleation activity of the SPB associated \u03b3-TuSC. Most likely only the surplus of \u03b3-TuSC that is not engaged in MT organization is phosphorylated and affected by Spc110<sup>pT18</sup>. This model fits with the observation that the yeast SPB of haploid cells organizes a constant number of 20 nuclear MTs during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib87\">Winey et al., 1995</a>)."

In vivo data indicate that the binding of \u03b3-TuSC to Spc110, although a prerequisite, is insufficient for MT formation. For example, although the \u03b3-TuSC component Spc97 bound to mitotic SPBs of <i>spc110</i><sup><i>T18D</i></sup> or <i>spc110</i><sup><i>5D-T18D</i></sup> cells with similar efficiency to wild type cells, the \u03b3-TuSC in the two mutants was insufficient in full MT organization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Cell lysates were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 10 min. To further solubilize the pellet with insoluble SPBs, binding buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 was added to resuspend the pellet and incubated for 40 min. GFP-binder protein (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rothbauer et al., 2008</a>) conjugated Sepharose 4B slurry or IgG-conjugated Dynabeads was added into supernatants and rocked at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr, followed by five times of washing with binding buffer. Pull-downed Spc110-GFP or Spc110-TAP was eluted by heating with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or mass spectrometry."
