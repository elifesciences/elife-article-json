In this study, we show that visual stimulation during locomotion, which increases the gain of visual responses in primary visual cortex, dramatically enhances recovery in the mouse. Excitatory neurons regained normal levels of response, while narrow-spiking (inhibitory) neurons remained less active. Visual stimulation or locomotion alone did not enhance recovery. Responses to the particular visual stimuli viewed by the animal during locomotion recovered, while those to another normally effective stimulus did not, suggesting that locomotion promotes the recovery only of the neural circuits that are activated concurrent with the locomotion. These findings may provide an avenue for improving recovery from amblyopia in humans."

We next tested whether recovery of closed-eye responses is preferentially enhanced to the particular visual stimuli presented during running. Mice viewed either square bars drifting in eight evenly-spaced directions (<i>barVS</i>) or the contrast-modulated noise (<i>noiseVS</i>) during running each day for 3 weeks. Intrinsic signal responses to both bar and noise stimuli were measured weekly. Mice that experienced <i>barVS+run</i> showed significantly greater recovery of closed-eye responses to bars than to noise (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Likewise, mice that experienced <i>noiseVS+run</i> showed significantly greater recovery of response to noise than to bars (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Responses to the stimulus that was not experienced during running were similar to those in control mice presented with a blank screen during running.

                        "text": "Narrow-spiking cells are thought to correspond to inhibitory, predominantly fast-spiking, interneurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">McCormick et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bartho et al., 2004</a>). Although a minority population, inhibitory cells play an important role in plasticity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Espinosa and Stryker, 2012</a>). We observed several notable differences between broad- and narrow-spiking cells in the changes following LTMD and 7d-BV. First, spontaneous activity of narrow-spiking cells was greatly reduced after LTMD and did not change significantly after 7d-BV regardless of the treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), whereas those of broad-spiking cells were elevated after LTMD and significantly decreased toward normal level in mice after 7d-BV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). These opposite changes in spontaneous firing between broad- and narrow-spiking cells may reflect a homeostatic mechanism that alters excitatory\u2013inhibitory balance to maintain cortical activity during prolonged deprivation. Second, recovery of closed-eye responses and ocular dominance to the gratings in narrow-spiking cells was only modest even in <i>grating+run</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas it was nearly complete in broad-spiking cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Third, responses of narrow-spiking cells to contrast-modulated noise through the deprived eye and ocular dominance were incompletely restored both in <i>noise+run</i> and <i>grating+run</i> mice to similar extents, showing no preference for the experienced stimulus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Fourth, responses of narrow-spiking cells through the open-eye were not elevated after LTMD either to the noise or grating stimulus, and did not change significantly in any of 7d-BV mice (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This lack of potentiation of open-eye responses during LTMD in narrow-spiking cells may contribute to potentiation of those in broad-spiking cells. The responses of narrow-spiking cells after LTMD suggest that deprivation reduces intracortical inhibition. Such a reduction may provide a starting point that allows meager deprived-eye excitatory pathways of the cortical circuit to drive activity upon re-opening. The incomplete recovery of orientation tuning of broad-spiking cells in spite of nearly full restoration of the magnitudes of responses may result from the very limited recovery in narrow-spiking cells, as inhibition is critical for generation of sharp orientation tuning in upper layer neurons in the primary visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Liu et al., 2011</a>)."

In this study, we have used intrinsic signal imaging and single cell recording to find that locomotion, which is known to increase visual responses (<a href=\"#bib16\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>), dramatically enhances the recovery of visual responses, almost to normal levels within a week. Surprisingly, the recovery of response was specific to the particular visual stimuli presented during locomotion. Neither locomotion alone nor visual stimulation alone promoted recovery. These findings suggest that recovery is facilitated only in the neural circuits that are activated during running."

These treatments have in common a decrease in intracortical inhibition, consistent with our finding of reduced activity of inhibitory neurons. Such treatments may also increase locomotion, producing an active cortical state that facilitates plasticity. Interestingly, active hunting by barn owls, flying rather than walking or running in this case, dramatically increases adaptive plasticity of the auditory map in the superior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergan et al., 2005</a>)."

Locomotion may induce activity in neuromodulatory circuits that might enhance cortical function or plasticity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carcea and Froemke, 2013</a>), and it may also produce hemodynamic changes that might affect the operation of the cortical circuit (<a href=\"#bib20\">Seifert and Secher, 2011</a>). The stimulus specificity of enhanced recovery, however, rules out any general explanation of recovery as an increase in cortical response to any stimulus. Most simply, the larger responses of the cortical neurons themselves during locomotion would be expected to enhance recovery through the operation of any Hebbian or spike-timing based plasticity mechanism that depends on neural activity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Feldman, 2009</a>). Plasticity of excitatory connections would be further enhanced by the opposite changes in spontaneous firing of broad- and narrow-spiking neurons."

Such a test would require monitoring of the responses of individual cells or the efficacy of the synapses that they make throughout the recovery period. However, responses to both grating and noise stimuli were measured in three large populations of broad-spiking neurons, one before recovery and two in separate groups of animals after recovery during exposure to grating or noise. Making a correspondence between the individual neurons in these samples, in order to create fictive repeated measures from the same neurons, may suggest whether the present data are compatible with the Hebbian hypothesis. Indeed, the fictive longitudinal data show that noise stimulation increased the responses of neurons originally responding better to noise more than it did for the neurons that responded better to grating, and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Animals were maintained in the animal facility at University of California San Francisco and used in accordance with Protocol AN098080-01D approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Monocular deprivation (MD) was performed as described (<a href=\"#bib7a\">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</a>) except that 2\u20133% isoflurane in oxygen was used for anesthesia. The lid of the right eye was sutured shut at P22\u201324. Mice were housed in the standard condition (12/12 dark\u2013light cycle, free access to food and water) until P135\u223c150, at which time a custom stainless steel plate for head fixation was attached to the skull with dental acrylic under isoflurane anesthesia. The exposed surface of the skull was covered with a thin coat of nitrocellulose (New-Skin, Medtech Products Inc., NY) to prevent desiccation, reactive cell growth, and destruction of the bone structure. Animals were given a subcutaneous injection of carprofen (5 mg/kg) as a post-operative analgesic. 5\u20137 days after head-plate implantation, the closed eyelid was re-opened and groups of mice for the intrinsic signal imaging study underwent the first imaging session (day 0). The re-opened eyelid was left open afterward to allow binocular vision while animals were subjected to the different regimes of visual stimulation and locomotion as follows. (1) <i>running with visual stimulation</i>: The mouse was allowed to freely move its limbs and trunk on a foam ball floated on a stream of air, while its head was fixed via the implanted headplate that could be screwed into a rigid crossbar above the floating ball as described (<a href=\"#bib16\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>). Two optical mice were used to measure the displacement of the ball as the mouse moved, allowing us to calculate the physical speed of the ball (<a href=\"#bib16\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>). After re-opening the deprived eye, each animal spent 4 hr daily on the ball while viewing visual stimulus, over next 3 weeks (for intrinsic signal optical imaging) or 6 days (for single unit recording). Running was performed during the dark phase of the housing cycle, because we found that mice ran for longer times during this phase. (2) <i>running without visual stimulation</i>: Each animal ran on the floating ball exactly as the first group but viewed only a blank, mid-gray screen (\u223c35 lux). (3) <i>visual stimulation alone without running (intrinsic signal imaging only)</i>: a transparent cage containing a group of mice with regular bedding materials was surrounded by four monitors with the distance of 25 cm between the center of the cage and the monitor. The visual stimulus was presented on the monitors continuously for 7\u20138 hr daily during which animals were allowed to behave freely without disruption by the experimenter. We extended the duration to 7\u20138 hr because animals were obviously active only 50\u201360% of time. (4) <i>no running, no visual stimulation</i>: mice were housed in the standard condition without running or specific visual stimulation. (5) <i>Non-deprived control for single unit recording only</i>: age-matched control animals, many of them being in the same litter as those in experimental groups, were housed in the standard condition with normal visual experience without running or specific visual stimulation."

Repeated optical imaging of intrinsic signals was performed as described (<a href=\"#bib9b\">Kaneko et al., 2008</a>). We monitored the concentration of isoflurane using an Ohmeda 5250 RGM (Datex-Ohmeda, Madison, WI) throughout each imaging session. Images were recorded transcranially through the window of the implanted headplate. Intrinsic signal images were obtained with a Dalsa 1M30 CCD camera (Dalsa, Waterloo, Canada) with a 135 \u00d7 50 mm tandem lens (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) and red interference filter (610 \u00b1 10 nm). Frames were acquired at a rate of 30 fps, temporally binned by four frames, and stored as 512 \u00d7 512 pixel images after binning the 1024 \u00d7 1024 camera pixels by 2 \u00d7 2 pixels spatially. We used two kinds of visual stimuli presented between \u22125\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 (azimuth) on the stimulus monitor (0\u00b0 = center of the monitor aligned to center of the mouse) to record intrinsic signals in the binocular visual cortex: (1) 2\u00b0-wide bars, moving continuously and periodically upward or downward at a speed of 10\u00b0/sec; (2) the contrast-modulated noise movie, as described above. To record in the monocular visual area, the contrast-modulated noise was presented between 50\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 (azimuth) of the visual field. Visual stimuli were presented on a 40 \u00d7 30 cm monitor placed 25 cm in front of the mouse. The phase and amplitude of cortical responses at the stimulus frequency were extracted by Fourier analysis as described (<a href=\"#bib9a\">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</a>). Response amplitude was an average of at least four measurements. Ocular dominance index was computed as (R \u2212 L)/(R + L), where R and L are the peak response amplitudes through the right eye and the left eye, respectively, as described (<a href=\"#bib9b\">Kaneko et al., 2008</a>).

The authors make the surprising and interesting (and potentially clinically important) discovery that pairing visual stimulation with the animal's own locomotion dramatically improves the responses through the eye that underwent long-term deprivation. Further, the authors go further to demonstrate that major forms of selectivity, including orientation and spatial frequency selectivity, are dramatically improved by the new protocol compared to locomotion or visual stimulation alone (or home-cage experience)."

The authors find that responses to a noise stimulus or bar stimulus are selectively enhanced by prior exposure to the same stimulus while running. They suggest that a Hebbian synaptic plasticity model may account for these results. This predicts that to the extent that the enhancement is stimulus specific, the stimuli should activate different circuits. One might imagine, for example, that the selective enhancement would be especially pronounced for cells that respond much better to one stimulus than the other, while cells that respond to both stimuli equally might be expected to show more balanced enhancement (although this need not be the case if the two stimuli activate the postsynaptic neuron through separate sets of synapses). Because the authors have recorded responses to both sets of stimuli in many individual cells they should be able to address this question of whether selective enhancement depends on selective response. This would potentially strengthen the interpretation in terms of an underlying plasticity mechanism. Although this analysis may be complicated by differences in the responses to gratings vs. bars, these differences are likely less prominent and presumably the authors have some handle on how these responses differ."

We appreciate that the authors are going for big picture appeal, but we are concerned that many readers will insert their own interpretation for \u201cexercise\u201d. In fact, the findings the authors report are related to a specific activity, locomotion/running for an extended period of time (several hours). In our opinion, the authors should use a specific term such as \u201crunning\u201d or \u201clocomotion\u201d. The paper is very clear and careful; it would be shame for the conclusions to be misapplied by someone who only looks at the Title/Abstract. (Maybe \u201cexercise\u201d as a keyword?)"

We have carried out the analysis suggested as major issue #1 and we have incorporated new text in the manuscript, a new paragraph in the Discussion, and a new supplemental figure (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>) to address the conclusions that are sustained by this analysis. Following the suggestion outlined in the reviewers\u2019 major issue #2, we have also revised the manuscript title and excised the word \u2018exercise\u2019 from our text at several points."
