To reveal the finer details of circadian variation in the mammalian SCN transcriptome we combined laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-seq over a 24\u2009hr light / dark cycle. We show that 7-times more genes exhibited a classic sinusoidal expression signature than previously observed in the SCN. Another group of 766 genes unexpectedly peaked twice, near both the start and end of the dark phase; this twin-peaking group is significantly enriched for synaptic transmission genes that are crucial for light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. 341 intergenic non-coding RNAs, together with novel exons of annotated protein-coding genes, including <i>Cry1</i>, also show specific circadian expression variation. Overall, our data provide an important chronobiological resource (www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq/) and allow us to propose that transcriptional timing in the SCN is gating clock resetting mechanisms."

To reveal the finer details of circadian variation in the mammalian SCN transcriptome we combined laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-seq over a 24\u2009hr light / dark cycle. We show that 7-times more genes exhibited a classic sinusoidal expression signature than previously observed in the SCN. Another group of 766 genes unexpectedly peaked twice, near both the start and end of the dark phase; this twin-peaking group is significantly enriched for synaptic transmission genes that are crucial for light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. 341 intergenic non-coding RNAs, together with novel exons of annotated protein-coding genes, including <i>Cry1</i>, also show specific circadian expression variation. Overall, our data provide an important chronobiological resource (www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq/) and allow us to propose that transcriptional timing in the SCN is gating clock resetting mechanisms."

The mice spent half of each day in the light, and half in the dark. This revealed that the expression levels of over a quarter of all the genes that are found in the SCN fluctuate over a 24-hour period.

Importantly, this number of cycling genes is sevenfold higher than previously reported in the SCN (<a href=\"#bib40\">Panda et al., 2002</a>). This large increase is likely to reflect a combination of factors: first, the significantly improved anatomical enrichment of the SCN tissue we have surveyed; second, the greater sensitivity and specificity of the statistical approaches we have applied (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hughes et al., 2010</a>); and finally, our sampling approach under LD as opposed to the constant dark (DD) conditions utilised in earlier studies (<a href=\"#bib40\">Panda et al., 2002</a>). For example, we are able to detect cycling genes that may be physiologically relevant to light\u00a0exposure or light-induced transcriptional cascades that are undetectable as cycling under DD (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ueda et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Leming et al., 2014</a>).

Interestingly, we observe novel enrichments among cycling genes in terms relating to RNA splicing and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) which suggests that these processes may establish oscillatory expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2013</a>).

Our module eigengene for the twin-peaking module (blue dotted line) indicates that when its expression lies above the threshold level (black horizontal line), the phase of the organism is able to shift. The greater the expression over this threshold, the larger the phase shift. Conversely, when expression is low and below this threshold, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is resistant to phase shifting induced by light pulses. This suggests the presence of susceptibility windows (shown by green bars) when light impulses are able to shift the phase of the SCN.

Twin-peaking gene-encoded proteins identified by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) SCN RNA-seq are indicated in blue.

(i) Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gates glutamatergic synaptic transmission by regulating either presynaptic release or membrane channel activity.

At this timepoint, F-actin levels are at their highest and an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> depolymerises the F-actin affecting components of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Ca<sup>2+</sup> also induces intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release though the opening of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel RyR2.

Alternative and potentially functionally important expression profiles may thus have been overlooked. Using Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), which does not assume a single mode of temporal variation, we identified a single module of 766 genes, which instead of adopting a sinusoidal profile, displayed two peaks of expression at ZT14 and ZT22 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). From this \u2018twin-peaking\u2019 module 496 genes individually exhibited statistically significant temporal fluctuations (DESeq2, q &lt;\u00a00.05), of which 17 of 17 were validated by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This profile is also distinct from previously described 12-hr harmonics (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cagampang et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hughes et al., 2009</a>), and prior to this, only single genes from individual studies were shown to possess similar expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shinohara et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cagampang et al., 1998c</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">1998d</a>). For example, isoforms of protein kinase C (<i>Prkcb</i> and <i>Prkcg</i>) exhibit a twin-peaking profile in rat SCN similar to that observed in our RNA-seq data (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cagampang et al., 1998c</a>). This twin-peaking transcriptional profile, particularly for this large number of genes, was thus unexpected. Functional annotations related to synaptic transmission, calcium signalling and gated channel activity were greatly and significantly enriched among these twin-peaking genes (q &lt;\u00a00.05; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting a circadian component to establishing the electrophysiological environment of the SCN."

This is demonstrated by the phase response curve (PRC): a light impulse at ZT14 will initiate a phase delay of the clock whereas a light impulse at ZT22 will initiate a phase advance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Golombek and Rosenstein, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ding et al., 1994</a>). At all other timepoints we assessed under an LD cycle the twin-peaking genes exhibited low expression levels exactly when the clock is resistant to phase shifts. This suggests a possible transcriptional gating mechanism in which a threshold level of gene expression needs to be exceeded for light to activate this phase shifting pathway (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ding et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gillette and Mitchell, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Iyer et al., 2014</a>). Transcriptional profiling at a higher temporal resolution would be required to confirm the elevated expression of twin-peaking genes above this critical threshold at timepoints when light-induced phase shifts are possible (e.g. ZT12; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Genes previously known to participate in this light-induced phase shifting pathway display this twin-peaking pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), and their pharmacological inhibition (e.g. for <i>Grin2a/b, Camk2a, Nos1, Ryr2</i>) blocks light-induced phase shifts (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ebling et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yokota et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ding et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2010</a>). Many genes whose expression peaks singly at ZT14 have functions related to actin cytoskeleton reorganisation and/or to small GTPase signalling (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013G</a>). This supports the hypothesis that actin depolymerisation is important for phase delays but not phase advances (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gerber et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cabej, 2013</a>). Taken together, our data indicate that oscillations in the SCN transcriptome play an important role in gating the differential responses to light, a fundamental circadian process. The complex relationship between photic and non-photic cues and their relative roles in phase adjustment must also be considered, however. Light exposure during constant conditions can still modify the processing of non-photic signals by the SCN (<a href=\"#bib14\">Challet and Pevet, 2003</a>). For example, novelty-induced running in the subjective mid-day induces a phase advance in mice, although a 1-hr light pulse administered after access to running wheels can significantly attenuate this affect (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biello and Mrosovsky, 1995</a>). More work is required to determine how the timing or relative level of gene expression mediates these light-induced behavioural changes."

Tissue from five animals was pooled to generate one biological replicate sample (15 mice in total were used per ZT) and total RNA was purified using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Manchester, United Kingdom). RNA quality was determined using an RNA Picochip (Agilent, Stockport, United Kingdom), with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values over 8 for all samples and average yield of approximately 10\u00a0ng per replicate. Approximately 1\u00a0ng of RNA was amplified using the SMARTer protocol (Takata Clontech Bio Europe SAS, France), and the resulting libraries were 100-bp paired-end sequenced on the HiSeq (Illumina, Fulbourn, United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics Sequencing Core).

DESeq2 was used to perform a likelihood ratio test to determine the genes whose expression significantly altered over time (q &lt;\u00a00.05, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg) and the JTK_CYCLE was used to identify genes whose expression followed 24-hr periodic waveforms (q &lt;\u00a00.05, Bonferroni). To identify genes with non-sinusoidal oscillatory patterns, signed WGCNA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</a>) was used to detect modules based upon gene coexpression. Modules were merged if their similarity was greater than 0.3 according to dendrogram height. Of the resultant 23 modules only the \u2018lightsteelblue1\u2019 module was investigated further because it was the only non-sinusoidal module whose expression pattern was not influenced by anomalous expression of a single sample at a particular timepoint. Genes of this module were defined as fluctuating if their expression significantly altered over time (q &lt;\u00a00.05, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg; DESeq2)."

They improve on earlier studies of this type by 1) limiting the sampling of the tissue to the SCN itself (some other studies did not have this degree of neuroanatomical resolution and instead sample the SCN along with extraSCN tissue). 2) by sampling under the physiologically relevant light-dark cycle (as opposed to constant lighting). By combining RNAseq with 1 and 2, they provide exciting new evidence that many other transcripts cycle in a SCN specific manner as do long intergenic non-coding RNAs. Further, they show that some transcripts show two peaks in expression per 24h. Additionally they characterise a novel isoform of the key clock gene, <i>Cry1</i>."

However, as the reviewers correctly state, light is also able to induce shifts at times when our twin-peaking genes do not \u2018peak\u2019 (such as at the end of the light phase); in these cases, we suggest that mRNA abundance remains above a particular threshold to facilitate phase shifting, despite not peaking at this time point. To illustrate this hypothesis more clearly, we have amended <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> so that when the expression of the twin-peaking module lies above a threshold level (the horizontal line) it allows the potential for a light-induced phase shift."

We do not believe that these specific studies necessarily affect our more general hypothesis that transcript abundance is important for light-responsive phase shifting. Nevertheless, we have toned-down our argument in several places (e.g. paragraph two, subheading \u201cIdentification of novel twin-peaking synaptic module\u201d and subheading \u201cIdentification of novel transcripts with circadian expression profiles\u201d) by acknowledging that more work will be required to determine the link between transcript levels and light-mediated behavioural changes."

In addition, by examining the coefficient of variance (CV) for all genes at each time point, we found that there was not a trend for greater variance of expression during the night as suggested, although it was marginally elevated during the day (12% increase; p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup> Kruskal-Wallis test)."

For example, a gene with an elevated CV at a particular time point may not need to be tightly regulated at that specific time; expression may only be required to reach a threshold level to induce its necessary function, with the generation of additional mRNA having no detrimental outcome. Variation may also be dampened at the functional level due to translational efficiency or other molecular feedback mechanisms. Alternatively, a gene might have a reduced CV representing tighter regulation at a particular time point if the precise level of mRNA at that time is functionally important."
