Here, we produce biosensors based on a ligand-binding domain (LBD) by using a method that, in principle, can be applied to any target molecule. The LBD is fused to either a fluorescent protein or a transcriptional activator and is destabilized by mutation such that the fusion accumulates only in cells containing the target ligand. We illustrate the power of this method by developing biosensors for digoxin and progesterone. Addition of ligand to yeast, mammalian, or plant cells expressing a biosensor activates transcription with a dynamic range of up to ~100-fold. We use the biosensors to improve the biotransformation of pregnenolone to progesterone in yeast and to regulate CRISPR activity in mammalian cells. This work provides a general methodology to develop biosensors for a broad range of molecules in eukaryotes."

Here, we produce biosensors based on a ligand-binding domain (LBD) by using a method that, in principle, can be applied to any target molecule. The LBD is fused to either a fluorescent protein or a transcriptional activator and is destabilized by mutation such that the fusion accumulates only in cells containing the target ligand. We illustrate the power of this method by developing biosensors for digoxin and progesterone. Addition of ligand to yeast, mammalian, or plant cells expressing a biosensor activates transcription with a dynamic range of up to ~100-fold. We use the biosensors to improve the biotransformation of pregnenolone to progesterone in yeast and to regulate CRISPR activity in mammalian cells. This work provides a general methodology to develop biosensors for a broad range of molecules in eukaryotes."

Here, Feng, Jester, Tinberg, Mandell et al. have developed a new method to make biosensors from ligand-binding domains that could, in principle, be applied to any target small molecule. The new method involves taking a ligand-binding domain that is either engineered or occurs in nature and linking it to something that can be readily detected, such as a protein that fluoresces or that controls gene expression. This combined biosensor protein is then engineered, via mutations, such that it is unstable unless it binds to the small molecule. This means that, in the absence of the small molecule, these proteins are destroyed inside living cells. However, the binding of a target molecule to one of these proteins protects it from degradation, which allows the signal to be detected."

We began with the computationally-designed binding domain DIG10.3\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Tinberg et al., 2013</a>), hereafter DIG<sub>0</sub>, which binds the plant steroid glycoside digoxin and its aglycone digoxigenin with picomolar affinities. Introduction of three rationally-designed binding site mutations into DIG<sub>0</sub> resulted in a progesterone binder (PRO<sub>0</sub>) with nanomolar affinity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Tinberg et al., 2013</a>). We constructed genetic fusions of DIG<sub>0</sub> and PRO<sub>0</sub> to a yeast-enhanced GFP (yEGFP, LBD-biosensors DIG<sub>0</sub>-GFP and PRO<sub>0</sub>-GFP) and constitutively expressed them in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>\u00a0(<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The fusions showed little change in fluorescence in response to digoxin or progesterone, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Work by Wandless and co-workers has shown that mutagenesis of LBDs can be used to identify variants that are stable only in the presence of a target ligand\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Banaszynski et al., 2006</a>). We randomly mutagenized the LBDs of DIG<sub>0</sub>-GFP and PRO<sub>0</sub>-GFP by error-prone PCR and subjected libraries of 10<sup>5</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib22\">Gil et al., 2000</a>) integrants to multiple rounds of FACS, sorting alternately for high fluorescence in the presence of the ligand and low fluorescence in its absence. We isolated LBD variants having greater than 5-fold activation by cognate ligand (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By making additional variants that contain only one of the up to four mutations found in the progesterone biosensors, we showed that some mutations are additive, while others predominately contribute to sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). Many of the conditionally-destabilizing mutations identified in DIG<sub>0</sub> involve residues that participate in key dimer interface interactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). The conditionally-destabilizing mutations of PRO<sub>0</sub> are located throughout the protein (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b\u2013d</a>); the DIG<sub>0</sub> interface mutations also rendered PRO<sub>0</sub>-GFP conditionally stable on binding progesterone (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2e</a>)."

The dynamic range of TF-biosensor activity was maximal when the biosensor was expressed using a weak promoter and weak activation domain, because of lower yEGFP expression in the absence of ligand (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>)."

A FACS-based screen of an error-prone PCR library of G-DIG<sub>0</sub>-V, G-DIG<sub>1</sub>-V, and G-DIG<sub>2</sub>-V variants identified mutations L77F and R60S in the Gal4 dimer interface (hereafter G<sub>L77F</sub>, G<sub>R60S</sub>) that further increased TF-biosensor response by lowering background activity in the absence of ligand (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Although these Gal4 mutations were identified by screening the\u00a0libraries of digoxin-dependent TF-biosensors, they also increased progesterone-dependent activation of the G-PRO-V series of biosensors, indicating a shared mechanism of conditional stability in both systems (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). Combining mutations in Gal4 and DIG<sub>0</sub> or PRO<sub>0</sub> led to activations of up to 60-fold by cognate ligand, a ten-fold improvement over the most responsive LBD-biosensors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c,d</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>) and a dynamic range that has been challenging to achieve with stability-based biosensors in yeast\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Rakhit et al., 2011</a>).

The response of the TF-biosensors to the withdrawal of ligand is likely much faster than observed by fluorescence, as the reduction in fluorescence signal is dependent on both the degradation of the TF-biosensors as well as the degradation and dilution of previously expressed yEGFP."

To demonstrate tunability, we replaced the DBD of G-DIG<sub>1</sub>-V with the bacterial repressor LexA and replaced the Gal4 DNA-binding sites in the <i>GAL1</i> promoter with those for LexA. LexA-based TF-biosensors with DIG<sub>1</sub> and a weak TAD (B42) showed a strong response to digoxin (nearly 40-fold) only when the promoter-driving reporter expression contained LexA-binding sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). These results demonstrate that the biosensors can function with different combinations of DBDs and TADs, which could produce diverse behaviors and permit their use in eukaryotes requiring different promoters. Furthermore, the reporter gene can be swapped with an auxotrophic marker gene to enable growth selections. The TF-biosensors drove the\u00a0expression of the <i>HIS3</i> reporter most effectively when steroid was added to the growth media, as assessed by the\u00a0growth of a histidine auxotrophic strain in media lacking histidine (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,d</a>). Fusion of the Mat\u03b12 degron to the biosensor improved dynamic range by reducing the\u00a0growth of yeast in the absence of ligand. Finally, the yeast strain could be modified to improve biosensor sensitivity toward target ligands by the\u00a0deletion of the gene for a multidrug efflux pump\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Ernst et al., 2005</a>), thereby increasing ligand retention (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c\u2013d</a>)."

A key step in the production of both steroids is the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone by the enzyme 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD). We aimed to use a progesterone biosensor to detect and improve this transformation. An important feature of biosensors intended for pathway engineering is their ability to detect a product with minimal activation by substrate or other related chemicals. TF-biosensors built from PRO<sub>1</sub> showed the greatest dynamic range and selectivity for progesterone over pregnenolone when driving yEGFP expression or when coupled with a <i>HIS3</i> reporter assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>).

To select for improved progesterone production, we required a growth assay in which wild-type 3\u03b2-HSD could no longer complement histidine auxotrophy when the yeast were grown on plates supplemented with pregnenolone. To this end, the selection stringency was tuned by adding the His3 inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>). We mutagenized the 3\u03b2-HSD coding sequence using error-prone PCR and screened colonies that survived the <i>HIS3</i> selection for their yEGFP activation by pregnenolone. By transforming evolved 3\u03b2-HSD mutations into a fresh host background, we showed that the mutations in the enzyme, and not off-target plasmid or host escape mutations, were responsible for increased biosensor response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). Two of the mutants, 3\u03b2-HSD N139D and 3\u03b2-HSD F67Y, were assayed for progesterone production using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and were found to produce two-fold more progesterone per OD than cells bearing the wild-type enzyme (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>)."

If yeast-derived biosensors function in more complex eukaryotes, the design-build-test cycle in those organisms could be rapidly accelerated. We first assessed the portability of yeast TF-biosensors to mammalian cells. Single constructs containing digoxin and progesterone TF-biosensors with the greatest dynamic ranges (without codon optimization) were stably integrated into human K562 cells using PiggyBac transposition. We characterized the dynamics of the TF-biosensors in human cells by dose response and time course assays similar to the yeast experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013d</a>). As with yeast, the human cells demonstrated greater sensitivity to digoxin, with fluorescence activation increasing up to 100 nM of cognate ligand for digoxin biosensors and 1 mM for progesterone biosensors. We observed &gt;100-fold activation for the most sensitive progesterone biosensor G<sub>L77F</sub>-PRO<sub>1</sub>-V. The increase in mammalian dynamic range over yeast may arise from more aggressive degradation of destabilized biosensors or greater accumulation of target-stabilized biosensors or reporters resulting from larger cell sizes and slower doubling times. The time course data show that fluorescence increased four-fold within 4 hr of target introduction and rose logarithmically for 24\u201348 hr."

Further, it may be desirable to tightly regulate Cas9 activity such that gene editing occurs only under defined conditions. To facilitate inducible gene editing, we fused human codon-optimized versions of the DIG<sub>3</sub> and PRO<sub>1</sub> LBDs to the N-terminus of Cas9 from <i>S. pyogenes</i>. We integrated this construct into a reporter cell line containing an EGFP variant with a premature stop codon that renders it non-functional. Upon separate stable integration of the DIG-Cas9 and PRO-Cas9 fusions, we transfected a guide RNA targeting the premature stop codon as well as a donor oligonucleotide containing the sequence to restore EGFP activity <i>via</i> homologous recombination. After a 48-hr incubation period, we observed an ~18-fold increase in GFP positive cells with digoxigenin relative to the mock control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>)."

We initially tested the G-DIG<sub>1</sub>-TAD variants with a transient expression assay using <i>Arabidopsis</i> protoplasts and a reporter gene consisting of firefly luciferase under the control of a Gal4-activated plant promoter (<i>pUAS::Luc</i>). The biosensor containing the Mat\u03b12 degron and VP16 TAD showed the highest fold activation of luciferase in the presence of digoxigenin (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>).

Primary transgenic plants were screened in vivo for digoxigenin-dependent luciferase production, and responsive plants were allowed to set seed for further testing. Second generation transgenic plants (T<sub>1</sub>, heterozygous) were tested for digoxin- or digoxigenin-dependent induction of luciferase expression. After 42 hr, we observed 30-50-fold induction of luciferase activity in digoxin-treated plants compared to the uninduced control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Digoxigenin-dependent luciferase induction was observed in multiple independent transgenic T<sub>1</sub> lines (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>), and a rising dose response to digoxigenin was observed in the transgenic plants (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>).

Here, we show that LBDs can be conditionally destabilized to create biosensors that function in yeast, mammalian cells, and plants, and we demonstrate the use of these biosensors in metabolic engineering and genome editing applications. While this method requires a high-affinity ligand-binding domain as a starting point, nearly all small molecules of interest have a natural protein interactor. Furthermore, the use of de novo<i>-</i>designed binders opens the possibility of generating biosensors for ligands with unsuitable or unknown binding proteins. By incorporating standard mutagenesis and screening, our method constitutes a simple platform for sensor development that can be applied to many areas of biotechnology. These sensors act either at the level of post-translational control over protein function or at the level of transcription (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>), and they can be tuned by altering any of their components (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>) or by modifying efflux of the target ligand in the host organism. These tunable features should make the biosensors useful in many different cellular and environmental contexts."

Furthermore, the portability of the mutations we identified suggests a structural basis for conferring conditional stability to the DIG<sub>0</sub> LBD scaffold. Both the DIG<sub>0</sub> LBD and Gal4 are homodimers, and the majority of the conditionally-stabilizing mutations are located at the dimer interfaces. A computational model of the Gal4-DIG<sub>0</sub> complex indicates that the orientation of the two domains allows a homodimeric fusion to form (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). These results suggest an allosteric interplay between ligand binding and dimer formation: weakening of the dimer interface, in either the DIG<sub>0</sub> or the Gal4 domain, is compensated by ligand binding. This LBD scaffold is derived from a member of the nuclear transport factor 2 family, a fold class that typically has a large dimer interface (~1200 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) that facilitates the large and open ligand-binding site (~600 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>). These protein folds are well suited for <i>de novo</i> design of other LBDs because of their large binding pocket and natural substrate diversity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib51\">Todd et al., 2002</a>). Exploiting dimer interfaces to modulate stability without impairing ligand binding may be a general mechanism to confer conditional stability on LBDs. This possibility is supported by the observation that interface mutations in DIG<sub>0</sub> and Gal4 conferring digoxin-dependent stability lead to progesterone-dependent stability in a progesterone biosensor (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>)."

At very high levels of ligand, the TF-biosensors exhibit tight distributions as well, but at intermediate ligand concentrations, the GFP levels span a fairly broad range.

Previous work has shown that conditionally destabilized proteins are degraded by the highly conserved ubiquitin proteasome system (Egeler et al., 2011). Relying on the general principles of protein stability and ligand binding allows for the development of biosensors in any organism with similar protein quality control machinery. The fact that our biosensors engineered from a bacterial protein scaffold retained high levels of sensitivity with minimal modifications when developed in yeast and deployed across mammalian and plant species demonstrates unprecedented portability for biosensors and suggests than even further portability may be possible.
