Here we investigate electrophysiological characteristics of <i>Xenopus</i> tadpole midbrain neurons across development and during homeostatic plasticity induced by patterned visual stimulation. We show that in development tectal neuron properties not only change on average, but also become increasingly diverse. After sensory stimulation, both electrophysiological diversity and functional differentiation of cells are reduced. At the same time, the amount of cross-correlations between cell properties increase after patterned stimulation as a result of homeostatic plasticity. We show that tectal neurons with similar spiking profiles often have strikingly different electrophysiological properties, and demonstrate that changes in intrinsic excitability during development and in response to sensory stimulation are mediated by different underlying mechanisms. Overall, this analysis and the accompanying dataset provide a unique framework for further studies of network maturation in Xenopus tadpoles."

Here we investigate electrophysiological characteristics of <i>Xenopus</i> tadpole midbrain neurons across development and during homeostatic plasticity induced by patterned visual stimulation. We show that in development tectal neuron properties not only change on average, but also become increasingly diverse. After sensory stimulation, both electrophysiological diversity and functional differentiation of cells are reduced. At the same time, the amount of cross-correlations between cell properties increase after patterned stimulation as a result of homeostatic plasticity. We show that tectal neurons with similar spiking profiles often have strikingly different electrophysiological properties, and demonstrate that changes in intrinsic excitability during development and in response to sensory stimulation are mediated by different underlying mechanisms. Overall, this analysis and the accompanying dataset provide a unique framework for further studies of network maturation in Xenopus tadpoles."

Many of these neurons are very much alike, and work together to process information in the brain. Yet while they are similar, they are not exactly identical. One of the reasons for these differences seems to be to allow each neuron to contribute something unique to the overall working of the brain. By looking at how individual neurons within a specific type differ from each other, it is possible to understand more about how they work together."

To distinguish between these two possibilities, Ciarleglio, Khakhalin et al. provided a group of older tadpoles with strobe-like visual stimulation and observed that this caused the neurons to become more similar once again. This suggests that neurons can change their response properties to adapt to the type of sensory input they receive, which would allow the animal to better process different types of sensory information. The data collected through these experiments could now be used to build computational models of this part of the tadpole brain."

To make sure that none of the variables were redundant (brought no new information to the set), or too noisy (having no interactions with other variables in the set), we ran the so-called Principal Variable Analysis, quantifying the total amount of variance in the dataset explained by each variable (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mccabe, 1984</a>). We found that the most informative, and thus least independent, variables were related to the number of spikes the cell was able to generate (N spikes to cosine and step injections explained 15% and 14% of total variance, respectively), or different aspects of spike shape (9\u201313% of total variance; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <i>top</i> of the list). Conversely, some variables did not serve as good linear predictors for other properties in the set (<i>bottom</i> of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that they were more independent \u2014 the lowest variable explained 4% of total variance, which was still more than the 3% expected for a fully uncorrelated variable.

We found that 9 variables from the step current injection protocol together explained 42% of total variance in the set; 7 variables quantifying IV-curves explained 34%; 6 variables from cosine current injections explained 33%; 5 synaptic variables and 4 passive membrane properties both accounted for 21%; and 2 variables describing miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) predicted 11% of total variance (shares of explained variance don't have to add up to 100%).

Among others, spiking inactivation (as measured by 'Wave decay\u2019), maximal amplitudes of sodium and slow potassium ionic currents, the frequency of minis, and the total synaptic charge all experienced an almost twofold increase in variability. Only two properties out of 33 became less variable over development: synaptic resonance and synaptic resonance width.

As not every variable was measured in every cell, we used an iterative Bayesian version of PCA known as 'PCA with missing values' (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ilin and Raiko, 2010</a>), followed by a promax oblique rotation. We extensively verified the validity of our PCA analysis, comparing it to standard PCA on restricted and imputed data, PCA on rank-transformed data, as well as two most common non-linear dimensionality reduction approaches: Isomap and Local Linear Embedding (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We concluded that our PCA analysis was the most appropriate analysis for for this data set, and performed better than local non-linear approaches, with the first two principal components explaining 15% and 8% of total variance respectively (this total of 23% of variance explained would have corresponded to ~35% of variance if we had every type of observation in every cell; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details)."

Consistent with high predictive value of individual variables related to spiking, we found that C1 describes the overall 'Spikiness' of each cell. Cells with large values of C1 generated many sharp and narrow spikes in response to current injections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, green points describing spike shape, <i>left</i>; <b>red</b> points describing number of spikes, <i>right</i>). These cells spiked strongly in response to prolonged current injections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, red point for 'Spiking resonance width,' <i>upper right quadrant</i>); had low accommodation, both in spike amplitude (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, green, <i>left bottom corner</i>) and inter-spike interval (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, blue, <i>left top corner</i>), and had high trial-to-trial spike-timing precision (low jitter; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, blue point, <i>left top corner</i>).

We used our dataset to try to infer biological processes that could underlie adjustment of spike output. To deduce these processes, we looked for basic intrinsic properties that could serve as good predictors of cell spiking output across all experimental groups (220 cells). We ran a set of competitive sequential linear regression models (<a href=\"#bib10\">Calcagno and de Mazancourt, 2010</a>) to test whether we could predict the number of spikes produced by cells in response to current step injections based on their low-level electrophysiological properties, namely: membrane resistance (Rm), membrane capacitance (Cm), and both ionic current activation potentials and maximal amplitudes for sodium (I<sub>Na</sub>), stable potassium (I<sub>KS</sub>) and transient potassium (I<sub>KT</sub>) voltage-gated currents (8 variables total). We found that across all cells, the pair of properties that explained most of spike-output variance was a pair of activation potentials for sodium and stable potassium voltage-gated currents (I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>KS</sub>; 18% of variance without interaction, 19% with interaction). After activation potentials were considered, the next most informative variable was membrane resistance (Rm, 7% of variance; 13% with interactions) followed by voltage-gated sodium channel amplitude (2% of explained variance, 4% with interactions), and membrane capacitance (5% without, 15% with interactions). Together these 5 variables explained 33% of variation in the number of spikes if taken without interactions, and as much as 51% if multiple-order interactions were included. Unfortunately, linear models did not help to differentiate between variables underlying tuning of spike output during development and after sensory stimulation, as none of the effects disappeared (based on <i>P</i><sub>F</sub> &lt; 0.05 criterion) when both developmental stage and experimental manipulation were factored in."

For example, the cell property that predicted most of spiking output variance, voltage-gated sodium current activation potential, interacted significantly (<i>P</i><sub>F</sub> &lt; 0.05) with slow potassium current activation potential, membrane resistance and capacitance, as well as several second and third-order combinations of these variables. In practical terms it means that to keep the spike output of a tectal cell constant, a change in any of these variables should be accompanied by a balancing correction of sodium current activation potential, and vice versa.

Each clamped neuron was subjected to a series of voltage clamp and current clamp protocols to assess its characteristics. First, cells were held at -65 mV in voltage clamp to ensure that Na<sup>+</sup> channels are fully de-inactivated. Then cells were stepped for 150ms to membrane potentials from -65 mV to 115 mV in 20 mV increments to get the data for IV curves. Cells were then switched to current clamp and subjected to ten square pulses of current from 0 pA to 180 pA in 20 pA increments. We next explored potential resonances in tectal neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000</a>) by probing their ability to fire in response to cosine current injections of varying frequencies. Each sweep contained five separate 200 ms bouts of cosine injections with frequencies of 100, 50, 30, 25, and 20\u2009Hz, and peak amplitude of 135 pA. To determine health of the neurons, they were switched back to voltage clamp and subjected to the IV-curve voltage step protocol once again. After that, the spontaneous activity was continuously recorded for one minute at \u221245 mV holding potential. Continuing to hold at -45mV, cells were then subjected to synaptic stimulation protocols, in which the optic chiasm (OCh) was stimulated with a bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC, Bowdoin, ME) to activate retinal ganglion cell axons. Five stimuli of 150 \u00b5A to 800 \u00b5A and duration of 180 \u00b5s were provided at varying frequencies, with inter-stimulus intervals of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ms; the protocol was repeated 5 times. Finally, the IV-curve voltage step protocol was repeated a third time to ensure the health of the cell and stability of the data. The microscope was then switched to the 10x objective, and the cell location was recorded (<a href=\"#bib36\">Khakhalin and Aizenman, 2012</a>). The cell was suctioned away from the tissue and the process was repeated for up to 6 neurons. Some cells did not survive the entire series of protocols, but as long as the nearest IV-curve recording from these cells was stable, they were included in the dataset. No potentials reported in this paper were corrected for the expected junction potential of +12 mV."

We did not measure the resting membrane potential Em of each cell, but recorded the holding current (#4: I hold, pA) required to keep the cell membrane at \u221265 mV.

For na\u00efve tadpoles at stages 48\u201349 the preparation age did not affect any of the variables we measured, and none of the variables were affected by the time of day at which cells were recorded."

At the same time, to make referencing and subsequent meta-analysis possible, we always report means and standard deviations in the text. Other statistical tests used in this study include Pearson correlation (<i>P</i><sub>corr</sub>), one-way ANOVA (<i>P</i><sub>ANOVA</sub>), multiple linear regression test (<i>P</i><sub>F</sub>), Welch generalization of Student\u2019s t-test (<i>P</i><sub>TT</sub>), and F-test for equality of variance (<i>P</i><sub>V</sub>). When exploring potential correlations between variables we used False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure to adjust for multiple testing, keeping the false discovery rate at 0.05 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</a>). The FDR procedure was performed separately for each massive set of comparisons, as indicated in the text. In post-hoc pairwise comparisons of data groups after ANOVA tests we used a more conservative Bonferroni correction, but reported uncorrected p-values. To illustrate correlation levels between variables (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) we used a custom MATLAB script inspired by the circular diagram from the 'Circos' visualization package (<a href=\"#bib40\">Krzywinski et al., 2009</a>). As not every pair of variables was available in every cell, different correlation tests were run on different numbers of points (from 38 to 154; median of 108). We verified our Pearson correlation-based analysis by calculating Spearman correlation coefficients; after FDR 112 Spearman correlations were significant (as opposed to 90 for Pearson), and all Pearson correlations with r&gt;0.5 (n=11), including all shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, remained significant for Spearman calculation."

To verify that the PCA-MV procedure is applicable to our data, we selected a subset of 52 cells and 27 variables to form a full matrix free of missing values. A standard PCA was then run on this reduced data set, and the results of it were compared to the results of PCA-MV run on the full data set. The scree plot of a standard PCA on restricted data suggested that two first components (explaining 20% and 16% of variation respectively) could be interpreted meaningfully; the remaining components representing individual variability of the data, or 'noise\u2019; see (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shabalin and Nobel, 2013</a>) for references. We therefore only present the first two PCA-MV components in this paper (explaining 15% and 8% of total variance respectively).

This statement is obvious if you consider that the estimation of total variance in a set with randomly missing values is unbiased, yet explained variance is biased, as missing values cannot contribute to the calculation: while predictions for them are available, the values themselves are not present. As described above, a standard PCA run on a subset of data with full representation of all cells and variables explained 36% of total variance. Similarly, when we performed multiple imputation of missing values using R package 'Mi' (<a href=\"#bib71\">Su et al., 2011</a>) (see below for details), a standard PCA procedure explained on average 35 \u00b1 5% of total variance."

Rank-based normalization improved the amount of variance explained by the first component (from 15% on raw data to 21% on rank-transformed data), but did not improve explanatory value of higher components. Upon visual comparison of score-plots and loading-plots, we concluded that the relative arrangement of individual cells (score-plot), as well as contributing variables within the 2D plane of first two components (loading-plot), did not change enough to justify the use of rank-transformation. All analysis reported in the paper was therefore performed on raw variables."

To quantify the quality of 2D ordination we looked at how well the 2D map preserved pairwise differences between points in the original 33D space, using the squared correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> between 2D and 33D distances as an output measure (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pedhazur, 1982</a>). Based on this metric, PCA preserved 51 \u00b1 2% of variance in pairwise differences (5 alternative Bayesian imputations of missing data using R package 'Mi\u2019). The quality of Isomap projection improved as the projection became less and less local, from 17 \u00b1 4% for isomap based on 3 closest neighbors for each point, to 36 \u00b1 7% based on 20 closest neighbors; still it was substantially lower than for PCA. The Local Linear Embedding approach (R package 'lle\u2019, based on (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kouropteva et al., 2005</a>) also produced better results as more neighbors were considered, with the local best solution achieved at 19 neighbors explaining 27 \u00b1 9% of variance in pairwise differences (as opposed to 51 \u00b1 2% for PCA). Based on these results we concluded that for our data linear factor analysis approach is not only adequate, but also the most appropriate. In all cases testing was performed on centered and normalized data."

At 17 variables (one half of the original set, corresponding to total explained variance threshold of 6%) PCA-MV explained 40% of total variance in the set (as opposed to 23% for full data PCA-MV), and some of the effects we describe in the paper became more prominent (for example, F-value for changes in PCA cloud size across developmental stages increased from 75 for the full set to 118 for restricted set). However we decided not to present PCA of restricted data in the paper, as thinning out of the multivariate dataset is generally not recommended for exploratory analysis when there is no objective post-hoc test to justify the use of one restricted model over another (<a href=\"#bib27\">Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003</a>).

To be more specific, we would all agree that the Na and K conductance densities are independent attributes. But, spike frequency and interspike interval are two measures of the same property. Obviously, this latter case is trivial, but there are instances in which two attributes that on first glance may appear to be independent are not. So for example, membrane capacitance and synaptic current might together give you the envelope of the synaptic events? If so, then is it fair to use all three as independent attributes? It is not clear how many truly independent measurements there are among the 33?"

And we understand why you made some measurements after bringing all the neurons to -65mV. But that by itself was a decision to not measure the voltage difference between the resting potential and threshold. There are a number of choices of this sort which were not adequately justified in the manuscript, but which might change significantly the take-home messages? You report the number of spikes in response to cosine drive, but from -65mV. These data might look totally different if you had started at the neurons' resting potential (which also has its difficulties of course)."

One of the specificities of the current article is that the authors use different types of multi-dimensional analyses (mostly PCA) to analyze variations in electrical phenotype defined by 33 intrinsic electrophysiological parameters (passive properties, spiking response, and measurements of specific voltage-dependent ion currents). The main conclusion drawn from this analysis is that a high degree of degeneracy underlies the electrical phenotype of tectal neurons, as neurons with similar spiking can display strikingly different underlying electrophysiological properties and neurons with similar underlying electrophysiological properties may display strikingly different electrical phenotype. Moreover, the authors suggest that the differences in electrophysiological properties found between visually-stimulated and early stages of development for similar spiking profiles also demonstrate degeneracy of electrical phenotype. Although the approach is interesting, I have several concerns about the measurements, the analysis and the conclusions drawn from the results."

As the authors mention, the 2 principal components account for 23% of the variance of the observations (15% for PC1 and 8% for PC2). This means that the main part of the variance in the observations (77%) is unaccounted for in this analysis. The choice of analyzing neuronal output by measuring a large number of electrophysiological parameters, and using dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA to visualize it is a valid approach if dimensionality reduction preserves most of the information contained in the original measurements. In the present case, 77% of the variance (most likely including variance in parameters that are essential for defining neuronal output) is lost in the analysis. This problem may arise from several different sources: i) the high number of parameters used as an input for the PCA (33) ii) the fact that a linear model such as PCA might not be adequate to describe the variance of the parameters analyzed here. Independent of the source of confusion, this means that PCA may not be the adequate model to use in the present study to draw conclusions on the relationships between neuronal output and underlying parameters. In particular, the concept of degeneracy requires that both the target phenotype (here neuronal output) and the underlying parameters are accurately measured (see main point 2) and defined, and that they have relevant relationships. The fact that PCA accounts for only 23% of the variance in \"electrical phenotype\" is a real concern that hinders the purpose and the conclusions of this study."

                    "text": "2) My second main concern is about the relevance of some of the electrophysiological parameters measured: some of the parameters are flawed with measurements errors, whilst others lack obvious physiological relevance. The thresholds of the 3 ion currents (Na, KT, and KS) are not measured properly as they are contaminated by reversal potential variations (Na, KT) or are based on a non-sigmoidal fragment of the IV curve (KS). Ion current \"thresholds\" are usually characterized by precisely defining the half-activation voltages based on conductance vs voltage curves. The measurements of action potential properties in these cells seem to be strongly influenced by variations in the remote location of the spike initiation site (as indicated by the small amplitude of the action potential, around 15\u201320 mV). In this context, it is difficult to understand whether variations in the kinetics and amplitude of the action potential are mainly attributable to variations in Na and K currents, or variations in the passive properties (i.e. rather related to Cm and Rm) of the compartment located in between the recording site and the spike initiation site. I do not understand the monosynapticity factor."

Although there is no doubt that biological systems are \"degenerate\", demonstrating degeneracy first requires to demonstrate that the variable parameters have a strong influence on the output of the system. As an example, action potential shape is degenerate if i) it relies on variable sodium current density and ii) sodium current density has been demonstrated to have a causal influence on action potential shape. The degeneracy argument is irrelevant when the second condition is not fulfilled: as an example, the fact that synaptic transmission at axon terminals located far away from the soma tolerates large variations in soma size does not tell us anything about the degeneracy of synaptic transmission, until we prove that soma size has a significant influence on synaptic transmission."

However, while one can somewhat impute characterizing \"spikiness\", a meaningful definition of \"robustness\" is not provided. The authors then go on to make the point that the PCA cloud is moving across developmental \"space\", predominantly in the \"spikiness\" domain. This is seemingly a bit of an overwrought analysis, when a much more direct measure of \"spikiness\" (i.e. the spiking of the cells) is provided in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and demonstrates in much less convoluted terms that spiking propensity does indeed change in these groups."

This crucial aspect of the manuscript is not well justified. The criterion for determining cells of similar output is only mentioned in passing with a reference to work of Victor and Purpura without enough detail to evaluate. Since then, many computational studies have been published with highly effective means of identifying cells with highly convergent output. This is underscored by the fact that in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, the representative traces from these cells are too small to really get a proper feel for this, but the case could easily be made counter to the authors assertion that \"spiking outputs are\u2026 closely matched within each group\". In other words, they don't look that similar to me. If this is based simply on spike number, then it is ignoring the pattern of firing and seems to arbitrarily decide that 2-3 and 4-7 are different groups (why not 2-4 and 5-7?). A much more thorough analysis and justification for \"similar outputs\" would greatly strengthen the argument of the authors. As this figure is potentially a centerpiece of the study, this is one of the most critical aspects to address."

Specifically, with this level of sample size the authors could remove the tails of the data distribution (perhaps below the 5th and above the 95th percentiles), reanalyze, and see if correlations remain.

Such an approach needs to have a very transparent analysis and should steer clear of jumping to conclusions. Unfortunately, I found the analysis relied heavily on quite opaque methods that in one case reported clustering (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) with minute p-values even though no clustering is evident when all the data are plotted together. This reliance on very complicated analysis methods to find patterns in the data made it hard to interpret the findings and assess their veracity."

From studies in adult frogs it is known that eventually, after metamorphosis, optic tectum harbors several types of neurons that differ both in their morphology (Lazar and Szekely, 1967; Lazar, 1973) and function (Gr\u00fcsser and Gr\u00fcsser-Cornehls, 1976; Yamamoto et al., 2003; Nakagawa and Hongjian, 2010).

Not only PCA can be extremely useful when applied to datasets of interdependent variables, it relies on the assumption that variables are co-dependent (specifically \u2013 linearly correlated). The actual pitfall of applying PCA to diverse multivariate datasets is not the potential dependency of variables per se, but rather the overrepresentation of some aspects of this dependency at the expense of others. For example, when creating our dataset we had to be mindful of including about the same number of variables to quantify each of different aspects of cell physiology (3 for spiking, 3 for spike shape, 2 for spontaneous activity, 2 for synaptic strength, 3 for temporal synaptic properties etc.), lest one of them overwhelmed the rest and skewed the results in its favor."

As an example, action potential shape is degenerate if i) it relies on variable sodium current density and ii) sodium current density has been demonstrated to have a causal influence on action potential shape. The degeneracy argument is irrelevant when the second condition is not fulfilled: as an example, the fact that synaptic transmission at axon terminals located far away from the soma tolerates large variations in soma size does not tell us anything about the degeneracy of synaptic transmission, until we prove that soma size has a significant influence on synaptic transmission.</i> "

More importantly, all subsequent analyses in the paper (including principal variable analysis and principal component analysis) rely on the assumption of normality of the data, and utilize standard total variance calculations that are based on Pearson-like products of non-rank-transformed data. As we were aware of this potential issue early on, even before performing any extensive analysis of data we separately ran a validation test by comparing PCA on rank-transformed variables to that on the original data. The validation showed that the results of PCA on rank-transformed variables were not qualitatively different from that of standard PCA, which is reported in the paper (subheading \u201cStatistical Procedures\u201d). Moving to Spearman definition for the sake of correlation analysis would therefore introduce a statistical inconsistency, as it would be equivalent to moving to rank-transformed data for preliminary analysis, yet staying with original data with the final analysis; a choice that may be hard to justify. For similar reasons we did not use tail removal to verify our correlations, as strong correlations remained significant under Spearman definition, which is arguably preferable to data range restriction when outliers are concerned (Linn et al., 1981), while weak correlations were not used for any inference."
