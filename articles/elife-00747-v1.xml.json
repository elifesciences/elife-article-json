The major strategy proposed for overcoming resistance is combination therapy. We present a mathematical model describing the evolutionary dynamics of lesions in response to treatment. We first studied 20 melanoma patients receiving vemurafenib. We then applied our model to an independent set of pancreatic, colorectal, and melanoma cancer patients with metastatic disease. We find that dual therapy results in long-term disease control for most patients, if there are no single mutations that cause cross-resistance to both drugs; in patients with large disease burden, triple therapy is needed. We also find that simultaneous therapy with two drugs is much more effective than sequential therapy. Our results provide realistic expectations for the efficacy of new drug combinations and inform the design of trials for new cancer therapeutics."

The major strategy proposed for overcoming resistance is combination therapy. We present a mathematical model describing the evolutionary dynamics of lesions in response to treatment. We first studied 20 melanoma patients receiving vemurafenib. We then applied our model to an independent set of pancreatic, colorectal, and melanoma cancer patients with metastatic disease. We find that dual therapy results in long-term disease control for most patients, if there are no single mutations that cause cross-resistance to both drugs; in patients with large disease burden, triple therapy is needed. We also find that simultaneous therapy with two drugs is much more effective than sequential therapy. Our results provide realistic expectations for the efficacy of new drug combinations and inform the design of trials for new cancer therapeutics."

Given that a single drug is therefore highly unlikely to eradicate a tumor, combinations of two or more drugs may offer a higher chance of cure.

Four decades of research passed between the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome and the first treatment to target an activated oncogene in a human cancer. Targeted therapies against many different types of cancer are now being developed at a fast pace.

Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of resistance in targeted cancer treatment is crucial for progress in this area and has been the focus of experimental (<a href=\"#bib14\">Engelman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Corcoran et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bivona et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Diaz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ellis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Misale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Straussman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Khorashad et al., 2013</a>) and theoretical studies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dewanji et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Komarova and Wodarz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Michor et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haeno et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dingli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Katouli and Komarova, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lenaerts et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beckman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bozic et al., 2012</a>).

Conceptually, there are two paths: treat tumors when they are very small, before a sufficient number of mutant cells conferring resistance have developed, or treat tumors with two or more drugs that target different pathways. In reality, the first option is usually not feasible, as clinicians have little or no control over the size of lesions in their patients at presentation. The second option, however, will become possible as more targeted agents are developed. The potential of combination therapy with targeted agents is buttressed by the success of conventional chemotherapeutic agents in leukemias and other cancers (<a href=\"#bib8a\">DeVita, 1975</a>) and of combination therapies for infectious diseases such as HIV (<a href=\"#bib39\">Porter et al., 2003</a>). But the potential therapeutic utility of combination therapies targeting different pathways in solid tumors cannot be inferred from these prior studies, as the anatomic and evolutionary characteristics of solid tumors are far different from those of liquid tumors (leukemias) or infectious diseases. In this work, we have formulated a mathematical model to predict the effects of combined targeted therapies in realistic clinical scenarios and attempted to answer the question posed at the beginning of this paragraph."

Evidence to date does not indicate that cancer stem cells are innately resistant to either single drugs or drug combinations. However, the precise proportion of cancer stem cells (among all cancer cells) has a dramatic effect on the development of resistance. This effect can be studied using our model if we use the number of cancer stem cells as an effective population size in our formulas and adjust other parameters to account for the stem cell dynamics (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tomasetti and Levy, 2010</a>) (i.e., the birth rate should correspond to the rate of symmetric renewal, the rate of symmetric differentiation should be added to the death rate, and an effective mutation rate for stem cells should be introduced to account for mutations that occur during asymmetric division). For example, if cancer stem cells represent only 0.1% of cancer cells, then the development of resistance to single agents or combinations is roughly 0.1% as likely as if 100% of the cancer cells have the capacity to repopulate the tumor. The fraction of cancer stem cells appears to be this low in CML, perhaps explaining the remarkable success of imatinib (<a href=\"#bib36\">Michor et al., 2005</a>). In solid tumors, however, the fraction of cancer stem cells seems much higher, usually higher than 5% and in some cases close to 100% (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shackleton et al., 2009</a>). This issue is further complicated by the fact that the situation is plastic, with non-stem cells converting to cancer stem cells under certain conditions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gupta et al., 2009</a>). As better approaches to quantify cancer stem cells in solid tumors become available, our estimates of the likelihood of therapeutic success will be improved."

We used computer simulations to verify our results in the case when there is a cost for resistance, by assuming that each resistance mutation decreases the net growth rate of the cell by up to 10%. The results are shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. For combination therapies with drugs that have resistance mutations in common, the probability of eradicating a lesion is only marginally affected by costly resistance. For dual therapies with no cross-resistance mutations, treatment has a high chance of eradicating all but the largest lesions, whether or not resistance is costly. In the case of large lesions with high cell turnover rates (the case in which even dual therapies with no cross-resistance might fail), costly resistance increases the chance of treatment success. For example, if each resistance mutation decreases the net growth rate of cells by 10%, the probability that dual therapy with no cross-resistance mutations will eradicate a lesion of size 10<sup>11</sup> in which cells divide on average every day is 68% (compared with 47% in the case of neutral resistance)."

Moreover, it is well known that mutations in several different genes, including those encoding ABC transporters, can confer resistance to many different drugs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lavi et al., 2012</a>). Drugs that have very different chemical structures, in addition to distinct mechanisms of action, may be required to circumvent these resistance mechanisms."

This promising line of therapy relies on an ongoing battle between cancer cells and the immune system. The immune system, unlike small molecule compounds, can replicate and evolve, and the factors underlying therapeutic success or failure are not sufficiently understood to allow useful modeling at this point. Once the mechanisms underlying the failures of immune modulators become more apparent, it will be important to try to understand why long-term control of disease is more common with these therapies than with small molecule drugs."

Sequential administration of targeted agents is often used to treat patients, for a variety of medical and economic reasons. Our data show that this sequential administration precludes any chance for cure\u2014even when there are no possible mutations that can confer cross-resistance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). And when there are potential mutations conferring cross-resistance to two or more agents, simultaneous administration offers some hope for cure while there is no hope with sequential therapy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The realization of the advantages of simultaneous vs sequential dual therapy will hopefully stimulate efforts to combine agents much earlier in the drug development process."

The simulations implement a multitype birth\u2013death branching process using the specified parameter values.

Our primary advances with regard to previous branching-process models are in the development and incorporation of new mathematical techniques yielding exact closed-form results, and our use of new clinical data to obtain parameter values applicable to solid tumors.
