We applied the classic Michaelis\u2013Menten enzyme kinetics to demonstrate a novel mathematical relationship of income to childhood (aged 0\u20135 years) and adult (aged 15\u201360 years) survival. We treat income as a substrate that is catalyzed to increase survival (from technologies that income buys) for 180 countries from 1970 and 2007. Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics permit estimates of maximal survival and, uniquely, the critical income needed to achieve half of the period-specific maximum. Maximum child and adult survival rose by about 1% per year. Critical incomes fell by half for children, but doubled for men. HIV infection and smoking account for some, but not all, of the rising critical incomes for adult survival. Altering the future cost curve for adult survival will require more widespread use of current interventions, most notably tobacco control, but also research to identify practicable low-cost drugs, diagnostics, and strategies."

We applied the classic Michaelis\u2013Menten enzyme kinetics to demonstrate a novel mathematical relationship of income to childhood (aged 0\u20135 years) and adult (aged 15\u201360 years) survival. We treat income as a substrate that is catalyzed to increase survival (from technologies that income buys) for 180 countries from 1970 and 2007. Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics permit estimates of maximal survival and, uniquely, the critical income needed to achieve half of the period-specific maximum. Maximum child and adult survival rose by about 1% per year. Critical incomes fell by half for children, but doubled for men. HIV infection and smoking account for some, but not all, of the rising critical incomes for adult survival. Altering the future cost curve for adult survival will require more widespread use of current interventions, most notably tobacco control, but also research to identify practicable low-cost drugs, diagnostics, and strategies."

When plotted as a graph, with national income on the horizontal axis and life expectancy on the vertical axis, the Preston curve shows that an increase in national income leads to an increase in life expectancy, with the increases in life expectancy becoming proportionally smaller as income increases. Moreover, Preston showed that innovations in healthcare (such as vaccinations, public health education, and sanitation systems) were increasing the maximum life expectancy that can be achieved for any given national income (defined as GDP per capita): this can be seen by comparing the Preston curves from 1960 and 2000 shown in Figure 1A. Indeed, global life expectancy increased by about 25 years over the course of the 20th century, which suggests that the level of daily income needed to achieve a certain life expectancy should be falling over time."

They found that most of the gains in life expectancy for low- and middle-income countries have been achieved by reducing child mortality, with gains in life expectancy for adults being restricted mostly to high-income countries. The model, which is based on the mathematical equations used to describe the kinetics of enzymatic reactions, makes it possible to estimate the improvements of health that can be made over time, and also the level of income that is needed to achieve these improvements."

Based on available data from over 150 countries, they found that critical incomes fell by half for children between 1970 and 2007, but doubled for adult males during the same period. The rise in critical income for adults was due partly to the HIV epidemic and increases in smoking in low- and middle-income countries, reflecting the growing problems presented by noncommunicable diseases. Hum et al. conclude that increasing the survival among adults will require increased use of proven cost-effective interventions, most notably tobacco control, plus new research to identify low-cost drugs, diagnostics, and other public health strategies."

Preston noted an upward rise in the curve for three decades over the 20th century, leading to higher life expectancies for any given national income (defined as GDP per capita) level over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> is a reproduced graph of the Preston curve for the years 1960 and 2000).

But these trends mask heterogeneity across age groups and income levels. In this article, we argue that the majority of gains in life expectancy for low- and middle-income countries have been achieved through reductions in child mortality while improvements in adult mortality have been restricted mostly to high-income countries. This has reduced inequality between countries for child survival, however, increased inequality for adult survival. The central objective of this article is to construct a mathematical model derived from the field of biochemistry/enzymology to analyze upward and lateral movements in the Preston curve. More specifically, we establish a new parameter \u2018critical income\u2019 (analogous to the Michaelis constant [K<sub>m</sub>]) to investigate the trends in income levels associated with reductions in mortality over the past 40 years; this model is further applied to age-specific populations to elucidate child and adult contributions to improving life expectancy. We also estimate the impact of HIV/AIDS and smoking on adult critical income values."

We introduce a new parameter called \u2018critical income\u2019 as a meaningful construct that can be estimated to assess the relationship between income and mortality.

For adult males in the year 2000, HIV prevalence (range 0.06\u201326% aged 15\u201349 years) and cigarette consumption (range 54.6\u20133385.2 per year at ages 15 years or older) were shown to influence critical income. Selecting the 86 countries with complete survival, income, HIV, and cigarette data, the critical income value was $2.02 ($1.32\u2013$2.73). Adjusting for HIV and smoking prevalence to the average across countries reduced the critical income to $1.22 ($0.76\u2013$1.69), meaning that HIV and smoking could explain about half of the increases in critical income. In 1970, the critical income was $0.54 ($0.38\u2013$0.71), thus, HIV infection and smoking do not explain all of the worsening of critical income observed by the year 2000.

This suggests that for low- and middle-income countries, the majority of the past gains in life expectancy have been achieved via declining child mortality. This is consistent with the UN Population Division trends given the large impact of child mortality (compared to adult mortality) on overall life expectancy (<a href=\"#bib41\">United Nations, 2011</a>). The greatest decline in child critical income was achieved after 1990, coinciding with actions following the UN's World Summit for Children. With justification, cost-effective interventions have been disproportionately devoted to child and maternal health (<a href=\"#bib12\">Daar et al., 2007</a>), and more recently to control of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Increasing coverage of inexpensive health interventions such as immunization, insecticide-treated nets, and case management of childhood infections could be contributing to the decline in critical income for child survival (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jamison et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mathers et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, there might be complementary benefits of education in reducing child mortality (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gakidou et al., 2010</a>). Our study does not address any causal relationship between such interventions and reductions in child mortality; however, our results imply that the achievement of the UN MDG 4 (to reduce child mortality by two-thirds from 1990 levels) might be due to the falling levels of income needed to increase child survival."

While achievable adult survival rates have improved, improvements are only associated with those countries at higher income levels. The rise in critical income suggests that the marginal costs of increasing adult longevity are rising; this may explain the lower rate of decline in adult mortality in countries with low income (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rajaratnam et al., 2010</a>). The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and the rise in global smoking prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guindon and Boisclair, 2003</a>) can explain much, but not the entire rise in critical income for adult males. For males, the rise in smoking accounts for over 40% more of the variance in critical income compared to 30% for HIV/AIDS. For adult women, the impact of cigarettes on critical income is much lower, which reflects the five times lower prevalence of smoking among women compared to men (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guindon and Boisclair, 2003</a>). Indeed, previous studies have already highlighted the impact of smoking and HIV/AIDS on adult survival in developing countries. Even low levels (4%) of HIV prevalence in rural Tanzania can increase overall adult mortality by more than 50% (<a href=\"#bib38\">Todd et al., 1997</a>). Our findings also show that smoking increases critical income but has no statistical impact on maximum survival. This is in line with trends in global smoking, where prevalence of smoking (and subsequently the deaths attributed to smoking) are rising in low- and middle-income countries but declining in high-income countries (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jha, 2009</a>)."

Moreover, should the critical income costs for adults continue to rise (in line with current trends), survival rates for low- and middle-income countries might well deteriorate into the future. In contrast, high-income countries have benefited from the rise in maximum survival among adults. This is likely due to more widespread availability of secondary treatments for chronic diseases, most notably for vascular disease, and in particular from sharp reductions in smoking (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jha, 2009</a>)."

However, these interventions are still not widely used in low-income countries (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jha et al., 2012</a>). Over the past few decades, research and development of new technologies (drugs, vaccines, and policies) have focused mostly on childhood and infectious disease, with fewer worldwide investments for adult chronic diseases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research Relating to Future Intervention Options, 1996</a>). Thus, the longer-term trajectory of critical incomes for adult survival might well depend on the development of newer interventions, as well as more widespread application of interventions already proven to be cost effective (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jamison et al., 2006</a>)."

But none of the models can directly elucidate the mechanism(s) that converts income into better survival. The novel insight from the MM method is that we can model income as a substrate that catalyzes further changes that more directly impact survival. National income is quite large in relation to health spending for most countries (the median national spending on health is 5% of the GDP, and the United States at about 18% of GDP represents an outlier). Thus, income fulfills, partially, the MM definition of a substrate that is an input converted into health interventions and their use. We also reason that income directly enables certain technologies, immunization programs, epidemiological knowledge, education, and sanitation systems and other areas, which may themselves be interpreted as \u2018catalysts\u2019\u2014agents that accelerate the rate of a reaction without being fully consumed in the process."

Additionally, the obvious impacts of two large risk factors (HIV and tobacco) on adult survival suggest some mechanistic insights between income and survival (and indeed the fact that male survival was more unequal from greater male smoking, and female and male survival were affected equally by the more even spread of HIV infection, further strengthens this case)."

Nonetheless, this equation was (and continues to be) used extensively in the pharmaceutical and food industries as well as in waste treatment systems. Additionally, our analyses could be considerably strengthened by examining trends in age, gender, and cause-specific mortality, but cause-specific mortality data are simply unavailable for most countries; for instance, notwithstanding global efforts to identify data for child mortality, less than 3% of all child deaths worldwide were certified according to cause of death (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, expanded efforts to measure causes of death is a big global priority (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jha, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vogel, 2012</a>) and the development of new physically or biologically inspired analytical models can help elucidate better understanding of global mortality trends."

Income alone does not adequately explain these changes \u2013 rather it is a reflection of a range of complex interactions of which GDP and family income are two factors. It is unclear to us how this analysis deals with the complex web of interactions that impact on life expectancy or the burden of disease and our read of the manuscript did not leave us with a clear indication of how this enzyme mathematical model adds value as a new approach to the problem if it does not deal with the multitude of variables impacting life expectancy."

First, we cannot attribute a theoretical mechanism to our model; but we reason that income directly enables certain technologies, immunization schemes, public health knowledge, education, and sanitation systems, which may be interpreted as \u201ccatalysts\u201d, whose effects are long lasting, are not consumed in the reaction (or on minimally consumed as they cost only a very small % of GDP), and can increase the efficiency of the transformation of income to health. Second, the main contribution of our finding is to identify a new variable (akin to <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>), which provides a measure of efficiency or \u201clateral shift\u201d that simply was not possible mathematically from the earlier adaptations of the Preston curve. This critical income value is also directly policy relevant \u2013 it shows marginal costs are falling for children but rising for adult survival."
