In this study, we used Mss116, a yeast DEAD-box protein that utilizes ATP to locally unwind dsRNA, to investigate helicase specificity and mechanism. Our results define the molecular basis for the substrate specificity of a DEAD-box protein. Additionally, they show that Mss116 has ambiguous substrate-binding properties and interacts with all four NTPs and both RNA and DNA. The efficiency of unwinding correlates with the stability of the \u2018closed-state\u2019 helicase core, a complex with nucleotide and nucleic acid that forms as duplexes are unwound. Crystal structures reveal that core stability is modulated by family-specific interactions that favor certain substrates. This suggests how present-day helicases diversified from an ancestral core with broad specificity by retaining core closure as a common catalytic mechanism while optimizing substrate-binding interactions for different cellular functions."

In this study, we used Mss116, a yeast DEAD-box protein that utilizes ATP to locally unwind dsRNA, to investigate helicase specificity and mechanism. Our results define the molecular basis for the substrate specificity of a DEAD-box protein. Additionally, they show that Mss116 has ambiguous substrate-binding properties and interacts with all four NTPs and both RNA and DNA. The efficiency of unwinding correlates with the stability of the \u2018closed-state\u2019 helicase core, a complex with nucleotide and nucleic acid that forms as duplexes are unwound. Crystal structures reveal that core stability is modulated by family-specific interactions that favor certain substrates. This suggests how present-day helicases diversified from an ancestral core with broad specificity by retaining core closure as a common catalytic mechanism while optimizing substrate-binding interactions for different cellular functions."

(<b>D</b>) Model for RNA duplex binding and unwinding by Mss116. The helicase core domains of Mss116 have modular roles in substrate loading (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallam et al., 2012</a>). D1 captures ATP in the open-state enzyme using the Q-motif, which coordinates the adenine base, and motifs I and II, which are the conserved triphosphate-binding loop and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding aspartic acid motifs, respectively, present in many other ATP-binding enzymes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Walker et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rudolph et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schutz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mallam et al., 2012</a>). D2 recognizes duplex RNA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallam et al., 2012</a>). When ATP and dsRNA are bound to D1 and D2, respectively, core closure occurs, leading to unwinding of the dsRNA bound to D2 by bending one RNA strand and displacing the other. During unwinding and formation of the closed-state helicase core complex, ATP bound to D1 makes additional interactions with motifs Va and VI in D2. The closed-state helicase core bound to ssRNA and ATP represents the \u2018post-unwound\u2019 state of the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). ATP hydrolysis occurs in the closed state, followed by dissociation of P<sub>i</sub> and ADP, which leads to the reopening of the core and the release of the bound ssRNA, thereby regenerating the enzyme (<a href=\"#bib14\">Henn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cao et al., 2011</a>)."

This was done by using a 12-base pair (bp) dsRNA, which was labeled with a fluorophore and quencher at its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, respectively.

Equilibrium fluorescence anisotropy binding assays with a fluorescein (FAM)-labeled A<sub>10</sub>-RNA were used to monitor formation of the closed state with increasing concentrations of NDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> (N = A, C, G, or U; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These assays show that the closed-state complex is most stable with ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 0.022 mM), while CDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, GDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, and UDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> promote formation of the closed state only at significantly higher concentrations of nucleotide analogue (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 0.09, 0.11, and 0.63 mM, respectively). Similarly, analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) shows that a closed-state helicase core with A<sub>10</sub>-RNA is maintained during elution for complexes containing ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, CDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, or GDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> but not those containing UDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, consistent with the latter complex having a lower stability (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Together, these findings indicate that the unwinding efficiencies and closed-state core stabilities with different NTP analogues follow the same order of A &gt; C, G &gt; U from higher to lower efficiency and stability."

This indicates a more stable closed state and accounts for the higher unwinding activity observed for ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> compared to AMP-PNP for several DEAD-box proteins (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2008</a>). Further, neither ADP nor ADP + P<sub>i</sub> in large excess led to the formation of a stable closed state in our assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that the effective concentration of the ATP \u03b3-phosphate is critical for the stability of the closed-state. This finding explains energetically why ATP hydrolysis leads to core re-opening and enzyme turnover in DEAD-box proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Henn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cao et al., 2011</a>) and perhaps other SF1 and SF2 helicases. Together, our results show the unwinding efficiency of Mss116 with different nucleotides is directly correlated with the stability of the post-unwound closed-state complex."

These structures show that the ATP-binding motifs I and VI make similar direct contacts to the phosphate groups of all four NTP analogs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Motif II (DEAD) is positioned identically in all structures and interacts indirectly via waters with the BeF<sub>3</sub> moiety, which corresponds to the ATP \u03b3-phosphate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, each base interacts differently in the ATP-binding pocket. The purine bases (A and G) are stacked optimally with F126 in the Q-motif, which primarily confers ATP specificity in DEAD-box proteins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</a>), whereas the pyrimidine bases (C and U) adopt a less favorable stacking orientation with this residue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Also, fewer direct contacts are made to the C, G, and U bases than to A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In particular, compared to the closed-state structure with ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, two hydrogen (H)-bonds from G128 and Q133 in the Q-motif to the base are absent in the complex with GDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, and all of the direct interactions of the Q-motif with the base are missing in the structures with CDP- or UDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>. The fewer contacts of all other bases relative to adenine and the less favorable stacking of pyrimidine bases in the ATP-binding pocket explain the relative stabilities of the closed-state complexes and reveal how the helicase core of Mss116 adapted to unwind RNA most efficiently using ATP."

To determine how Mss116 specifies for dsRNA, we first examined how 12-bp RNA and DNA duplexes of different geometries (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) interact with D2 in the absence of nucleotide. EMSAs using fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labeled duplexes show that D2 has surprisingly similar affinities for dsRNA (<i>K</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 400 nM) and A-DNA and B-DNA duplexes (<i>K</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 410 and 510 nM, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Circular dichroism (CD) measurements confirmed that the geometry of the A-DNA and B-DNA duplexes is maintained upon binding to D2, and that binding does not induce a B- to A-form transition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The B-DNA duplex also competitively displaces dsRNA bound to D2 (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 1700 nM) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These results indicate that D2 can bind dsRNA and dsDNA of A- or B-form geometry in the dsRNA binding pocket even with the different spacing of the backbone phosphate groups (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallam et al., 2012</a>). Our findings are consistent with recent studies showing that several DEAD-box proteins can interact with dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kammel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tuteja et al., 2014</a>). D2 of Mss116 is therefore a general and flexible nucleic acid duplex binding domain."

In each case, core closure was retained as a catalytic mechanism using the interactions common to all NTP or nucleic acid substrates predicted from our results. However, the stability of the closed-state was further modulated by family-specific interactions that favor a particular NTP and nucleic acid. Thus, helicase families that display the most substrate ambiguity by utilizing all four NTPs and function on either DNA or RNA (for example the DEAH/RHA [<a href=\"#bib42\">Tanaka and Schwer, 2005</a>] and NS3/NPH-II [<a href=\"#bib36\">Preugschat et al., 1996</a>] families; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) may contain a core that functions similarly to that of an ancestral helicase. Helicases that preferentially use ATP maintained the conserved interactions with nucleotide phosphate groups but acquired additional interactions with the adenine base that further stabilize the closed-state complex. Similarly, DEAD-box proteins, which act preferentially on RNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</a>), maintained conserved interactions with the nucleic acid backbone but evolved specificity for A-form duplexes and additional stabilizing interactions with RNA 2\u2032-OH groups in the closed state, as demonstrated here for Mss116. The lack of unwinding activity in some DEAD-box proteins may stem from structural changes in the helicase core that mitigate RNA bending or strand displacement (<a href=\"#bib48\">Young et al., 2013</a>). Helicase families that function on DNA (for example, the Swi/Snf, RecQ-like, and UvrD/Rep families) could have diversified by the preservation of conserved interactions with the nucleic acid backbone combined with the selection of additional interactions that favor B-form duplexes and/or disfavor nucleic acids with 2\u2032-OH groups."

The DEAH family of helicases are a potential example of a case where a sequence change in motif II compared to DEAD-box proteins (\u2018DEAH\u2019 instead of \u2018DEAD\u2019) might result in a weaker interaction with the ATP \u03b3-phosphate and favor the observed switch from localized to translocation-based unwinding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). More generally, ATP-dependent core closure to form a ternary complex with nucleic acid may have evolved from tighter to weaker binding as the helicase mechanism concurrently evolved from localized to translocation-based. This is in addition to structural features, such as extra terminal domains or \u03b2-hairpins within the helicase core, which favor translocation-based unwinding in some helicase families (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</a>). Protein cofactors may also play a role in helicase substrate specificity, as illustrated for the DEAD-box protein Rok1, whose cofactor Rrp5 increases the specificity of the helicase core 10-fold for a pre-rRNA duplex (<a href=\"#bib48\">Young et al., 2013</a>)."

In these cases, subtle changes in the closed-state core, perhaps combined with additional flanking domains, enable the helicase to bind duplex nucleic acid without the need to overcome the energetic barrier to unwinding and lead to this distinct mechanism of action. It has been hypothesized that during evolution, progenitor enzymes of low activity and broad specificity diverge into families of more potent and highly specialized enzymes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jensen, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</a>). Taken together, our findings suggest how a progenitor helicase core that had broad specificity and used conserved motifs to recognize the phosphate groups of NTPs and the backbone of nucleic acids diverged to present day SF1 and SF2 helicases with different cellular functions."

Initial space groups were determined by using Pointless (<a href=\"#bib10\">Evans, 2006</a>) and confirmed by decreases in both <i>R</i><sub>work</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>free</sub> after refinement of molecular replacement solutions. Molecular replacement was performed with Phaser (<a href=\"#bib29\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>), using the previously determined structure of Mss116 D1D2 in the closed state (PDB 3I5X) as a search model. Structures were completed with cycles of manual model building in Coot (<a href=\"#bib9\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and refinement in Phenix (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). Validation of protein and nucleic acid models and their contacts was done by using MolProbity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2010</a>) and indicated that at least 98% of residues are located in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot. Structural figures were prepared by using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.4, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC."

Using structural and biochemical approaches on the DEAD-box helicase Mss116 that functions as a chaperone for the process of mitochondrial intron splicing, they show that this helicase can, in principle, bind both RNA and DNA, and a variety of nucleotides, but with a significant preference for A over the others. Crystal structures are presented of the Mss116 construct in complex with Berylium Fluoride and ADP, CDP, GDP and UDP. These structures go some way to delineate specific interactions that confer specificity for the adenine base and RNA, and show that these specificities are caused by rather small tweaks in the helicase core. Their results also suggest that the gamma phosphate of ATP pays a critical role in maintaining a 'closed state' conformation when engaging the nucleotide and RNA. The authors also show that, in addition to the known ability to bind duplex RNA, Mss116 is capable of binding to A-form double stranded DNA, but not DNA in the more common B-form, while the isolated C-terminal RecA domain (D2) can bind the B-form. Crystal structures are also presented of Mss116 in complex with A10 RNA and A10 DNA, showing a similar mechanism of interaction for both substrates."

The Discussion is instructive and insightful. The figures are excellent and are very easy on the eye. Although the results are perhaps not ground breaking, the paper provides new, and in some aspects surprising, insight for a large and ubiquitous family of enzymes with central biological roles. The manuscript will thus be of interest to a diverse readership. There are a number of minor comments on specific points that will hopefully be helpful for the authors to consider, outlined below."

In vivo, Mss116 is required for the efficient splicing of all 13 yeast mitochondrial group I and group II introns, as well as the translation of certain mRNAs and mitochondrial RNA processing reactions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Huang et al., 2005</a>). The introns whose splicing is promoted by Mss116 differ structurally and rely on different intron-encoded maturases or nuclear gene-encoded splicing factors for structural stabilization. In vitro, purified Mss116 can by itself promote splicing of group II introns or function in the presence of a heterologous splicing factor, the <i>Neurospora crassa</i> mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (CYT-18 protein), to promote the splicing of a <i>N. crassa</i> group I intron (<a href=\"#bib6\">Del Campo et al., 2009</a>). The lack of specificity required for Mss116 function in vivo is further indicated by the finding that all phenotypic defects in an <i>mss116</i>\u0394 strains can be rescued by the expression of the <i>N. crassa</i> CYT-19 protein (<a href=\"#bib15\">Huang et al., 2005</a>), a related DEAD-box that also functions as general RNA chaperone (Mohr et al., 2002)."
