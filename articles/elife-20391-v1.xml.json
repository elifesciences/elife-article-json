To determine how TREM2 variants contribute to these diseases, we performed structural and functional studies of wild-type and variant proteins. Our 3.1 \u00c5 TREM2 crystal structure revealed that mutations found in Nasu-Hakola disease are buried whereas Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk variants are found on the surface, suggesting that these mutations have distinct effects on TREM2 function. Biophysical and cellular methods indicate that Nasu-Hakola mutations impact protein stability and decrease folded TREM2 surface expression, whereas Alzheimer\u2019s risk variants impact binding to a TREM2 ligand. Additionally, the Alzheimer\u2019s risk variants appear to epitope map a functional surface on TREM2 that is unique within the larger TREM family. These findings provide a guide to structural and functional differences among genetic variants of TREM2, indicating that therapies targeting the TREM2 pathway should be tailored to these genetic and functional differences with patient-specific medicine approaches for neurodegenerative disorders."

To determine how TREM2 variants contribute to these diseases, we performed structural and functional studies of wild-type and variant proteins. Our 3.1 \u00c5 TREM2 crystal structure revealed that mutations found in Nasu-Hakola disease are buried whereas Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk variants are found on the surface, suggesting that these mutations have distinct effects on TREM2 function. Biophysical and cellular methods indicate that Nasu-Hakola mutations impact protein stability and decrease folded TREM2 surface expression, whereas Alzheimer\u2019s risk variants impact binding to a TREM2 ligand. Additionally, the Alzheimer\u2019s risk variants appear to epitope map a functional surface on TREM2 that is unique within the larger TREM family. These findings provide a guide to structural and functional differences among genetic variants of TREM2, indicating that therapies targeting the TREM2 pathway should be tailored to these genetic and functional differences with patient-specific medicine approaches for neurodegenerative disorders."

                        "text": "The precise molecular determinants and mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases remain uncertain, but\u00a0recent large-scale genetic sequencing projects have uncovered new candidates associated with these diseases. For example, whole genome and whole exome sequencing has identified point mutations in the gene encoding the protein TREM2\u00a0(triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) that correlate with a significantly increased risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guerreiro et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jonsson et al., 2013</a>). In particular, the TREM2 R47H variant is associated with a risk that is similar to that associated with <i>APOE4</i>, previously the only well-established risk factor for late-onset AD. This mutation correlates with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels, a well-established risk factor for AD (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cruchaga et al., 2013</a>), and subsequent studies have identified this mutation in patients who\u00a0have frontal temporal dementia (FTD),\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rayaprolu et al., 2013</a>), and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Cady et al., 2014</a>). A recent study of more than 1,600 late-onset AD (LOAD) and cognitively normal brains revealed that microglia-specific networks, including those containing TREM2, are those most significantly dysregulated in LOAD (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Thus, even in the absence of rare variants in <i>TREM2</i> that increase AD risk, <i>TREM2</i>-containing pathways play a significant role in disease. Recent studies in AD mouse models that\u00a0are\u00a0deficient in <i>TREM2</i> confirm that loss of TREM2 function contributes to classic AD pathology and demonstrates a crucial role for TREM2 in central nervous system (CNS) biology (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jay et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ulrich et al., 2014</a>). <i>TREM2</i>-deficient AD mice display fewer activated microglia, and the absence of <i>TREM2</i> prevents microglia proliferation and promotes microglia apoptosis, which was correlated with increased accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jay et al., 2015</a>). Microglia in <i>TREM2</i>-deficient AD mice displayed less activation and did not engulf A\u03b2 plaques.\u00a0This\u00a0impacts the density of A\u03b2 plaques and promotes diffuse A\u03b2 structures, which in turn are more neurotoxic, and contributes to the accumulation of classic AD pathology (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yuan et al., 2016</a>). These findings highlight a crucial role for <i>TREM2</i> in maintaining CNS homeostasis.\u00a0Therefore,understanding how these risk variants affect TREM2 function and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is vital to the development of therapies targeting these devastating conditions."

It is a type one receptor protein consisting of an extracellular V-type Ig domain, a\u00a0short stalk, a transmembrane domain that associates with the adaptor protein DAP12 for signaling, and a cytoplasmic tail (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure <b>1a</b></a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Colonna, 2003</a>). TREM2 has historically been shown to play an anti-inflammatory role <i>in vitro</i> by antagonizing the\u00a0production of inflammatory cytokines from bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and dendritic cells (BMDDCs) in response to FcR (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hamerman et al., 2006</a>) and Tlr signaling (<a href=\"#bib61\">Turnbull et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ito and Hamerman, 2012</a>). Likewise, TREM2 participates in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in cultured microglia and reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib58\">Takahashi et al., 2005</a>). However, TREM2-expressing macrophages can also promote inflammatory disease in the brain (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jay et al., 2015</a>) and lung (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). The identity of a physiologic TREM2 ligand (TREM2-L) remains uncertain, although several classes of molecules have been proposed, including bacterial carbohydrates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daws et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Quan et al., 2008</a>), sulfoglycolipids (<a href=\"#bib45\">Phongsisay et al., 2015</a>), nucleic acids (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawabori et al., 2015</a>), phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cannon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>) and proteins (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stefano et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Takegahara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yoon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Atagi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bailey et al., 2015</a>).

N68K and D87N have also been identified in AD patients, but\u00a0because these mutations are very rare, their risk remains uncertain (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guerreiro et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jonsson et al., 2013</a>). In addition, the mutation T96K has been linked to a decreased risk of AD, but this\u00a0mutation is also too rare to allow verification of this observation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jin et al., 2014</a>). This curious segregation of disease phenotypes by distinct mutations occurring within the same protein suggest that these mutations should have divergent effects on the structure and function of TREM2."

To facilitate these studies, we developed a novel mammalian expression system to produce the natively folded and glycosylated TREM2 ectodomains in milligram quantities (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kober et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2015</a>). We determined the crystal structure of the TREM2 ectodomain at 3.1 \u00c5 resolution and found that the disease-linked mutations exhibit distinct structural patterns, suggesting that they would impact TREM2 function through alternate mechanisms. To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out extensive biophysical, cellular, and functional assays. We found that\u00a0NHD-causing mutations impact TREM2 protein folding and stability, whereas AD risk variants decrease binding to the\u00a0cellular TREM2-ligand (TREM2-L). Furthermore, these AD-linked mutations appear to epitope map a disease-relevant functional surface on TREM2 that facilitates binding to cell-surface TREM2-L. These findings demonstrate two distinct loss-of-function mechanisms for TREM2, illuminate a disease-relevant functional surface on TREM2, and pave the way for the development of patient-specific molecular therapies for the treatment of distinct neurodegenerative diseases."

The TREM2 ectodomain is a V-type Ig domain containing two disulfide bonds, the canonical Ig disulfide between residues C36 and C110 (\u03b2B\u2013\u03b2F) and an additional linkage between C51 and C60 (\u03b2C-\u03b2C\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). A single N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) glycan that\u00a0remains\u00a0after Endo Hf treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>) is clearly visible in the electron density at residue N79 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g</a>).

The side chains of mutations causing NHD (Y38, T66\u00a0and V126) are all buried within the core of the Ig fold, whereas the side chains of verified AD risk variants (R47H\u00a0and R62H) and possible AD risk variants (N68K, D87N\u00a0and T96K) all lie on the protein surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Quantification using solvent-accessible surface calculations verified this qualitative observation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Using structural analysis, we can hypothesize how the buried NHD mutations could negatively impact protein folding. Y38 is adjacent to C36, which forms an intramolecular disulfide with C110, so the Y38C mutation most likely disrupts correct disulfide formation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). T66 immediately follows the C\u2019 \u03b2-sheet and is tightly packed inside the core of the protein, with the side chain hydroxyl engaging the backbone amide of K48 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2c</a>). The T66M mutation would sterically disrupt this packing and probably\u00a0destabilize the protein. V126 is located on \u03b2-sheet G;\u00a0it is entirely buried and contributes to a hydrophobic core of the buried residues F24, D104, A105, and Y108. Removal of the side chain by the V126G mutation would disrupt this packing and probably destabilize this hydrophobic core (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2d</a>). In addition, sequence analysis reveals that\u00a0Y38 and V126 are conserved within the TREM family, implying that they are probably required to preserve the common fold within this family of receptors (Figure 5c). The T66 residue is less conserved in the TREM family, but is highly conserved in TREM2 proteins across species."

R47, the residue with the strongest link to AD as the R47H variant, is at the end of the loop preceding \u03b2-sheet C. It is well-ordered in the structure with the side chain lying parallel along the surface of the protein, and the side-chain amines engage the carbonyl oxygen of T66 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2d</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). R62, another strong AD\u00a0risk factor as the R62H variant, comes after the loop marked by the C51-C60 disulfide bond (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2e</a>). Its side chain faces outward and makes no polar contacts. N68 is also surface exposed and its side chain makes no obvious polar contacts within the molecule. D87 is at the end of \u03b2-strand D; its side chain extends from the protein surface and the side-chain carboxyl engages the backbone amide of G90. This interaction probably stabilizes the \u03b2D-E loop. T96 is on the end of \u03b2-strand E and its side chain points away from the surface and engages the side chain of Q33 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2f</a>). On the basis of this structural analysis of neurodegenerative disease mutations in TREM2, we hypothesized that NHD mutants (which are buried) would affect protein folding and stability and thus decrease their surface expression, whereas AD risk variants (which lie on the protein surface) would not affect surface expression and instead probably impact ligand binding."

(<b>h</b>) FLAG-TREM2 full-length constructs were co-transfected with DAP12 into 293T cells and expression analyzed by anti-FLAG immunoblot. Samples were prepared by suspending cells in reducing SDS loading buffer and boiling for no more than 5 min. We observe SDS-resistant aggregate bands for the NHD variants, which\u00a0were\u00a0largely absent in WT and AD risk variants. The T96K variant shows some light aggregation, consistent with the slight shift (~5\u00b0C) in denaturation temperature for that variant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

(<b>i</b>) TREM2 signaling analyzed by phosphor-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 immunoblot in RAW264.7 macrophage cells transfected with WT or variant FLAG-TREM2. (RAW264.7 cells express endogenous DAP12.) 24 hr post-transfection, cells were stimulated with anti-FLAG antibody (1:100) for the indicated length of time. ERK/pERK content was assessed by immunoblot. In these cells, we observe pERK at 10 min post-stimulation. However, only WT sustained signaling 30 min post-stimulation.

                                "text": "Given that our structural analysis suggested that the TREM2 NHD mutants should be misfolded, we were surprised to observe that these ectodomains bypassed cellular quality control and were secreted. We therefore devised an assay\u00a0using flow cytometry to investigate whether these point mutants in full-length TREM2 impair cell surface expression. DAP12 was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged WT or mutant TREM2 full-length proteins and surface expression was measured either by an anti-FLAG antibody or by\u00a0anti-TREM2 sera raised against our secreted, folded protein. Whole-cell expression levels of the TREM2\u00a0NHD mutants were slightly higher than\u00a0those\u00a0of WT or AD risk variant TREM2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). However, as predicted by our structural analysis, anti-TREM2 staining was decreased for the NHD mutants Y38C, T66M, and V126G, but not for\u00a0the AD risk variants R47H, R62H, N68K, D87N, and T96K (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Similar observations were made using a commercial anti-TREM2 antibody (R&amp;D;, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). By contrast, the anti-FLAG antibody showed surface expression for all TREM2 mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). We next examined cells expressing TREM2 WT, NHD mutant Y38C, and AD risk variant R47H by immuofluorescence confocal microscopy in the presence or absence of permeabilization. We found that\u00a0the surface expression pattern in non-permeabilized cells was similar for all cell\u00a0types, whereas in permeabilized cells, the NHD mutant Y38C displayed diffuse intracellular accumulation, in comparison to WT and R47H which displayed a distinct punctate staining pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that NHD mutant\u00a0proteins do retain some level of surface expression; but\u00a0the protein is misfolded or aggregated and thus is not recognized by conformation-specific TREM2 antibodies. Consistent with these observations, we found significant amounts of SDS-resistant aggregates by anti-FLAG immunoblotting when expressing the full-length TREM2 NHD mutants in 293T cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a>). Finally, we evaluated how these different classes of mutations impact TREM2 signaling by crosslinking the different versions of FLAG-TREM2 using anti-FLAG antibody. Consistent with our observation of FLAG-TREM2 on the cell surface for all the variant\u00a0proteins, we found that while both the Y38C and R47H variants have some signaling potential, as assessed by phosphorylated-ERK blotting in RAW264.7 and Cos-7 cells, neither of\u00a0these\u00a0variants sustains signaling as efficiently as WT TREM2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i,j</a>). The loss of sustained signaling by the disease variants may suggest\u00a0that these mutant\u00a0proteins have aberrant folding kinetics (and thus are replenished more\u00a0slowly\u00a0at the surface than WT\u00a0proteins) or cannot bind co-factors that may be required to sustain signaling. Altogether, these experiments demonstrate\u00a0that\u00a0the buried residue\u00a0changes linked to NHD cause misfolding and aggregation, with variable impact on surface expression, as would be suggested by our structural analysis."

First, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to analyze whether AD-linked variants induced large conformational changes in the TREM2 ectodomain. For these experiments, we chose to analyze the R47H and R62H mutations, as they represent the most significant TREM2 risk factors identified to date, as well as the T96K mutation, which is a sporadically occurring mutation that is not significantly associated with AD. In order to evaluate whether the point mutations induced conformational changes, we collected CD spectra on the proteins, analyzed for large changes, and compared the ratio in minima at 214 nm (due to \u03b2 sheets) to minima at 233 nm (due to tryptophans), which are characteristic features of the CD spectra for Ig folds (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sikkink and Ramirez-Alvarado, 2008</a>). We found that R62H and T96K displayed CD spectra similar to WT\u00a0proteins while, surprisingly, R47H showed a subtle, yet statistically significant difference in the 214 nm/233 nm ratio (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a and b</a>).

Each surface variant produced slightly lower denaturation temperatures, with R47H and R62H marginally reduced when compared to WT proteins and T96K having the lowest denaturation temperatures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). As a control, the same experiments were carried out in the presence of 1 mM DTT, which induced the expected shift to lower denaturation temperatures by\u00a0disrupting\u00a0the disulfide bonds. We also used thermal denaturation CD to assess the thermal stability of these proteins. By obtaining full CD scans at 5\u00b0C increments, we observed\u00a0that\u00a0TREM2 has a denaturation transition at 225 nm, consistent with other Ig domains (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sikkink and Ramirez-Alvarado, 2008</a>), and this wavelength was monitored in subsequent denaturation experiments (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). WT TREM2\u00a0and all the TREM2\u00a0variants tested showed reversible thermal denaturation as they reacquired their native spectra rapidly after cooling from 90\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C, but their ability to refold was ablated in the presence of DTT (not shown). In contrast to DSF measurements, thermal denaturation by CD did not show a difference between WT, R47H, and R62H\u00a0proteins; however, the T96K variant has a pronounced shift towards lower denaturation temperature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). In the presence of DTT, all proteins had lower denaturation temperatures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). We further assayed stability using chemical denaturation by titration of guanidine-HCl (GuHCl) in CD experiments. The R47H and R62H proteins melt at slightly lower GuHCl concentrations than the\u00a0WT protein,\u00a0while the T96K variant unfolds at lower GuHCl concentrations than R47H and R62H, consistent with the thermal melt experiments (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Thus, as predicted by our structural analysis, the AD-risk surface variants do not induce large conformational changes in TREM2, nor do they dramatically impact protein stability, but\u00a0they can induce subtle changes in both parameters."

                                "text": "Our structural analysis suggested that\u00a0AD risk variants might impact function by altering ligand binding due to the surface presentation of the\u00a0mutated residues. Recently, TREM2 was shown to signal following stimulation of reporter cells by plated phospholipids, and the R47H mutation resulted in loss of signaling (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). To test the direct binding of TREM2 to phospholipids in a cell-free system, we used purified protein in solid-state ELISA and liposome sedimentation assays. Consistent with the results of previous work (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cannon et al., 2012</a>), we detected TREM2 binding to phospholipids by both ELISA and liposome sedimentation. However, we did not observe differences in phospholipid discrimination or in direct lipid binding between WT and AD variant TREM2 ectodomains (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a>). We therefore investigated binding to a cell surface ligand (TREM2-L). Although no endogenous protein ligand for TREM2 has yet been identified, several cell types have been reported to express a ligand on the basis of staining with a TREM2-Fc fusion construct (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ito and Hamerman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hamerman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Daws et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hsieh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stefano et al., 2009</a>). In order to evaluate the effect of AD-linked mutations on TREM2 binding to TREM2-L, we constructed a novel TREM2 protein cell-binding reagent containing a site-specific BirA-biotinylation sequence on the C-terminus of TREM2, which could then be complexed with PE-labeled streptavidin to create a tetrameric cell-staining reagent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). In initial experiments, we found that both human and mouse TREM2/SA-PE tetramers were able to bind Neuro2A (N2A) and THP-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013d,f,g</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2a,c</a>). To validate the specificity of our reagent, we cultured THP-1 cells with various immune stimuli and found that overnight treatment with PMA/ionomycin dramatically decreased binding of\u00a0TREM2/SA-PE tetramers to THP-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b and c</a>), while the myeloid cell marker CD45 remained unchanged (not shown). Other stimuli tested (overnight exposure to IL-13, Poly I:C, LPS, or M-CSF) did not alter staining (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). PMA/ionomycin treatment is the first identified stimulus that ablates TREM2 staining, and this confirms that TREM2 recognizes a specific cell-surface ligand."

                                "text": "We next sought to interrogate the endogenous target recognized by TREM2 on the cell surface, and found that TREM2\u00a0binding is sensitive to proteinase treatment of cells prior to incubation with our staining reagent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). Treatment with proteinase K abolished binding while the more specific proteases chymotrypsin and elastase had an intermediate effect. Proteinase K treatment did not affect cell viability, which was\u00a0&gt;99% by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2f</a>). This demonstrates that TREM2-L contains a protein component. In addition, given the high pI of TREM2, and the frequent reports of anionic potential ligands for TREM2, we reasoned that proteoglycans containing highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may facilitate cell-surface binding. We tested binding to wild-type CHO-K1 cells, which express heparan and chondroitin sulfates, and\u00a0to\u00a0CHO-745 cells, which are deficient in GAG maturation and surface expression (<a href=\"#bib12\">Esko et al., 1985</a>). In this experiment, GAG-dependent cell binding of the TREM2 tetramer was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). Next, we used heparinases (which also cleave heparan sulfates) and chondroitinase ABC to ask whether TREM2 selectively binds either type of GAG. In CHO (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), THP-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>) and N2A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>) cells, treatment with heparinases had a pronounced effect on cell surface binding while chondroitinase only slightly diminished binding, together implicating GAGs, specifically heparin sulfate, as a major component of the cell surface TREM2-L."

For these experiments, we chose to compare WT TREM2, the validated TREM2 AD risk variants (R47H\u00a0and\u00a0R62H), and the possibly protective AD risk variant (T96K). We utilized anti-6H detection of purified monomeric hTREM2 ectodomains bound to THP-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4j,k,\u00a0and\u00a0l</a>), tetramer staining of WT and variant mTREM2 binding to N2A and THP-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2c,d</a>), and competition assays in\u00a0which SEC-purified monomers competed with SA-PE-labeled WT tetramers (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2e</a>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the AD-linked variant R47H displayed markedly diminished binding to N2A and THP-1 cells. In stark contrast, the potentially AD-protective T96K variant significantly increased binding. The R62H variant reduced binding\u00a0as\u00a0measured in the anti-6H format, but the reduction in binding was less dramatic\u00a0when\u00a0measured by competition or tetramer staining, suggesting an intermediate decrease in affinity. Thus, as suggested by our structural analysis, the AD risk variant R47H TREM2 negatively impacts binding to cell surface TREM2-L, whereas the variant T96K results in increased cellular binding. These data, together with our direct phospholipid binding experiments, suggest\u00a0that\u00a0TREM2 AD-risk variants retain phospholipid binding, and instead impact binding to cell surface GAGs. As the R47H risk variant is able to bind phospholipids\u00a0directly, but does not signal in cellular assays of TREM2 signaling triggered by plated phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), we suggest that TREM2 interaction with GAGs in cis is likely required to orient or cluster TREM2 to mediate signaling upon stimulation by phospholipids. Alternatively, phospholipids may function to orient TREM2 on the cell surface for proper presentation to GAGs and/or additional as of yet undefined protein surface receptors."

We returned to analysis of our crystal structure in order to interpret these observations. Upon mapping the electrostatic surface of hTREM2, we noticed a large basic surface that was not present on the surface of other TREM family receptors for which coordinates are available (mTREM1, PDB 1 U9K, [<a href=\"#bib27\">Kelker et al., 2004a</a>]; hTREM1, PDB 1SMO, [<a href=\"#bib28\">Kelker et al., 2004b</a>]; and TLT-1, PDB 2FRG [<a href=\"#bib13\">Gattis et al., 2006</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,b and d\u2013f</a>). Furthermore, sequence analysis shows that the residues constituting this basic patch are highly conserved within TREM2, but not within the rest of the TREM family, suggesting that\u00a0this interface has evolved specifically toward a role in TREM2 function (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). To demonstrate this, we prepared staining tetramers for other TREM-like family members with similar overall high pI values calculated for the ectodomain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>). Consistent with our hypothesis, TREM2 ectodomain tetramers bound to N2A cells, while tetramers of ectodomains from TREM-like 2 (TREML2) and TREM-like 4 (TREML4) did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i</a>). This cluster of residues contains most of the AD-linked surface mutations (including R47H and R62H). Additionally, the T96K mutation is located adjacent to this basic patch and would therefore extend it, providing a structural explanation for the gain of function observed with this variant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). To test whether additional basic residues located within this surface <strike>i</strike>nfluence TREM2-L binding, we selected two other basic residues that\u00a0are\u00a0conserved only in TREM2 (R76 and R77), and assayed the ability of these variants to bind TREM2-L using our flow cytometry assay. We found that both a R76D and a R77D mutation decreased binding to TREM2-L on THP-1 cells in a manner similar to the validated AD risk variants (R47H and R62H) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5g</a>). Together, the data indicate that this surface represents a conserved functional interface on TREM2 that participates in cell-surface ligand binding and that this surface is unique to TREM2 within the TREM family."

Our studies indicate, as presaged by our crystal structure, that NHD-linked mutant\u00a0residues are buried and impact protein folding and stability, while AD-linked variant\u00a0residues are on the protein surface and do not diminish the stability or surface expression of the molecule but instead impact ligand engagement (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Several variants have been reported for TREM2, but some are very rare, so it is not\u00a0clear whether they associate with AD risk.\u00a0The structure-based studies presented\u00a0here provide a framework with which one could make predictions as to the\u00a0variant's\u00a0impact on function. Our observation of detectable misfolded cell-surface TREM2 NHD mutant proteins was surprising, given that one would expect that\u00a0the cellular quality-control machinery should degrade misfolded proteins and prevent their surface expression. In addition, previous reports noted decreased surface expression for these mutants (<a href=\"#bib44\">Park et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kleinberger et al., 2014</a>). Here, we used an approach that probes surface expression using both non-conformational (anti-FLAG) and conformational (anti-hTREM2) antibodies. We found\u00a0that both the NHD-associated and AD-linked mutant\u00a0proteins reach the cell surface, however the NHD-associated TREM2 mutants are probably not functional as they are either misfolded or aggregated, and thus are not recognized by the conformational-dependent antibodies. These results are supported by our analysis of the solution behavior of theTREM2 ectodomains of these mutant proteins. An alternative explanation could be that the FLAG tag or overexpression drives the surface expression of these mutated\u00a0proteins; but\u00a0we do not think that is the case since we found that the TREM2 ectodomains carrying these mutations (which contain a different tag that is on the opposite terminus) were also secreted. These findings are of potential therapeutic value, as the discovery of molecular chaperones that rescue the\u00a0folding of\u00a0and restore function to these mutants could be pursued for patient-specific NHD treatments."

However, it should be noted that the R47H mutation does induce a subtle change in secondary structure detectable by CD. The AD mutations probably alter TREM2 function by impairing ligand binding. Recent studies in AD mouse models that\u00a0are\u00a0deficient in <i>TREM2</i> confirm that loss of TREM2 function contributes to classic AD pathology and suggest a crucial role for TREM2 in microglia function (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jay et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ulrich et al., 2014</a>). <i>TREM2</i>-deficient AD mice display fewer activated microglia, and the absence of <i>TREM2</i> prevents microglia proliferation and promotes microglia apoptosis, which is correlated with increased accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jay et al., 2015</a>). Microglia in <i>TREM2</i>-deficient AD mice display less activation and do not engulf A\u03b2 plaques, which reduces the density of A\u03b2 plaques and promotes diffuse A\u03b2 structures, which, in turn, are more neurotoxic\u00a0and contribute to the accumulation of classic AD pathology (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yuan et al., 2016</a>). These models suggest a crucial role for TREM2 in microglia biology and in the turnover of A\u03b2. On the basis of the conserved nature of AD-linked basic surface residues and our analysis of cell-surface ligand binding for multiple cell lines, we favor the concept that AD risk variants lead to impaired binding of TREM2-L, which in turn perturbs microglia function."

The many diverse ligands reported for TREM2 may in fact suggest that\u00a0TREM2 is capable of recognizing multiple ligands and that under different conditions, their respective affinities might tune signaling accordingly. For example, low-affinity ligands may induce a tonic inhibitory signal while ligation of a high-affinity ligand could result in an activating response. Indeed, anionic bacterial carbohydrates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daws et al., 2003</a>), phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), myelin lipids (<a href=\"#bib47\">Poliani et al., 2015</a>), and even purified DNA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawabori et al., 2015</a>) all activate TREM2 reporter cell lines. This is not surprising in light of our crystal structure, which reveals an extended basic patch on the surface of TREM2 that would be capable of forming electrostatic interactions with these anionic ligands. In contrast to highly selective phospholipid binding by other Ig domains (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kobayashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Miyanishi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Santiago et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Simhadri et al., 2012</a>), purified TREM2 shows only broad discrimination for anionic (PA, PG, PI, PS) over more neutral (PC, PE) lipids (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a,b and c</a>). Structurally, Ig domains with selective lipid binding feature a canonical FG loop motif that\u00a0contains large hydrophobic residues, absent in TREM2, which mediate membrane insertion and acyl chain binding (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tietjen et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d,e</a>). Moreover, while TREM2 does share a conserved aspartic acid residue from this motif, which chelates a required Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion for the TIM and CD300a proteins, TREM2-lipid binding is not sensitive to EDTA, unlike TIM and CD300 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1e and f</a>). Thus, while we do observe direct binding of TREM2 to phospholipids, it does not appear that TREM2 binds phospholipids with high selectivity or using the same binding mode as other phospholipid-binding Ig domains. By contrast, it should be noted that there is a long and narrow hydrophobic patch on the end of TREM2 most distal from the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that is the most likely lipid-binding surface. Interestingly this patch is adjacent to the basic patch, which could mediate interaction with anionic phospholipid head groups (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). These hypotheses will need to be tested in future studies using sensitive binding assays (such as surface plasmon resonance) and crystallographic studies of TREM2-phospholipid recognition. In contrast to recent studies employing reporter cells expressing TREM2 R47H (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), we did not observe any large differences in binding to phospholipids for any of the validated TREM2 AD risk variants. In light of our experimental observations, we believe this is best explained by the hypothesis that another interaction (such as TREM2 binding to GAGs, which we show here is impacted by these AD risk variants) is required to mediate phospholipid signaling; thus in the context of cellular experiments, TREM2 R47H shows diminished signaling, while in direct lipid-binding assays it performs in the same way as WT TREM2. This is potentially supported by a recent report that TREM2 binds to isolated PS, but does not bind apoptotic Jurkat T cells, which present PS on their cell surface but may also be deficient in GAGs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bailey et al., 2015</a>). The results presented here suggest that the point mutations in <i>TREM2</i> participate in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis through distinct molecular mechanisms."

                        "text": "We found that the validated AD risk variants in TREM2 impact binding to a cell-surface ligand (TREM2-L). This ligand does appear to contain a protein component, as pre-treatment of cells with proteases decreases or prevents the binding of TREM2 to these cells. This interaction also appears to be highly GAG-mediated, as TREM2 cell-staining tetramers do not bind CHO 745 cells, which do not express GAGs.\u00a0This\u00a0interaction seems most dependent on heparan sulfate, as treatment with heparin sulfatases remove much of the observed binding. As the AD risk variants most notably impact binding to TREM2-L, we reason that this interaction is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. In support of this, we find that the mutations R47H and perhaps R62H deleteriously impact TREM2-L recognition. By contrast, T96K appears to be a potential gain-of-function mutation in our binding experiments. Interestingly, this mutation appears at a much higher frequency than R47H and R62H, and in some studies it has been reported to be enriched in European-American AD cases compared to controls; overall it is associated with a decreased odds ratio for the development of late-onset AD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), again suggesting the TREM2-L binding function is coupled to AD risk. Altogether, the structural and functional analysis of these variants illuminates a surface epitope that is specific to TREM2,\u00a0that\u00a0is not conserved among the other members of the TREM family, and that mediates binding to a cell-surface ligand. Additional point mutations localized to that surface also resulted in loss of binding, supporting this functional role. Our results suggest\u00a0that this ligand may have a specific protein component in addition to GAGs. On that note, while this manuscript was in preparation, it was reported that TREM2 binds lipid-loaded ApoE and that this interaction facilitates uptake of A\u03b2 loaded into lipoparticles by microglia (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yeh et al., 2016</a>). This\u00a0report also suggests that TREM2 AD risk variants decrease binding to ApoE, but binding\u00a0affinities were not quantitated. However, we do not suspect that ApoE is the protein component of cell surface TREM2-L\u00a0because it is a soluble rather than a\u00a0surface-bound protein. Our study demonstrates that TREM2 can specifically bind GAGs, utilizing the basic patch; other TREM-like proteins with the same overall calculated pI, but lacking the basic patch residues, do not bind GAGs. We also demonstrate that TREM2 AD risk variants affect binding to GAGs. Future studies will need to focus on how TREM2 binding to GAGs and ApoE are coordinated and how they impact TREM2 function in microglia."

                        "text": "Our results illustrate two distinct paths to loss-of-function in TREM2, so how might these different mechanisms result in either AD or NHD? In attempting to explain this, it is important to take into account genetics-based dosage affects (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). In NHD, the\u00a0mutations are homozygous and the TREM2 is either deleted or misfolded, leading to a complete loss of function, and more serious and early-onset neurodegenerative disease. In AD, the mutations are heterozygous and impair function (but do not completely abolish it), leading to less severe and late onset neurodegenerative disease. Under this hypothesis, it should be possible that a heterozygous NHD mutant would give increased risk for AD. Consistent with this, there have been reports of rare AD cases containing heterozygous NHD variants, including Q33X, Y38C, and T66M (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guerreiro et al., 2013b</a>). In addition, TREM2 may function not only as a receptor but also\u00a0as a signaling molecule as it can be cleaved. We have recently shown that\u00a0the soluble TREM2 may be a survival signal in bone-marrow macrophages (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, we have observed that the absence of <i>TREM2</i> in an AD mouse model prevents microglia proliferation and promotes microglia apoptosis, suggesting that soluble TREM2 could play a similar role in the CNS (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Accordingly, soluble TREM2 can be detected in the CNS, and we have shown that some AD risk variants, but not the NHD mutant\u00a0proteins are readily detected in the CSF of patients (<a href=\"#bib46\">Piccio et al., 2016</a>). Because the AD risk variant proteins are expressed and stable enough to be soluble factors, they may retain some signaling ability and prevent more serious diseases. These hypotheses will require animal knock-in studies for\u00a0full\u00a0evaluation. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of all TREM2 variants will be essential to understanding TREM2 function in both\u00a0neurodegenerative diseases and other inflammatory diseases, and to design targeted therapies accordingly."

A molecular replacement solution was found with PHASER using mouse TREM-1 ectodomain (1 U9K) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kelker et al., 2004a</a>) as the probe, locating two molecules in the asymmetric unit (ASU). Data were initially scaled and processed at 3.3 \u00c5 using HKL2000 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</a>). The initial model was substantially improved by iterative rounds of manual rebuilding in COOT (<a href=\"#bib11\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and refinement using Phenix (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). Next, resolution was extended using the method described by Karplus and Diederichs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Karplus and Diederichs, 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The 3.3 \u00c5 model was used as a molecular replacement probe on data scaled to 3.4 \u00c5 and 3.3 \u00c5, and subsequently subjected to automated refinement in Phenix without manual intervention. The 3.3 \u00c5 solution was then used to calculate Rfree and Rwork at 3.4 \u00c5. Rfree was lower at 3.4 \u00c5 using the model refined at 3.3 \u00c5 compared to the model refined at 3.4 \u00c5, providing\u00a0evidence that 3.3 \u00c5 data improved the model. Similarly, data were again extended to 3.2 \u00c5 and finally 3.1 \u00c5. Data past 3.1 \u00c5 did not improve the model as determined by an increased Rfree calculated at 3.1 \u00c5 using the model refined on 3.0 \u00c5 data. Final model refinement occurred by iterative building and refinement in Phenix. NCS and secondary structure restraints were used during refinement, and TLS refinement of B-factors was applied in later rounds. The structure is complete with only one N-terminal residue and four C-terminal residues not visible in the electron density (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Ramachandran statistics are 97.7% favored, 0% outliers, 2.3% allowed. Molprobity score was 1.66 (100th percentile) and clashscore was 9.62 (96th percentile) for the final model."

The bottom line from these studies is the AD associated variants are on the surface of the ectodomain and probably regulate binding of ligands and the PLOSL/NH variants are buried and probably affect folding and maturation as previously discussed. The structural studies appear to be of high quality. However, the other experiments are not optimally or poorly performed, poorly presented, and often over-interpreted, or misinterpreted. The overall recommendation is to re-perform experiments to bring them up to publication quality (e.g., cleanly interpretable gels and analytical SEC traces) or include proper controls, eliminate redundant or irreproducible results, and eliminate unneeded results, as detailed below."

Often the authors refer to an experiment with this domain and then quickly move on to the full-length protein and one has to pay close attention to figure out which was being used. For the reader it would be useful to call the secreted domains something other than TRME 2 Ig which sounds like an immunoglobulin fusion.

Indeed, some of the same mutations that cause NHL in their homozygous form lead to AD in the heterozygous form. While the authors do provide convincing evidence that the NHL and AD mutations are located in different parts of the 3D structure of the protein, they seem to ignore the obvious dosage effect. (It is discussed briefly in the last paragraph, but this is far too important an effect to be dismissed lightly). If the \"internal\" NHL mutations result in decreased protein stability and these NHL patients are homozygous, does this not just kill the level of the protein in the cell. That by extension would of course decrease the binding properties of TREM2, which is the same effect as seen by the AD mutations. It's more pronounced in NHL, but it is fundamentally the same effect. Under this paradigm, both mutations do the identical thing (diminish key TREM2 function) but in different ways. Again, it is the genetic dosage that is driving the severity and decides if the patient will develop NHL or AD. The authors are encouraged to discuss these points."

TREML2 and TREML4 are both in the TREM family, and are predicted to have the same fold, and in addition, their ectodomains are highly basic (as denoted by the high calculated \u03c0 values [with the exception of mTREML4]). However, by structure-based sequence analysis, these proteins would not contain the basic patch residues conserved only in TREM2. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>, these ectodomains (TREML2 and TREML4) do not bind to N2A cells, whereas TREM2 robustly binds these cells."

These effects are even more pronounced when a lower-affinity reagent (as compared to an antibody) is used. In all of our cell-based binding studies, we have taken care to run all of the comparative experiments with the same batches (passages) of cells. In addition, all of these experiments were run at least three times each. The general binding trends were always the same. Finally, we did the experiments comparing the TREM2 AD risk variants (R47H, R62H, and T96K) in three different orientations, i.e. as TREM2/SA-PE tetramers directly binding cells, as TREM2 monomers directly binding cells, and finally monomeric WT TREM2 and monomeric TREM2 risk variants competing for binding with WT TREM2/SA-PE tetramers). We obtained the same trend regardless of the orientation of the experiments. So, we feel that these experiments have been carried out quite exhaustively and are entirely reproducible."

Indeed, some of the same mutations that cause NHL in their homozygous form lead to AD in the heterozygous form. While the authors do provide convincing evidence that the NHL and AD mutations are located in different parts of the 3D structure of the protein, they seem to ignore the obvious dosage effect. (It is discussed briefly in the last paragraph, but this is far too important an effect to be dismissed lightly). If the \"internal\" NHL mutations result in decreased protein stability and these NHL patients are homozygous, does this not just kill the level of the protein in the cell. That by extension would of course decrease the binding properties of TREM2, which is the same effect as seen by the AD mutations. It's more pronounced in NHL, but it is fundamentally the same effect. Under this paradigm, both mutations do the identical thing (diminish key TREM2 function) but in different ways. Again, it is the genetic dosage that is driving the severity and decides if the patient will develop NHL or AD. The authors are encouraged to discuss these points.</i> "

In all of these cases, the binding of ligand to isolated receptor ectodomains validated cellular experiments utilizing the full protein. In our case, TREM2 consists of a single Ig domain which is connected to the transmembrane domain by a long (40 a.a.) linker which is likely unstructured. Furthermore, TREM2 is presented on the cell surface as a 1:2 complex with DAP12 dimer (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This has been established by Kai Wucherpfenning\u2019s group (Feng et al., PLOS Biol 2006; Call et al., Nat Immunol 2010). Thus, the current literature would suggest that TREM2 is expressed on the cell surface as in a 1:2 ratio with DAP12, with the single Ig domain tethered to the surface by a long, unstructured linker. Studies of the isolated Ig domains are extremely valid in this case."

Since <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> is cropped, we include below a scan of the full western blot, so you can see that there is only a single band observed for each of the TREM2 WT, NHD mutants, and AD risk variants. In addition, if boiling induced aggregation, we would expect to observe it nearly equally for WT and all variants. Taken altogether, we do not believe that boiling induces aggregation in the TREM2 proteins we analyze here. Instead, we believe that the aggregation we observe in these western blots shows in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> are indicative of misfolding and covalent oligomers (formed by aberrant intermolecular disulfides) for the NHD mutants, which is consistent with our other data.
