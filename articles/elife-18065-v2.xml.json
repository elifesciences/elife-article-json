                    "text": "Many neurodegenerative diseases are linked to amyloid aggregation. In Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), neurotoxicity correlates with an increased aggregation propensity of a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in exon 1 of mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt). Here we establish how the domains flanking the polyQ tract shape the mHtt conformational landscape in vitro and in neurons. In vitro, the flanking domains have opposing effects on the conformation and stabilities of oligomers and amyloid fibrils. The N-terminal N17 promotes amyloid fibril formation, while the C-terminal Proline Rich Domain destabilizes fibrils and enhances oligomer formation. However, in neurons both domains act synergistically to engage protective chaperone and degradation pathways promoting mHtt proteostasis. Surprisingly, when proteotoxicity was assessed in rat corticostriatal brain slices, either flanking region alone sufficed to generate a neurotoxic conformation, while the polyQ tract alone exhibited minimal toxicity. Linking mHtt structural properties to its neuronal proteostasis should inform new strategies for neuroprotection in polyQ-expansion diseases."

In Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), neurotoxicity correlates with an increased aggregation propensity of a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in exon 1 of mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt). Here we establish how the domains flanking the polyQ tract shape the mHtt conformational landscape in vitro and in neurons. In vitro, the flanking domains have opposing effects on the conformation and stabilities of oligomers and amyloid fibrils. The N-terminal N17 promotes amyloid fibril formation, while the C-terminal Proline Rich Domain destabilizes fibrils and enhances oligomer formation. However, in neurons both domains act synergistically to engage protective chaperone and degradation pathways promoting mHtt proteostasis. Surprisingly, when proteotoxicity was assessed in rat corticostriatal brain slices, either flanking region alone sufficed to generate a neurotoxic conformation, while the polyQ tract alone exhibited minimal toxicity. Linking mHtt structural properties to its neuronal proteostasis should inform new strategies for neuroprotection in polyQ-expansion diseases."

The misshapen proteins form as a result of specific mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called huntingtin. These mutations result in a region of the protein called the polyQ tract being longer than normal. Other regions of huntingtin that are near to the polyQ tract can dramatically change the behavior of the mutant protein.

HD arises from mutations in Huntingtin (Htt) that expand a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG repeat in exon 1 above a threshold length of 35 Qs (<a href=\"#bib55\">MacDonald, 1993</a>). The length of the polyQ tract correlates with both disease severity and propensity to form amyloid aggregates (<a href=\"#bib79\">Scherzinger et al., 1999</a>). A link between neuronal toxicity and amyloid aggregation is further supported by post-mortem analyses of HD brains, which contain amyloid aggregates formed primarily by N-terminal exon 1 truncations of Htt (<a href=\"#bib26\">Difiglia, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Landles et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mangiarini et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Ross and Poirier, 2004</a>). Such N-terminal fragments may arise from aberrant splicing at the Htt exon 1 junction or from caspase cleavage (<a href=\"#bib78\">Sathasivam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Wellington et al., 2002</a>). Importantly, mutant Htt exon 1 carrying a polyQ expansion (herein 'mHtt-Ex1') suffices to cause HD-like disease in animal models (<a href=\"#bib31\">Goldberg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sathasivam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Wellington et al., 2002</a>) and is thus widely used as a relevant model for HD biology and pathology."

One model proposes that amyloid aggregates are toxic because they sequester and deplete essential cellular proteins such as transcription factors or molecular chaperones (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kirstein-Miles et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Olzscha et al., 2011</a>). However, a number of findings question the causal relationship between mHtt amyloid aggregates and toxicity. For instance, the medium spiny striatal neurons more vulnerable to HD toxicity show few to no aggregates in HD patient brains. In contrast, less affected neuronal cell-types contain many aggregates (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kuemmerle et al., 1999</a>). In addition, while transgenic mHtt-Ex1 is neurotoxic in mice, a longer N-terminal mHtt fragment encompassing exons 1 and 2 forms many aggregates in transgenic mice but exhibits no neuronal dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib82\">Slow et al., 2005</a>). Finally, longitudinal survival studies of primary neurons expressing fluorescently-tagged mHtt-Ex1 demonstrated that the\u00a0formation of an amyloid inclusion correlated with neuronal survival (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arrasate et al., 2004</a>). Since fluorescence and EM imaging studies have suggested that mHtt can be sequestered in different types of cellular inclusions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Caron et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nekooki-Machida et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sahl et al., 2016</a>) one possible explanation for these observations is that only some inclusions are toxic, while others are protective."

Biophysical studies indicate that amyloidogenic proteins, including mHtt, not only form amyloid fibrils but also populate an array of ill-defined soluble, oligomeric conformations. Studies with conformationally-sensitive antibodies indicate that these states are conformationally highly heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib28\">Duim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kayed and Glabe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nucifora et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Sontag et al., 2012</a>). The transient and structurally diverse nature of these soluble species has hindered their characterization; accordingly, the nature and determinants involved in the formation of these oligomeric mHtt species remain elusive. It remains imperative to clarify the mHtt conformational landscape and link the various species \u2013 aggregates, oligomers, or even aberrant monomers \u2013 to proteotoxicity. We also must understand how various mHtt species engage the cellular protein homeostasis (or 'proteostasis') pathways that clear aberrant and aggregation-prone conformations (<a href=\"#bib58\">Martinez-Vicente et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Ravikumar et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Rui et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</a>). mHtt interactions with the chaperones and degradation pathways that handle misfolded proteins in the cell (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balch et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hartl et al., 2011</a>) are likely key determinants of the cellular balance of toxic and non-toxic conformers."

Importantly, we link the mHtt conformational ensemble to mHtt proteostasis and toxicity in cultured neurons and brain slices. Biophysical and structural analyses demonstrate that N17 and PRD have opposing effects on the energetic barriers dictating the formation of aggregates and oligomers by mHtt both in vivo and in vitro. This interplay between N17 and PRD determines the formation of toxic mHtt conformations and their interaction with cellular proteostasis pathways. One corollary of our data is that neuronal mHtt toxicity cannot be explained by a simple model whereby amyloid fibrils or oligomers are toxic, but rather one that points to specific toxic conformational sub-populations. Our work linking the mHtt conformational landscape with neuronal proteostasis and toxicity informs rational avenues to leverage the roles of the polyQ flanking regions for HD therapeutics."

Consistent with previous reports, deletion of N17 reduces the rate and yield of amyloid formation and aggregation, while deletion of the PRD domain enhances formation of amyloids and aggregates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crick et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tam et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Thakur et al., 2009</a>). \u2206N\u2206P exhibited a complex, combined behavior of both N17 and PRD deletions. Similar to \u2206P, the \u2206N\u2206P mutant displayed enhanced aggregation rates measured in the filter trap assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). On the other hand, similar to \u2206N, \u2206N\u2206P had very slow kinetics of amyloid formation as measured by the ThioflavinT assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Indeed, fitting the normalized ThioflavinT amyloid formation kinetics to the Finke-Watzky kinetic model (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Morris et al., 2009</a>) showed that the elongation rate <b><i>v</i></b> for amyloid formation and half-time to saturation of amyloid formation <b>t<sub>1/2</sub></b> for mHtt variants lacking N17 (\u2206N and \u2206N\u2206P) were much slower than those for mHtt variants containing N17 (Ex1 and \u2206P) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We conclude that the presence of a PRD disfavors formation of large, SDS-insoluble aggregates while N17 exerts a dominant effect to promote the ThioflavinT-reactive, amyloid conformation."

Formation of GFP-inclusions provided a read-out for the aggregation propensity of the mHtt variants in vivo. As observed in vitro,\u00a0deleting N17 reduced the formation of visible inclusions in vivo, while deleting PRD enhanced the formation of aggregates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013F</a>). Notably, few aggregates were visible in the \u2206N\u2206P expressing cells, despite rapid formation of insoluble aggregates in vitro. Given the slow kinetics of amyloid aggregation by \u2206N\u2206P in vitro, it is possible that in the absence of the N17 and PRD flanking regions, the polyQ tract does not efficiently generate amyloidogenic fibrils but instead forms non-amyloidogenic aggregates that are less stable in vivo (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crick et al., 2013</a>). We conclude that N17 and PRD have opposing effects of on amyloid formation and aggregation in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and further suggest that the cellular environment destabilizes the non-amyloid aggregates generated by the polyQ tract in \u2206N\u2206P."

                                "text": "Next, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to gain a structural understanding of how N17 and PRD impact the formation of mHtt amyloid fibrils. mHtt-Ex1 fibrils have a characteristic architecture, in which frayed fibril ends branch out from a bundled central core (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bugg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Darrow et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Shahmoradian et al., 2013</a>). For the \u2206N mHtt variant, we observed dramatically fewer fibrils, consistent with its lower amyloid aggregation propensity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In addition, the fibrils formed by \u2206N had a strikingly distinct morphology, which lacked the bundled architecture of Ex1 fibrils and were much thinner and straighter (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Allowing \u2206N aggregation to reach saturation by prolonged incubation increased the number of fibrils but did not change their thin morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, the thin fibril structure of \u2206N aggregates is intrinsic to the mutation. In contrast, \u2206P formed many large, densely packed aggregates with individual fibrils arranged in parallel bundles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with its increased aggregation propensity. As observed for kinetic measurements, the morphology of \u2206N\u2206P aggregates combined properties from both the \u2206N and \u2206P fibrils. Similar to \u2206N fibrils, the \u2206N\u2206P fibrils were shorter, thinner and lacked the frayed fibril ends observed for Ex1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); similar to \u2206P fibrils, \u2206N\u2206P aggregates consisted of more densely packed fibrils (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Quantification of at least 10 individual micrographs for each fibril variant supported these observations, indicating that \u2206N fibrils were only several nanometers in width, whereas Ex1 and \u2206P fibrils were on average almost a micron wide and over a micron long (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We conclude that N17 and PRD have independent and dramatic effects on the amyloid formation propensity of the polyQ tract and its fibrillar structure. N17 promotes amyloid formation but also enhances interfibrillar contacts, thereby driving the bundling of individual fibrils observed for Ex1 and \u2206P (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, PRD appears to destabilize lateral contacts among fibrils and thus prevents their dense packing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The combined effects of N17 and PRD in Ex1 lead to the characteristic mHtt structure consisting of fibril bundles with frayed ends (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). When N17 is absent, PRD leads to thin sparse fibrils observed for \u2206N; while when PRD is absent, N17 leads to thick, bundled aggregates as observed for \u2206P (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

For prions, distinct fibrillar amyloid stability is a hallmark of different prion strains (<a href=\"#bib89\">Tanaka et al., 2006</a>) as their reduced stability (or increased 'frangibility') is directly linked to their propensity for intercellular transmission (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cushman et al., 2010</a>).

Cryo-EM imaging confirmed and extended these observations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The sonicated seeds of Ex1 and \u2206N were small structures only one or two fibrils in width, while the sonication products of \u2206P and \u2206N\u2206P were large, thick, and densely-packed bundles of fibers. Of note, the presence or absence of N17 had no significant impact on the size of the fragmented species, indicating that while N17 contributes to the formation of these fibrils, it does not contribute to their mechanical stability. We conclude that the PRD mechanically destabilizes mHtt aggregates by disfavoring inter-fibrillar contacts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), thus providing a molecular basis for reduced aggregation propensity of mHtt variants with a PRD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Unfortunately, characterizing these oligomeric species by conventional structural approaches such as electron microscopy, crystallography or NMR is technically challenging given that these oligomeric species are structurally heterogeneous and chemically unstable. Conformational antibodies have provided a useful approach to distinguish specific conformations of amyloidogenic proteins, albeit the characteristics of these reactive species are not often defined (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brooks et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kayed and Glabe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kayed et al., 2003</a>).

In contrast, the small oligomers formed by \u2206N\u2206P, which had similar mobility to those formed by \u2206N, were not 3B5H10 reactive (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D<i>ii</i></a>).

Oligomer formation was assessed by SDS-AGE and immunoblotting against \u2206N (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The\u00a0addition of N17 at the start of the aggregation reaction led to the disappearance of \u2206N oligomers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), consistent with the increase in aggregates observed by EM and filter trap (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tam et al., 2009</a>). The rate of oligomer disappearance was enhanced at higher N17 concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, it seems that N17 triggers a conformational switch that disfavors the accumulation of trapped, oligomeric species and allows the\u00a0formation of amyloid fibrils. Such a role explains the slow \u2206N amyloid formation observed in the kinetic and cryo-EM analyses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We next asked whether N17 could impact pre-formed, stable \u2206N oligomers. We incubated \u2206N for 7\u00a0hr to generate a large population of oligomers but no fibrils, then added N17 <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Strikingly, N17 also promoted disappearance of these pre-formed, non-amyloidogenic oligomers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggesting that N17 can act on the kinetically trapped \u2206N oligomers themselves to promote formation of amyloid fibrils (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

Specifically, \u2206N forms many oligomers and few fibrillar aggregates; \u2206P forms many fibrillar aggregates and few oligomers; and \u2206N\u2206P, which is essentially a pathogenic length Q-tract, forms both oligomers and fibrils (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To evaluate the toxicity of these polyQ expanded mHtt variants we looked at the striatal neurons of rat corticostriatal brain slices, which provide a more disease relevant, 'tissue contextual' model of HD when compared to traditional models of neuronal cell cultures (<a href=\"#bib44\">Khoshnan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Reinhart et al., 2011</a>). In corticostriatal brain slices, the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are preferentially affected in HD, remain within their intact local tissue environment and maintain interactions among multiple brain cell-types. mHtt toxicity was measured by co-transfecting corticostriatal brain slices with a plasmid encoding untagged mHtt-Ex1 variants and another plasmid encoding YFP, which serves as an independent morphological marker for the transfected neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Crittenden et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). MSN viability is measured by examining the cellular and dendritic morphology by YFP expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). Importantly, when corticostriatal brain slices are transfected with polyQ-expanded mHtt there is a progressive degeneration of MSNs over 3\u20135 days (<a href=\"#bib70\">Reinhart et al., 2011</a>). No degeneration is observed when YFP is co-transfected with Htt carrying non-pathogenic polyQ repeats (Q8, Q23) or with a control vector (<a href=\"#bib70\">Reinhart et al., 2011</a>)."

Although \u2206N and \u2206P have dramatically different aggregation and oligomerization propensities in vitro and in vivo, both were as toxic as Ex1 as early as 3 days after transfection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). Even more surprisingly, \u2206N\u2206P, which generates both aggregates and oligomers and has an expanded polyQ tract of identical length, exhibited only modest toxicity even by day 4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These results negate simple models of aggregate-only or oligomer-only toxicity and instead call for a more nuanced view of proteotoxicity. Since both \u2206N, which forms few amyloid fibrils, and \u2206P, which forms few oligomers are both highly toxic, our data cannot be explained by either fibrillar aggregates or, oligomeric species per se as being toxic. Remarkably, since the expanded polyQ tract itself is only mildly toxic, the action of the flanking regions must be key to induce the toxic polyQ conformation(s)."

First, it is possible that there is no universal proteotoxic species, and either specific fibrillar or oligomer states mediate toxicity, most likely through different mechanisms given their radically different properties. However, it was intriguing that mHtt toxicity in the brain slices was observed for those variants that gave rise to 3B5H10-reactive small oligomers, namely Ex1, \u2206N and \u2206P but not \u2206N\u2206P. Thus, an alternative is that toxicity resides in a subclass of structural conformers, such as oligomers linked to 3B5H10 reactivity, rather than a particular size of species. Yet another possibility is that mHtt interconverts between several conformations when expressed in vivo\u00a0and that toxicity arises when those species cannot be efficiently cleared by the cellular machinery. We thus extended our analysis to the soluble mHtt conformers formed in striatal neurons, as well as their interactions with the proteostasis machinery."

One established mechanism is the chaperonin TRiC/CCT, which suppresses mHtt aggregation and toxicity in many HD models through recognition of N17 by the CCT1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib6\">Behrends et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kitamura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tam et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tam et al., 2009</a>). In neuronal cell culture, overexpression of CCT1 or exogenous addition of the purified substrate-binding domain of CCT1 (ApiCCT1) to the media suffices to suppress mHtt toxicity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kitamura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sontag et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tam et al., 2009</a>). We thus examined if ApiCCT1 could also be neuroprotective in the corticostriatal brain slice toxicity model of HD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Indeed, exogenous administration of purified recombinant ApiCCT1 significantly protected MSNs from mHtt neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E<i>i</i></a>). Strikingly, Blue-Native PAGE revealed that this exogenous ApiCCT1 addition caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the levels of small 3B5H10-reactive oligomers implicated in toxicity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E<i>ii</i></a>). These experiments support the notion that these 3B5H10-reactive small oligomers are diagnostic of a conformational pathway linked to toxicity and that chaperonin protection against HD toxicity decreases the levels of these soluble species."

We first used corticostriatal brain slices to investigate the impact of the different polyQ flanking domain variants on TRiC-mediated neuroprotection. CCT1 was cotransfected with the toxic mHtt-Ex1 variants into the corticostriatal brain slices and MSN viability assessed as above (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As expected, overexpression of CCT1 dramatically protected MSNs from mHtt-Ex1 toxicity but did not protect MSNs from \u2206N-induced toxicity. These results are consistent with the notion that N17 hosts the CCT1 binding site in mHtt (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tam et al., 2009</a>). Surprisingly, despite the presence of N17, CCT1 afforded only a modest degree of protection for \u2206P-induced toxicity. The minimal rescue of \u2206P by CCT1 may be due to the aggressive neurotoxicity of \u2206P (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>), which may impair neurons too quickly to be effectively rescued by CCT1. Alternatively, we considered that the absence of the PRD domain may reduce the availability of N17 to engage CCT1."

A pulse of <sup>35</sup>S\u2013methionine labeling followed by a non-radioactive chase measured the impact of N17 and the PRD on the clearance of soluble mHtt variants, which were detected by immunoprecipitation and autoradiography (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). The pulse began 14\u2009hr post-transfection when cellular mHtt was still soluble (not shown) to ensure labeling of only soluble mHtt populations. Under these conditions, the disappearance of mHtt-Ex1 is abrogated by inhibition of the proteasome and lysosomal pathways, as expected (not shown). Notably, both \u2206N and \u2206P had significantly slower protein clearance rates compared to Ex1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>).

As N17 is critical to drive the initial stages of amyloidogenesis and aggregation and the absence of the PRD promotes rapid aggregation, N17 may become more buried in the faster-forming \u2206P oligomer species. We thus assessed the relative exposure of N17 in purified mHtt-Ex1 variants with and without PRD by exploiting the enhanced protease susceptibility of exposed unstructured protein regions. Oligomers formed by Ex1 and \u2206P were generated in vitro and the degree of exposure of N17 was tested by a short incubation with low concentrations of Proteinase K, a broad specificity protease (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E<i>i</i></a>). N17 was then detected by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting with an anti-N17 antibody (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E<i>i</i></a>). We found that N17 was significantly more protease-sensitive in Ex1 oligomers containing the PRD than in \u2206P oligomers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E<i>ii\u2013iii</i></a>). As an alternative assay, we exploited the fact that N17 is the only region in mHtt-Ex1 that contains lysine residues, which are specifically cleaved by trypsin. Since Ex1 and \u2206P contain the same N17 sequence, any differences in trypsin digestion will arise from the differential exposure of N17. Indeed, N17 in Ex1 oligomers was much more sensitive to trypsin protease cleavage than in \u2206P oligomers (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Thus, these experiments show that the PRD increases exposure of the N17 domain, which explains the similar responses of \u2206N and \u2206P to CCT1 protection, their enhanced nuclear localization and their slower protein degradation kinetics, all of which were previously shown to depend on N17 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>). Taken together, these analyses indicate that, despite their opposing effects on the energetics of aggregation or oligomer formation, the two polyQ flanking regions also act synergistically in vivo to determine the cellular fate of mHtt (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>)."

In vitro the \u2206N\u2206P variant, encompassing essentially only the polyQ tract, accumulates filter-trappable SDS-insoluble species at similar rates as mHtt-Ex1 and also forms large and small oligomers. However, the conformations populated by \u2206N\u2206P are clearly different from those of Ex1: its rate of amyloid formation measured by ThioflavinT is much slower, similar to the toxic \u2206N variant and its fibrils are more tightly bundled, similar to the toxic \u2206P (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Supporting the role of flanking domains in generating specific polyQ conformers, \u2206N\u2206P does not give rise to 3B5H10 reactive species, unlike the toxic Ex1 variants, even though this antibody is known to recognize a polyQ-containing \u03b2-hairpin conformation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brooks et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Peters-Libeu et al., 2012</a>). These data suggest that in the absence of flanking regions, the polyQ tract quickly forms large, non-amyloidogenic oligomers and SDS-insoluble aggregates but takes longer to develop an amyloid conformation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Binette et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Crick et al., 2013</a>) and is less likely to populate toxic conformation(s)."

We propose that N17-N17 and N17-polyQ interactions lower the kinetic barrier between non-amyloidogenic oligomeric species and amyloid fibrils to disfavor accumulation of oligomeric species and promote amyloid aggregation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Without the N17 domain, \u2206N becomes kinetically trapped in large and small oligomer states (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). <i>Trans</i> addition of the N17 peptide can convert these trapped oligomers to fibrillar aggregates in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and accelerate mHtt-Ex1 aggregation in striatal-derived neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). N17 may act by increasing local mHtt concentration through inter-molecular interactions with the polyQ and N17 domains (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atwal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jayaraman et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Tam et al., 2009</a>), thereby nucleating amyloid formation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fiumara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Jayaraman et al., 2012b</a>) and promoting fibril bundling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In addition N17 may induce a conformational switch in the polyQ tract, through direct intrachain interaction to induce its transition to \u03b2-sheet structures (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kokona et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Williamson et al., 2010</a>), that may be important for on-pathway aggregation of polyQ stretches (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nagai et al., 2007</a>). The importance of the non-polar residues of N17 in promoting aggregation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tam et al., 2009</a>) could reflect the N17-N17 interaction interface, or a model where nonpolar N17 residues impact the conformation of the polyQ region."

Thus, removing the PRD in \u2206P enhances the progression to amyloid fibrils and makes oligomer states more transient (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). \u2206P amyloid fibrils are also more densely packed and more mechanically stable than amyloid fibrils containing a PRD region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3B\u2013C</a>). Several models may explain these findings. The PRD could form a PolyProline-II (PPII) helix that propagates into the polyQ region to promote a more helical conformation in the polyQ rather than a \u03b2-sheet structure to disfavor aggregation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Binette et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Darnell et al., 2007</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib24\">2009</a>). A dynamic PPII-helical PRD within the fibril could also interfere with fibril packing interactions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bugg et al., 2012</a>), perhaps by adopting a 'bottle brush' like architecture protruding from the amyloidogenic core of the fibril (<a href=\"#bib38\">Isas et al., 2015</a>).

In this sense, the longer the polyQ repeat, the more of these repetitive units may confer aberrant cellular interactions and cause pathogenesis. Alternatively, the 'emergent conformation' model proposes that a unique, toxic polyQ conformation appears at only pathogenic, expanded polyQ lengths (<a href=\"#bib59\">Miller et al., 2011</a>)."

Firstly, mHtt structural conformers and their cellular interactions are more relevant to pathogenesis than polyQ aggregation propensity. The Ex1, \u2206N and \u2206P variants are all highly toxic (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>) despite their different propensities to form insoluble aggregates or soluble oligomers both in vitro\u00a0and in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B-C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4B-E</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This suggests that only certain conformational sub-populations are neurotoxic (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>). Defining these toxic conformers is hindered by the limitations of current structural approaches, highlighting the need for improved methodologies to structurally define soluble mHtt states. Secondly, since polyQ alone generates toxic conformations inefficiently, the sequence context is key to the neurotoxic structural transition. Thus, the other polyQ-expansion disease causing proteins, such as ataxins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almeida et al., 2013</a>) must contain additional sequence elements that are functionally equivalent to N17 or the PRD. This finding highlights the need for understanding polyQ dynamics in the relevant protein context."

Many studies focus on the biophysical properties of aggregation-prone proteins, while others focus on their toxicities and behavior in cell culture, leaving a large gap in understanding how the biophysical nature of these aggregating proteins leads to their cellular consequences. Here we address the challenge of integrating these biochemical and biophysical approaches and link them to toxicity in a relevant brain model. However, the complexity of moving back and forth between systems was evident from the disjointed nature of our original manuscript. Our current revision focuses on the novel in vitro structural insights, while simplifying the integration of our in vivo analysis."

Our study shows that toxicity may not derive from just fibrils or oligomers but likely in specific conformations (or conformational ensembles) as shown by the selective reactivity of toxic variants to the 3B5H10 antibody. While we feel that the 3B5H10 reactive species illustrates this point, we do not want to state that this is \u201cthe\u201d toxic conformation, since there may be toxic species that we cannot detect due to a lack of conformational probes. This may include specific conformations of fibrils, since we show here that there is much conformational diversity among fibrils. We have now expanded on this discussion in the manuscript.."

We hope that we have succeeded in the revision to capture the role the polyQ flanking regions play in controlling complex interplay between the biophysics and cell biology leading to the cellular fate mHtt and that these results will be of great interest to those studying other neurodegenerative diseases."
