To better understand this process, we developed a novel two-color structured illumination microscopy with single-particle averaging (SPA-SIM) approach to study the localization of all 18 SPB components during duplication using endogenously expressed fluorescent protein derivatives. The increased resolution and quantitative intensity information obtained using this method allowed us to demonstrate that SPB duplication begins by formation of an asymmetric Sfi1 filament at mitotic exit followed by Mps1-dependent assembly of a Spc29- and Spc42-dependent complex at its tip. Our observation that proteins involved in membrane insertion, such as Mps2, Bbp1, and Ndc1, also accumulate at the new SPB early in duplication suggests that SPB assembly and NE insertion are coupled events during SPB formation in wild-type cells."

To better understand this process, we developed a novel two-color structured illumination microscopy with single-particle averaging (SPA-SIM) approach to study the localization of all 18 SPB components during duplication using endogenously expressed fluorescent protein derivatives. The increased resolution and quantitative intensity information obtained using this method allowed us to demonstrate that SPB duplication begins by formation of an asymmetric Sfi1 filament at mitotic exit followed by Mps1-dependent assembly of a Spc29- and Spc42-dependent complex at its tip. Our observation that proteins involved in membrane insertion, such as Mps2, Bbp1, and Ndc1, also accumulate at the new SPB early in duplication suggests that SPB assembly and NE insertion are coupled events during SPB formation in wild-type cells."

Few methods are available to examine large protein structures such as microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in intact cells. However, elucidating the mechanism of MTOC assembly is important since MTOCs perform a variety of functions in the cell, including cell signaling, cilia assembly, intraflagellar transport, and chromosome segregation. Duplication of a class of MTOCs known as centrosomes (in metazoans) or spindle pole bodies (SPBs, in fungi) once per cell cycle is essential to facilitate the formation of a bipolar spindle (<a href=\"#bib71\">Winey and O'Toole, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Winey and Bloom, 2012</a>).

Electron microscopy (EM) studies show that the SPB is a multilayered cylindrical organelle that is embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE) throughout the yeast lifecycle (<a href=\"#bib15\">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1975</a>). The outer and inner plaques of the SPB nucleate cytoplasmic and nuclear microtubules, respectively, while the central plaque is key to the structural integrity of the SPB and anchorage of the SPB to the NE via hook-like appendages visible by electron tomography (<a href=\"#bib51\">O'Toole et al., 1999</a>). Associated with one side of the SPB is a modified region of the NE known as the half-bridge, which is important for SPB duplication and cytoplasmic microtubule formation during G1 phase and mating (<a href=\"#bib15\">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Knop and Schiebel, 1998</a>). Although SPBs and centrosomes are morphologically distinct, they share a number of components, including proteins involved in duplication (Sfi1 and Cdc31/centrin), structure (Spc110/pericentrin and Nud1/centriolin), microtubule nucleation (\u03b3-tubulin complex, composed of Tub4, Spc97, and Spc98 in budding yeast), regulators (Mps1 and cyclin-dependent kinases; Cdks), and assembly principles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kollman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Winey and Bloom, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fu et al., 2015</a>).

Duplication is typically broken down into three steps based on cytological examination of wild-type and mutant yeast cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams and Kilmartin, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Winey and Bloom, 2012</a>). A combination of molecular, genetic, and cytological methods has been used to determine the composition and distribution of the 18 SPB components within the organelle and to predict their function(s) in its duplication (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The integral membrane proteins Mps3 and Kar1 localize to the nuclear and cytoplasmic face of the half-bridge, respectively, and likely serve as structural components that are involved in the localization of Sfi1 and Cdc31 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vallen et al., 1992a</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Spang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jaspersen et al., 2002</a>). Sfi1 is a long helical protein that contains multiple binding sites along its length for the yeast centrin, Cdc31 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kilmartin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>). Dephosphorylation of Cdk1 sites in the C-terminus of Sfi1 initiates elongation of the half-bridge to a full bridge, most likely via oligomerization of C-terminal ends of Sfi1 in an anti-parallel manner that allows free N-termini to associate directly or indirectly with components of the satellite\u2014the new SPB precursor (<a href=\"#bib6\">Avena et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Elserafy et al., 2014</a>). ImmunoEM predicts that the satellite is composed of four of the 18 SPB components, Spc42, Spc29, Cnm67, and Nud1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</a>). How the satellite assembles is unknown, but within the mother SPB core, trimers of Spc42 dimers form a hexagonal lattice that is visible by cryoEM (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bullitt et al., 1997</a>). The N-terminus of Spc42 associates with Spc29 and with Spc110, a spacer protein that tethers the \u03b3-tubulin complex to the inner plaque (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elliott et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Muller et al., 2005</a>). The C-terminus of Spc42 associates with Cnm67, another spacer protein that associates with the signaling scaffold Nud1/centriolin and the outer plaque receptor for the \u03b3-tubulin complex, Spc72 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Knop and Schiebel, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gruneberg et al., 2000</a>). Linkage of the SPB to the NE is thought to occur via Spc29, which binds to the soluble protein Bbp1 that in turn associates with the integral membrane protein Mps2 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schramm et al., 2000</a>). However, other tethering mechanisms may exist. For example, mutations in <i>NDC1</i> and <i>NBP1</i> result in many of the same phenotypes as <i>BBP1</i> and <i>MPS2</i> mutants, including defects in SPB insertion into the NE (<a href=\"#bib70\">Winey et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Chial et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Schramm et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Araki et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kupke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, it is presumed that Ndc1 and Nbp1 also anchor the SPB in the NE through unknown binding interactions with the non-membrane core SPB."

In contrast to SPA approaches used in previous studies with super-resolution microscopy data (<a href=\"#bib47\">Loschberger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Szymborska et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Loschberger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Van Engelenburg et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Broeken et al., 2015</a>), we employed three-dimensional image fitting of the protein intensity distributions to facilitate image alignment and intensity quantitation in our dual color images. SPA-SIM provided unexpected insights into the early steps of SPB duplication that were not attainable using existing technologies, including the structure and timing of half-bridge elongation, the composition of the satellite and the formation of the membrane pore. Relative spatiotemporal distributions of protein density from multiple images were obtained using fudicial markers and cell cycle analysis. We find that assembly of both the bridge and satellite occurs through a series of discrete and ordered steps, beginning with end-to-end association of Sfi1 in late mitosis. Interestingly, the Sfi1 filament is not symmetrical in the elongated half-bridge and there is relatively more Cdc31 bound to the newly assembled Sfi1. In addition to known satellite components, we find that Mps2 and Bbp1 localize to a region near the distal cytoplasmic tip of the extended half-bridge during SPB duplication, while Ndc1 is found along its length and Nbp1 is restricted primarily to the mother SPB. These data suggest that half-bridge and membrane proteins couple SPB duplication with its NE insertion."

SIM provides a twofold increase in this resolution limit (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gustafsson et al., 2008</a>), and we were able to detect two foci of Spc42-GFP that were unresolvable using widefield microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In most \u03b1-factor arrested cells, two Spc42 foci were observed; one focus was significantly brighter than the other, a phenotype anticipated for a mother SPB and a satellite that is beginning to assemble (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). The distance between foci (225 \u00b1 10 nm) was calculated from the center of the mother SPB to the center of the satellite so it is greater than the reported length of the extended half-bridge (117 \u00b1 9 nm), which was measured by EM from the edge of SPB to the edge of the satellite (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>). Analysis of Spc42-mMaple by photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) reported a distribution of distances between the mother SPB and satellite as 80\u2013280 nm (<a href=\"#bib57\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>). By SIM, two closely spaced foci of Tub4-mTurquoise2 were also detected at the spindle poles of most cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The average distance between foci was 157 \u00b1 7 nm, which is similar to the 150 nm height measured from outer to inner plaque by EM (<a href=\"#bib15\">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Winey et al., 1991</a>).

In contrast, two Sfi1 foci were observed in 62% of N-terminally tagged Sfi1 (GFP-Sfi1) cells arrested under the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The orientation of the mother SPB and satellite and the relatively low fluorescence intensity of GFP-Sfi1 compared with other SPB components were the primary reasons why we do not see two foci of GFP-Sfi1 in all cells.

Unlike Spc42-mCherry intensity, which is greatest at the mother SPB and shows reduced levels at the satellite, many cells exhibit increased GFP-Sfi1 fluorescence at the distal end near the satellite compared with the proximal end (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), suggesting asymmetry along the Sfi1 filament. The C-terminus of Sfi1 was noticeably displaced towards the cytoplasmic side of the bridge (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, merged panels) and the average distance between Spc42-mCherry at the mother SPB and Sfi1-GFP in the \u2018center\u2019 of the bridge is significantly shorter than the distance between Sfi1-GFP and the satellite (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that newly formed Sfi1 is distinct from Sfi1 existing on the half-bridge from the previous cell cycle and that the new Sfi1 filament is built at an angle relative to the existing Sfi1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These asymmetries may be important for bridge expansion, contraction, and bending, which have previously been proposed to facilitate formation and NE insertion of the new SPB (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2000</a>)."

Conceptually similar to single particle analysis used in many cryoEM studies, SPA-SIM involves the generation of probability profiles depicting the average position of the second SPB component after alignment of many images using Spc42. This type of analysis incorporating a common fiducial marker is advantageous because it shows the likelihood that a protein is present in a given location based on many cells and allows for positional comparison between different proteins."

Based on EM, the C-terminus of Spc42 is above the NE in intermediate layer 2 of the SPB, which is located between the central and outer plaque; the Spc42 N-terminus is located in the central plaque, which is spaced 10.8 nm from intermediate layer 2 towards the NE (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bullitt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">O'Toole et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Muller et al., 2005</a>). Because two reference points were needed for positioning, we selected C-terminal-labeled Spc42 at the mother SPB and satellite in our raw SIM images based on differences in intensity using the mTurquoise2 signal. We fit these manually selected positions to three-dimensional Gaussian functions in order to determine their centers with greater accuracy. Images were then realigned in three dimensions so that the centers of Gaussian fits were arranged along the x axis with the center point between the mother and satellite at zero. Therefore, in aligned images, the x axis represents the mother-satellite axis while the y axis represents the pole axis as depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. Examination of YFP intensity in aligned images showed a high degree of correlation in the mother-satellite axis, while in the pole axis the \u223c15 nm shift in intensity maxima is consistent with the position of the N-terminus in the central plaque and the C-terminus in intermediate layer 2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). These data demonstrate that we have excellent color alignment in our raw images and that the use of Spc42 enables comparison of positional information between multiple images with high confidence using our alignment methods."

Detection of YFP-Cdc31 in foci, as opposed to distributed along the bridge like YFP-Kar1 and Mps3-YFP, was unexpected based on its genetic and physical interactions with Kar1 and structural studies in vitro showing that Cdc31 binds along the tryptophan-containing repeats in the central region of Sfi1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Biggins and Rose, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Vallen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Spang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>).

During most of the cell cycle, GFP-Sfi1 appeared as a single focus; however, two foci were detected at one or both poles at the end of anaphase in many (63%, 25/40) large budded cells and at the pole in nearly all early G1 cells (90%, 26/29) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In these same cells, two foci of Spc42-mCherry were never seen at the SPB in anaphase cells and only 31% of the poles in early G1 cells had two Spc42 foci. The late mitotic timing of half-bridge elongation is consistent with recent studies showing that dephosphorylation of Cdk1 sites in Sfi1 by the Cdc14 phosphatase licenses a new round of SPB duplication (<a href=\"#bib6\">Avena et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Elserafy et al., 2014</a>). Our observation of an SPB duplication structure in mitosis is earlier than described by EM, perhaps because it is a transient step that is only observed in a small fraction of cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1975</a>). In both late mitotic and early G1 cells, an extended half-bridge was detected before the Spc42-containing satellite was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that bridge elongation is a distinct step in SPB duplication that must occur prior to formation of the satellite."

                                "text": "Previous EM analysis of mutant alleles in the Mps1 kinase showed cells containing <i>mps1-1</i> arrest with an elongated bridge lacking a satellite, which is reminiscent of certain <i>SFI1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib70\">Winey et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kilmartin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson et al., 2007</a>). Thus, it seems likely that Mps1 regulates progression from the elongated bridge state we observed in cycling cells to the satellite-bearing stage in SPB duplication. To test this idea, we examined the localization of GFP-Sfi1 in <i>mps1-1</i> cells by both immunoEM and SIM. Three pools of GFP-Sfi1 were found in the extended half-bridge of <i>mps1-1</i> mutant cells by immunoEM: 5/19 gold particles were proximal to the mother SPB and 10/19 gold particles were distal. The remaining 4/19 particles were located closer to the center of the bridge (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). SIM of wild-type cells at 24\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C or <i>mps1-1</i> mutants grown at 24\u00b0C showed that virtually all the early mitotic SPBs in large budded cells contained a single focus of both Spc42-mCherry and GFP-Sfi1. In <i>mps1-1</i> mutants shifted to 37\u00b0C, the frequency of this class of SPBs decreased and SPBs containing two GFP-Sfi1 foci increased, including SPBs with two Spc42-mCherry foci (representing SPBs containing an elongated half-bridge and a satellite/duplication plaque or duplicated side-by-side SPBs) or one Spc42-mCherry focus (representing a SPB with an elongated bridge lacking a satellite) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The mixed phenotype is consistent with molecular and genetic analysis of Mps1 showing that Mps1 function is required at multiple points in SPB duplication (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schutz and Winey, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jones et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Araki et al., 2010</a>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that half-bridge elongation is a distinct step of SPB duplication that begins in late mitosis and that the conversion from an elongated half-bridge to a satellite-bearing SPB requires the function of Mps1."

To test if these localized to the satellite by SIM, we arrested cells at the satellite-bearing stage of SPB duplication using \u03b1-factor for 3 hr. The duration of \u03b1-factor treatment ensured that more than 95% of cells arrested in G1; however, since most yeast strains have an \u223c90 min generation time at 30\u00b0C, many cells were likely in G1 for an extended period of time compared with the time normal cycling cells spend in this cell cycle stage."

The intensity of Nud1-mTurquoise2 at the mother SPB relative to the satellite (1.9 \u00b1 0.3) was equivalent to that of Spc42-mTurquoise2 so it is unlikely that an inability to detect Nud1-mTurquoise2 at the satellite was the cause of the reduced number of satellites observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). One possibility is that Nud1 is a more peripheral satellite component that may assemble later as the satellite matures into a duplication plaque (see below). The fact that the distance between the mother SPB and satellite is greater when measured by Nud1-mTurquoise2 (275 \u00b1 12 nm) than Spc29-mTurquoise2 (228 \u00b1 13 nm) or Spc42-mTurquoise2 (225 \u00b1 10 nm) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) would be consistent with this idea, particularly if the bridge adopts a bent shape (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D, 3E,F</a>)."

Of the very small budded cells at this time point, 82% (77/94) showed two foci of Spc42-mTurquoise2, which is indicative of satellite assembly. Most of the cells with two Spc42-mTurquoise2 foci (90%, 69/77) had a single focus of Nud1-YFP that was coincident with the more intense focus of Spc42-mTurquoise2, which is consistent with our theory that Nud1 assembles into the satellite later than Spc42. We observed Nud1-YFP at the SPB in the majority of SPBs at later time points (83% at 60 min, 48/58), as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> (60 min)\u2014both cells have two Spc42-mTurquoise2 foci, and the cell with the larger bud that has progressed further in the cell cycle contains Nud1-YFP at both poles.

If cells were released into \u03b1-factor for 3 hr, the fraction of cells containing two foci of Spc42-YFP and Nud1-mTurquoise2 rose to 71% (46/64), showing that Nud1 accumulates at the satellite during a prolonged pheromone arrest (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

This suggests that Spc42 precedes Spc29 in recruitment to the satellite; however, we cannot exclude the possibility this is due to detection issues since we were unable to create a strain containing <i>MET-CDC20/SPC42-YFP/SPC29-mTurquoise2</i>. However, the observation that the percentage of SPBs containing two Spc29-YFP foci in addition to two foci of Spc42-mTurquoise2 increased from 15% at 30 min to 47% at 40 min supports that Spc42 assembles prior to Spc29 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>)."

In a fraction of cells with emerging buds, two foci of Bbp1-mTurquoise2 could be seen flanking Sfi1-YFP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, bottom panels), reminiscent of the localization pattern of satellite components. This suggests that Bbp1 and possibly other pore membrane components of the SPB may localize to early SPB duplication structures."

The distance between the two foci was approximately equal to the values for satellite components (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In some cells, Mps2-mTurquoise2 was not observed in two foci but rather was distributed across the region that is likely the bridge, possibly because the SPB is oriented in a longitudinal section (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, arrowhead). Short linear structures were also observed in \u03b1-factor arrested cells containing Nbp1-mTurquoise2 and to a lesser extent Ndc1-mTurquoise2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that the Nbp1 and Ndc1 may localize to the extended half-bridge region, and Mps2 and Bbp1 accumulate on the mother SPB and satellite in \u03b1-factor arrested cells."

Nbp1-mTurquoise2 initially localized to the mother SPB, then assembled in the region between Bbp1-YFP foci before forming two separate foci near the mother SPB and satellite as SPB duplication concluded in early S phase. The remnant of Nbp1-mTurquoise2 in the region between the two poles was no longer detected in medium budded cells, and both proteins localized to the SPB throughout the rest of the cell cycle. Similarly, Ndc1-YFP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) and Ndc1-mTurquoise2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) also accumulated in the region between the mother SPB and the satellite in unbudded cells but later matured into two foci.

The location of these satellite components, with the exception of Spc42, relative to the C-terminus of Spc110 is consistent with our knowledge of their positional information within the core SPB from other methods of analysis such as immunoEM, FRET, and yeast two-hybrid analysis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Muller et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Winey and Bloom, 2012</a>). The large displacement of Spc42-mTurquoise2 is most likely due to the fact that the fits consider the position of Spc42 at both the mother SPB and satellite. The shift of the satellite components relative to the membrane proteins indicates that the pore and pore-related structures are formed near the region defined by the C-terminus of Spc110, which is displaced in the pole axis from the satellite components. Overlays of fluorescent density further illustrate how pore proteins assemble beneath the satellite (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>)."

Most (88%, 114/129 at 15 min and 79%, 104/165 at 20 min) contained a single focus of Nbp1-mTurquoise2 and a single focus of Spc110-YFP. Even at later time points, the predominant phenotype seen was two resolved foci of Spc110-YFP that likely are SPBs in the duplicated side-by-side configuration connected by an elongated Nbp1-mTurquoise2 signal (18%, 19/107 at 25 min and 38%, 24/65 at 30 min) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,D</a>). It is important to note that we used mTurquoise2, which has a shorter wavelength than YFP (and thus increased resolution with SIM) to visualize Nbp1. The fact that we saw two foci of Spc110-YFP suggests that biology inherent to SPB duplication, rather than the resolution of our microscope, was the underlying cause for this stretched configuration of Nbp1-mTurquoise2. A similar pattern of Ndc1-mTurquoise2 recruitment to the new SPB prior to its insertion and Nbp1-mTurquoise2 resolution after SPB insertion was observed during the next SPB duplication cycle (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>), although precise timing of events relative to release from \u03b1-factor varied from cell to cell due to loss of synchrony following mitosis. Although two resolved foci of Nbp1-mTurquoise2 occasionally were seen prior to NE insertion, these events were rare (less than 10% of cells examined at all time points) and could be due to poor detection of Spc110-YFP. Taken together with our SPA-SIM results, these data lend support to the idea that Nbp1 is the last SPB component to fully assembly onto the new pole. We propose that a membrane fenestra formed by Mps2 and Bbp1 is created below the satellite at the time of its formation and that Ndc1 is recruited later followed by Nbp1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

A recent study that combined PALM and STORM data showed, as we have, that N-terminally tagged versions of Sfi1 appear as two foci and a single focus is observed if Sfi1 is tagged at its C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>). However, using SPA-SIM we were able to resolve additional structural features of the extended half-bridge due to our ability to perform quantitative analysis of multiple SPB components in three dimensions. Unexpectedly, we find that the bridge is neither linear nor symmetric, even at early stages of SPB duplication, and that Cdc31 is not localized uniformly along its length. The maximum intensity of Cdc31 binding on the extended half-bridge occurs in the central region of the new Sfi1 filament, which is located between the central and distal bridge (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). While this central repeat domain of Sfi1 has been shown in vitro to contain multiple Cdc31 binding sequences (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kilmartin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>), it is unknown why Cdc31 would preferentially associate with the newly formed Sfi1 instead of the old molecules of Sfi1 since both contain the same repeat domains. By EM, the half-bridge appears as a flat sheet and probably only has one layer of Sfi1 filaments (<a href=\"#bib14\">Byers, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>). Based on the 65\u00b0 rotation of Cdc31 molecules around Sfi1 repeats seen in vitro, there is thought to be limited side-to-side contact between adjacent Sfi1-Cdc31 filaments (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>). Cdc31 binding to only a fraction of repeats, in particular those on the new filament, could increase the interaction between adjacent Sfi1 molecules by partially alleviating this constraint. Binding to the newly assembled Sfi1 also could be important for stabilizing the half-bridge, a theory supported by recent studies on <i>sfi1+</i> and <i>cdc31+</i> in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bouhlel et al., 2015</a>)."

During most of the cell cycle, the C-terminus of Sfi1 is phosphorylated; dephosphorylation of Cdk1 sites in the C-terminus by Cdc14 results in half-bridge elongation and triggers SPB reduplication (<a href=\"#bib6\">Avena et al., 2014</a>). Here we show that two foci of GFP-Sfi1 are visible in late mitosis, when Cdc14 is activated (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stegmeier and Amon, 2004</a>). Based on our analysis, this appears to be the first landmark event signaling a new round of SPB duplication. Understanding the molecular interactions between the C-termini of Sfi1 molecules emanating from the same pole and between Sfi1 C-termini in the antiparallel array will further elucidate how this important step in SPB duplication is controlled."

Not only do Mps2 and Bbp1 interact with each other, but also Bbp1 binds to Spc29 and Kar1 and Mps2 associates with Mps3 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schramm et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jaspersen et al., 2006</a>). Enrichment of Mps3-YFP at the distal end of the bridge near the satellite (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>) could be due to interactions with Mps2. The <i>mps2-381</i> allele that is defective in Mps3 binding is unable to form a bridge or satellite at the non-permissive temperature, supporting the idea that Mps2 plays a role early in SPB duplication (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jaspersen et al., 2006</a>). A role for Bbp1 early in SPB duplication has not been reported; however, the observation that Mps1-dependent phosphorylation of Spc29 increases its binding to Bbp1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Araki et al., 2010</a>) might be re-interpreted in light of our finding\u2014phosphorylated Spc29 may recruit Bbp1 to the satellite. Similarly, other regulatory events at the SPB may take on a new significance based on possible coordination between satellite and pore assembly."

The answer likely is that factors needed to remodel the NE to form a stable contiguous pore membrane have not yet localized. One candidate is Ndc1, an evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein that is present at the pore membrane of both SPBs and NPCs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Chial et al., 1998</a>). Although Ndc1 was observed at the satellite region in \u03b1-factor arrested cells, yeasts are exquisitely sensitive to its dosage (<a href=\"#bib21\">Chial et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2014</a>) and it may not be present at high enough levels to induce stable changes in membrane architecture. A second candidate is the Ndc1 binding protein Nbp1, which contains an ArfGAP1 lipid packing sensor domain that is able to interact with lipid head groups to induce membrane bending (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bigay et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kupke et al., 2011</a>). Nbp1 localization in \u03b1-factor arrested cells was restricted to the mother SPB and the bridge proximal to the mother. Our observations that Nbp1 does not localize to the new SPB until that pole is inserted into the NE and that it localizes to a region within 10 nm of Spc110 are consistent with the idea that Nbp1 functions from the nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kupke et al., 2011</a>). Analysis of cells depleted of <i>NBP1</i> using a temperature-dependent degron allele showed that Nbp1 is not required for localization of Cdc31, Kar1, Mps3, Sfi1, Spc29, or Spc42 to the mother SPB or the satellite. However, Nbp1 is partially required for Bbp1 recruitment and Mps2 stability at the new SPB without significantly affecting the mother SPB (<a href=\"#bib5\">Araki et al., 2006</a>). The fact that SPB insertion can occur without full resolution of Nbp1 onto a new SPB combined with its requirement for Mps2 protein stability make it tempting to speculate that Nbp1 is not required for SPB insertion per se but rather for maturation and maintenance of structures formed at the membrane of the new SPB."

This could explain, in part, why Nud1 is detected at the satellite region more frequently than Cnm67 in our experiments. Although Nud1 is an essential component of the outer plaque and is present at the satellite, it has no known role in SPB duplication. Instead, Nud1 serves as a signaling platform that is important for exit from mitosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gruneberg et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rock et al., 2013</a>).

While SIM by itself does not offer the resolution of STORM and PALM, the SPA-SIM method we developed offered unique advantages that were ideally suited to our study. Firstly, as opposed to STORM and PALM, SIM data can be acquired using standard fluorescent proteins such as GFP, YFP, CFP, mCherry, and mTurqouise2. In yeast, where genetic manipulations are straightforward, this allows for study of endogenously tagged proteins and removes concerns over competition with native untagged proteins as well as the need for antibody staining. Because all protein can in theory be visualized, sparse labeling artifacts are effectively eliminated, which pose a major challenge for any type of quantitative single particle analysis. Secondly, SIM allows for simple and rapid measurement with two to three fluorophores. In our case, we have used this to our advantage since Spc42 or Spc110 could be included as reference points for further alignment and averaging. Our fitting uncertainty of Gaussian centers in three dimensions is less than 3 nm, while the alignment of the colors, shown for YFP-Spc42-mTurqouise2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), is within 12 \u00b1 6 nm in the mother-satellite axis, which serves as a color alignment control for our SIM data and our realignment method. Furthermore, we are able to decipher shifts in density centers on the order of 10\u201330 nm, putting SPA-SIM on par with other super-resolution and particle averaging methods that to this point have required more sophisticated three-dimensional data acquisition methods (<a href=\"#bib47\">Loschberger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Szymborska et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Loschberger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Van Engelenburg et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Broeken et al., 2015</a>)."

A 60\u00d7 1.42 NA Plan Apo oil objective was used, and emission was collected onto two PCO Edge sCMOS cameras (Kelheim, Germany) with each camera dedicated to one specific channel. For CFP/mTurqouise2/YFP experiments, a 440/514/561 dichroic was used with 460\u2013485 nm and 530\u2013552 nm emission filters for CFP/mTurqouise2 and YFP, respectively. The 440 nm line and 514 nm line were used for excitation of CFP/mTurqouise2 and YFP, respectively. For GFP/mCherry experiments, a 405/488/561/640 dichroic was used with 504\u2013552 nm and 590\u2013628 nm emission filters for GFP and mCherry, respectively, using a 488 nm laser line (GFP) and 561 nm laser line (mCherry). To limit spectral cross-talk, all SIM data was acquired in alternating excitation mode. SIM reconstruction was performed with the Applied Precision software Softworx with a Wiener filter of 0.001. Color alignment from different cameras in the radial plane was performed using the color alignment slide from GE Healthcare (Pittsburg, PA). In the axial direction, color alignment was performed using 100 nm tetraspeck beads (Life Technologies, Kelheim, Germany). For image preparation, the SIM reconstructed images were scaled 2 \u00d7 2 with bilinear interpolation then smoothed with a Gaussian blur of pixel radius 0.8. In many cases, for illustration purposes, a max projection in z over the relevant slices was done."

Next 30 \u00d7 30 pixel intensity profiles along the z axis were created. SPBs with fitted channel profile maxima in the first or last slice were eliminated. Each selected SPB was then visually inspected in three dimensions for counts of those containing two spots. This methodology underestimates the number of two spot images given the lower z resolution and thus the inability of the microscope to distinguish spots where the mother-satellite axis is oriented vertically. Nevertheless, yeast nuclei rarely orient themselves this way and this method provides the best estimate of satellite formation and/or incorporation."

While this method has some associated error, most proteins are distributed fairly symmetrically along the mother-satellite axis so a small number of mis-oriented axes will not dramatically skew the results."

Intensities were obtained by tri-linear interpolation along this plane with a pixel size four times smaller than that of the reconstructed SIM image. These realigned profiles were summed together to create dual-color probability maps for the intensity profiles of the two proteins under study. In cases where Spc110 is labeled in the second channel, profiles were rotated so that the side of the profile with the higher Spc110 intensity (the mother SPB) was oriented to one side. In that way it was possible to assess the shift of the mother-satellite profile relative to the pole axis. In the same way, half-bridge profiles collected with Spc42 as a reference were oriented to one side based on the non-Spc42 signal (or YFP in the YFP-Spc42-mTurquoise2 strain). Typically images are shown with the aligned channel above the non-aligned channel since this is most consistent with available structural and molecular information. The exceptions to this are Mps3 and N-terminus of Spc42, where EM and/or FRET data demonstrates positioning below the mother-satellite axis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bullitt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">O'Toole et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jaspersen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Muller et al., 2005</a>)."

Errors were estimated by standard Monte Carlo analysis of 100 randomly simulated data sets with random Gaussian noise corresponding to the variance indicated by the fit residuals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bevington and Robinson, 2003</a>). Given the random orientation of individual realigned images and the choice to orient them with the reference channel to one side, the mother<b>-</b>spindle axis was centered slightly differently for different probability maps. For creation of overlayed contour maps, these differences were eliminated by vertically shifting the probability maps with bilinear interpolation. Contour maps were then generated by thresholding each channel at 75% of its maximum intensity and outlining the resulting mask. For proteins present at both the mother and satellite, each distribution was outlined independently to avoid bias due to the intensity differences between these distributions."

For pore protein distributions in that same direction, a third broad Gaussian function centered on the distribution was required for reasonable fitting of the distribution."

While this is a commonly employed technique for biochemical analyses in the field, it is not clear why this is important for single cell analysis. The authors could use a morphological marker (such as pole separation) to tell them exactly where they are within the cell cycle. The issue here is how representative arrest and release is relative to \u201cnormal\u201d cell cycle progression. One might imagine a build-up of certain products in the arrest that might be different from normal progression. It is not necessary that the authors repeat their entire data set but they should validate for a few key proteins that the changes they see are representative of unperturbed cell cycles."

We also have done multiple timing experiments to determine how SPB components are recruited during the course of wild-type SPB duplication to build a complete model of the duplication process using the lens of SIM. To show that Nbp1 is indeed the last SPB component to fully assemble on the new SPB, we have added new data in which we released cells from \u03b1-factor and examined its distribution relative to Spc110, which marks assembly into the NE. Unexpectedly, we observed two foci of Spc110 before we detected two Nbp1 foci (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This supports our idea that Nbp1 is the last and/or limiting factor but also demonstrates that resolution of Nbp1 into two foci is not required for SPB insertion."
