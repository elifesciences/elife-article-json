Here we investigate the function of Pentagone (Pent), a secreted protein that acts in a regulatory feedback during establishment and maintenance of BMP/Dpp morphogen signalling during Drosophila wing development. We show that Pent internalises the Dpp co-receptors, the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein (Dlp), and propose that this internalisation is important in the establishment of a long range Dpp gradient. Pent-induced endocytosis and degradation of glypicans requires dynamin- and Rab5, but not clathrin or active BMP signalling. Thus, Pent modifies the ability of cells to trap and transduce BMP by fine-tuning the levels of the BMP reception system at the plasma membrane. In addition, and in accordance with the role of glypicans in multiple signalling pathways, we establish a requirement of Pent for Wg signalling. Our data propose a novel mechanism by which morphogen signalling is regulated."

Here we investigate the function of Pentagone (Pent), a secreted protein that acts in a regulatory feedback during establishment and maintenance of BMP/Dpp morphogen signalling during Drosophila wing development. We show that Pent internalises the Dpp co-receptors, the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein (Dlp), and propose that this internalisation is important in the establishment of a long range Dpp gradient. Pent-induced endocytosis and degradation of glypicans requires dynamin- and Rab5, but not clathrin or active BMP signalling. Thus, Pent modifies the ability of cells to trap and transduce BMP by fine-tuning the levels of the BMP reception system at the plasma membrane. In addition, and in accordance with the role of glypicans in multiple signalling pathways, we establish a requirement of Pent for Wg signalling. Our data propose a novel mechanism by which morphogen signalling is regulated."

During larval wing development, Dpp is produced in a stripe of cells at the anterior-posterior (AP) boundary and disperses into both compartments, by mechanisms that are still not fully understood, to organize a BMP signalling activity gradient along the AP axis with highest levels in medial and lowest in lateral regions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Affolter and Basler, 2007</a>). Dpp, together with a second, uniformly expressed ligand, Glass bottom boat (Gbb), activates membrane bound receptors and induces the phosphorylation of the transcription factor Mad. Phosphorylated Mad (pMad) accumulates in the nucleus with the cofactor Medea, where the activated Smad complex directly regulates BMP-target gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hamaratoglu et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "In addition to the localized production of Dpp, many other determinants impact on proper establishment and maintenance of the activity gradient. Prominent amongst them are membrane-bound BMP-binding proteins, such as Thickveins (Tkv) and Dally, which have dual functions in the establishment of the pMad gradient. Tkv is cell-autonomously required for signalling as it is the main type I BMP receptor in <i>Drosophila</i>. At the same time, Tkv critically affects Dpp tissue distribution through ligand trapping and internalisation, and thus globally shapes the BMP activity gradient (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crickmore and Mann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lecuit and Cohen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tanimoto et al., 2000</a>). Similarly, Dally, a GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), binds and concentrates Dpp at cell surfaces and, together with a second glypican, Dally-like protein (Dlp), is required for both local signal activation and long-range distribution of the ligand (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akiyama et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Belenkaya et al., 2004</a>). Absence of glypicans- for example in a clone of cells- can result in both a reduction of BMP signalling within the clone and an interruption of Dpp spreading within and beyond the clone. In addition, glypicans can also, by virtue of their ligand-binding capacity, hinder the movement of ligands in several contexts. For example, the diffusion of BMP4 (a vertebrate homolog to Dpp) during early Xenopus embryogenesis has been shown to be restricted through its interactions with HSPGs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ohkawara et al., 2002</a>). Similarly, in the wing disc, increasing the levels of Dally at the source of Dpp causes a local increase of signalling activity and a drastic compaction of the gradient due to ligand trapping (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fujise et al., 2003</a>; and see below). Reflecting the importance of the activity of Tkv and Dally for proper gradient establishment, the levels of both proteins are tightly regulated along the AP axis of the developing disc. Through complex transcriptional regulation, which involves repression by BMP signalling itself, both Tkv and Dally are down-regulated near the ligand source to maintain the proper balance between Dpp signalling and Dpp dispersion (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crickmore and Mann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lecuit and Cohen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tanimoto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fujise et al., 2001</a>)."

The transcription of <i>pent</i> is directly repressed by BMP signalling, hence its production is restricted to the\u00a0lateral-most cells of the disc. Pent protein is, however, secreted and distributes in a gradient that is inverse to the pMad gradient. Pent mutants have a restricted pMad gradient with abnormally high levels in the centre of the disc and very low levels in lateral regions; consequently, adult wings have growth and patterning defects in lateral regions. The pMad gradient of <i>pent</i> mutants thus resembles the abnormal gradients caused by medial over-expression of Tkv or Dally, suggesting an interaction of the protein with the BMP-reception system. Indeed, our past work established that Pent physically associates with Dally on cell membranes, but the consequences of this interaction have remained unclear."

Endocytosis of glypicans is dependent on dynamin and Rab5, but does not require clathrin or Dpp signalling. Additionally, we show that Pent influences Wg signalling, which also depends on glypicans. We conclude from these data that Pent modulates glypican levels in order to modify multiple signalling pathways during wing morphogenesis. Our data suggest an additional, protein-level feedback mechanism to tightly control levels of signalling, which cooperates with transcriptional regulatory feedback loops to ensure proper morphogen gradient formation and organ development."

While binding of Dpp to glypicans can promote signalling and movement of Dpp, glypicans can also block ligand dispersion. Increasing the level of Dally in the centre of the disc by dppGal4 increases pMad and Dpp levels medially in a cell-autonomous manner (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fujise et al., 2003</a>), but this is at the expense of lateral signalling as judged by the drastic restriction of the pMad gradient (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Assessing the distribution of Dpp itself by an extracellular staining protocol reveals accumulation of the ligand on Dally-expressing cells and a simultaneous loss of Dpp in cells flanking the source, demonstrating that too much Dally can trap Dpp and impede its spreading (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013F</a>)."

These experiments suggest that Pent can be found on glypicans far from the source of Pent production. To better investigate the physiological distribution of Pent we used genomic engineering to generate flies expressing a N-terminally YFP tagged Pent (PentYFP) under endogenous control (see Materials and methods). Flies with PentYFP as the only source of Pent display normal wing morphology and a normal pMad gradient, demonstrating that the fusion protein is fully functional (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,E,F,A\u2019,E\u2019,F\u2019,I</a>). In such flies, PentYFP was mostly detectable in lateral regions of the wing imaginal discs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2K</a>) and was below detection levels in medial cells. However, when we expressed an anti-GFP nanotrap - a membrane-tethered, extracellularly exposed single-chain nanobody against GFP (<a href=\"#bib33\">Harmansa et al., 2015</a>) - using dppGal4, PentYFP strongly accumulated on nanotrap expressing cells in the centre of the disc (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2K,L</a>).

We used a DallyYFP fusion protein, where YFP is inserted as an artificial exon between the first and second exons of the gene, to monitor Dally levels and distribution (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lowe et al., 2014</a>). This chimeric protein is functional as it can restore the adult wing defects and the abnormal pMad profile observed in <i>dally</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C,A\u2013C\u2019,I\u2019</a>). In the third instar wing disc, DallyYFP protein localised at cell membranes and, consistent with previous reports, was found at its highest levels in the lateral regions and lowest in the medial region of the disc (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ayers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fujise et al., 2001</a>). Increased levels of DallyYFP were also seen at the DV and AP boundaries, although the latter could notalways be detected. To investigate the effect of Pent on Dally, we expressed V5Pent in the dorsal compartment of the wing disc using apterous-Gal4 (apGal4). As the profile of Dally is mirrored in the DV axis, the ventral compartment served as an internal control in these experiments. The distribution of DallyYFP was dramatically altered upon expression of V5Pent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), with a marked redistribution of the protein from membranes to discrete puncta. Closer inspection showed that V5Pent and DallyYFP co-localised in these puncta, with 66% of V5Pent puncta found to also contain DallyYFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The majority of V5Pent-DallyYFP puncta were found in the dorsal compartment, where expression of V5Pent was driven by apGal4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Nevertheless, and consistent with the spreading of Pent, co-localisation of Pent and DallyYFP in puncta was also seen in ventral cells multiple cell-diameters away from the DV boundary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Clonal expression of V5Pent also resulted in redistribution of DallyYFP and the appearance of V5Pent-DallyYFP puncta (data not shown)."

This assay revealed a substantial reduction of extracellular Dally upon V5Pent expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The reduction in DallyYFP protein level is not due to a reduction in Dally mRNA as a reporter of Dally transcription showed no significant reduction upon UASV5Pent expression (data not shown).

In comparison to wild type discs, a small increase in DallyYFP was observed in the anterior compartment of <i>pent</i> discs, and a more substantial increase in the posterior compartment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). The pattern of Dally distribution was also notably changed, from a smooth gradient in wild type discs to a much more abrupt gradient in <i>pent</i> discs, with a sharp increase in the posterior compartment. Importantly, we saw a similar increase in the level of extracellular Dally in <i>pent</i> mutant discs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Transcriptional regulation of <i>dally</i> expression by the altered pMad gradient in <i>pent</i> mutants certainly contributes to the observed changes, especially the medial expansion of DallyYFP expression. Nevertheless, the increase of DallyYFP in lateral-most cells (where pMad signalling is absent) is likely due to direct effects of Pent on Dally stability and is consistent with our gain of function analysis. Cumulatively, the data suggest that Pent induces the internalization of Dally and its depletion from the plasma membrane."

In wild type conditions, Dlp is found at highest levels either side of the DV boundary, with levels low at the DV boundary itself (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We expressed V5Pent in the posterior compartment of discs as this allows easy comparison of expressing and non-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Similar to what was seen with DallyYFP, the level of Dlp protein was drastically reduced in the posterior compartment. The remaining Dlp protein was localised to puncta that frequently co-localised with V5Pent, with 57% of V5Pent puncta also containing Dlp (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>).

As with Dally, DlpYFP levels were slightly increased across <i>pent</i> mutant discs in comparison to WT control (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), a result also confirmed by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Unlike Dally, the pattern of Dlp transcription does not suggest it is suppressed by Dpp signalling. Indeed, we could not detect changes in Dlp protein level in <i>mad</i> mutant clones, which have no Dpp signalling (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, the increase in DlpYFP seen in <i>pent</i> mutants is likely due to reduced internalisation of Dlp by Pent. These data show that Pent influences glypicans in general, and not just Dally. Glypican levels are reduced when Pent is over-expressed, and their levels increase in the absence of Pent. Consistent with the role of glypicans in Dpp signalling and the phenotypes observed in glypican loss of function studies, the reduction of glypicans by Pent over-expression results in aberrant BMP signalling and gradient formation. In discs expressing Pent in the dorsal compartment we saw a local decrease in extracellular Dpp levels and a concomitant shrinkage of the pMad gradient (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

To determine whether association of any binding protein can induce glypican endocytosis, we expressed Dpp, Notum and Shifted with apGal4 and monitored the level of DallyYFP. Notum and Dpp occasionally co-localised with Dally in endosomes, but neither Dpp, Notum nor Shf induced internalisation and depletion of Dally (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). This leads us to conclude that the recruitment of glypicans into endosomes and consequent reduction in glypican protein level is a specific property of Pent and not a general consequence that occurs upon binding of an extracellular protein."

We focused on Tkv and Punt, which account for most of the BMP signalling during wing disc development (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ruberte et al., 1995</a>). Unlike Dally and Dlp, expression of Tkv in the dorsal compartment of the disc did not affect the distribution of Pent, suggesting that Pent does not bind Tkv (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F,J</a>). To monitor effects of Pent on the level of Tkv protein, we generated an endogenous TkvHA fusion protein (see Materials and methods). Flies with TkvHA as the sole source of Tkv are fully viable and display no molecular or morphological defects in wing development, confirming the functionality of the fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3H,H\u2019,I</a>). Under normal conditions, and consistent with previous studies, TkvHA is high laterally and low in the medial region with particular drops in protein level at the AP and DV boundaries (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crickmore and Mann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lecuit and Cohen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tanimoto et al., 2000</a>). Unlike the dramatic effects seen with glypicans, TkvHA was not visibly reduced when Pent was over-expressed in the dorsal compartment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, similar to the effects seen with DallyYFP, TkvHA co-localised with V5Pent puncta (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which were frequently positive for the late endosome marker Rab7 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), suggesting these endosomes are destined for lysosomal degradation. As Pent is internalised with Tkv and Dally, we sought to determine whether Tkv and Dally co-localise into endosomes together. When V5Pent was expressed with apGal4, V5Pent-Dally-Tkv endosomes were frequently seen, showing that Dally and Tkv co-localise in endosomal compartments (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). From these data we conclude that Pent may be able to drag Tkv into endosomes with Dally, but this happens at a frequency too low to visibly reduce Tkv protein level. Alternatively, the appearance of Dally and Tkv in the same endosomes could be due to downstream fusion of independent endosomes containing Tkv or Dally. In either scenario, Pent primarily exerts its function through regulation of glypicans, and not Tkv."

We used two additional approaches to directly examine whether internalisation of glypicans by Pent requires active Dpp signalling. Firstly, we clonally expressed V5Pent in discs expressing either Punt or Tkv RNAi under control of apGal4. Under these conditions, Dpp signalling is blocked in the dorsal compartment and is normal in the ventral compartment. DallyYFP was still internalised with V5Pent in the compartment expressing Tkv or Punt RNAi, and the level of DallyYFP was visibly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). This demonstrates that receptors and active signalling are not required for Pent-induced glypican internalisation. In a further experiment, we sought to address whether Dpp itself, which also directly binds to glypicans, is required for Pent to internalise glypicans. Dpp is absolutely required for wing disc development; however, some wing discs do grow in <i>brk/dpp</i> double mutant flies (genotype <i>brk<sup>XA</sup>;dpp<sup>d12</sup>/dpp<sup>d14</sup></i>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schwank et al., 2008</a>). In the absence of Dpp, the distribution of Dlp was slightly different, with increased levels at the AP boundary, which is not surprising considering these discs have developed in the absence of Dpp (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Expression of Pent in the dorsal compartment clearly reduced Dlp protein level, and co-localised with Dlp in endosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). From these experiments we conclude that Pent does not require Dpp or active Dpp signalling in order to internalise glypicans."

We tested the requirement for clathrin in glypican endocytosis by expressing an RNAi construct against clathrin heavy chain (chc). Staining for clathrin was substantially decreased in the region expressing the chcRNAi, showing that the RNAi is effective (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, knockdown of clathrin had no visible effect on the internalisation of Pent or Dally, with many endosomes of Pent and Dally clearly visible in both the dorsal and ventral compartments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). The immediate destination for many endocytic cargoes is Rab5 positive early endosomes. Knockdown of Rab5 significantly reduced the internalisation of Pent and Dally, with very few endosomes present in the dorsal compartment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>).

One of the earliest steps of endocytosis is the scission of nascent endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane, a mechanism which often requires dynamin. We inhibited dynamin function with a temperature sensitive dominant negative version of Shibire (Shi<sup>TS</sup>), the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of dynamin. In order to rule out effects on the\u00a0secretion of V5Pent, Shi<sup>TS</sup> was expressed in the posterior compartment.

Prolonged expression of Shi<sup>TS</sup> caused severe tissue deformation, preventing study of later time points that may have provided a greater inhibition of Dally internalisation.

As expression of V5Pent reduces glypican levels, we assumed that over-expression of Pent would also affect distribution of extracellular Wg. We chose engal4 to mis-express V5Pent as its expression is confined to the posterior compartment and this crosses the DV boundary from which the highest levels of Wg are produced. In the posterior, Pent expressing region, the peak of extracellular Wg was the same as in the WT control, but the intensity decreased steeper than in the control region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These data are consistent with phenotypes seen in glypican mutant clones (<a href=\"#bib31\">Han et al., 2005</a>).

When Dlp was over-expressed with enGal4, adult wings had a scalloped phenotype due to defects in Wg signalling (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yan et al., 2009</a>). Absence of Pent enhanced this phenotype, whilst over-expression of Pent completely suppressed the phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Similarly, a well described effect of Dlp over-expression is inhibition of the Wg-target <i>senseless (sens)</i> (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yan et al., 2009</a>). We found that expression of Dlp in the posterior compartment resulted in no detectable Sens protein, which could be substantially restored by Pent co-expression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). It has recently been shown that one of the functions of glypicans in Wnt signalling is to act as a platform upon which Notum can deacylate Wnt proteins, reducing their signalling potency (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kakugawa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, reducing the levels of glypicans has been shown to effectively restore defects in wing morphology caused by over-expression of Notum (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kakugawa et al., 2015</a>). We reasoned that if our hypothesis that Pent internalises glypicans is correct, then expression of Pent should similarly reduce the effects of Notum over-expression. When Notum was expressed with spaltGal4, substantial regions of the distal adult wing were missing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Co-expression of Pent suppressed this phenotype, restoring wings to a wild type shape, although some vein defects related to Dpp signalling perturbations remained. From these data we conclude that by modulating glypican levels, Pent impacts on Wg signalling activity."

From the data presented here, we propose that Pent reduces the co-receptor function of glypicans by binding them and inducing their internalisation. We suggest that Pent may promote spreading of Dpp by reducing Dpp co-receptors and therefore Dpp trapping and signal transduction. Internalisation of glypicans is independent of signalling and Dpp itself, which fits the model that removal of glypicans by Pent enhances spreading. Furthermore, we have presented data showing that by regulating glypican levels, Pent is also able to modulate Wingless signalling."

Glypicans share physical properties, notably a GPI anchor and heparan sulphate side chains, upon which Pent binds. We have shown that internalisation of glypicans by Pent requires dynamin and Rab5 but not clathrin. Cell culture experiments have shown that GPI proteins are commonly endocytosed via clathrin independent mechanisms, but this has not been demonstrated before in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Johannes et al., 2015</a>). Many clathrin independent mechanisms have been described in cultured cells, but in vivo evidence for many of them is lacking (<a href=\"#bib35\">Johannes 2015</a>).

While Pent does not bind to Tkv directly and Pent over-expression seems not to affect the levels of membrane bound Tkv, a substantial amount of the receptor is found in Pent- and Dally positive endocytic vesicles. This raises the possibility that Pent might target a specific subpopulation of Tkv for degradation, and that this interaction requires glypicans as adaptors."

Glypicans, in particular Dally, have been shown to regulate the spreading of Dpp, in addition to being essential for Dpp signal transduction itself. The molecular basis for these activities is the binding of Dpp to the heparan sulphate side-chains of glypicans, probably a first step that serves to concentrate Dpp at the surface of the disc epithelium. Glypican-bound Dpp molecules can follow multiple routes, as they can be passed to receptors (promoting signalling), to glypicans of neighbouring cells (promoting ligand dispersion), or can persist on glypicans of the same cell resulting in local ligand enrichment. It is probable that the specific outcome at any position along the morphogen field will depend on the relative levels and activities of the involved factors, i.e. the ligand, receptors and glypicans. A similar balance between glypicans, receptors and ligands has been proposed to explain the biphasic activity of Dlp in Wg signalling in the wing imaginal disc (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yan et al., 2009</a>). In the case of Dpp, levels of glypicans need to be tightly regulated to allow for the optimal balance between ligand release, trapping and receptor binding. Our data suggest that Pent contributes to this balance by fine-tuning the levels of glypicans (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> for a model). We propose that in the absence of Pent, glypican levels are too high and this results in excessive ligand trapping and enhanced local signalling. Such local effects would be accompanied with a non-autonomous reduction in ligand spreading and shrinkage of the pMad gradient. An approximation mimicking this situation is artificially elevating levels of Dally in medial regions, which has been shown to locally increase pMad (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fujise et al., 2003</a>). We have shown here that this increase in signalling by Dally is at the expense of Dpp spreading to the rest of the disc and the formation of the long range pMad gradient (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). This clearly shows that excess Dally can block spreading of Dpp. Notably, <i>pent</i> mutants display a similarly compacted activity gradient with high medial and low lateral pMad levels. Importantly, ligand-binding properties of HSPGs have been described to impede ligand spreading in multiple physiological contexts, including BMP4 in <i>Xenopus</i> early dorso-ventral patterning and FGF10 in its role in branching morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Makarenkova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ohkawara et al., 2002</a>)."

In the absence of Pent (left), glypican levels on cell surfaces increase. Elevated co-receptor levels enhance local signalling but, at the same time, 'over-trap' Dpp and reduce the pool of ligand that would be available for movement and long-range dispersion. In contrast, excessive levels of Pent (as in our over-expression studies) cause a drastic depletion of surface exposed glypicans (right). As a consequence, and similar to glypican loss-of function conditions, cells fail to bind Dpp and signalling is reduced. Between these two extremes (middle), an optimal concentration of Pent ensures for glypican levels that are high enough to promote signalling but not too high to cause local trapping and 'over-consumption' of Dpp. Thus, in the context of long-range gradient formation, we suggest that adjustable levels of Pent titrate glypicans to ensure for the optimal trade-off between ligands channelled into signalling and ligands available for movement along the morphogen field (see text for details)."

Primary amongst these is the repression of Tkv and Dally transcription by Dpp signalling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crickmore and Mann, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fujise et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lecuit and Cohen, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tanimoto et al., 2000</a>). This ensures that receptor and co-receptor levels are low near the Dpp producing cells, allowing Dpp to spread out from the centre of the disc. These feedback loops are important for proper establishment of the Dpp signalling gradient. However, such direct feedbacks targeting the production of molecules with ligand-binding properties may have limitations. In response to a reduction in spreading of Dpp, Tkv and Dally levels would increase to locally compensate the reduction in Dpp signalling activity. Such an increase would, however, further enhance trapping and internalisation of the ligand and, at the level of the whole wing disc, would further block Dpp spreading. From our data we suggest that Pent, a secreted negative regulator of Dpp signalling, fine-tunes the signalling gradient at a different level, by directly adjusting glypican levels and reducing the inbuilt increase in co-receptor and ligand-trapping upon a reduction in the extent of the pMad gradient. This might happen at a critical region of the wing disc, the mediolateral cells, where declining levels of the spreading ligand face increasing levels of the receptor and co-receptor (Tkv and Dally, respectively). Pent, secreted by lateral cells next to this region, could reduce the glypican pool to allow Dpp to overcome excessive ligand trapping and thus promote further spreading. Consistent with such a 'remote' activity, Pent can be detected throughout the wing disc. As Pent is transcriptionally repressed by Dpp signalling and, unlike Tkv and Dally, does not bind Dpp, Pent might be a good candidate for how the system overcomes the inherent limitations of feedback loops involving membrane tethered, Dpp-binding proteins."

Similarly, our data show that excess Pent internalises glypicans and reduces extracellular Wg. Precise in vitro assays have shown that low levels of Dlp enhance Wg signalling, but too much Dlp reduces signalling (<a href=\"#bib21\">Franch-Marro et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yan et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, recent evidence shows that deacylation of Wg by Notum, which reduces Wg signalling activity, requires glypicans (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kakugawa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). It is clear, then, that the level of glypicans must be very finely balanced for Wg signalling to be at the correct level. We propose that the elevated glypican levels observed in the absence of Pent push this fine balance towards inhibition of signalling, due to the increased levels of glypicans sequestering Wg away from the receptor and also increasing the platform upon which Notum can deacylate Wg. Consistent with this conclusion, the effects of Notum and Dlp over-expression can be suppressed by increasing the level of Pent protein."

The authors previously identified pentagon (<i>pent</i>), a secreted feedback factor involved in Dpp morphogen gradient formation. <i>pent</i> expression is repressed by <i>dpp</i> signalling and Pent protein enhances Dpp morphogen spreading, potentially through binding to dally. However, the mechanism by which Pent regulates the Dpp morphogen gradient shape remained unclear. In this study, the authors find that over-expression of Pent can cause internalization of Dally or Dlp in a Dynamin and Rab5 dependent manner. This effect seems specific to dally and dlp, since Tkv or Punt levels are not influenced by Pent. Based on these results, mainly from over-expression experiments, the authors suggest that Pent-mediated Dally and Dlp internalization and degradation promotes Dpp dispersal and morphogen gradient expansion. As they found that Pent-induced endocytosis of Dally and Dlp the authors expand their analysis to explore a role for Pent in the Wg signaling."

Although over-expression of Dally in the stripe of Dpp producing cells at the anterior-posterior border can inhibit Dpp signaling (p-Mad) outside of the stripe, inhibition of Dpp dispersal by Dally in the physiological condition has not been shown previously and is not directly addressed in the current study."

Indeed, it has been shown that overexpression or loss of Dally broadens or narrows the p-Mad gradient respectively, and clones mutant for dally inhibit p-Mad signal behind clones (Belenkaya et al., Cell, 2004), which seems opposite to their interpretation."

If Dally over-expression inhibits Dpp dispersal one would expect that the <i>pent</i> mutant phenotype is rescued in pent dally double mutant. In the same paper, the authors showed that Dpp stability is significantly reduced in pent mutants. How can Pent-mediated Dally internalization lead to stabilization of Dpp?

Is it right that the authors suggest that internalization of glypicans facilitates Dpp dispersal but inhibits Wg dispersal? If so, what might be the reason for this opposing behavior?

If indeed the protein stability is affected in the <i>pent</i> mutant, pulse-chase experiment staining extracellular Dally or Dlp should show longer half-lifes for these proteins.

If Tkv-Rab7 endosomes are present in the whole disc, then it is simpler to explain why Pent OE does not deplete Tkv, and suggests that the colocalization with Pent (and Dally) is due to later fusion events away from the plasma membrane. A further way to interrogate the uptake of Tkv and Dally+Pent would be to repeat the dependence experiment with clathrin on Tkv puncta formation. (I realize it is hard to see Tkv puncta in many parts of the disc, but is feasible in the medial anterior region, like in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>.) If they have different mechanisms, this would mean they are distinct pathways and may lead to interesting ideas about how Tkv co-receptor interactions influence internalization."

The expansion-repression model seems more about scaling, but the description near the end of the discussion frames it as preventing a trapping/sharpening tendency built into the system by the other feedback mechanisms involving Tkv and Dally expression. It may be simple semantics, but both of these angles seem important when thinking about a morphogen gradient."

But there is a general shortcoming perhaps due to the predominant overexpression experimental setting: The reader is left with a good grasp regarding the biological consequences of excess Pent, but with less appreciation on the glypican/Pent balance and its role on signaling when the protein levels are low. Within this frame, it would be more intuitive to assess the signaling outcome as a function of protein concentration and relative level. Such a discussion, or even a schematic representation, could be very helpful in describing the proposed roles for Pent-Glypican in modulation of BMP and Wg signaling and conveying the authors' thoughts on the multiple layers of regulation suggested by their data. \""
