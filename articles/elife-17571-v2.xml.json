                    "text": "Vesicle fusion is mediated by an assembly of SNARE proteins between opposing membranes, but it is unknown whether transmembrane domains (TMDs) of SNARE proteins serve mechanistic functions that go beyond passive anchoring of the force-generating SNAREpin to the fusing membranes. Here, we show that conformational flexibility of synaptobrevin-2 TMD is essential for efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis and actively promotes membrane fusion as well as fusion pore expansion. Specifically, the introduction of helix-stabilizing leucine residues within the TMD region spanning the vesicle\u2019s outer leaflet strongly impairs exocytosis and decelerates fusion pore dilation. In contrast, increasing the number of helix-destabilizing, \u00df-branched valine or isoleucine residues within the TMD restores normal secretion but accelerates fusion pore expansion beyond the rate found for the wildtype protein. These observations provide evidence that the synaptobrevin-2 TMD catalyzes the fusion process by its structural flexibility, actively setting the pace of fusion pore expansion."

Here, we show that conformational flexibility of synaptobrevin-2 TMD is essential for efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis and actively promotes membrane fusion as well as fusion pore expansion. Specifically, the introduction of helix-stabilizing leucine residues within the TMD region spanning the vesicle\u2019s outer leaflet strongly impairs exocytosis and decelerates fusion pore dilation. In contrast, increasing the number of helix-destabilizing, \u00df-branched valine or isoleucine residues within the TMD restores normal secretion but accelerates fusion pore expansion beyond the rate found for the wildtype protein. These observations provide evidence that the synaptobrevin-2 TMD catalyzes the fusion process by its structural flexibility, actively setting the pace of fusion pore expansion."

When a neuron receives an electrical impulse, this ultimately triggers the vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the gap between the neurons. This process is known as exocytosis. Other cells called neuroendocrine cells, which can receive signals from neurons, also undergo exocytosis to release chemicals into the bloodstream."

The results show that in both neurons and a type of neuroendocrine cell called chromaffin cells, exocytosis is significantly reduced and the fusion pores open more slowly when the transmembrane domain is less flexible. By contrast, exocytosis occurs normally when the transmembrane domain is more flexible; however, the fusion pore expands more rapidly than normal."

                        "text": "SNARE-mediated membrane fusion comprises a series of mechanistic steps requiring both protein-protein as well as protein-lipid interactions. Protein-protein interactions involving SNARE proteins in the fusion process have been explored in great detail (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</a>), but the functional role of SNARE-lipid interplay has remained enigmatic. Previous studies provided conflicting views on the requirement of proteinaceous membrane anchors of SNARE proteins for efficient neurotransmitter release or vacuole-vacuole fusion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fdez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Grote et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pieren et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rohde et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). Even more unclear is how a proteinaceous TMD may regulate the membrane fusion process. Experiments in reduced model systems have suggested that lipidic SNARE-anchors are inefficient in driving proper fusion between artificial liposomes (<a href=\"#bib56\">McNew et al., 2000</a>), cells expressing \u2018flipped\u2019 SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Giraudo et al., 2005</a>), or between liposomes and lipid nanodiscs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Shi et al., 2012</a>). However, these experiments were unable to track kinetic intermediates <i>en route</i> to fusion (e.g. priming, triggering or fusion pore expansion) leaving the questions unanswered whether and if so, at which step TMDs of SNARE proteins may regulate fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis and membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fang and Lindau, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Langosch et al., 2007</a>). In comparison to other single-pass transmembrane proteins, SNARE TMDs are characterized by an overrepresentation of \u00df-branched amino acids (e.g. valine and isoleucine, ~40% of all residues [<a href=\"#bib45\">Langosch et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Neumann and Langosch, 2011</a>]), which renders the helix backbone conformationally flexible (<a href=\"#bib30\">Han et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Quint et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Stelzer et al., 2008</a>). In an \u03b1-helix, non-\u00df-branched residues like leucine can rapidly switch between rotameric states, which favor van der Waals interactions with their i \u00b1 3 and i \u00b1 4 neighbors, thereby forming a scaffold of side chain interactions that defines helix stability (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lacroix et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Quint et al., 2010</a>). Steric restraints acting on the side chains of \u00df-branched amino acids (like valine and isoleucine) instead favor i \u00b1 4 over i \u00b1 3 interactions leading to local packing deficiencies and backbone flexibility. In vitro experiments have suggested that membrane-inserted short peptides mimicking SNARE TMDs (without a cytoplasmic SNARE motif) exhibit a significant fusion-enhancing effect on synthetic liposomes depending on their content of \u00df-branched amino acids (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hofmann et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Langosch et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, simulation studies have shown an inherent propensity of the SNARE TMDs or the viral hemagglutinin fusion peptide to disturb lipid packing, facilitating lipid splay and formation of an initial lipid bridge between opposing membranes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kasson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Markvoort and Marrink, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Risselada et al., 2011</a>)."

In a gain-of-function approach TMD mutants were virally expressed in v-SNARE deficient adrenal chromaffin cells (dko cells), which are nearly devoid of exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Borisovska et al., 2005</a>). By using a combination of high resolution electrophysiological methods (membrane capacitance measurements, amperometry) and molecular dynamics simulations, we have characterized the effects of the mutations in order to delineate syb2 TMD functions in membrane fusion. Our results indicate an active, fusion promoting role of the syb2 TMD and suggest that structural flexibility of the N-terminal TMD region catalyzes fusion initiation and fusion pore expansion at the millisecond time scale. Thus, SNARE proteins do not only act as force generators by continuous molecular straining, but also facilitate membrane merger via structural flexibility of their TMDs. The results further pinpoint a hitherto unrecognized mechanism wherein TMDs of v-SNARE isoforms with a high content of \u00df-branched amino acids are employed for efficient fusion pore expansion of larger sized vesicles, suggesting a general physiological significance of TMD flexibility in exocytosis."

Replacing the syb2 TMD by a poly-leucine helix (polyL) strongly reduced the ability of the syb2 mutant to rescue secretion in v-SNARE deficient chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Indeed, a\u00a0detailed kinetic analysis of the capacitance changes revealed that both components of the exocytotic burst, the rapidly releasable pool (RRP) and the slowly releasable pool (SRP), were similarly diminished, and the sustained rate of secretion was reduced, but no changes in exocytosis timing were observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The similar relative decrease in both, the RRP and the SRP component, could indicate that the polyL mutation interferes with upstream processes like the priming reaction leading to impaired pool formation and reduced exocytosis competence. By studying SNARE complex assembly with recombinant proteins, we found that the polyL variant affects neither the rate nor the extent of SNARE complex formation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This renders the possibility unlikely that the mutant syb2 TMD allosterically affects the upstream SNARE motif leading to altered interaction with its cognate SNARE partners. Thus, the secretion deficiency in polyL expressing cells is not due to impaired SNARE complex formation, i.e. by causing changes in vesicle priming, but rather reflects defective vesicle fusion."

The polyL variant not only lowered the frequency of exocytotic events but also profoundly slowed transmitter release from the vesicle, compatible with the phenotype of a fusion mutant. The release events were characterized by a decreased amplitude and increased rise-time as well as half-width of the amperometric signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). In clear contrast, expression of either polyV or polyI variant accelerated catecholamine release compared to controls, as indicated by significantly higher spike amplitudes, reduced rise-times and half-width values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Evidently, modifying the content of \u00df-branched amino acids within the TMD causes correlated changes in spike waveform, even producing a gain-of-function phenotype in pore expansion kinetics for TMDs enriched in \u00df-branched residues. Moreover, TMD mutations also affected the prespike signal and its current fluctuations, which report transient changes in neurotransmitter flux through the early fusion pore (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kesavan et al., 2007</a>). The polyL mutation prolonged the expansion time of the initial fusion pore, lowered its current amplitude and diminished fluctuations in the signal time-course compared with the wildtype protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The polyV and polyI variants shortened prespike duration, increased its amplitude, and current fluctuations. Taken together, the polyL and poly I/V mutants oppositely affect both, the prespike and the spike phase of transmitter discharge, implying that conformational properties of the syb2 TMD govern the fusion process from the\u00a0opening of the nascent fusion pore to its final expansion."

To further investigate this mechanism we studied the\u00a0structure and dynamics of the TMD mutants using molecular dynamics simulations of the C-terminal region of syb2 (residues 71\u2013116). Based on the X-ray crystallographic structure (<a href=\"#bib79\">Stein et al., 2009</a>), syb2 and its mutant variants were embedded in an asymmetric membrane (mimicking the physiological lipid composition of synaptic vesicles [<a href=\"#bib75\">Sharma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>]) and structural flexibility was calculated from the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the backbone atoms for each peptide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The results show that conformational flexibility of the TMD region is significantly lowered in the polyL and increased in the polyV variant compared with the wildtype protein. Similarly, changes in the root mean square displacement (RMSD) of the C\u03b1-atoms relative to an ideal \u03b1-helix (syb2 0.104 \u00b1 0.004 nm; polyL 0.067 \u00b1 0.003 nm, p&lt;0.001; polyV 0.139 \u00b1 0.005 nm, p&lt;0.001, one-way analysis of variance versus syb2) are paralleled by alterations in \u03b1-helix content of syb2 TMD (79 \u00b1 0.56%) and its variants (polyL 83 \u00b1 0.56%, and polyV 65 \u00b1 5.6%). Taken together, changing the frequency of \u00df-branched residues within the syb2 TMD substantially varies conformational flexibility, which clearly correlates with alterations in the kinetics of the nascent fusion pore as well as in the spike waveform. Overall, these data provide strong evidence that structural features of v-SNARE TMDs are crucial for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis, enabling TMDs to actively promote the fusion process."

For parameters describing the main spike kinetics we found a clear proportionality between the speed of catecholamine discharge and the number of \u00df-branched residues near the N-terminal end of the TMD helix (rise-time, r<sup>2</sup>=\u00a00.95; half-width r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.96, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Moreover, the pre-spike duration is progressively shortened by increasing the fraction of \u00df-branched residue in the N-terminal half of the TMD (r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.93) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Following the same line, we also found a strong correlation between the frequency of pre-spike current fluctuations of the mutant variants and their valine/isoleucine-content (r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.96). Evidently, increasing or decreasing the number of \u00df-branched amino acids in the TMD oppositely controls conformational flexibility in the TMD helix (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and the rate of cargo release from single vesicle. These findings provide strong evidence for a mechanistic link between TMD flexibility and the kinetics of fusion pore expansion. However, deviating from this pattern, total secretion in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-infusion and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uncaging experiments was not further potentiated beyond the wildtype response by increasing the fraction of \u00df-branched residues within the N-terminal half of the TMD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Most likely, docking and priming reactions become rate-limiting (<a href=\"#bib78\">Sorensen, 2009</a>), thereby preventing the\u00a0total release to exceed wildtype levels."

This finding has been interpreted as evidence that v-SNARE TMDs are functionally interchangeable with lipidic membrane anchors. Opposing this view, a recent study showed that the same lipid-anchored syb2 provides little support for spontaneous synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chang et al., 2016</a>). We also found that this acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein was largely inefficient in reconstituting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells (21% of syb2, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>), albeit showing similar expression levels and sorting to granules as the wildtype protein (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, while expression of syb2-CSP raises secretion significantly over the level of the dko (2% of syb2), the phenotype is still more severe than the secretion deficits seen with the polyL variant (35% of syb2, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>), reconfirming that the proteinaceous membrane anchor provides an autonomous facilitating function in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis. Furthermore, like the polyL mutant, the lipid-anchored syb2 prolonged the time course of transmitter discharge during the spike phase (without changing the event charge) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) and even more strongly slowed down kinetics of the early fusion pore (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>). Collectively, these results highlight the important role of the proteinaceous syb2 membrane anchor in membrane fusion, generally facilitating fusion initiation and pore expansion. Our data obtained with the acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein appear to deviate from the previously reported results by <a href=\"#bib91\">Zhou et al. (2013)</a>, wherein the mutant protein significantly rescued synaptic transmission compared to a syb2-RST-mVenus construct serving as control. However, as reported by <a href=\"#bib14\">Chang et al. (2016)</a>, the syb2-RST-mVenus construct does not support wildtype like fusion both, in neurons and neuroendocrine cells due to the presence of a positively charged arginine residue in the C-terminal end of the syb2 TMD. Indeed, a previous study has shown that insertion of charged residues in the C-terminal end of the syb2 TMD impairs the release response (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ngatchou et al., 2010</a>). Consequently, the reduced ability of the syb2-RST-mVenus construct to rescue neuronal exocytosis may have led to an overestimation of the acylated syb2-CSP response providing an explanation for the apparently discrepant results."

Viral expression of the polyV mutant rescued evoked synaptic transmission to the level of wildtype cells, while the polyL mutant largely failed to support neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>), which is reminiscent of our findings in neuroendocrine cells. Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that polyL and polyV mutant proteins were indeed targeted to synaptic vesicles with comparable efficiency as the wildtype protein (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013G</a>). To test whether the flexibility of the syb2 TMD is also critical for quantal signaling, we recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the presence of 1\u00a0\u00b5M TTX using mass cultures of hippocampal neurons. Compared with the wildtype syb2 protein, expression of the polyL mutant in syb2 ko neurons significantly reduced the frequency of spontaneous events, whereas the polyV mutant fully rescued spontaneous release (ko+syb2: 1.46 \u00b1 0.24\u2009Hz, n\u00a0=\u00a052; ko+polyL: 0.49 \u00b1 0.12\u2009Hz, n\u00a0=\u00a023; ko+polyV: 1.42 \u00b1 0.31, n\u00a0=\u00a021). Notably, the frequency of mEPSCs recorded for the polyL mutant is more than 20fold higher compared to syb2 ko neurons (0.02 \u00b1 0.005\u2009Hz, n\u00a0=\u00a08), emphasizing the gain-of-function phenotype of the TMD mutant. In contrast, we failed to detect significant alterations in the mean amplitude of the polyL or polyV-mediated mEPSCs compared with the wildtype controls. Potential changes in the release profile of small synaptic vesicles (SSVs) may be masked by dendritic filtering of the receptor-mediated response. Moreover, release from SSVs might be less dependent on TMD-mediated acceleration of fusion pore expansion due to the high curvature of the vesicle, as will be discussed below."

By systematically changing the structural flexibility of the syb2 TMD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we observed secretion phenotypes that highlight the functional impact of the TMD at various stages of membrane fusion. Our experiments provide first evidence that the syb2 TMD plays an active role in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis, acting as a\u00a0crucial catalyst for membrane merger and fusion pore.

Neither the overall expression level nor colocalization analyses with the intrinsic marker protein cellubrevin delivered evidence for inefficient sorting of the different mutant proteins to chromaffin granules, thus attributing potential fusion deficits to changes in TMD-mediated function (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). An exciting interpretation of our data is that TMD mutations may change protein-lipid interactions during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion by altering the conformational dynamics of the helical backbone. Indeed, previous NMR-studies have shown that increasing the content of \u00df-branched amino acids of TMD mimic peptides profoundly enhanced lipid mobility and wobbling of lipid head groups (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2007</a>). Hydrophobic nucleation events, in which lipid tails from opposite membranes initially interconnect the adjacent leaflets, have been identified as a highly energy-demanding step <i>en route</i> to fusion (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kasson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Risselada et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Smirnova et al., 2010</a>). The reduced fusogenicity of vesicles in chromaffin cells expressing either rigid polyL or lipid anchored syb2 variants indicates that the interplay between flexible SNARE TMDs and surrounding lipids could promote hydrophobic tail protrusion and thereby fusion initiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Indeed, our results are supported by previous in vitro work, showing that isolated SNARE TMDs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Langosch et al., 2001</a>) or syb2-juxtamemembrane region-TMD constructs (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tarafdar et al., 2015</a>) facilitate liposome-liposome fusion. A similar dependence on protein-lipid interactions for membrane fusion has previously been observed with viral fusogens (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kasson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tamm et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis and viral fusion engage common mechanisms to drive membrane fusion. Given that the formation of an initial lipid stalk is generally observed in direct vicinity of SNARE TMDs in MD simulations (<a href=\"#bib70\">Risselada et al., 2011</a>), TMD-rigidifying mutations (e.g. polyL mutation) may lower the probability of lipid splay and thereby produce more unsuccessful fusion attempts with vesicles arrested in a trapped state prior to membrane merger. As fusion mutants are usually expected to slow down stimulus secretion coupling, a scenario where vesicles are led into a trapped state would explain why helix-rigidifying mutations do not alter the kinetics of the exocytotic burst component (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Regardless of the exact underlying mechanism, our results support a model wherein conformational flexibility of a proteinaceous v-SNARE TMD is required to surmount the energy barrier for initial membrane merger."

Since bilayer bending mechanics allow pores of smaller vesicles to expand more rapidly (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alvarez de Toledo et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chizmadzhev et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhang and Jackson, 2010</a>), increasing the content of \u00df-branched amino acids in the v-SNARE TMD can ease the expansion of a lipidic pore for larger vesicles as they fuse. Our results show that systematically changing the number of helix-destabilizing, \u00df-branched valine or isoleucine residues in the syb2 TMD leads to correlated changes in fusion pore behavior. In particular, increasing the number of \u00df-branched residues within the N-terminal half of the TMD causes an unprecedented gain-of-function phenotype, wherein fusion pore dilation is even accelerated beyond the rate found for the wildtype protein, emphasizing the key role of structural dynamics of the syb2 TMD in membrane fusion. Both, substitution of the syb2 TMD with a lipid anchor or with rigidifying leucine residues strongly slowed down kinetics of transmitter discharge, demonstrating the inherent propensity of the\u00a0syb2 TMD to promote fusion pore expansion. An attractive explanation for this phenomenon could be that structural flexibility within the N-terminal half of the syb2 TMD counters the highly negative curvature of the membrane\u2019s outer leaflet to drive expansion of the narrow fusion pore neck (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound synaptotagmin-1 (syt1) induces positive curvature to the cytoplasmic leaflets of the fusing membranes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hui et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Martens et al., 2007</a>) and thereby may destabilize the early fusion pore (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dhara et al., 2014</a>). In this context, it stands to reason that SNARE force-mediated membrane straining (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kozlov et al., 2010</a>) and TMD-mediated lipid perturbation together with syt1\u2019s ability to bend membranes are synergistic mechanisms that provide mutual reinforcement to form a nascent lipid bridge between membranes and to drive subsequent pore expansion."

Furthermore, TMD variants furnishing hydrophobic, identical residues can rescue (polyLV, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) or even speed up (polyV and polyI) transmitter discharge, albeit these helices neither exhibit any polarity nor asymmetry with respect to the side-chain volume of residues that could generate different surfaces of the putative proteinaceous pore."

Yet, several lines of evidence render the possibility unlikely that such a scenario is responsible for functional deficits observed with the TMD mutants. First, the\u00a0complete substitution of syx interacting residues in syb2 TMD with valine (or isoleucine) had no effect on the total secretion and even accelerated fusion pore expansion compared with the wildtype protein. Secondly, the polyV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and the polyLV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) mutants exhibited different kinetics of fusion pore expansion, even though the crucial amino acids I98, I102 and I106 were substituted by valine residues in both mutant variants. These results counter the view that perturbations of \u2018lock and key\u2019 like protein-protein interactions between syb and syx TMD are responsible for the functional effects of the TMD mutants. Third, neither short insertions of amino acids (e.g. 2 residue KL insertion) nor insertion of 2 helix breaking proline residues, immediately upstream of the syb2 TMD (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kesavan et al., 2007</a>), which should interfere with N- to C-terminal zipping of SNAREs into the bilayer spanning helical bundle, were found to affect overall secretion or fusion pore properties. Even a 5 amino acid insertion had no functional consequences on fusion pore dynamics (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kesavan et al., 2007</a>). These results together with the strong fusion deficits observed for polyL and polyL-Nt mutants suggest thatconformational flexibility of the syb2 TMD (within the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane) rather than defined protein-protein interactions upon progressive zipping of syb2/syx TMDs facilitates secretion and fusion pore expansion. Thus, heterodimerization between v- and t-SNARE TMDs likely succeeds but does not promote fusion pore opening and expansion. Notably, single point mutations (G100L, V101A, V112A, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), may similarly change\u00a0structural flexibility of the TMD. Yet, given the observed proportionality between the number of \u00df-branched amino acids and fusion pore parameters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), they are not expected to detectably affect fusion pore dynamics."

The observed systematic dependency of fusion pore dynamics on the number of \u00df-branched amino acids in the syb2 TMD raises the question whether structural flexibility of TMDs indeed varies among other v-SNARE isoforms and thus could facilitate cargo release in the context of diverse physiological processes. Interestingly, v-SNARE isoforms responsible for exocytosis of differentially-sized secretory vesicles show a considerable degree of variability regarding the content of \u00df-branched amino acids within the N-terminal half of their TMDs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). v-SNARE proteins, like VAMP7 and VAMP8, contain more than 70% \u00df-branched amino acids within this TMD region and thereby are well-suited for exocytosis of large zymogen granules and mast cell vesicles facilitating rapid pore expansion and release of their bulky cargo molecules such as interferon (<a href=\"#bib42\">Krzewski et al., 2011</a>) and hexoaminidase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lippert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wang et al., 2004</a>). Others, like cellubrevin (VAMP3) or syb2 (VAMP2), with an intermediate content of \u00df-branched amino acids (33% and 44%, respectively), are responsible for exocytosis of smaller-sized vesicles such as chromaffin granules (<a href=\"#bib9\">Borisovska et al., 2005</a>), cytotoxic T-cell lytic granules (<a href=\"#bib55\">Matti et al., 2013</a>) or small-synaptic vesicles (SSV) (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schoch et al., 2001</a>), whereas syb1 with only 22% \u00df-branched amino acids preferentially mediates SSV exocytosis to release classical neurotransmitters at the NMJ (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the number of helix-destabilizing \u00df-branched amino acids within the N-terminal half of different v-SNARE TMDs appears to be evolutionary adapted to the size of vesicles to catalyze fusion pore expansion and facilitate bona fide cargo release. Such a mechanism could also tip the balance between an expanding or non-expanding fusion pore, on the one hand ensuring efficient discharge of bulky cargo molecules from large vesicles and on the other hand favoring release of small cargo as well as rapid recycling of SSVs by reducing the likelihood of complete merger with the plasma membrane."

Briefly, the atomistic structure was converted into a coarse-grained (CG) representation using a PerlScript file adapting the Martini coarse-graining method (<a href=\"#bib59\">Monticelli et al., 2008</a>). The CG protein was positioned at the center of a box with dimensions of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 11 nm along with overlapping boxes of randomly placed cytoplasmic (CP) lipids and intravesicular (IV) lipids. The composition of CP lipids was 22 Palmitoyl-Oleoyl-PS (POPS), 76 Palmitoyl-Oleoyl-PE (POPE) and 92 cholesterol (CHOL) molecules and IV lipids was 22 Palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (PPCS), 66 Palmitoyl-Oleoyl-PC (POPC) and 52 CHOL. The resulting lipid box was filled with CG water and an appropriate number of Na<sup>+</sup> ions were added to preserve electro-neutrality.

The CG simulations were analyzed for tilt angle of syb2 transmembrane domain and location of WW domain with respect to the phosphate groups of the membrane. The martini force field employs secondary structure constraints that do not allow changes in conformational states.

After this short equilibration, three 40 ns long production simulations were performed for the wildtype starting from different random velocities.

Electrostatic interactions were calculated at every step with the particle-mesh Ewald method (<a href=\"#bib20\">Essmann et al., 1995</a>) with real-space cutoff of 1.0 nm. The van der Waals interactions were cut off at 1.4 nm. All simulations were carried out with the GROMACS package version 4.6, (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pronk et al., 2013</a>). Analyses were performed by using utilities within the GROMACS package. The secondary structure analyses were carried out using the dictionary of secondary structure of proteins (DSSP) method (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kabsch and Sander, 1983</a>)."

Stein et al. 2009 conclude that at least 10 amino acids interact with the Syntaxin linker/TMD, most of them in the syb TMD. This issue is insufficiently addressed. First, the experiments in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> do not address this issue critically. The results of these experiments are completely dominated by the interactions in the SNARE-domains, which are not altered and therefore really not expected to be changed (as the authors observed). This should be clearly indicated in the text. Second, the paper does not sufficiently address possible effects of Syb2 mutagenesis on interaction with the Syntaxin linker and TMD domains. When do the authors think these domains come together? Can the mutagenesis in Syb2 alter the previously predicted interactions? And can this help to explain differences in fusion pore opening? In the Discussion the authors conclude that \"TMD mutations may change protein-lipid interactions during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion\". What about protein-protein interactions? The Discussion mentions several more 'exotic' protein-protein interactions, such as proteinacious pore and homotypic interactions but not syb-syx. This should be discussed."

The kinetics of release are very similar, suggesting that the whole release process is scaled down or that the number of release sites is strongly reduced. There is no explanation for this important finding and it is not addressed in the Discussion."

It is not clear what exactly the basis is for this statement. It seems likely that, since zippering starts at the N-terminals and then proceeds until the TMD, the TMD plays a rather passive role and simply follows the rest of the proteins. For the interpretation it seems not essential to make these claims. The authors should either provide clear experimental evidence/reasoning for this conclusion or adjust the conclusions."

However, as outlined already under point #1) and described in the first paragraph of the subsection \u201cStabilization of the syb2 TMD helix diminishes synchronous secretion\u201d, we find no evidence of impaired SNARE complex formation with polyL mutant. In contrast, our MD simulations provide significant evidence for altered conformational flexibility of the polyL TMD that can be held responsible for the reduced fusion activity of the protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In good agreement, previous NMR-studies have shown that increasing the content of \u00df-branched amino acids of TMD mimic peptides profoundly enhanced lipid mobility and wobbling of lipid head groups (Agrawal et al., 2010; Agrawal et al., 2007), which could lower the energy barrier for fusion. Furthermore, our results are supported by previous in vitro work, showing that isolated SNARE TMDs (Langosch et al., 2001) in the absence of any cytoplasmic domain of syb2 facilitate liposome-liposome fusion. Overall, these data provide strong evidence that structural features of v-SNARE TMDs are crucial for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis, enabling TMDs to actively promote the fusion process."

This conclusion is further substantiated by the experimental evidence outlined under point #2). In addition, a similar reduction in exocytosis and slowing of fusion pore kinetics was observed by replacing the syb2 TMD with an acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein confirming that conformational flexibility of a proteinaceous v-SNARE TMD is required for fusion. Moreover, an unprecedented gain of function phenotype accelerating the kinetics of fusion pore expansion beyond the rate of wildtype cells was seen with three different TMD mutants (polyV, polyI and polyI-Nt mutants). This further underlines an active, fusion promoting role of the syb2 TMD that clearly goes beyond simple membrane anchoring.
