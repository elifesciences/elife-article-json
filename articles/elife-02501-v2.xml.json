The physiological necessity of these quality control mechanisms in different environments remains unclear, as the cost vs benefit of accurate protein synthesis is difficult to predict. We show that in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, a non-coded amino acid produced through oxidative damage is a significant threat to the accuracy of protein synthesis and must be cleared by phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase in order to prevent cellular toxicity caused by mis-synthesized proteins. These findings demonstrate how stress can lead to the accumulation of non-canonical amino acids that must be excluded from the proteome in order to maintain cellular viability."

The physiological necessity of these quality control mechanisms in different environments remains unclear, as the cost vs benefit of accurate protein synthesis is difficult to predict. We show that in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, a non-coded amino acid produced through oxidative damage is a significant threat to the accuracy of protein synthesis and must be cleared by phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase in order to prevent cellular toxicity caused by mis-synthesized proteins. These findings demonstrate how stress can lead to the accumulation of non-canonical amino acids that must be excluded from the proteome in order to maintain cellular viability."

The amino acids that make up a particular protein, and the order they appear in, are determined by the gene that encodes that protein. First, the gene is transcribed to produce a molecule of messenger RNA, which is then translated by a molecular machine called a ribosome. This involves other RNA molecules, called transfer RNAs (tRNAs), bringing the correct amino acids to the ribosome, which then joins the amino acids together to build the protein."

                        "text": "The faithful translation of mRNA into the corresponding protein sequence is an essential step in gene expression. The accuracy of translation depends on the precise pairing of mRNA codons with their cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs, containing the corresponding anticodons, during ribosomal protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zaher and Green, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rodnina, 2012</a>). Cognate amino acids are attached to their respective tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), and the ability of these enzymes to distinguish between cognate and non-cognate substrates is a major determinant of the fidelity of the genetic code. AaRSs discriminate against near- and non-cognate tRNAs at levels compatible with typical translation error rates (\u223c10<sup>\u22124</sup>) due to the structural complexity and diversity observed between tRNA isoacceptors. AaRSs can less successfully discriminate against near-cognate amino acids, which may differ from the cognate substrate by as little as a single methyl or hydroxyl group. Errors during amino acid recognition do not usually compromise the accuracy of translation due to highly specific aaRS enzymes, and the widespread existence of editing mechanisms that proofread non-cognate amino acids. For example, phenylalanine tRNA synthetase (PheRS) edits mischarged Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> at a hydrolytic editing site \u223c30 \u00c5 from the synthetic active site (<a href=\"#bib38\">Roy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kotik-Kogan et al., 2005</a>). PheRS editing provides a key checkpoint in quality control, as mischarged Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> is readily delivered to the ribosome by EF-Tu where it can efficiently decode Phe codons as Tyr in the growing polypeptide chain, resulting in mistranslation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ling et al., 2007b</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2009</a>)."

The range of divergent mechanisms used by different PheRSs to discriminate against non-cognate amino acids illustrates how the requirements for translation quality control vary with cellular physiology (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yadavalli and Ibba, 2013</a>). Furthermore, given that editing by PheRS and other aaRSs is not essential for viability in yeast or <i>E. coli</i>, it is clear that the true roles of these quality control pathways remain to be fully elucidated (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reynolds et al., 2010</a>)."

AaRSs are able to edit tRNAs misacylated with a range of amino acids not found in the genetic code such as homocysteine, norleucine, \u03b1-aminobutyrate and <i>meta</i>-tyrosine (<i>m</i>-Tyr), although the physiological relevance of these activities is unknown (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib48\">Yadavalli and Ibba, 2012</a>). Both <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> PheRS have been shown to edit <i>m</i>-Tyr, a metabolic byproduct formed by oxidation of phenylalanine following metal-catalyzed formation of hydroxyl radical species (<a href=\"#bib13\">Huggins et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Stadtman and Levine, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Klipcan et al., 2009</a>). Certain species of fescue grasses (<i>Festuca</i> spp.) produce <i>m</i>-Tyr as a natural defense agent that appears in the proteomes of neighboring plants, and <i>m</i>-Tyr accumulation in the proteome of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been proposed to have a cytotoxic effect on translation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gurer-Orhan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bertin et al., 2007</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that oxidative stress could potentially result in <i>m-</i>Tyr accumulation with the accompanying threat of cytotoxic mistranslation. Under such growth conditions, the ability of the cell to edit <i>m-</i>Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> would be essential to maintain cellular viability. Here we show that bacterial PheRS is able to efficiently edit <i>m-</i>Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, and that this editing activity is essential for cellular growth and survival under both cytotoxic amino acid and oxidative stress conditions. Additionally, we show that PheRS editing in yeast provides only limited protection from <i>m</i>-Tyr, but instead is essential for protecting the cell from <i>para</i>-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> accumulation."

Cytosolic protein samples were isolated from <i>m-</i>Tyr treated <i>E. coli</i> cells and samples subjected to acid hydrolysis to generate individual amino acids. The resulting amino acid hydrolysate was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MS/MS-MRM). To validate peak assignments of the Tyr isomers, co-chromatography was performed with synthetic <i>m</i>-Tyr or <i>o</i>-Tyr added to proteome samples. Only one peak for each of the isomers was observed, validating the assignments. Some level of <i>m</i>-Tyr was found to be present in the proteomes of both wild type and <i>phe(G318W)</i> strains indicating incorporation could be occurring through more than one route. Comparison of proteome total amino acid levels between wild type and <i>pheT</i>(G318W) strains indicated a level of misincorporation of 1% <i>m-</i>Tyr at Phe codons due to the absence of PheRS editing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

To measure the approximate amount of carryover, wild type PheRS <i>E. coli</i> strain was grown in the presence of 0.5 mM <i>o</i>-Tyr, which is not a substrate for protein synthesis, and total protein samples were subjected to acid hydrolysis and LC-MS/MS-MRM.

To investigate if oxidative stress conditions generate potentially toxic levels of <i>m-</i>Tyr in vivo, wild type and editing deficient <i>E. coli</i> were grown in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and FeSO<sub>4</sub> (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) as a source of ROS.

In addition to <i>m-</i>Tyr, significant de novo <i>o-</i>Tyr accumulation was also observed following ROS treatment, although this is not expected to pose a threat to translation fidelity as it is not a substrate for PheRS (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>E. coli</i> lacking PheRS editing activity showed a reduction in growth relative to wild type when grown in media where ROS exposure increased, consistent with the accumulation of free <i>m-</i>Tyr and its subsequent utilization in protein synthesis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Taken together, our data indicate that PheRS editing activity affords <i>E. coli</i> protection against the co-translational insertion of non-proteinogenic amino acids that accumulate during oxidative stress. Attempts to identify <i>m</i>-Tyr in the total protein hydrolysis samples under oxidative stress conditions revealed the presence of <i>m</i>-Tyr and <i>o</i>-Tyr in both the wild type and <i>pheT(G318W)</i> strains. Proper quantification of the levels of each amino acid in these samples was not possible as adequate resolution could not be achieved for the peaks corresponding to the different Tyr isomers in total protein samples prepared from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated cells. These observations suggest posttranslational damage of Phe residues in protein by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment may also be partially responsible for the accumulation of hydroxylated Phe residues. In efforts to increase the misincorporation of <i>m</i>-Tyr into the proteome at Phe codons, higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were used, however this resulted in the death of both strains likely due to the other damaging effects of reactive oxygen species."

AaRS fidelity is achieved through discrimination at the aminoacylation site as well as through additional editing activities in some aaRSs. Protection against both <i>p</i>-Tyr and <i>m</i>-Tyr incorporation at Phe codons appears critical in <i>E. coli</i> as the PheRS enzyme maintains high active-site selectivity against <i>p</i>-Tyr as well as post\u2013transfer editing activity against <i>m</i>-Tyr-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. <i>E. coli</i> PheRS requires this editing activity to protect the proteome from toxic effects of the non-proteinogenic amino acid <i>m</i>-Tyr, which is poorly discriminated against by the active site of the enzyme. Examination of the structure of the catalytic active site provides clues as to why PheRS is unable to discriminate against all the Tyr isomers. Ala294 is primarily responsible for specificity against binding of <i>para</i>-substituted Phe analogs, while Gln174 and Glu210 help stabilize the hydroxyl of non-cognate <i>m</i>-Tyr at position 3 of the ring (<i>E. coli</i> numbering) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Klipcan et al., 2009</a>). In the case of the cognate Phe substrate, Glu210 is also needed to hydrogen bond with the Phe amino group, ensuring correct orientation of the substrate for activation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Safro et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mermershtain et al., 2011</a>). It is unlikely this enzyme selects against recognition of <i>m</i>-Tyr while still maintaining efficient activity for the cognate amino acid, therefore the maintenance of post\u2013transfer editing activity is critical for fidelity in <i>E. coli</i>. In eukaryotes, cytoplasmic PheRS editing is needed to protect the proteome from <i>p</i>-Tyr misincorporation. This finding concurs with the low Phe/<i>p</i>-Tyr specificity of the yeast cytoplasmic enzyme (<a href=\"#bib33\">Reynolds et al., 2010</a>). It is unclear if protection from <i>m</i>-Tyr incorporation is achieved through editing as the yeast strain encoding wild type ctPheRS is sensitive to high concentrations of <i>m</i>-Tyr, mtPheRS efficiently aminoacylates <i>m</i>-Tyr onto tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, and other eukaryotic proteomes are vulnerable to the use of this oxygen-damaged amino acid for translation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gurer-Orhan et al., 2006</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that either <i>m</i>-Tyr accumulation is not a substantial threat in eukaryotes, or possibly that the incorporation of low amounts of this non-proteinogenic amino acid in certain proteomes confers some as yet unknown evolutionary benefits."

Our results now reveal the role of <i>E. coli</i> PheRS editing for preventing the use of <i>m</i>-Tyr during protein synthesis, demonstrating the threat amino acid oxidation poses to the proper functioning of the bacterial translation machinery."

Other non-proteinogenic amino acids have also been shown to be potential threats to translation, such as \u03b1-aminobutyrate, which in the absence of ValRS editing is toxic at high concentrations, although the physiological conditions under which this non-protein amino acid might naturally accumulate to significant levels are unclear (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nangle et al., 2002</a>). The robust editing activity maintained by <i>E. coli</i> PheRS to protect the proteome from <i>m</i>-Tyr demonstrates the significant threat such an amino acid poses when misincorporated at specific near-cognate codons. In contrast, the presence of <i>m</i>-Tyr in the proteome of wild type <i>E. coli</i> suggests misincorporation can also occur at Tyr codons but without cytotoxic sequelae. These findings suggest that the cellular effects of non-proteinogenic amino acid incorporation are codon-dependent. The cell does not have codons or tRNAs for <i>m</i>-Tyr, therefore any advantage or disadvantage this amino acid might provide to the proteome cannot easily be selected for, or against, at the level of the genetic code. The only selection against near-cognate non-proteinogenic amino acid use during translation can be made at the level of the synthetase or ternary complex formation with an elongation factor (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dale and Uhlenbeck, 2005</a>). In <i>E. coli</i>, misincorporation of <i>m</i>-Tyr at Phe codons in the absence of PheRS quality control occurred at a frequency of 1% and had a significant impact on cellular viability and restricted growth. This contrasts with the effects of misincorporation of canonical amino acids, which have been shown to be tolerated at rates of up to 10% without inhibiting growth (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ruan et al., 2008</a>). Taken together with earlier studies, our present findings now show that the misincorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids presents a substantial challenge for protein synthesis quality control. This in turn suggests that many \u2018dispensable\u2019 editing functions, both in aaRSs and <i>trans</i> editing factors, may actually be essential for growth under conditions that lead to the accumulation of potentially toxic levels of non-proteinogenic amino acids."

These damaged amino acids challenge the protein synthesis machinery, as for example in the case of L-DOPA, and leucine hydroxide, which have been shown to be incorporated into proteins in mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rodgers et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ozawa et al., 2005</a>). The formation of intracellular <i>m</i>-Tyr in <i>E. coli</i> under physiological conditions is possibly a result of cellular exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Aerobic respiration results in elevated endogenous levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but bacterial cells are also exposed to ROS present in their environment. Uncharged H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is able to penetrate the cell membrane and accumulate inside cells whenever H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is present in the extracellular habitat. At physiological pH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> quickly oxidizes ferrous iron via the Fenton reaction, generating a hydroxyl radical that can react with nearby cellular targets (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rush et al., 1990</a>). Accumulation of toxic levels of <i>m</i>-Tyr in the intracellular pools of <i>E. coli</i> occurs under experimental conditions that promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals, however this is not the major byproduct of Phe oxidation. The <i>o</i>-Tyr isomer is the more abundant hydroxylation product under ROS-generating conditions used here (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, there is no observed <i>o</i>-Tyr aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> by wild type PheRS in vitro, or inhibition of cell growth, in the presence of this hydroxylated Phe substrate. These, and the corresponding biochemical data, indicate how <i>E. coli</i> PheRS has evolved to effectively discriminate against different Tyr isomers using a combination of substrate specificity (<i>o-</i>Tyr, <i>p-</i>Tyr) and editing activity (<i>m-</i>Tyr, <i>p-</i>Tyr). In contrast, yeast PheRS has mainly evolved specifically to discriminate for <i>p-</i>Tyr by editing, reflecting differences in the factors that drive selection of quality control mechanisms."

Reactions were carried out at 37\u00b0C in a medium containing 100 mM Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 30 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM [<sup>32</sup>P]PP<sub>i</sub> (2 cpm/pmol), varying amounts of Phe (1-200 \u00b5M) and D,L-<i>m</i>-Tyr (20\u20132000 \u00b5M), and 40 nM <i>E. coli</i> PheRS, 100-150 nM yeast cytosolic enzyme. After 1\u20131.3 min, 25 \u00b5l of the reaction were removed and added to a solution containing 1% charcoal, 5.6% HClO<sub>4</sub>, and 75 mM PPi. The charcoal-bound ATP was filtered through a 3 MM Whatman filter discs under vacuum and washed three times with 5 ml of water and once with 5 ml of ethanol. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity content was determined by liquid scintillation counting. We previously reported the activation specificity of Phe vs <i>p</i>-Tyr to be 7800 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Reynolds et al., 2010</a>), however this discrepancy appears to be due to differences in enzyme-bound aminoacyl adenylate during protein purification affecting the measured active enzyme concentration. This problem was resolved here through extensive dialysis against PPi."

Samples were re-dissolved in water (50 \u00b5l), centrifuged (16,000\u00d7<i>g</i>, 5 min) and the supernatant transferred to LC injector vials. Aliquots of the supernatant (typically 5 \u00b5l) were injected onto a reverse phase HPLC column (Phenomenex Kinetex XB-C18, 2.1 \u00d7 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size) equilibrated in solvent A (water/formic acid, 100/0.1, vol/vol) and eluted (100 \u03bcl/min) with an increasing concentration of solvent B (acetonitrile/formic acid, 100/0.1, vol/vol; min/%B, 0/1, 5/1, 26/70, 27/1, and 35/1). The effluent from the column was directly connected to an electrospray ion source (Agilent Jet Stream, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) attached to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (6460; Agilent) scanning in the multiple reaction monitoring mode with standard resolution settings (FWHM 0.7) using previously optimized conditions for the following transitions: Tyr, 182\u2192136; U<sup>13</sup>C-Tyr, 191\u2192144; Phe, 166\u2192120; U<sup>13</sup>C-Phe, 175\u2192128. With each batch of samples a series of standards was prepared with the same amount of internal standards and increasing amounts of Tyr and Phe (0, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 pmol in 50 \u00b5l of water, in duplicate). Typical retention times for <i>p-</i>Tyr, <i>m-</i>Tyr, <i>o-</i>Tyr and Phe were 4.8, 6.6, 8.6 and 9.7 min, respectively. Peak areas were measured using instrument manufacturer supplied software (Agilent MassHunter). The amount of each analyte in each sample was determined by interpolation from the curves constructed from the standard samples (peak area Tyr or Phe/peak area U<sup>13</sup>C-Tyr or \u2013Phe against amount of Tyr or Phe)."
