The most severely affected dilated cardiomyopathy patients harbor Titin truncations in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein, suggesting that mutation position might influence disease mechanism. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated six zebrafish lines with Titin truncations in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Although all exons were constitutive, C-terminal mutations caused severe myopathy whereas N-terminal mutations demonstrated mild phenotypes. Surprisingly, neither mutation type acted as a dominant negative. Instead, we found a conserved internal promoter at the precise position where divergence in disease severity occurs, with the resulting protein product partially rescuing N-terminal truncations. In addition to its clinical implications, our work may shed light on a long-standing mystery regarding the architecture of the sarcomere."

The most severely affected dilated cardiomyopathy patients harbor Titin truncations in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein, suggesting that mutation position might influence disease mechanism. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated six zebrafish lines with Titin truncations in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Although all exons were constitutive, C-terminal mutations caused severe myopathy whereas N-terminal mutations demonstrated mild phenotypes. Surprisingly, neither mutation type acted as a dominant negative. Instead, we found a conserved internal promoter at the precise position where divergence in disease severity occurs, with the resulting protein product partially rescuing N-terminal truncations. In addition to its clinical implications, our work may shed light on a long-standing mystery regarding the architecture of the sarcomere."

Recent guidance issued by the American College of Medical Genetics emphasizes that the strongest form of evidence supporting causality of a mutation is whether it results in a truncation of the protein (nonsense, frameshift or canonical splice-site mutations), specifically for genes where loss-of-function mutations are known to cause disease (<a href=\"#bib38\">Richards et al., 2015</a>). Truncating mutations within alternatively spliced exons and at the extreme C-terminus of the protein must be interpreted with caution, as they may have little to no impact on protein function. However, the guidelines do not address whether truncating mutations at different positions along the length of the protein might differ in phenotype severity or mechanism of action, a finding that could complicate interpretation of truncation mutations for a broad range of inherited diseases."

TTN lies along the length of the sarcomere and is thought to mediate passive tension of the muscle fiber, while also serving as a binding scaffold for a large number of proteins, including actin and myosin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lewinter and Granzier, 2013</a>). Individual regions of TTN are annotated according to their localization to the Z-disc, I-band, A-band, and M-line regions of the sarcomere visualized on immuno-electron micrographs <a href=\"#bib9\">F\u00fcrst et al., 1988</a>. Truncating and/or missense mutations in TTN result in cardiac (dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM]) and skeletal muscle (myofibrillar myopathy) disease (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chauveau et al., 2014</a>). Recent estimates suggest that truncation mutations in TTN may explain as much as 25% of DCM (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herman et al., 2012</a>), a disease which affects upwards of 1 in 2500 individuals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Codd et al., 1989</a>). Although truncations are found along the length of TTN in DCM patients, in patients with the most severe forms of DCM, truncations reside within the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (from amino acid 14,760 onwards, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), specifically in the distal I-band and A-band (we will refer to these as C-terminal truncations) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Roberts et al., 2015</a>). Multiple TTN exons are alternatively spliced (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bang et al., 2001</a>), with many having little to no inclusion within cardiac isoforms, and splicing has been proposed to at least partially explain the exclusion of N-terminal mutations in patients with end-stage DCM (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herman et al., 2012</a>). Nonetheless, over 5500 amino acids in the N-terminal region of the protein are constitutive (percent spliced in or PSI &gt;0.9, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), implying the importance of other mechanisms."

For a disease such as DCM, in which inheritance is most commonly observed as adult-onset autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, deciphering such mechanisms in mouse models can be challenging, as heterozygotes tend to show minimal phenotypes and homozygotes tend to be embryonic lethal (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gramlich et al., 2009</a>). We selected the vertebrate zebrafish model for several reasons. Firstly, zebrafish has high sequence conservation of sarcomeric proteins with mammals and recapitulate disease phenotypes with loss-of-function of multiple established Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dahme et al., 2009</a>). In fact, forward genetic screens have generated zebrafish <i>Titin</i> mutants, although in only one case is the position of the mutation known (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Steffen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Myhre et al., 2014</a>). Secondly, zebrafish can live for up to two weeks with a non-contractile heart, thus allowing mechanistic studies of homozygote mutants. Thirdly, the relatively low cost and large clutch size of zebrafish allow the ability to generate multiple mutant lines and provide statistical power for robust conclusions."

The zebrafish and human proteins are similar in length (\u223c32,000\u201335,000 amino acids depending on the splice isoform) and share 56% identity and 82% homology. They have a nearly identical domain organization, with three immunoglobulin-like of domains (proximal, mid, and distal), an elastic PEVK region, N2A and N2B domains which distinguish cardiac and skeletal isoforms, a fibronectin-immunoglobulin repeat region that mediates binding to myosin, and a C-terminal kinase domain. In both species, alternative splicing targets the middle Ig-like and PEVK domains, which modulate passive tensile properties of the sarcomere (<a href=\"#bib14\">Granzier and Labeit, 2004</a>). Cardiac isoforms typically include much of this elastic region as well as the N2B \u00b1 N2A domains, while skeletal isoforms include the N2A domain but exclude N2B as well as much of the elastic region. Multiple mutants isolated from forward genetic screens coupled with morpholino knockdown analysis have demonstrated that <i>ttna</i> is essential for cardiac sarcomere formation in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Myhre et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Seeley et al., 2007</a>)."

Immunostaining supported the distinction, with ttna<sup>c/c</sup> mutants having highly distorted sarcomeric architecture while ttna<sup>n/n</sup> architecture closely resembled wild-type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To confirm transcription of all mutant isoforms, assess nonsense-mediated decay, and rule out selective alternative splicing of ttna<sup>n/n</sup> mutant exons, we performed RNA-Seq of heart (cardiac muscle) and trunk (skeletal muscle) of 3 day old embryos, as well as adult fish. All mutated exons appeared constitutive in both heart and skeletal muscle, across all genotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We next examined the extent of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) for each mutant allele by performing targeted RNA sequencing of heterozygote embryos and comparing the number of reads for wild-type and mutant exons. In keeping with typical estimates for NMD efficiency (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zetoune et al., 2008</a>), we saw \u223c75\u201380% of mutant transcript being degraded (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Knockdown of ttnb by morpholino disrupted ttna<sup>n/n</sup> skeletal muscle morphology indicating that the intact skeletal muscle sarcomeric architecture in ttna<sup>n/n</sup> mutants arose at least in part from rescue by ttnb protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), although the phenotype was not nearly as severe as that of ttna<sup>c/c</sup> mutants. To investigate a dominant negative mechanism for ttna<sup>c/c</sup> mutants, we performed a morpholino knockdown of ttna, targeting a splice site of an N-terminal constitutive exon (exon 4), which would be expected to introduce an N-terminal frameshift on top of the same C-terminal mutant allele. If the differences between ttna<sup>n/n</sup> and ttna<sup>c/c</sup> mutants arose simply from inhibitory effects of the ttna<sup>c/c</sup> truncated product, then introducing an upstream frameshift should disrupt production of the dominant negative protein product even further and restore sarcomeric architecture. Knockdown by morpholino was effective (\u223c78% knockdown efficiency, data not shown) and the combined action of NMD and morpholino knockdown would be expected to reduce mutant ttna protein to only \u223c5% of the level of ttnb protein. Nonetheless we were unable to rescue skeletal muscle architecture in ttna<sup>c/c</sup> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Finally, a translation start site morpholino targeted upstream of the actual alternative initiator methionine (and 38 nucleotides upstream of the intron-exon junction) was sufficient to completely impair motility and disrupt skeletal muscle architecture in the ttna<sup>n3/n3</sup> mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), further supporting the hypothesis that the <i>Cronos</i> product can rescue skeletal muscle architecture in ttna<sup>n/n</sup> mutants. No obvious impact of the morpholino on alternative splicing of neighboring exons was seen (data not shown)."

Nonetheless, implicit in our work is the assumption that findings from zebrafish skeletal muscle sarcomere development in <i>ttna</i> homozygote mutants (albeit with the paralogous <i>ttnb</i> present for rescue) are relevant towards understanding disease development in humans with <i>TTN</i> mutations. Prominent differences between these systems must be noted. With the exception of certain childhood-onset forms of skeletal and cardiac myopathy arising from homozygous <i>TTN</i> truncations (<a href=\"#bib3\">Carmignac et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ceyhan-Birsoy et al., 2013</a>), the mode of inheritance in <i>TTN</i> truncation mutation patients is heterozygous with marked variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Roberts et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Itoh-Satoh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Norton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">van Spaendonck-Zwarts et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, disease onset usually occurs in adulthood. Such an inheritance pattern is typical of many of the familial forms of cardiomyopathy, and is believed to imply additional modifying effects, potentially from diverse sources as autoimmunity and viral infection as well as contributions from additional genetic variants (<a href=\"#bib15\">Mrh et al., 2015</a>). Nonetheless, taking all of our results together, we find it a highly plausible explanation that a superimposed deficiency in expression of the <i>Cronos</i> protein product would result in the more severe forms of human cardiac disease seen in DCM patients with C-terminal <i>TTN</i> truncations."

Firstly, by precisely mapping the location of the alternate promoter to the e239-e240 intron in humans, we are in a better position to give mutation-specific guidance to TTN truncation patients regarding the potential severity of their disease, with the caveat that additional factors (genetic and environmental) also modulate phenotypic severity. Along these lines, given the overlapping distribution of mutations in unselected cases and controls, it is unlikely that highly accurate patient prognoses would be realized from genotype information alone (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), although there does appear to be nearly complete separation of mutation distribution for the more extreme phenotypes (end-stage DCM and senior athletes). Secondly, our work implies that strategies that augment activity of the internal TTN promoter and levels of the <i>Cronos</i> isoform might provide therapeutic benefit in TTN truncation patients, although it is unclear whether there is a restricted developmental window where this might be possible."

                        "text": "In addition to clinical ramifications, our work may shed light on a long-standing mystery regarding sarcomeric architecture. Electron microscopy reconstructions of serial sections of skeletal muscle dating back over 50 years presented a puzzle: the thin/thick filament arrangement in the sarcomere alters its geometry, progressing from a tetragonal lattice arrangement at the Z-band to a trigonal arrangement in the A-band (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pringle, 1968</a>), with the transition taking place near the I-A junction (<a href=\"#bib45\">Traeger et al., 1983</a>). The implication for TTN would be that there would be a resulting increase in the copies of TTN protein, with four at the Z-band and six at the A-band and M-line (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liversage et al., 2001</a>), which is difficult to reconcile with the fact that a single TTN molecule spans the entire length, from Z-band to M-line. Our data provides a simple explanation for this observation, with the <i>Cronos</i> protein product selectively increasing copies of TTN at the distal I-band, A-band and M-line. Our work also proposes an alternative explanation for the consistently observed \u2018T2\u2019 band on protein gels, which migrates at the expected molecular weight of <i>Cronos</i>. This has invariably been labeled a C-terminal degradation product, as it reacts with A-band antibodies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Opitz et al., 2004</a>). However, in keeping with <i>Cronos</i> expression patterns in development, the T2 band was prominently seen in developing mouse (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lahmers et al., 2004</a>) and rat hearts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Opitz et al., 2004</a>), but was markedly reduced in adulthood. It is possible that, at least in some situations, T2 and <i>Cronos</i> represent the same isoform."

Given its more marked expression in early development, is it important only for the initial sarcomerogenesis or in subsequent aspects of muscle function? Is it likely to be reactivated under stress? And how fast does it turn over compared to full-length TTN? Models with selective disruption and tagging of this isoform should begin to answer these questions. Finally, it is possible that unrecognized internal promoters influence disease severity in truncating mutations of other genes. It is likely a more nuanced diagnostic and prognostic interpretation of truncating mutations will be needed."

Evidence is provided to suggest that these observations are not based upon alternative splicing, differential efficiency of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or differential dominant-negative potential of the predicted truncated protein products derived from the mutant alleles. Instead, the data strongly suggest the relevance of an alternative promoter that lies between exons 115 and 116, giving rise to an mRNA and protein (termed <i>Cronos</i>) that is expressed (and putatively functional) with proximal but not distal premature termination codon mutations. Overall, this is a very elegant study with quality data and largely convincing conclusions.

There is generally an apparent polarization effect, with greater efficiency for proximal PTCs, with the potential for less efficiency for distal PTCs and near-universal loss of NMD for PTCs in the very distal portion of the penultimate exon or in the last exon. In this light, it is surprising that all assayed PTCs (none in last exons) had a relatively modest effect on transcript abundance (\u223c50% of WT). The details regarding how this assay was performed are minimal and should be expanded.

When compared to healthy volunteers or participants in heart study cohorts (numbers not specified), senior athletes had about the same frequency (\u223c1.0-1.5%) of TTN truncation mutations. However, all senior athletes had their truncating mutation in the very distal portion of the Novex-3 isoform (that is rather poorly described in this manuscript), while the other groups largely showed \u2018other\u2019 types of truncations. Apparently, there is an alternative TTN transcript that includes a large (\u223c6.5kb) terminal exon that also contains a 3' cleavage and polyadenylation signal. By report, the Novex-3 transcript contains all proximal exons, and terminates considerably short of the alternative promoter described here. Are the truncations in the very distal portion of the Novex-3 exon seen in robust old age because they have no functional impact at all (i.e. normal levels of both full-length and Novex-3 message and protein due to avoidance of NMD in both)? While the data might even suggest a selective advantage, there is no mechanism that can even be inferred by the data and conclusions of this manuscript. Perhaps more importantly, what was the specific nature of the \u2018other\u2019 truncating mutations in the healthy volunteers and other unselected cohorts? Were they greatly enriched for N- as opposed to C-terminal truncations (defined by the exon 115/116 boundary), as might be predicted by this study? Were the Novex-3 truncations seen in the FHS and JHS cohorts also in the extreme C-terminal exon, or were they more widely distributed?"

The initial inference that C-terminal titin truncation variants are uniformly classified as pathogenic mutations is incorrect. There is a substantial excess of C-terminal truncating variants in DCM subjects, but there are also such variants in the control groups so the position of a variant is insufficient (at least at this resolution) to define pathogenicity. This observation also raises important questions regarding the mechanisms of pathogenicity. In addition, it is worth noting that there are remarkably few of the proposed truncating mutations that have been demonstrated to result in truncated protein and there are only two extant families where there are any segregation data of significance between titin variants of any sort and the DCM phenotype. In each case, the variant is not clearly truncating when studied closely. Finally, the spectrum of variation in titin that leads to skeletal muscle involvement is not so systematically described but many DCM subjects (with heterozygous genotypes) have subclinical skeletal muscle involvement when examined rigorously. The suggestion that TTN mutations cause HCM is controversial and should be stated as such. The distinction between N- and C- terminal truncating mutations with regard to DCM is not as discrete and robust as is suggested by the authors, with documentation of cases with N-terminal truncations (i.e. Herman DS et al, NEJM 2012). Also, given the complexities of TTN transcript biology that remain to be fully explored in fish, mice and especially people, the authors\u2019 suggestion that it is now possible to definitively classify C-terminal variation in the titin gene is overstated. While this work will undoubtedly contribute to progress, much more needs to be done to reliably inform patient management and counseling."

The initial inference that C-terminal titin truncation variants are uniformly classified as pathogenic mutations is incorrect. There is a substantial excess of C-terminal truncating variants in DCM subjects, but there are also such variants in the control groups so the position of a variant is insufficient (at least at this resolution) to define pathogenicity. This observation also raises important questions regarding the mechanisms of pathogenicity. In addition, it is worth noting that there are remarkably few of the proposed truncating mutations that have been demonstrated to result in truncated protein and there are only two extant families where there are any segregation data of significance between titin variants of any sort and the DCM phenotype. In each case, the variant is not clearly truncating when studied closely. Finally, the spectrum of variation in titin that leads to skeletal muscle involvement is not so systematically described but many DCM subjects (with heterozygous genotypes) have subclinical skeletal muscle involvement when examined rigorously. The suggestion that TTN mutations cause HCM is controversial and should be stated as such. The distinction between N- and C- terminal truncating mutations with regard to DCM is not as discrete and robust as is suggested by the authors, with documentation of cases with N-terminal trucations (i.e. Herman DS et al, NEJM 2012). Also, given the complexities of TTN transcript biology that remain to be fully explored in fish, mice and especially people, the authors' suggestion that it is now possible to definitively classify C-terminal variation in the titin gene is overstated.

While this may be the case, the fact is that sarcomerogenesis itself is disrupted during development in the fish limb of this construct, while humans with the proposed orthologous trait have no demonstrable structural defect in the sarcomere and survive to middle age. The authors' also assert that components of the observed disparities between fish and human hearts and fish and human skeletal muscle is a consequence of the associated levels of</i> ttnb <i>and</i> Cronos <i>in the different tissues in each species. It would be important to formally demonstrate these assertions with rescue experiments in the different tissues, or as noted in prior reviews, to consider and test alternative explanations including the presence or absence of external stressors. The authors did test two rather acute and rather similar perturbations without success, though the zebrafish would seem to be amenable to much more extensive and stringent challenge. The RNAseq data more robustly quantitate the levels of NMD and are reassuring, though the distribution along the transcript is somewhat discordant with prior observations in other genes. I remain somewhat unsure how to interpret the failure of</i> ttna <i>knockdown to rescue the</i> ttna <i>homozygous mutants. It is difficult to see how a mechanism that may be dependent on the presence of a threshold amount of wild-type (WT) protein, can be excluded by the knockdown of both mutant alleles. This serves only to emphasize the failure of the zebrafish experiments as described to capture the biology of either human skeletal or cardiac titin disease. The authors have revised their statements on the inferences of their work for clinicians and in doing so have created an improved and carefully nuanced description of the field.</i>"
