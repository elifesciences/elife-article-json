However, the relationship between its two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, and the extent to which they are functionally distinct, remains uncertain. Using mouse models of paralog deficiency, we demonstrate that they are not equivalent for CD4<sup>+</sup> 'helper' T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Instead, we find that STAT5B is dominant in both effector and regulatory (Treg) responses and, therefore, uniquely necessary for immunological tolerance. Comparative analysis of genomic distribution and transcriptomic output reveals that STAT5B has greater transcriptional output but, surprisingly, our data point towards asymmetric expression (i.e. paralog dose), rather than distinct functional properties, as the key distinguishing feature. Thus, we propose a quantitative model of STAT5 paralog activity whereby relative abundance imposes functional specificity (or dominance) in the face of widespread structural homology."
