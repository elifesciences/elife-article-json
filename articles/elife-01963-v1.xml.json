Using the FEI Falcon II direct electron detector in video mode, we have reconstructed a map at 3.36 \u00c5 resolution of the 1.2 MDa F<sub>420</sub>-reducing hydrogenase (Frh) from methanogenic archaea from only 320,000 asymmetric units. Videos frames were aligned by a combination of image and particle alignment procedures to overcome the effects of beam-induced motion. The reconstructed density map shows all secondary structure as well as clear side chain densities for most residues. The full coordination of all cofactors in the electron transfer chain (a [NiFe] center, four [4Fe4S] clusters and an FAD) is clearly visible along with a well-defined substrate access channel. From the rigidity of the complex we conclude that catalysis is diffusion-limited and does not depend on protein flexibility or conformational changes."

Using the FEI Falcon II direct electron detector in video mode, we have reconstructed a map at 3.36 \u00c5 resolution of the 1.2 MDa F<sub>420</sub>-reducing hydrogenase (Frh) from methanogenic archaea from only 320,000 asymmetric units. Videos frames were aligned by a combination of image and particle alignment procedures to overcome the effects of beam-induced motion. The reconstructed density map shows all secondary structure as well as clear side chain densities for most residues. The full coordination of all cofactors in the electron transfer chain (a [NiFe] center, four [4Fe4S] clusters and an FAD) is clearly visible along with a well-defined substrate access channel. From the rigidity of the complex we conclude that catalysis is diffusion-limited and does not depend on protein flexibility or conformational changes."

The results confirm that the previously reported structure is correct. Furthermore, several new structural features were seen for the first time, including a previously unseen ion located between two protein subunits. Allegretti et al. also revealed that the structure of Frh is highly rigid, and so the process by which it catalyses reactions involving its substrate, the coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>, does not involve changes in its shape. Instead, the reaction rate depends on the rate at which F<sub>420</sub> diffuses to the correct position in the enzyme, where the reaction occurs very rapidly."

Since the first sub-nanometer resolution cryo-EM structures of icosahedral viruses, which have the advantage of multi-MDa size and high symmetry (<a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00f6ttcher et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Conway et al., 1997</a>), steady advances in instrumentation have yielded a number of virus structures at better than 4 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grigorieff and Harrison, 2011</a>). For smaller and less symmetrical structures, progress has been slower, but several complexes have yielded structures at around 6 \u00c5 resolution where secondary structure is recognizable and X-ray structures of subcomplexes can be reliably fitted (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ludtke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Armache et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gipson et al., 2010</a>). In a few cases, side chain densities have been resolved (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ludtke and Baker, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mills et al., 2013</a>). Radiation damage limits the electron dose that can be used in any individual EM image and the resulting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has meant that until recently high-resolution maps have required the equivalent of 10<sup>6</sup> images of asymmetric units."

In addition, these cameras have frame rates which make it possible to collect videos of the particles in the thin film of vitreous water during an exposure, and thus partially correct for the effects of beam-induced particle movement and specimen drift. Using a 70-MDa virus that can be accurately aligned even at short exposures, it was shown that electron irradiation causes random translations and rotations of the particles, which are typically largest in the first few frames (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brilot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>). In two recent studies, image processing schemes were developed to correct for these beam-induced motions. Using the 700 kDa archaeal 20S proteasome, which is too small to reliably detect and align in images recorded with a short exposure, a protocol was developed to align entire frames or subareas of &gt;2000 \u00d7 2000 pixels to each other (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2013</a>) (The motion correction software is available to download from <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n6/extref/nmeth.2472-S2.zip\">http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n6/extref/nmeth.2472-S2.zip</a>). For the much larger ribosome (\u223c4 MDa) a statistical video processing approach was developed, which acts on individual particles using a user-defined running average of video frames (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2013</a>). Both studies produced maps of unprecedented resolution, 3.3 \u00c5 for the D7 proteasome from 126,000 particles and 4.5 \u00c5 from 35,000 asymmetric 80S ribosomes."

Frh is a key enzyme in the metabolism of methanogenic archaea, where the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane involves the oxidation of four molecules of H<sub>2</sub> by a number of different hydrogenases. The reduced form of the F<sub>420</sub> coenzyme, which is the electron donor in several of these steps, is regenerated by Frh (<a href=\"#bib37\">Thauer et al., 2010</a>). The central role of Frh in the metabolism of methanogens is reflected in its abundance (\u223c2%) in the soluble cell protein (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fox et al., 1987</a>). Frh is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of the 43 kDa subunit FrhA that contains a [NiFe]-center, the 26 kDa subunit FrhG with three [4Fe4S] clusters, and the 31 kDa iron\u2013sulphur flavoprotein FrhB, which contains the F<sub>420</sub>-binding site and has one [4Fe4S] cluster and an FAD. Our cryo-EM study showed that the Frh complex is a dodecamer with tetrahedral symmetry. The map had \u223c5 \u00c5 resolution which was sufficient to show secondary structure and density for many side chains as well as the cofactors forming the electron transfer chain, making it possible to trace the three protein chains, one of them without a template."

A dataset of 33,590 particles (403,080 asymmetric units) at a defocus range of 0.8\u20133.5 \u00b5m was collected from 235 images in two sessions on a single grid. Areas of very thin ice were selected that we estimate to be only slightly thicker than the particle diameter of \u223c175 \u00c5; often similar holes nearby had no particles in the center but a densely packed outer rim, so apparently the thin ice had squeezed the complexes out to the edge of the hole."

In this protocol, two half datasets are refined completely independently throughout, and after each cycle the new reference volumes are low-pass filtered to the resolution where the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between the two volumes drops to 0.143, thus preventing overfitting of noise (<a href=\"#bib35\">Scheres and Chen, 2012</a>). A first refinement using the sum of the first 20 video frames (discarding the last 4 frames because of likely radiation damage [<a href=\"#bib4\">Baker and Rubinstein, 2010</a>]) yielded a map at 3.94 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) that looked considerably better than our previous map from 84,000 particles on film. Also, the map was virtually noise-free due to the RELION refinement procedure (<a href=\"#bib34\">Scheres, 2012</a>). Next we applied the frame alignment software (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2013</a>) and aligned all 24 frames to each other. In the majority of cases, the first frame showed a large movement in comparison with the others (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)<i>.</i> We refined the sum of the aligned frames with or without the first frame and found that discarding the first frame results in a higher-resolution map (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). As found also by others (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2013</a>), the correction cannot deal with the fast motion of the particles during the first frame. On this basis we discarded the first frame of every video for all subsequent refinements. The refinement of the 20 aligned frames resulted in a 3.74 \u00c5 map (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In another refinement approach, we used the statistical alignment procedure (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2013</a>) implemented in RELION (<a href=\"#bib34\">Scheres, 2012</a>). This method follows the movement of the particles within the videos (particle-based method) using a running average of frames. This procedure also improved the resolution relative to the unaligned particles in a very similar way to the whole-frame alignment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); the best resolution was obtained when 5 frames were averaged. In yet another approach we combined the two alignment procedures (whole-frame and particle-based). The resolution curve of this refinement gave a better FSC than the others over all frequencies and the resulting reconstruction had a resolution of 3.69 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), indicating that for the intermediate-sized particle investigated here the combination of the two alignment procedures works best."

We therefore decided to discard suboptimal images from the first dataset to improve the map. We removed the images with high defocus (&gt;2.5 \u00b5m) and those that were of poor quality as judged by the visibility and symmetry of the Thon rings. This reduced the dataset by 20% from 33,590 to 26,635 particles (319,620 asymmetric units).

We found that all three proteins had been traced essentially correctly in the lower-resolution film map (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The largest differences between the two models were found in surface loops that had been difficult to trace in the film map. The only unresolved part in the previous model involved a 12-residue stretch in FrhG (188\u2013199), for which no density was found and which was thought to form a flexible surface loop. In the new map, two nearby density features, modelled as extended loops before, were clearly recognizable as alpha-helices (194\u2013201 and 208\u2013215) that accommodate the missing residues. The resulting shift of residues brings the cysteine residues C206 and C208, which are conserved in the FrhG family (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>), near a strong density on the dimer axis between two FrhG subunits. The cysteines of the dimer partner are just a few \u00c5 away, and the density in between the four cysteine side chains is strongly suggestive of a coordinated ion (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). Although the cysteine side chains are not completely resolved, their tetrahedral arrangement suggests that it is a zinc ion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dokmani\u0107 et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Harding et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rul\u00ed\u0161ek and Vondr\u00e1\u0161ek, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Zheng et al., 2008</a>)."

The fundamental problem is the inevitable radiation damage to the biological sample caused by the electron beam. Reaching high resolution requires low exposures to maximize the SNR of rapidly destroyed high-resolution information. The resulting images are noisy, which makes it both difficult to detect particles and to determine the defocus parameters accurately. The high frame rate of direct electron detectors allows data collection in video mode, which removes these restrictions and allows beam-induced motion of particles to be identified and partially corrected for. Just as importantly, direct electron detectors offer increased detective quantum efficiency at high resolution and so while individual images are still noisy they contain more information. The combination of better images and improved data processing is now leading to better reconstructions which in turn allows more information to be extracted from the images due to better alignment of individual particles."

The higher DQE of the detector makes it possible to reliably detect particles at very low defocus.

We found that two issues are important here: aligning the video frames to reduce the effects of beam-induced movement, and selecting the frame sequence used in the final map reconstruction to eliminate data affected by radiation damage. We used two approaches for video alignment. The first was the procedure developed by <a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al. (2013)</a> for aligning whole frames (or large fractions of frames) independent of the visibility of the particles of interest in the individual frames. This was developed for the 700 kDa 20S proteasome and is most useful for relatively small protein complexes that are hard to detect on images recorded at low electron exposure. The second method is the statistical alignment procedure developed by <a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al. (2013)</a>, which works on the particle level on user-defined running averages of substacks and requires the particles to be visible on the substacks. This was developed for ribosomes, which for a given dose are easier to detect due to their large size (several MDa) and high RNA content. The 1.2 MDa Frh complex, which contains 48 [4Fe4S] clusters and several other metal ions, is intermediate in density and size between the proteasome and the ribosome. For this complex we found that both video alignment methods gave similar improvements in final map resolution compared to unaligned frames (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, the combination of the two methods, running the statistical particle alignment on pre-aligned stacks, yielded another improvement of similar magnitude. We used a running average of 5 frames for the particle-based alignment, so it is not unexpected that a pre-alignment of the frames was advantageous."

This large movement during the first fraction of the exposure would blur the first frame, and by omitting it, we obtained an improvement in resolution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The later frames are increasingly affected by radiation damage. Reducing the number of frames used in the reconstruction to only 6 (out of the total 24) produced the best map (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The accumulated dose in these frames was \u223c24 e/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, very similar to the accumulated dose (\u223c21 e/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>) used for the 3.3 \u00c5 proteasome map (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2013</a>). A 4.16 \u00c5 reconstruction after a refinement of only the last 6 frames of the 20-frame videos still showed partial side chains and clear helices (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In case of smaller particles than the 1.2 MDa Frh complex, it would be advantageous to record videos over longer periods with higher cumulative doses, so that the particles are more visible and easier to align. The later, radiation-damaged frames can then be omitted from the reconstruction if necessary, as suggested before (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2013</a>). Thus, direct electron detectors provide a way to optimize a posteriori the electron exposure of the data used for reconstruction."

                        "text": "Our 3.36 \u00c5 resolution map made it possible to determine the structure of the Frh complex unambiguously. All elements of secondary structure are obvious, and side chain density is clearly visible for most residues in the protein interior. Side chains on the surface are in general not seen, probably due to their flexibility in the aqueous solvent. The only conspicuous exceptions are the side chains of glutamates and aspartates, which are almost all absent (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), even in maps reconstructed from the earliest, least damaged frames (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). An absence of aspartate and glutamate side chain densities can also be observed in other high-resolution cryo-EM maps, including the electron crystallography maps of LHC-II (<a href=\"#bib23\">K\u00fchlbrandt et al., 1994</a>) and bacteriorhodopsin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kimura et al., 1997</a>) and the recent 3.3-\u00c5 single particle map of the 20S proteasome (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2013</a>). In X-ray crystallography it was noted that carboxylate side chains have higher B-factors after extended exposure to intense synchrotron radiation, possibly due to decarboxylation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Weik et al., 2000</a>). A quantification of synchrotron radiation damage on carboxylate side chains (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fioravanti et al., 2006</a>) shows that this damage already occurs at radiation doses equivalent to less than 1 e/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Henderson, 1990</a>), a much lower dose than is feasible in cryo-EM. This implies that the decarboxylation would have occurred well within the first frame of our video data set and aspartate and glutamate side chains would in general not be visible in cryo-EM maps. However, not all are absent. Among the few visible carboxylate side chains in Frh, two are involved in ligand binding: FrhG Asp60 in the coordination of the proximal FeS cluster, and FrhA Glu44 in liganding a possible Fe or Mg ion (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mills et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>). In X-ray crystallography it is also found that not all glutamate and aspartate side chains are equally susceptible to radiation damage, but the dependence on the structural and chemical environment is not well understood (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fioravanti et al., 2006</a>). In the 3-\u00c5 bacteriorhodopsin EM map, the side chains of Asp85 and Asp212, which from spectroscopy are known to be deprotonated, were invisible, whereas the protonated side chains of Asp96 and Asp115 had good density (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kimura et al., 1997</a>). Active sites are often found to contain the most radiation-sensitive residues in X-ray crystallography, but the protonation state was not found to be essential, and a relation to pKa was also not observed (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fioravanti et al., 2006</a>). As more high-resolution cryo-EM maps become available, more data on the relative radiation sensitivity of side chains in different environments may give new insights in protein structure and dynamics."

There were many indications that our original Frh structure was essentially correct, for example well-resolved hydrophobic side chains in the protein interior and the observation of secondary structure in regions where it was expected from prediction programs. It was nevertheless gratifying to see how well the model fits the new, higher-resolution map. Note that it would hardly be possible to trace an electron density map obtained by X-ray crystallography at a nominal resolution of 5.5 \u00c5. This clear difference reflects the quality of the phase information, which is conserved in the phase contrast electron micrographs and determined directly by image processing, whereas in X-ray crystallography it is determined indirectly by isomorphous replacement or anomalous scattering."

                        "text": "Although the overall chain trace is the same, in detail the model based on the 3.36 \u00c5 map is of course much improved. The function of Frh is the hydrogenation of F<sub>420</sub> by molecular hydrogen. Electrons are extracted from hydrogen by the [NiFe] cluster in FrhA, and transferred via the three [4Fe4S] clusters in FrhG and another one in FrhB to FAD and from there to the substrate. The electron transfer chain is clearly recognizable. The [NiFe] cluster has a high density (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15B</a>) and is coordinated by conserved residues, as in the large subunits of other [NiFe] hydrogenases (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Nearby is another ion, also conserved, coordinated among others by the C-terminal histidine of FrhA, His386 (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15B</a>). The four FeS clusters were easily localized in the film map because of their high density; moreover, they are arranged in a chain with distances of \u223c10 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mills et al., 2013</a>). In the Falcon II map, the clusters are not just featureless blobs, but their tetrahedral coordination (mostly by cysteine residues, or, in one case, an aspartate) can be clearly seen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15A</a>). Thus their orientation can be modelled correctly, with the irons facing the sulphurs of the cysteine side chains. One unexpected feature found in the new map was the density for an ion on the dimer interface between two FrhG subunits (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). This density feature was actually visible in the film map, but since the flanking conserved cysteines from the two FrhG subunits were not recognized, its interpretation as an ion was not obvious. The function of this ion is most likely to stabilize the dodecameric complex, but its location between the two medial FeS clusters at a distance of only 9 \u00c5, which is less than the distance of \u223c10 \u00c5 between adjacent FeS clusters in the electron transfer chains, means that a role in electron transfer cannot be ruled out. The final part of the electron transfer chain, the FAD in FrhB, which is close to the last FeS cluster, has unambiguous, continuous density in the Falcon II map (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). FAD acts as a one-electron/two-electron redox switch between the FeS clusters and the F<sub>420</sub> substrate (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fox et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alex et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Thauer et al., 2010</a>). This means that the substrate needs to approach the FAD to within van der Waals distance to enable hydride transfer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ceh et al., 2009</a>). In our previous study, we collected data from Frh with and without the substrate. In the map obtained in the presence of substrate we had identified a density near the FAD isoalloxazine ring that we interpreted as part of F<sub>420</sub> at low occupancy (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mills et al., 2013</a>). For the new Falcon-II map, we used an Frh sample with a large excess of F<sub>420</sub>, but the F<sub>420</sub> binding pocket is clearly empty. As the same sample was used in both studies, we conclude that the density in the film map must have been due to noise. An access channel for the substrate can easily be recognized (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) and its significance is confirmed by the high conservation of the amino acid residues lining the channel (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). There is no indication of even a low occupancy of substrate or of flexibility in this map region. A map of local resolution (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</a>) confirmed that the protein region around this pocket is rigid. This suggests that conformational changes do not play a role for the access of F<sub>420</sub> to the hydride donor, consistent with the finding that F<sub>420</sub> reduction by Frh is very rapid and most likely diffusion-limited (<a href=\"#bib25\">Livingston et al., 1987</a>)."

The authors found that the reconstruction resolution was optimized when they a) averaged frames 2-7 (omitting the first frame owing to large sample motions and omitting subsequent frames owing to radiation damage), b) omitted images with the thicker ice, high defocus values and poor Thon rings, and c) combined the whole frame and particle alignment methods. With the optimized reconstruction, the authors were able to: a) confirm that the previous structure was correct, b) assign two new surface helices, c) identify a new Zn<sup>2+</sup>(Cys)4 site at the FhrG dimer interface, d) argue that the enzyme\u2019s active site does not appear to adjust substantially upon F<sub>420</sub> substrate binding, e) add to the available data concerning electron beam-induced decarboxylation of Asp and Glu residues (most such side chains are decarboxylated, but several are not, including several that coordinate cofactors), and f) demonstrate that reliable near atomic-resolution information was present even in their previous EM maps that exhibited nominal overall \u223c5 \u00c5 resolution, thanks to the direct phase information present in the images."
