Mimics in these complexes are assumed to vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended, or not defended at all. Here, we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants, wasps, bugs, tree hoppers and spiders. All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant <i>Gestalt</i>, but vary substantially in their defensive traits. However, they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials. We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits."

Mimics in these complexes are assumed to vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended, or not defended at all. Here, we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants, wasps, bugs, tree hoppers and spiders. All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant <i>Gestalt</i>, but vary substantially in their defensive traits. However, they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials. We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits."

Classic M\u00fcllerian mimicry was thought to only include equally defended species (<a href=\"#bib43\">M\u00fcller, 1878</a>), while Batesian mimicry (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bates, 1862</a>) describes undefended species resembling defended models. In reality, this simplistic dichotomy (<i>sensu</i> <a href=\"#bib69\">Speed, 1999</a>) represents the end-points of a mimetic spectrum that contains species that vary in their mimetic fidelity and/or their degree of defensiveness. A topic of considerable debate (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sherratt, 2008</a>) is the putative influence that moderately defended mimics have on the stability of mimicry rings (i.e. a composite of several similar M\u00fcllerian mimics). Discrepancy in protection between two mimetic species may dilute the protection of a more defended species (<a href=\"#bib69\">Speed, 1999</a>). Great tits (<i>Parus major</i>, Paridae, Passeriformes) for instance, attacked artificial models more often when less defended mimics were frequently encountered and food was restricted (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rowland et al., 2010</a>). In direct contrast, associative learning mechanisms predict a mutualistic relationship between moderately and highly defended members of the ring (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rowland et al., 2007</a>): wild caught great tits equally avoided four species of true bugs with varying levels of defence but which shared similar warning colours (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hodov\u00e1 Sv\u00e1dov\u00e1 et al., 2013</a>)."

These complexes, despite being speciose, are taxonomically limited because their members often belong to only a single family or genus (Lepidoptera or Hymenoptera). The mutillid wasp complex is suspected of including species from other orders but this has not been formally presented (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">2015</a>). A mathematical model suggests that mimicry complexes should be common in multispecies communities with distantly related taxa (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beatty et al., 2004</a>). The general lack of data on multi-order mimicry complexes may represent an observer bias. For example, ants have been largely overlooked as M\u00fcllerian mimics, yet they are diverse, typically well defended through a range of defensive measures including a sting, noxious chemicals, spines, a thickened cuticle, mandibles and communal attack (<a href=\"#bib20\">H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson, 1990</a>). There is also a rich diversity of invertebrate taxa that mimic ants."

The degree of distastefulness or level of venom toxicity within a mimicry ring is expected to vary among members. Experimental investigations, that started a hundred years ago (e.g. <a href=\"#bib37\">McAtee, 1912</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">1932</a>), have tended to focus on a single visually-oriented predatory guild and yet most environments contain a wide range of potential predators of mimics. For example, species that mimic ants may encounter several ant-averse and ant-eating predators (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pek\u00e1r et al., 2011</a>). In some microhabitats, such as leaf litter, the ant-eating predators (which often use chemical cues to recognise prey) and ant-adverse nonvisually-orienting predators are indeed more common than visually-orienting ones, thus exerting strong selection pressure on mimics to signal their unpalatability in sensory modalities other than visual. Thus one of the major outstanding questions regarding the contribution of mimics to the function of mimetic rings is evaluating the success of M\u00fcllerian and/or Batesian mimicry by analysing the selection pressure exerted by all predators in a given environment (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blumstein, 2006</a>)."

Thus, our first step was the identification of separate rings to understand how the mimicry complex evolved and is reinforced. We therefore tested whether the rings have a sympatric distribution, which would indicate a mutualistic relationship between mimics and whether mimics within a ring share common ancestry."

Aposematic warning signals and distastefulness are expected to evolve together within a species (e.g. <a href=\"#bib62\">Ruxton et al., 2004</a>) and thus, the strength of the distasteful stimulus should coincide with the conspicuousness of the warning signal (<a href=\"#bib68\">Speed and Ruxton, 2007</a>). In this mimicry complex, we investigated whether there is a positive relationship between signal intensity and unpalatability across species as has recently been found among lady-bird beetles (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mar\u00eda Arenas et al., 2015</a>). This would mean that truly M\u00fcllerian mimics are expected to honestly signal their distastefulness but truly Batesian mimics display a conspicuous warning signal without the noxious stimulus. We tested these assumptions by correlating the size of the warning signal (golden/back colouration) with a measure of distastefulness derived from the sum of defences found in the mimics."

In reality, the members of a complex are exposed to predators that use a variety of sensory modalities and foraging modes to detect and subdue their prey. We combined staged predatory trials with a dietary analysis of wild populations of a community of predators to test the hypothesis that more unpalatable species are attacked less frequently by a community of predators."

Because several complementary forms of defence are likely, we estimated total unpalatability for each mimic based on the sum of morphological, chemical, and behavioural defensive traits. Our analyses uncovered a spectrum of mimics from non-defended (Batesian) to highly defended (M\u00fcllerian) species. For instance, the spider and treehopper species had the lowest unpalatability score (i.e. sum of normalised measurements on defensive traits) and were therefore classified as Batesian mimics. <i>Daerlac</i> bugs, mutillid wasps and all ant species were unpalatable, but we found considerable variation in the degree of unpalatability ranging from quasi-M\u00fcllerian to unambiguously M\u00fcllerian, mimics. The index of unpalatability had an overall normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, W\u00a0=\u00a00.98, p=0.21) with the highest frequency consisting of moderately-palatable species. Unpalatability varied in each ring but the variation was not significantly different among the ten rings suggested previously (Bartlett test, K<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>\u00a0=\u00a011, p=0.09, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) supporting further the\u00a0existence of only one complex.

Eastern water skinks (N\u00a0=\u00a026) are visually-oriented generalist predators and captured (i.e. ate) non-mimetic spiders at significantly higher frequency than members of the mimetic complex such as ants, spiders and bugs (GEE-b, <i>X</i><sup>2</sup><sub>5</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0125.8, p&lt;0.0001, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Mimic or non-mimic spiders were immediately eaten, but skinks showed an adverse response to mimic ants and bugs.

The lack of ant fauna in mimetic rings possibly reflects an overall lack of conspicuous defensive coloration in ants. However, our study supports a species rich mimicry complex of golden coloured ant models and mimics, adding to the small number of documented large-scale complexes. Mimetic complexes (among several families of beetles) were first recognised by <a href=\"#bib45\">Nicholson (1927)</a> for Australian insect fauna. Such complexes are presumably far more widespread than appreciated, but have only been subject to more intensive study relatively recently. Many more large-scale mimetic complexes among ants and other animals (particularly arthropods) are likely to be described in future."

The lesser-defended individuals in this context are less distasteful. Species in our golden complex use multiple defensive traits including a variety of structural and chemical defences. To understand how these traits interplay with the aposematic signal we created an index that summed all traits known to serve a defensive function. We acknowledge this approach is somewhat simplistic as various traits are differentially effective against various predators. For example, a thick cuticle is effective against arthropod predators but ineffective against vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib12\">Evans and Sanson, 2005</a>). On the other hand, spines are effective against vertebrates but ineffective in the defence against arthropod predators (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mikolajewski et al., 2006</a>). Different species of closely related predators may also use a variety of adaptations to deal with the defences of prey. For example, some spiders are able to catch ants even with a thick cuticle while others are not (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pek\u00e1r and Toft, 2015</a>). A true index of unpalatability requires an estimation of the total effectiveness of a combination of defensive structures, such as spines and thick cuticle and the toxicity of chemical compounds for each predator-prey combination. Estimates including spines and cuticle thickness may be relatively straight forward but information on the toxicity of chemical compounds is largely not available (see <a href=\"http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov\">http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Although our approach is simplistic, the positive relationship between the index of unpalatability and the response of skinks strongly suggests that the measure is a good proxy for unpalatability."

Body size alone is an anatomical constraint that may prevent predation, thus it is difficult to separate the effect of pure body size from the\u00a0relative size of some defensive traits (e.g., spines). A strong correlation between body size and the size of defensive traits is natural, because larger spines, for example, require a larger body to support them. It is, however, the\u00a0absolute size of defences not their relative size that is ecologically important (e.g., a skink will swallow larger spines with greater difficulty than smaller ones). Whatever their single effect is, all these traits together, add to an overall unpalatability of mimics."

It remains to be tested what speciation process and selection forces have driven this pattern.

In other systems though, reflective iridescence has a significant additive effect (e.g. <a href=\"#bib13\">Fabricant et al., 2014</a>) so it is likely that the sheen enhances the detectability of the signal. A possible additional benefit, or even an alternative explanation, is that the sheen is important for reflecting harmful radiation and dissipating heat (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shi et al., 2015</a>). Irrespective of the explanation the importance of this colour variant, further experimental investigation is warranted."

Some non-visual predators potentially recognize mimics via the patterns of vibrations generated by their movements (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pek\u00e1r et al., 2011</a>). Predators typically use multisensory modalities to identify prey (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bro-J\u00f8rgensen, 2010</a>) such as movement, shape and defensive chemicals they emit."

This is in agreement with previous claims that mimicry rings are dominated by moderately defended species (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sherratt, 2008</a>). With a predominance of moderately defended prey, there is an expectation that their presence will erode the effectiveness of the model. Our findings, based on a limited number of mimics, multiple predatory guilds when taking into account, did not support this notion. Instead, all mimics investigated in our predator-prey trials experienced significantly lower mortality than the non-mimetic species, and this was irrespective of the coverage of gold. We found the skinks were more likely to attack the lesser-defended individuals but when the suite of predators was taken into account there was little variation in the overall predation pressure. This is potentially because some predators may not use the visual signal as a reference and are cuing in on other signals."

Indeed, they fed on prey related to the mimics as evidenced by the positive results of designed primers targeting the mimics. We did not measure the availability of alternative prey so we do not have an absolute indication of relative encounter rates. However, birds learn to avoid both M\u00fcllerian models and mimics irrespective of the availability of alternative prey (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lindstr\u00f6m et al., 2004</a>). In addition, there are multiple species of ant and ant models distributed across the sampling habitat occupying both terrestrial and arboreal habitats. The majority of the species in the complex are also ants and ants are typically super abundant due to their sociality. So it seems likely the predators would see these animals on a regular basis."

Similarly, the results of experiments with skinks must be interpreted with caution due to constrained randomisation used (M\u00fcllerian mimics first). The response of skinks could be affected by the constrained prey order (due to some kind of habituation). Yet, other predators used showed similar response to mimics as skinks, though the order of offered prey was fully randomised."

Our data suggest that all members of the golden mimicry complex receive quite similar net protection from a variety of predators presumably because they have a variety of defensive traits. We predict that mimetic complexes that incorporate a range of different forms of defence are not only more common than previously believed, but also more likely result in mutualism among the unequally defended members of the complex."

Size, number of spines and size of mandibles were measured in one individual from each species. Cuticle thickness and size of the poison/pygidial gland could only be measured from freshly collected specimens. So we collected the mimics (workers in the case of ants) from a variety of places across Australia (Cairns, Townsville, Brisbane, Sydney, Blue Mountains, Broken Hill, Hay, Macquarie Port, Tweed Heads, Sunshine Coast, Hervey Bay, Agnes Water). In total, 75 specimens belonging to 41 species, eight genera, and four subfamilies were collected alive. Individuals were killed by freezing at \u221220\u00b0C. Cuticle thickness was measured by slicing the thorax (mesosoma) perpendicularly using a blade and then measuring it under a stereomicroscope to the nearest 0.01 mm. To measure the size of the\u00a0gland, the gland was dissected from the gaster (thorax in bugs) using fine forceps, placed on a glass slide in a drop of water, and covered with a coverslip. The gland was approximately oval; thus the two perpendicular lengths of the gland were measured using an ocular ruler. We estimated gland area assuming a regular ellipsoid shape. We measured the\u00a0sting length after pulling it from the abdomen using forceps. In each of these individuals we also measured the gaster/abdomen length, and thorax length. The ability to perform a communal attack (i.e. attack by several individuals) was taken from the literature and was assumed to be consistent throughout each genus. To estimate these traits for the remaining ant species that we failed to collect we used an interpolation based on proxy measures using 55 specimens: the size of both the poison/pygidial gland and sting length were regressed (using a linear model) from the size of the gaster, and cuticle thickness was regressed from the size of the thorax. These regression models (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) were then used to predict values for species we were unable to sample. The gland content varies among species of ants from different subfamilies: Formicinae ants possess formic acid (<a href=\"#bib46\">O'Rourke, 1950</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Stumper, 1952</a>), Dolichoderinae ants possess terpens, such as iridodial and dolichodial (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cavill, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cavill and Hinterberger, 1960</a>), and Myrmeciinae ants possess indole (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jackson et al., 1990</a>). The metathoracic scent gland in true bugs produces pungent pyrazines and alkenals (<a href=\"#bib41\">Millar, 2005</a>). As the relative potency of these chemicals is unknown, we considered all these chemicals to be similarly noxious."

A GLS model with Brownian motion model correlation structure was used to correct for the effect of phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pek\u00e1r and Brabec, 2012</a>). To account for the fact that for some species, some defensive traits could not be measured (and were interpolated) we used weights that corresponded to the proportion of observed characteristics. Both variables were affected strongly by the body size so this measure needed to be included in the analysis. The body size had strong phylogenetic inertia (GLS, Pagel\u2019s \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01.08), thus by controlling for phylogeny the body size effect was included too, therefore use of the body size as a covariate was not necessary."

The campus in addition to buildings, contains a patch of native forest, several rocky streams, and open green space interspersed with trees where the predators could have been collected and observed which would be very difficult or even impossible in the pristine forest where the selection have taken place. The predators included noisy miners, lizards (skinks), and a number of arthropods that occur on the trunks and the immediate vicinity of Eucalyptus trees, where the mimics occur (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We sampled arthropods from under the bark of more than 50 trees and selected those that were predatory. Arthropods were immediately placed into 99% pure ethanol and then in a freezer at \u221220\u00b0C. Co-existing predators were selected among the most abundant species to represent three guilds according to their trophic strategy and prey detection modality: (1) visually-oriented euryphagous predators, (2) non-visually oriented ant-adverse predators, and (3) specialized ant-eating predators. We used the information of their gut content and data from the literature (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jackson and Harding, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Platnick, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Higgins et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">McGinley et al., 2015</a>) to identify those that feed on prey related to the mimics.

These two predators were selected because they feed on arthropods, were most abundant among congeners and foraged on tree trunks. <i>Eulamprus quoyii</i> were collected from both rocky streams (human-altered) and forest-edge by noosing. Lizards typically defecated immediately upon capture and in some cases we gently massaged the abdomen to expel a faecal pellet. <i>Manorina melanocephala</i> faeces were collected at temporary feeding stations to avoid handling the birds. We lured birds to a large canvas (3 \u00d7 5 m) by placing small amounts of sweet cake near a water bowl and perches made from branches. The stations were monitored continuously.

The reaction mixture total volume of 20 \u03bcL consisted of 10.6 \u03bcL of Multiplex PCR Master Mix, 1.8 \u03bcL of Q-Solution, 2.1 \u03bcL of RNase-free water, 0.5 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM forward and 0.5 \u03bcL of reverse primers, and 4.5 \u03bcL of DNA. PCR with Bothm primers was done separately whereas three remaining primer pairs were used in one multiplex reaction. PCR products were detected by electrophoresis in 2% GoodView-stained agarose gels. PCR was repeated for each sample and primer combination at least three times to exclude falsely negative results. In positive samples, PCR was repeated once again using primers modified with MID identifiers (i.e. multiplex identifiers, 10bp-long barcoding sequences). Each sample was thus marked with a unique combination of barcodes. PCR products were purified using a\u00a0QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The\u00a0concentration of each PCR product was measured using NanoDrop 8000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltman, MA) and assessed comparing to 50 bp ladder (Fermentas). Five \u03bcL of 50 \u03bcg/\u03bcL PCR products was pooled into the same sterile vial and sent for sequencing."

Based on their unpalatability, the ants and bugs were predicted to be M\u00fcllerian mimics, while the spider was predicted to be a Batesian mimic. Unpalatability was re-estimated for these five species using ten individuals from each species. All attributes as measured previously were re-measured with the addition of a behavioural measure. The behavioural measure was the frequency of biting in the field following agitation with forceps.

They were fed regularly with three crickets (<i>Acheta domestica</i>) three times a week. The skinks were then starved five days prior to the predation trials. One day prior to the trial a layer of butter was applied to the sides of the white container to prevent arthropods from climbing the walls and escaping. At the start of a trial a lizard was left to settle down for a period of 5 min. A prey item was released into the container and the behaviour of the skink during the 5 min trial was recorded with a fixed video camera positioned above the container. Five minutes was deemed sufficient, as previous feeding trials with crickets have shown this species of lizard will attempt to capture prey within 1 min. If the potential prey survived it was removed, and the skink was left for 2 min to settle down. Another prey item was then released and so on until all five mimic prey types were used. As a non-mimic control, we used juveniles of the spider, <i>Badumna insignis</i> L. Koch, which was of a similar size to the other species but was not a mimic as it lacked golden colouration. At the end a cricket was released as a positive control. Results of trials were used in the analysis only if the cricket was captured."

The learned aversion was necessary because skinks were collected in the wild a number of months prior to the trials and fed with crickets since then. We used 26 skinks in total.

I therefore think the study is novel, interesting to a wide audience, and important, and I applaud the authors for the huge effort required to collect the data.

In the discussion, the authors briefly acknowledge the fact that body size might correlate with their measure of noxiousness. [Indeed, some of the components of noxiousness them ARE body size (subsection \u201cMimetic noxiousness\u201d: missing values were taken from measures of body size).] The authors (rightly) point out that the absolute (as opposed to relative) size of defences such as spines may indeed matter to predators, so controlling for body size may reduce the information content of their noxiousness measure. However, body size matters to predators in many ways not directly related to the absolute size of defences: large prey have higher nutritional value and larger handling times, they may be unavailable to small predators because of anatomical constraints, they may be more likely to act as intraguild predators of small predators etc. So any relationship between predation and noxiousness (e.g. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>) may result from effects of body size other than those identified by the authors. The problems go beyond this: some of the interesting relationships identified in the results appear to be simple artefacts because of correlations with body size. For example, the relationship in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> shows an absolute measure of surface area (which obviously reflects body size) against noxiousness (which is known to reflect body size). Does this not just say that large animals have large surface areas? The authors have data on body size, so there is no difficultly in examining which relationships hold when body size effects are removed, either by expressing the constituent parts of noxiousness relative to body size, or by including body size as an alternative independent variable in the analysis. I agree with them that this will involve disposing of some of the useful biological information in the current noxiousness measure, and I would recommend displaying both kinds of analysis. If the relationships only hold when body size is not removed, the conclusion must be that any identified relationships involving noxiousness *may* (or may not) result from impacts of body size other than those related to the absolute size of spines, stings, venom glands etc."

How strong was the support for k = 10? Can you provide AIC scores for a range of models? The Manova doesn't really help in this respect, because any (arbitrary) partitioning of multivariate space would yield significantly different groupings. Which raw variables are important in distinguishing the clusters? How important is body size? I don't think it matters too much if the support for the clusters is weak: the existence of separate rings does not seem very important to the main points of interest in the paper. You might even ditch consideration of the rings altogether, or write a separate paper in which you consider the details."

The authors show that the rings are very speciose. They claim that the multiple ways of expressing defence, including distastefulness, venom and stingers, etc., contribute to equalling out the protection against a diverse set of predators, and lead to mutualistic interactions between the species participating in the mimicry ring."

The philosophy of this seems to be measuring as many things as we can, churning them into a multivariate analysis and taking this as a meaningful quantification of key ecological variables -morphology, defence/noxiousness, visual pattern, resemblance, etc. Unfortunately most of this is based on the postulate that if we measure many variables, they will together average out to something meaningful and hopefully not too far from the variation that is relevant to selection. I don't subscribe to this point of view. Resemblance is measured using a number of colour variables on different body parts, but it is impossible to understand how legitimate the absence of weighting is, in order for the composite measure to describe to morphological resemblance in a way that is relevant for predators. Similarly, noxiousness, an eminently perceptual notion, is \"quantified\" arbitrarily using size measurements of defence organs; although those don't necessarily correlate well with the perception of the noxious effects (tiny ants may have powerful venom, elongate mandibles may produce less painful a bite than short stubby mandibles, etc.). Generally, measurements are carried out on collection specimens or photographs, so I have less faith than the authors in the relevance of that to selection pressures in the wild. There is a hint of an effort to link perception with measurements, in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, but it is based on 6 data points (actually 4, since defenceless insects bring no information here)."

Similarly, the community of predators is indeed rich and diverse but the expectations of having multiple predators with different diets and affected in very different ways by prey defences are unclear, so again how this influences the evolution of this mimicry assemblage is impossible to tell. The \"rings\" the authors describe are analysed in terms of their geographic overlap but we don't know what the expectations are under different possible scenarios producing those rings, or what might underlie their clustered distribution in the morphological space. The authors ask whether mimicry should promote species richness in a clade, but why should mimetic clade be more speciose? Again the foundations of that conjecture are quite unclear. Those are just examples, and the net result is a manuscript where none of the data provide compelling insight into the mechanisms involved in the convergent evolution in the mimicry assemblage under study."

However limited in power, the per predator (or per dropping) quantification is ok and gives a hint to the prevalence of certain prey in a predator's ecology. I would however be more careful with relating this to frequencies of prey in the field. Furthermore, the urban park setting is probably quite different from the predator's ecology in more pristine conditions where mimicry has evolved in those groups."

In the discussion, the authors briefly acknowledge the fact that body size might correlate with their measure of noxiousness. [Indeed, some of the components of noxiousness them ARE body size (subsection \u201cMimetic noxiousness\u201d: missing values were taken from measures of body size).] The authors (rightly) point out that the absolute (as opposed to relative) size of defences such as spines may indeed matter to predators, so controlling for body size may reduce the information content of their noxiousness measure. However, body size matters to predators in many ways not directly related to the absolute size of defences: large prey have higher nutritional value and larger handling times, they may be unavailable to small predators because of anatomical constraints, they may be more likely to act as intraguild predators of small predators etc. So any relationship between predation and noxiousness (e.g. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>) may result from effects of body size other than those identified by the authors. The problems go beyond this: some of the interesting relationships identified in the results appear to be simple artefacts because of correlations with body size. For example, the relationship in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> shows an absolute measure of surface area (which obviously reflects body size) against noxiousness (which is known to reflect body size). Does this not just say that large animals have large surface areas? The authors have data on body size, so there is no difficultly in examining which relationships hold when body size effects are removed, either by expressing the constituent parts of noxiousness relative to body size, or by including body size as an alternative independent variable in the analysis. I agree with them that this will involve disposing of some of the useful biological information in the current noxiousness measure, and I would recommend displaying both kinds of analysis. If the relationships only hold when body size is not removed, the conclusion must be that any identified relationships involving noxiousness *may* (or may not) result from impacts of body size other than those related to the absolute size of spines, stings, venom glands etc.</i>"

We re-run the analyses with body size as a covariate and the effects were still significant as without the covariate but with the phylogenetic correlation structure. The body size had strong phylogenetic inertia (Pagel\u2019s \u03bb = 1.08), thus by controlling for phylogeny the body size effect was included too, therefore use of the body size as a covariate was not necessary."

I don't subscribe to this point of view.

The \"rings\" the authors describe are analysed in terms of their geographic overlap but we don't know what the expectations are under different possible scenarios producing those rings, or what might underlie their clustered distribution in the morphological space. The authors ask whether mimicry should promote species richness in a clade, but why should mimetic clade be more speciose? Again the foundations of that conjecture are quite unclear.
