Plexin signaling depends on their cytoplasmic GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain, which specifically inactivates the Ras homolog Rap through an ill-defined non-canonical catalytic mechanism. The plexin GAP is activated by semaphorin-induced dimerization, the structural basis for which remained unknown. Here we present the crystal structures of the active dimer of zebrafish PlexinC1 cytoplasmic region in the apo state and in complex with Rap. The structures show that the dimerization induces a large-scale conformational change in plexin, which opens the GAP active site to allow Rap binding. Plexin stabilizes the switch II region of Rap in an unprecedented conformation, bringing Gln63 in Rap into the active site for catalyzing GTP hydrolysis. The structures also explain the unique Rap-specificity of plexins. Mutational analyses support that these mechanisms underlie plexin activation and signaling."

Plexin signaling depends on their cytoplasmic GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain, which specifically inactivates the Ras homolog Rap through an ill-defined non-canonical catalytic mechanism. The plexin GAP is activated by semaphorin-induced dimerization, the structural basis for which remained unknown. Here we present the crystal structures of the active dimer of zebrafish PlexinC1 cytoplasmic region in the apo state and in complex with Rap. The structures show that the dimerization induces a large-scale conformational change in plexin, which opens the GAP active site to allow Rap binding. Plexin stabilizes the switch II region of Rap in an unprecedented conformation, bringing Gln63 in Rap into the active site for catalyzing GTP hydrolysis. The structures also explain the unique Rap-specificity of plexins. Mutational analyses support that these mechanisms underlie plexin activation and signaling."

This conformational change in Rap catalyses the breakdown of a signalling molecule called GTP, which inactivates Rap and triggers an intracellular signalling cascade that causes the axon to collapse and change direction."

The juxtamembrane segment has been suggested to regulate plexin signaling by interacting with the GAP domain or mediating oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell et al., 2011</a>). Binding of RhoGTPases such as Rac1 and RND1 to the RBD facilitates plexin activation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vikis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Driessens et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zanata et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Turner et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tong et al., 2007</a>), the mechanism of which is not well understood (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). The GAP domain in plexin shows structural homology to RasGAPs such as p120GAP, and contains a functionally essential arginine residue corresponding to the catalytic \u2018arginine finger\u2019 in RasGAPs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rohm et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Oinuma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2009</a>).

Our recent study, however, has demonstrated that the plexin GAP does not act directly on R-Ras or M-Ras (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Instead it is active specifically to the Ras homolog Rap, and this RapGAP activity is critical for plexin signaling. GTP-bound active Rap is a key activator of integrin for promoting cell\u2013matrix adhesion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gloerich and Bos, 2011</a>). Conversion of Rap into the GDP-bound inactive form by the plexin GAP likely contributes to plexin-mediated repulsive axon guidance and other cell morphological changes through causing inactivation of integrin and weakening cell\u2013matrix adhesion (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)."

Concomitantly, a conserved glutamine in the GTPases (Gln61 in Ras) coordinates the nucleophilic water for hydrolysis. Many other GAP/small GTPase pairs use similar mechanisms to catalyze GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bos et al., 2007</a>). Rap is distinct from Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras in that it has a threonine at position 61, which lacks the ability to coordinate the catalytic water. Canonical RapGAPs are structurally unrelated to RasGAPs and catalyze Rap GTP hydrolysis by providing an asparagine residue (referred to as the \u2018Asn thumb\u2019) to fulfill the water coordination role of Gln61 in Ras (<a href=\"#bib52\">Scrima et al., 2008</a>). SynGAP (Synaptic GAP), and three GAP1 family members Rasal (Ras-GTPase-activating-like protein), CAPRI (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-promoted Ras inactivator) and GAP1<sup>IP4BP</sup> (tetrakisphosphate binding protein) are dual-specificity GAPs, active to both Ras and Rap. Plexins and these dual-specificity GAPs share the RasGAP fold that contains the arginine finger but lack a conserved Asn thumb (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kupzig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pena et al., 2008</a>). They facilitate GTP hydrolysis for Rap through a distinct, poorly understood mechanism. A recent study has suggested that Gln63 in Rap plays a role analogous to Gln61 in Ras in the non-canonical catalysis of the dual-specificity GAPs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sot et al., 2010</a>).

Our previous structural analyses have suggested that the plexin GAP is autoinhibited by adopting a closed conformation that sequesters the active site (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2009</a>). A pre-formed inhibitory dimer of plexin may also be involved in suppressing the GAP activity prior to semaphorin binding (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antipenko et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nogi et al., 2010</a>).

These observations collectively support that semaphorin-induced formation of an active dimer of plexin is the major mechanism for activation of the GAP domain and intracellular signaling."

In addition, we employed a novel protein ligation system to covalently link the plexin cytoplasmic region and Rap, which stabilized their weak interaction and allowed us to crystallize and determine the structure of a PlexinC1/Rap complex.

Our extensive crystallization trials of these coiled-coil induced dimers of plexins<sub>cyto</sub> all failed, presumably due to the flexibility of the linker. We therefore removed the linker and directly fused the coiled-coil with the juxtamembrane helix (the N-terminal helix in the juxtamembrane segment) of plexin<sub>cyto</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Assuming the coiled-coil motif and the juxtamembrane helix of plexin merge into a continuous helix, varying the relative register between them by adding or removing residues at the junction can result in dramatically different relative orientations between the two plexin monomers in the dimer. Without knowing the ideal arrangement of the two monomers for active dimer formation, we systematically tested fusing plexin<sub>cyto</sub> to each of the seven unique positions on the heptad repeat of the coiled-coil (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We used mouse PlexinA1<sub>cyto</sub> for the screening experiments, because it displayed the highest level of activation by induced dimerization in our previous study (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). We chose Ala1272, located near the N-terminus of the juxtamembrane helix in PlexinA1<sub>cyto</sub>, as the reference for naming the fusion constructs. These constructs are referred to as CC(x)PlexinA1<sub>cyto</sub>, in which \u2018x\u2019 indicates the position of Ala1272 in PlexinA1 on the heptad repeat (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

Comparison of the active dimers in the two structures suggests that there is a small geometric incompatibility between the coiled-coil and the plexin dimer, as the N-terminal portion of the juxtamembrane helix (residues 553\u2013566) seems to bend slightly near its junction with the coiled-coil (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This portion of the juxtamembrane helix does not mediate any inter-molecular interactions and likely has some flexibility. The flexibility can further compensate for deletion or insertion of one residue at the junction between the coiled-coil and the juxtamembrane helix, allowing several constructs to induce the active dimer and achieve similarly high activation levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). More deletions or insertions at the junction probably cannot be accommodated without severe distortion of the juxtamembrane helix, explaining the much lower activation levels of those constructs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

The activation segment in the structure of the PlexinC1/Rap complex adopts a similar open conformation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Therefore, a major mechanism in the dimerization-induced activation of plexin appears to be the outward shift of the activation segment, which opens the otherwise obstructed active site to allow Rap binding and catalysis of GTP hydrolysis. While this conformational change in the plexin GAP domain seems small, it is known that interactions between small GTPases and their regulators or effectors can be strongly influenced by subtle changes at the binding interface (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nassar et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Snyder et al., 2002</a>). The activation segment in the PlexinC1/Rap complex is slightly more closed than that in the coiled-coil-induced PlexinC1 dimer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), indicating that the active dimer promotes a conformation that is more open than required for accommodating Rap.

Since the ligand for zebrafish PlexinC1 was not available, mouse PlexinA3 and its ligand Sema3F were used in these assays (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2009</a>). The K1273E, E1278R, E1285R and M1290E mutations of mouse PlexinA3, corresponding to R576E, D581K, D588K and V593E of zebrafish PlexinC1 respectively, all significantly impaired plexin-mediated COS7 cell collapse (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). A previous study identified a large panel of mutations that abolished PlexinB1-mediated COS7 cell collapse (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell et al., 2011</a>). These mutations were designed to test the model of plexin activation by Rac1-induced oligomerization. The results are also consistent with the activation mechanism shown here, as most of the mutated resides are conserved in zebrafish PlexinC1 and are involved in formation of the active dimer. Some mutations of highly conserved residues in the dimer interface have been identified in cancer patients, including R2040W in PlexinB1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gui et al., 2011</a>) (corresponding to Lys1058 in zebrafish PlexinC1) and R1680Q/W in PlexinA2 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012</a>) (corresponding to Lys937 in zebrafish PlexinC1). Both of these mutations likely prevent formation of the active dimer of plexins, consistent with the tumor suppressor function of plexins suggested by previous studies (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</a>)."

The linker between PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub> and Rap1B is not visible in the electron density map, suggesting that it is flexible as designed and does not impose restraints on the plexin/Rap interaction. A superimposition of Rap and Ras in the PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub>/Rap and p120GAP/Ras complexes shows that the overall binding modes of the two with their respective GAPs are similar (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, left panel) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Scheffzek et al., 1997</a>). The GAP domain in PlexinC1 and Switches I (residues 30\u201338) and II (residues 59\u201367) in Rap constitute the majority of the binding interface, whereas the RBD in plexin is not involved and its role in GAP regulation remains unclear (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The core of the interface is composed of several hydrophobic residues, which are surrounded by numerous charge\u2013charge interactions at the periphery. Most of the Rap-binding residues are conserved among the plexin family members, suggesting that they all interact with Rap in the same mode (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). The presumed arginine finger (Arg711) in PlexinC1 superimposes well with the arginine finger (Arg789) in p120GAP, playing the same role in catalysis by interacting with the AlF<sub>x</sub> and GDP in the active site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). While the bound AlF<sub>x</sub> is not clearly resolved in the relatively low-resolution map, the shape of the density suggests that it is the trigonal AlF<sub>3</sub>, the same as in the p120GAP/Ras structure. We therefore modeled it AlF<sub>3</sub> in the structure. The second conserved arginine (Arg1001) in PlexinC1 is equivalent to Arg903 in p120GAP, which stabilizes the position of the arginine finger (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The functional importance of these two arginine residues in plexin has been demonstrated by previous mutational studies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rohm et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Oinuma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)."

GAP1m, the only GAP1 family member that is active toward Ras but not Rap, has a valine at this position (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). Proline-to-valine mutants of the dual-specificity GAP1 family members (Rasal, CAPRI and GAP1<sup>IP4BP</sup>) remain active toward Ras, but lose activity toward Rap (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kupzig et al., 2009</a>). The superimposition of the p120GAP/Ras and PlexinC1/Rap structures suggests the basis for how this residue determines the substrate specificity of these GAPs (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Pro907 in p120GAP contributes to Ras binding by stacking against Tyr64 in Switch II of Ras. A valine residue at the position of Pro907 (Val515 in GAP1m in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>) appears to be readily accommodated in this Ras binding mode (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Assuming Rap adopts the same Gln63-in conformation when it binds the dual-specificity GAPs, a proline residue at this position in the GAPs is compatible with the interaction. However, the Gln63-in conformation of Rap places Phe64 much closer to the proline residue (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Replacing the proline with a bulkier valine residue likely cause steric clashes with Phe64 in Rap, leading to loss of the RapGAP activity."

Residue 31 in Rap and Ras is a key residue for determining the binding specificity for downstream effectors of these two closely related small GTPases (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nassar et al., 1996</a>). Our PlexinC1<sub>cyto</sub>/Rap1B structure suggests that residue 31 is also a determinant for the specificity between the plexin GAP and Rap. Rap possesses a lysine at this position, which is replaced by a negatively charged residue (aspartate or glutamate) in Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Lys31 and Asp33 in Rap form a charge\u2013charge pair and are buried by the activation segment in PlexinC1 (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). We made a Rap(K31E) mutant to render it more similar to Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras. This mutation is predicted to destabilize the PlexinC1/Rap interaction, since it closely places two buried negative charges. The GAP assay indeed showed that PlexinC1 failed to catalyze GTP hydrolysis for the K31E mutant (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>)."

Consistent with this notion, Rap2 has a proline residue at position 95 and is less responsive to the plexin GAP (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). The corresponding residues in Ras, R-Ras and M-Ras are glutamine, lysine and arginine respectively (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Mutating Rap Asp95 to lysine, as in R-Ras, substantially decreased the rate of PlexinC1-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>). Likewise, PlexinC1(K666D) displayed lower GAP activity than the wild-type PlexinC1 (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>). The PlexinC1(K666D) and Rap(D95K) charge-swapped pair only slightly restored the GTP hydrolysis activity (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>), which may be due to disruption of the electrostatic complementarity at the plexin/Rap interface by the mutations. We also tested the importance of this interaction in the cell-based assay, which showed that the equivalent mutation of mouse PlexinA3 (R1360D) impaired the cell collapse activity (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12D</a>). The same residue in human PlexinA1 (Arg1384) has been found mutated to cysteine in cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seshagiri et al., 2012</a>). These analyses together with the unique plexin/Switch II interface support the notion that plexins have evolved to recognize residues in Rap that have diverged from other Ras family members, leading to loss of activity toward Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras."

Semaphorin binding to the plexin extracellular region induces formation of the active dimer of the cytoplasmic region, which triggers its GAP activity to inactivate Rap through the non-canonical catalytic mechanism for signal transduction. Conformational changes similar to those undertaken by the plexin GAP domain upon the dimerization may serve as on/off switches for other related GAPs such as CAPRI, which is also activated by dimerization (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2011</a>). In addition to activation of the GAP, the dimerization-induced structural rearrangements may underlie the activation state-selective binding of plexins by signal transducers such as FARP2 (FERM, RhoGEF and pleckstrin homology protein 2) and MICAL (molecule interacting with CasL) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Toyofuku et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schmidt et al., 2008</a>). The structures of the several extracellular membrane-proximal domains and the transmembrane helix of plexins have not been determined. Our data suggest that, upon semaphorin-induced dimerization, these domains are arranged precisely to ensure the proper juxtaposition of the juxtamembrane helix for inducing the active dimer of the cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). Future work on these domains in the active dimeric state will fill in the missing links, leading to a complete structural model of semaphorin-activated plexin."

The results shown here and in our previous study (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>) together demonstrate that while sharing the same domain fold with RasGAPs and dual-specificity GAPs, plexins are a unique group that are active to Rap, but not to Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras. Our analysis of the plexin/Rap complex structure reveals residues in both plexin and Rap that contribute to this specificity. P120GAP has been shown to bind GTP-bound Rap strongly but fail to catalyze its GTP hydrolysis, making Rap an effective inhibitor of the GAP activity of p120GAP to Ras/R-Ras/M-Ras (<a href=\"#bib11\">Frech et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hata et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yatani et al., 1991</a>). The apparent GAP activity of plexins towards R-Ras and M-Ras reported previously may be caused indirectly by inactivation of Rap and alleviation of its inhibition on p120GAP. The induced Gln63-in conformation of Rap seen in the PlexinC1/Rap complex structure likely represents the general mechanism by which plexins and the dual-specificity GAPs facilitate GTP hydrolysis for Rap. This conformation is stabilized by specific interactions made by several conserved residues in plexin. The dual-specificity GAPs achieve this through different mechanisms that likely involve the extra domains, the precise basis for which awaits structural studies of these GAPs in complex with Rap."

Cells were stained with the BCIP/NBT alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and counted using a randomized and blind method."

Mutational analysis of key residues in the dimer interface supports the authors\u2019 conclusion that this mode of dimerization leads to an increase in Rap GAP activity. Taken together, these new structures, along with the associated biochemical studies, reveal for the first time how plexin cytoplasmic domains signal in response to semaphorin binding, through dimerization-mediated conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain promoting Rap GTP binding and induced GTP hydrolysis."

As discussed in the paper, the disordered portion of the activation segment may also contribute to autoinhibition by sampling conformations that obstruct Rap binding, whereas in the dimer structure this segment is stabilized in the open conformation. These effects together may account for the activity difference between the active dimer and the monomer (which displays basal activity and is not completely inactive). In addition, interactions between small GTPases and their regulators seem to be rather sensitive to subtle changes at the interface. For example, a single Leu/Ile in Dbl-family RhoGEFs serves as the major specificity determinant for distinguishing Rac1 and Cdc42 (Snyder, Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 2002, 9, 468).
