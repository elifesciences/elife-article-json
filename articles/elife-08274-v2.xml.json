                    "text": "Prevention of relapses is a major challenge in treating anxiety disorders. Fear reinstatement can cause relapse in spite of successful fear reduction through extinction-based exposure therapy. By utilising a contextual fear-conditioning task in mice, we found that reinstatement was accompanied by decreased c-Fos expression in the infralimbic cortex (IL) with reduction of synaptic input and enhanced c-Fos expression in the medial subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeM). Moreover, we found that IL dopamine plays a key role in reinstatement. A reinstatement-inducing reminder shock induced c-Fos expression in the IL-projecting dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and the blocking of IL D1 signalling prevented reduction of synaptic input, CeM c-Fos expression, and fear reinstatement. These findings demonstrate that a dopamine-dependent inactivation of extinction circuits underlies fear reinstatement and may explain the comorbidity of substance use disorders and anxiety disorders."

Fear reinstatement can cause relapse in spite of successful fear reduction through extinction-based exposure therapy. By utilising a contextual fear-conditioning task in mice, we found that reinstatement was accompanied by decreased c-Fos expression in the infralimbic cortex (IL) with reduction of synaptic input and enhanced c-Fos expression in the medial subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeM). Moreover, we found that IL dopamine plays a key role in reinstatement. A reinstatement-inducing reminder shock induced c-Fos expression in the IL-projecting dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and the blocking of IL D1 signalling prevented reduction of synaptic input, CeM c-Fos expression, and fear reinstatement. These findings demonstrate that a dopamine-dependent inactivation of extinction circuits underlies fear reinstatement and may explain the comorbidity of substance use disorders and anxiety disorders."

For example, if a mouse receives a small shock every time it enters a particular cage, it will learn to associate that cage with the shock. Once this association has been created, it can be \u2018undone\u2019 using a procedure called extinction. In the cage example, this may be performed by placing the mouse in the cage for a long time, but without giving it any shocks. Over time, the animal learns that the cage is no longer linked to an unpleasant outcome. However, if a mouse is given a reminder shock after extinction has occurred, the original association between the cage and the shock is re-established. This is known as fear reinstatement and is similar to a relapse."

As expected, fear could be linked to activity in the amygdala. During extinction, high levels of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex suppressed the amygdala's response. When the mice experienced the reminder shock, a chemical called dopamine was released. When dopamine entered the medial prefrontal cortex, the region's activity was reduced, removing the \u2018brakes\u2019 from the amygdala and reinstating the mice's fear."

Fear conditioning and extinction are used in animal models of anxiety disorders and their treatment (<a href=\"#bib16\">Davis, 2002</a>). In extinction, conditioned responses can be reduced by prolonged presentations of conditional stimuli (CS) without the associated unconditional stimuli (US) (<a href=\"#bib36\">LeDoux, 2000</a>). Many studies have shown that the infralimbic cortex (IL) is a critical brain region for extinction (<a href=\"#bib24\">Herry et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010</a>). Extinction is suppressed by pharmacological inactivation of the IL (<a href=\"#bib32\">Laurent and Westbrook, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</a>) as well as by local injection of <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burgos-Robles et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2009</a>) or cannabinoid antagonists (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2009</a>) into the IL. The IL inhibits the medial subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeM), a key region for fear expression (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wilensky et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ciocchi et al., 2010</a>), partly through intercalated amygdala neurons (ITCs) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Likhtik et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amano et al., 2010</a>), which are also necessary for extinction."

About 40% of patients in remission experience a relapse (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bruce et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ansell et al., 2011</a>). While clinical observations have limitations on experimental control, relapse studies in the laboratory provide more information because of the greater potential for experimental manipulation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vervliet et al., 2013</a>). In experimental animals, fear can be reinstated by one or more US-only presentations after successful extinction (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rescorla and Heth, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bertotto et al., 2006</a>). We previously reported that fear reinstatement occurs through NMDAR- and protein synthesis-dependent neural plasticity (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shen et al., 2013</a>). It has also been reported that fear reinstatement requires \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor endocytosis, and actin rearrangement in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Motanis and Maroun, 2012</a>). However, neural circuit mechanisms responsible for fear reinstatement are poorly understood. Interestingly, the BLA\u2013medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway is potentiated following fear extinction and depotentiated following reinstatement (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vouimba and Maroun, 2011</a>). Therefore, the mPFC could be a key region mediating fear reinstatement. Nevertheless, little is known about activity changes of the mPFC and its downstream brain regions during fear reinstatement, synaptic modifications within the mPFC, and potential molecular regulation of such modifications."

We focused on the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus because they are important in fear modulation and have reciprocal connections (<a href=\"#bib53\">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</a>). In addition, we used in vitro patch-clamp recording to explore synaptic modifications within the mPFC. Building on our results from the c-Fos and electrophysiology experiments, we hypothesised that prefrontal dopamine plays a key role in reinstatement and tested this hypothesis pharmacologically. Together, these data suggest that a dopamine-dependent inactivation of extinction circuits underlies fear reinstatement."

Mice learned an association between CS (chamber A) and US (foot shocks) on Day 1. On Day 2, they received a prolonged CS presentation without any US (extinction training), then their freezing time gradually decreased. On Day 3, they were re-exposed to CS to confirm retention of extinction (test 1). To reinstate the conditioned fear, they immediately received a weak US (reminder shock) in chamber B on Day 4, and they were exposed to CS again on Day 5 (test 2). The mice showed higher freezing time in test 2 than they did in test 1, suggesting successful reinstatement. Freezing time was comparable between tests 1 and 2 if mice were exposed to chamber B without a reminder shock on Day 4 (39.5 \u00b1 4.2% in test 1 and 32.6 \u00b1 5.3% in test 2, n = 4). When we gave the reminder shock to naive mice, the reminder shock alone did not induce high fear responses (6.0 \u00b1 2.1%, n = 5), indicating that the reminder shock-induced increase in freezing was derived from the original conditioned fear, not from new learning."

Mice were exposed to the CS one day after reminder shock (Reinstatement group). The Fear and Extinction groups were exposed to the CS one day after conditioning and one day after extinction training, respectively. The freezing time of the Reinstatement group was higher than it was in the Extinction group and comparable to that of the Fear group (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Brains were removed 90 min later and subjected to c-Fos immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The density of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the IL in the Reinstatement group was lower than it was in the Extinction group and comparable to that in the Fear group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), which was not affected by thresholding (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given that the IL inhibits the CeM partly through the ITC, the reduced IL activity could result in low ITC and high CeM activities. Consistent with this idea, the density of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the ventral ITC and CeM decreased and increased, respectively, in the Reinstatement group compared to the Extinction group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). There were no significant differences between the Extinction and Reinstatement groups in other sub-regions of the mPFC, amygdala, or hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results suggest that low IL activity disinhibits the CeM during fear reinstatement."

It is reported that aversive stimuli activate VTA dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brischoux et al., 2009</a>) and elevate dopamine concentration in the PFC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abercrombie et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hamamura and Fibiger, 1993</a>). Additionally, dopamine application with electric stimulation suppresses transmitter release onto mPFC neurons via dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Law-Tho et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gao et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, we hypothesised that a reminder shock activates the VTA-to-IL circuit and that dopamine D1 signalling in the IL contributes to reduction of synaptic input onto IL neurons and subsequent fear reinstatement. In order to assess this idea, we tested whether a reminder shock induces c-Fos expression in the VTA neurons projecting to the IL. We retrogradely labelled the neurons projecting to the IL by infusing Alexa 488-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into the IL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Of the retrogradely labelled cells (CTB<sub>IL</sub><sup>+</sup>) in the VTA, 59.1 \u00b1 4.5% were immunopositive for a dopamine neuron marker, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH<sup>+</sup>), indicating that they were dopaminergic. This is within the range reported in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Margolis et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lammel et al., 2011</a>). The mice underwent conditioning, extinction training, test 1, and were exposed to chamber B with or without a reminder shock; their brains were removed 90 min later. c-Fos and TH were immunostained and observed in the VTA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We found that a reminder shock increased c-Fos expression in the CTB<sub>IL</sub><sup>+</sup> TH<sup>+</sup> VTA neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), but not in the CTB<sub>IL</sub><sup>+</sup> TH<sup>\u2212</sup> VTA neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

SCH23390 infusions into the IL prevented reinstatement (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). On the other hand, SCH23390 infusions into the prelimbic cortex (PL), a region adjacent to the IL, did not affect reinstatement (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate a specific role of IL dopaminergic signalling in the induction of reinstatement. Next, we examined the effect of IL D1R blockage on reduction of synaptic input onto IL neurons associated with reinstatement. Brain slices were prepared after test 2 from the mice infused with SCH23390 or vehicle into the IL before the reminder shock. mEPSC frequency was higher in the SCH23390-infused mice than it was in the vehicle-infused mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), while mEPSC amplitude was comparable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, IL D1R blockage attenuated reduction of synaptic input associated with reinstatement. Finally, we examined the effect of IL D1R blockage on c-Fos expression in the amygdala during test 2. Brains were removed 90 min after test 2 from the mice infused with SCH23390 or vehicle into the IL before the reminder shock. SCH23390-infused mice showed higher and lower c-Fos expression than vehicle-infused mice in the ventral ITC and CeM, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Thus, we concluded that IL D1R blockage prevents c-Fos expression changes in the amygdala associated with reinstatement.

Accordingly, we investigated the neural circuit mechanism of fear reinstatement.

Reinstatement was accompanied by presynaptic depression of transmitter release onto IL neurons. Moreover, we found that a reminder shock activated IL-projecting dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, and the blocking of IL D1R signalling prevented reduction of synaptic inputs, activity changes of ventral ITC and CeM, as well as fear reinstatement.

It is important to note, however, that c-Fos expression is not the same as neuronal firing activity. Because c-Fos expression is dependent on an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lerea et al., 1992</a>), firing activity does not always result in c-Fos elevation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clayton, 2000</a>).

Both the IL and PL of the mPFC have important roles in fear regulation. The PL promotes fear responses. As indicated by our data and previous reports, neuronal activity of the PL, which is elevated during fear retrieval, is not elevated (or lowered) during extinction retrieval (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</a>).

In this study, we found that c-Fos expression in the Reinstatement group, compared with the Extinction group, was not changed in the PL, and it was lowered in the IL.

We found that reinstatement was accompanied by low IL and ventral ITC c-Fos expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Local injection of muscimol into the IL resulted in higher freezing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), indicating that IL inactivation is sufficient for reappearance of extinguished fear. The IL has direct projections to the ITC (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cho et al., 2013</a>), which is critically involved in fear extinction (<a href=\"#bib39\">Likhtik et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Busti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ma\u0144ko et al., 2011</a>). The ITC provides feedforward inhibition of output neurons in the CeM (<a href=\"#bib56\">Royer et al., 1999</a>). Therefore, low activity of the IL and ITC could result in disinhibition of the CeM. Accordingly, we found that reinstatement was accompanied by elevated c-Fos expression in the CeM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The CeM projects to brain structures controlling conditioned fear responses, including the periaqueductal grey and the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hopkins and Holstege, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Veening et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cassell et al., 1986</a>), and CeM activity is necessary and sufficient for expression of freezing (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wilensky et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ciocchi et al., 2010</a>). Thus, disinhibition of the CeM by downregulation of IL\u2013ITC pathway may underlie fear reinstatement. Another possible pathway is through the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeL), which also receives projections from the IL and contains two functionally distinct subpopulations of neurons (CEl<sub>on</sub> or somatostatin-expressing neurons, and CEl<sub>off</sub> or protein kinase C-\u03b4-expressing neurons) forming local inhibitory circuits to inhibit CeM activity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ciocchi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Haubensak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Although we did not find a significant difference between the Extinction and Reinstatement groups in the CeL (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), further analysis with a distinction between those two populations might reveal the activation of CEl<sub>on</sub> neurons, which suppress CEl<sub>off</sub> neurons and lead to disinhibition of the CeM."

An additional experiment using minimal stimulation would be helpful to examine changes in release probability upon fear reinstatement. Previous in vitro studies also revealed the inhibitory effects of prefrontal D1Rs by pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Dopamine attenuates excitatory synaptic transmission in prefrontal neurons in a D1R-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gao et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mair and Kauer, 2007</a>). Application of dopamine, combined with electrical stimulation, can induce long-term synaptic depression in the mPFC (<a href=\"#bib33\">Law-Tho et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2004</a>); however, the phenomenon is not observed in heterozygous D1R knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2004</a>).

One possible mechanism is that dopamine triggers adenosine release and subsequently activates presynaptic adenosine A1 receptors.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed with glass microelectrodes (3\u20136 M\u03a9) filled with internal solution (120 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 phosphocreatine-Na<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgATP, 0.1 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 0.2 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, pH 7.2\u20137.3, 280\u2013295 mOsm). For electrical stimulation, a pipette with a large tip (\u223c3 \u03bcm) was filled with ACSF and placed in layer 2/3. Brief current pulses (50 \u03bcs, 1\u201340 \u03bcA) were delivered with a stimulation-isolation unit (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). Paired stimuli were given with an interstimulus interval of 50 ms, and the ratio between the amplitude of the second and first EPSCs was calculated. mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of \u221270 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u00b5M). mEPSCs were detected using an in-house MATLAB programme and were defined as inward currents with amplitudes greater than 7 pA (<a href=\"#bib49\">Miura et al., 2012</a>). To examine the intrinsic excitability, IL neurons were injected with 800-ms depolarizing current pulses ranging from 40 pA to 400 pA at 40-pA increments. The number of action potentials evoked by each current intensity was counted. The amplitude of fast afterhyperpolarization was calculated as the difference between the minimum potential after the second evoked spike within the 800-ms pulse and the spike threshold. To measure the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP), cells were held at \u221270 mV, and the 800-ms pulse, which evoked two action potentials, was injected. The amplitude of mAHP was calculated as the difference between the negative peak of the potential after the end of the 800-ms pulse and the resting membrane potential (\u221270 mV). To measure the voltage sag, a hyperpolarizing current pulse of 200 pA was injected in current-clamp mode. The voltage sag was calculated by subtracting the average steady-state voltage during a 100-ms period beginning 645 ms after the beginning of the hyperpolarizing step minus the peak of the hyperpolarization. Input resistance was calculated by current response to a 10-mV, 30-ms depolarizing pulse in voltage-clamp mode. Data were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster, CA, United States), Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments), and pClamp 10.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, United States).

However, they also felt that additional data analysis is needed and/or a better explanation on the methods used, to clarify how c-Fos cells were quantified in the infralimbic area (see individual responses for details below). Images on the quality of c-Fos labelling are required as well as information on the success of retrograde tracing of dopaminergic fibers. Reviewer 1 was questioning how reliable c-Fos labelling can be correlated with discharge activity and therefore asked for LFP recordings in the infralimbic cortex.

They find that upon reinstatement of fear c-Fos labeling is reduced in the infralimbic cortex (IL) and the connected ITC but increased in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEM), which is a key nucleus of fear expression. Ex vivo investigations show further that this behavior is accompanied by a reduced mEPSC frequency in Pyramidal cells (PCs) recorded in the IL and paired pulse depression of evoked EPSCs indicating. The authors argue that presynaptic depression in release probability may cause the reduced recruitment of IL pyramidal cells and thus underlie the observed reinstatement of fear. Finally, they find that c-Fos labeling is enhanced in the VTA, specifically in cells projecting to the IL as revealed by retrograde tracers, and show that infusion of a D1 receptor antagonist into IL reduces freezing in reinstatement test. Moreover, they observe in ex vivo whole cell recordings an enhanced mEPSC frequency and c-Fos labelling in PCs of the IL. Thus blocking D1 receptors may be an important mechanism for reinstating freezing."

It would be important to discuss whether the authors believe that these are the same or different PC populations controlling extinction and reinstatement of fear or different populations. This is therefore critical because the Title of the presented study states that \u2018reinstatement of fear is regulated by down regulation of fear extinction circuits\u2019 and proposes that this is the same circuitry. This was unclear from the Discussion.</i>"

Then, the IL has been proposed as a critical circuit for fear extinction. In the current study, we found that the decreased activity of IL neurons is associated with fear reinstatement. Therefore, we propose that fear reinstatement is regulated by down regulation of extinction circuits (that is the IL). We added to the Discussion as follows: \u201cLow IL activity may cause ITC downregulation and CeM upregulation to reinstate fear [\u2026] The CeM projects to brain structures controlling conditioned fear responses, including the periaqueductal grey and the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hopkins and Holstege, 1978</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">Cassell et al., 1986</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">Veening et al., 1984</a>), and CeM activity is necessary and sufficient for expression of freezing (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ciocchi et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">Wilensky et al., 2006</a>). Thus, disinhibition of the CeM by downregulation of IL\u2013ITC pathway may underlie fear reinstatement.\u201d"
