A fundamental question in vision neuroscience is how the visual system integrates information from the environment across different areas. Using neuroimaging, we investigated the spatial pattern of correlated BOLD signal across eight visual areas on data collected during rest conditions and during naturalistic movie viewing. The correlation pattern between areas reflected the underlying receptive field organization with higher correlations between cortical sites containing overlapping representations of visual space. In addition, the correlation pattern reflected the underlying widespread eccentricity organization of visual cortex, in which the highest correlations were observed for cortical sites with iso-eccentricity representations including regions with non-overlapping representations of visual space. This eccentricity-based correlation pattern appears to be part of an intrinsic functional architecture that supports the integration of information across functionally specialized visual areas."

A fundamental question in vision neuroscience is how the visual system integrates information from the environment across different areas. Using neuroimaging, we investigated the spatial pattern of correlated BOLD signal across eight visual areas on data collected during rest conditions and during naturalistic movie viewing. The correlation pattern between areas reflected the underlying receptive field organization with higher correlations between cortical sites containing overlapping representations of visual space. In addition, the correlation pattern reflected the underlying widespread eccentricity organization of visual cortex, in which the highest correlations were observed for cortical sites with iso-eccentricity representations including regions with non-overlapping representations of visual space. This eccentricity-based correlation pattern appears to be part of an intrinsic functional architecture that supports the integration of information across functionally specialized visual areas."

Each retinotopic map can be divided along two orthogonal axes: polar angle (i.e., angular distance) and eccentricity (i.e., radial distance). Early electrophysiological recordings in monkeys and cats identified several representations of the contralateral visual field in and around the calcarine sulcus (<a href=\"#bib25\">Daniel and Whitteridge, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Zeki, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Allman and Kaas, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Van Essen et al., 1984</a>). Through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it has now become evident that the human visual system contains over two-dozen visual maps (for review of original mapping studies, see <a href=\"#bib78\">Silver and Kastner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wandell and Winawer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdollahi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wang et al., 2014</a>)."

Anatomical studies in primates have demonstrated that neurons with overlapping receptive fields (RFs) are interconnected (<a href=\"#bib22\">Cragg, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Zeki, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Van Essen and Zeki, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983</a>). Similarly, fMRI connectivity studies in humans have demonstrated topographically-local correlations between regions with overlapping visual field representations (<a href=\"#bib46\">Heinzle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Haak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Butt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Donner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Gravel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Raemaekers et al., 2014</a>).

Correlation analyses were performed on data collected during task-free conditions (eyes-closed and fixation), and during movie viewing. Correlation patterns were consistent across subjects and experiments. In addition to finding patterns that support well-established anatomical connectivity between areas with overlapping RFs, our analyses revealed a widespread correlation pattern based on eccentricity representation, in which the BOLD signal was correlated in areas with non-overlapping visual field representations, but with matching eccentricity representations. This eccentricity-based correlation pattern was observed between upper and lower visual field representations, within and across visual areas, and between hemispheres. Moreover, correlation patterns were similar in the presence and absence of bottom-up visual input. Finally, the measured correlation pattern could not be accounted for by overlapping RFs, inter-hemisphere homotopic connections, anatomical distance, eye movements, subject motion, or physiological noise. Our results demonstrate that functional coupling between visual areas reflect both local and widespread topographical patterns. We propose that this widespread pattern is part of an intrinsic functional architecture of the visual system that could reflect eccentricity-dependent processing."

Data binning was used as a form of averaging to increase signal-to-noise within bins, while preventing the spread of signal between bins. Within-subject pairwise correlations were calculated between the mean timeseries of all bins for visual areas V1, V2, V3, hV4, V3A\u2013B (combined), and VO1\u20132 (combined), each of which has sufficient surface area to allow for fine-scale binning of eccentricity data.

These correlations were seen across the vertical and horizontal meridians at both foveal and peripheral-most bins. We first illustrate the binning analysis by examining the raw correlations between the ventral and dorsal quadrants in V3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This pair was chosen for illustration because correlations computed across quadrants are less susceptible to the influence of overlapping receptive fields (RFs) or cortical proximity. For regions that represent the same visual quadrant (e.g., the dorsal portions of visual areas V1, V2, and V3), it is difficult to dissociate effects due to shared eccentricity representations from overlapping receptive fields. Similarly, for adjacent dorsal regions, the shortest cortical distances are typically at corresponding eccentricity representations, making it difficult to dissociate eccentricity-related correlations from cortical (and volumetric) distance-based correlations. The dorsal and ventral portions of visual area V3 (as well as V2), however, only anatomically border each other at the fovea, represent different parts of the visual field (lower and upper, respectively), and thereby minimize both the overlapping receptive field and anatomical adjacency concerns. Thus, correlation analyses between these areas allowed us to test for widespread eccentricity-based correlation patterns in cases where effects of cortical distance and overlapping RFs are minimal. As seen for subject S4, the exploratory seed-based analyses showed strong correlations (red/yellow) between dorsal and ventral V3 at corresponding eccentricity representations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Binned data showed the same correlation pattern. For each of the selected dorsal V3 bins, correlations with ventral V3 bins were strongest at (and around) corresponding iso-eccentricities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). For example, peripheral-most V3d bins correlated most with peripheral-most V3v bins, and the correlations gradually decreased moving towards the foveal bin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right). The entire correlation matrix for all eccentricity locations between dorsal and ventral V3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, center panel), revealed a similar pattern, where correlations were strongest among ventral and dorsal bins with iso-eccentricity representations (i.e., the diagonal), and were weaker for bins with large radial distances (e.g., foveal vs peripheral-most)."

To assess the general effect of radial distance for each area pair, eccentricity bin correlations were grouped as a function of radial bin distance and averaged. Averaged correlations were plotted relative to iso-eccentricity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left panel). In each quadrant, the radial mid-arc (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, white outline) corresponds to the average correlation of the 0-distance bin (iso-eccentricity). Radial arcs further away from the mid-arc correspond to larger radial distances. For each radial plot, for example, V2\u2013V3, radial arcs inside of the mid-arc illustrate correlations between relatively more foveal representations of V2 and relatively more peripheral representations of V3. Radial arcs outside of the mid-arc illustrate correlations between relatively more peripheral representations of V2 and relatively more foveal representations of V3. Inner and outer radial points will be identical for within area comparisons (e.g., V2\u2013V2), but could differ for between area comparisons (e.g., V2\u2013V3). As illustrated by resting state correlations within and between areas V2 and V3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), iso-eccentricity bins were positively correlated, regardless of visual field quadrant. This was observed in all experiment conditions and area comparisons, and individual subject Fisher-transformed correlations significantly differed from zero (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). There were clear differences in overall correlation magnitude between quadrants. As expected, correlation coefficients decreased at larger radial distances for foveal and peripheral-most bins in each quadrant, regardless of this magnitude difference (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

We plotted the average correlation as a function of radial bin distance (relative to iso-eccentricity; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) between the upper and lower visual fields, right and left visual fields, as well as across both left and right and upper and lower visual fields separately (see graphic illustrations in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> left panels). Data are presented for comparisons between quadrants within and between areas V2 and V3. As discussed in the eccentricity binning section, these comparisons were chosen for illustration because overlap in visual field representation is minimal. Consistent with the radial arc plots (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), correlations between dorsal and ventral portions of V2 and V3 were strongest at 0\u2013radial distance, and steadily decreased at larger radial distances for all conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; top row). We observed similar correlation patterns as a function of radial bin distance across hemispheres, both along the horizontal plane (e.g., RH V2v and LH V2v; middle row) and diagonally across the upper and lower visual fields (e.g., RH V2v and LH V2d; bottom row). The patterns were observed even after removal of horizontal and vertical meridian data, further demonstrating that these effects are unlikely to be driven by local, overlapping visual field representations (<a href=\"#box1\">Box 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The decrease in correlation coefficients at larger radial bin distances yielded negative slopes from linear fits in each subject for all V2 and V3 pairs. For any given pair, negative slopes were similar across condition. Across V2 and V3 pairs, the average individual subject slope of the linear fit ranged between \u22120.22 and \u22120.49. Further, the average individual subject slope for each area pair was greater than 97.5% of a permuted distribution (mean 97.5% across areas, conditions = \u22120.06) where the labels of radial distances were scrambled before deriving individual subject radial distance correlations and slopes. As seen in the radial plots (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), the slopes were similar across regional comparisons, though were slightly shallower for comparisons that spanned both quadrants and hemispheres (i.e., diagonal; bottom row). Finally, we observed these effects during resting fixation and eyes closed conditions, as well as during the processing of the movie, attesting to the robustness of the effect, and excluding many potential confounds (see \u2018Control analyses\u2019). Similar results were found in all other comparisons between visual areas. The magnitude of correlation coefficients linearly decreased as a function of radial bin distance for all area comparisons (V1, V2, V3, hV4, VO1\u20132, V3A\u2013B), though slopes were generally steeper for comparisons between V1, V2, and V3. Across all areas, average individual subject slopes ranged between \u22120.14 and \u22120.80, and each was greater than 97.5% of the permuted distribution (mean 97.5% across areas, conditions = \u22120.09)."

Despite constituting (at most) a minimal portion of the signal in our bin data, we tested whether the observed eccentricity-based correlations between dorsal and ventral cortex and between the hemispheres were driven by the inclusion of these overlapping representations at the horizontal and vertical meridians, respectively, by removing data from the meridians and re-running the binning analyses. For correlations between upper and lower visual fields (dorsal and ventral cortex), we cut out 60\u00b0 of polar angle centered on the horizontal meridian, which spared 60\u00b0 of polar angle in the upper and lower visual fields near the vertical meridians. For correlations between the right and left visual fields (right and left hemispheres), we cut out 90\u00b0 of polar angle centered on each vertical meridian, which sparred 90\u00b0 of polar angle centered on the horizontal meridian in each hemisphere. Consistent with the original analyses, average individual subject correlations between dorsal and ventral portions of V2 and V3 as well as between right and left hemispheres were strongest at the 0\u2013radial distances (iso-eccentricities), and linearly decreased at larger distances for all conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In general, the slopes of correlations were marginally shallower, but did not significantly differ from the full data reported in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> (<i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05, FDR corrected). If overlapping meridian representations facilitated the correlation patterns, removal of this data should have eliminated the correlation effects.

To assess the general effect of angular distance for each area pair, data were grouped into 12 equally spaced polar angle bins. Correlations between bins were computed and grouped as a function of angular bin distance. For within-quadrant, within-hemisphere and mirror symmetric (across vertical meridian) within-quadrant, between-hemisphere comparisons, correlations steadily decreased at larger angular distances. Taken together, these results suggest that angular connectivity reflects overlapping RF between areas and mirror-symmetric connections between hemispheres. No effect of angular distance was observed between dorsal and ventral comparisons based on actual angular distance or when reflecting across the horizontal meridian (i.e., mirror symmetry). As with any negative finding, we cannot conclude with certainty that such angular-based connectivity does not exist, though, to our knowledge, no study has shown angular connectivity between regions with non-overlapping RFs."

We conducted correlations between individual runs to directly test whether the patterns observed during the movie viewing condition reflected processing of the stimulus input. Intrinsic neural dynamics during the resting and movie conditions that are not related to the processing of visual stimuli, as well as non-neuronal artifacts (e.g., respiratory rate, motion), can only influence the pattern of correlations within each run, but should not induce correlations between runs. Indeed, inter-run Fisher-transformed correlations on resting state data showed no effect of radial distance (all <i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05), validating the assumption that noise correlations should not be reliable across runs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, blue and black lines). In contrast, inter-run correlations during movie watching showed radial distance effects similar to intra-run correlations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, red lines). Inter-run correlations were statistically significant for 96% of all comparisons (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). The slopes of coefficients as a function of radial distance for movie data were, generally, weaker for the inter-run relative to intra-run analyses (compare <a href=\"#fig6 fig7\">Figures 6B, 7</a>). However, the inter-run analyses inherently had less data and spatial attention was not controlled, making the differences between intra- and inter-run analyses difficult to interpret. The inter-run results indicate that the observed widespread eccentricity-based correlations can reflect the processing of the incoming information during viewing of real life stimuli, and further suggest that these correlations patterns are unlikely to be driven by non-neuronal artifacts."

The observed widespread eccentricity-based correlation pattern could not be attributed to non-neuronal artifacts (e.g., physiological noise, motion, BOLD spatial autocorrelation, eye movements). Global artifacts did not drive our results as correlation patterns were strengthened by the removal of non-neuronal signals (i.e., motion and white matter). The eccentricity-based correlation pattern was not due to inherent spread of the BOLD signal, anatomical distance, or any biases in our analyses, as artificial data that preserved such biases were not correlated with radial distance (see <a href=\"#box2\">Box 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Subject motion also could not explain the observed correlation patterns. We minimized the overall influence of movement in our data by using highly trained MRI subjects and by removing signal correlated with subject motion via regression. Further, the strength of eccentricity correlation did not significantly co-vary with degree of subject movement. We performed Spearman rank correlations between each subject's total amount of movement and the slope of his or her radial bin distance coefficients (i.e., effect of eccentricity on correlation strength). There was no significant correlation across subjects between the mean slope (averaged across all area pairs) and any of the six motion parameters (all rs &lt; 0.24, <i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05). In addition, there were no significant correlations across subjects between the slope and total amount of movement for any individual area pair (<i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). These analyses strongly suggest that the observed correlation patterns were not driven by subject motion. It is unlikely that eye movements drove the eccentricity-based correlation pattern as similar results were observed at rest during both fixation and eyes closed conditions. Finally, significant inter-run eccentricity-based correlation patterns were observed during movie viewing, but not during rest, further ruling out the possible influence of non-neuronal intrinsic artifacts (e.g., respiration rate, cardiac rate, motion), which should not be correlated across runs."

                                        "text": "The eccentricity-based correlation could not be accounted for by overlapping receptive fields or anatomical distance. There is an intrinsic spatio-temporal point-spread function in BOLD imaging (<a href=\"#bib29\">Engel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Parkes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Shmuel et al., 2007</a>). The point-spread function of BOLD imaging at 3T had been estimated to be about 3.5 mm (<a href=\"#bib29\">Engel et al., 1997</a>). We tested whether the observed correlation patterns were due to inherent spatial autocorrelation of the BOLD signal or pre-processing steps in our analysis pipeline by generating artificial data that maintained these non-neuronal spatial correlation patterns. We replaced the timeseries in each voxel with a randomly generated timeseries to preserve the anatomical position of each voxel in each subject and then applied a Gaussian spatial filter with a FWHM of 3.5 mm. We passed these data through the same processing as the real data (using motion correction parameters from each subject's real data) to derive estimated \u2018instrumental\u2019 correlations for each subject. These data capture the inherent spatial blur of the BOLD signal and preserve (any) volumetric and surface-based spatial correlations that were inherent in the data or introduced via the preprocessing and binning analyses. We found significant effects of radial distance for intra-areal correlations (e.g., V2d RH with itself; <i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05) and weaker, though non-significant, effects for adjacent areas (e.g., V1d RH with V2d RH) (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As discussed in the exploratory seed analysis section above, this was to be expected since the organization of eccentricity representations in these areas is correlated with (anatomical) spatial distance, and the spatial blurring in this analysis will introduce an anatomically local correlation structure to the data. Interestingly, the slopes of coefficients across eccentricity disparities did not reflect the slopes observed in our real data, suggesting that this cannot account for the entire signal measured between these areas in our real data (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). For intra-area correlations, coefficient values sharply decreased as a function of radial distance, and resembled the exponential decay reported by Butt and colleagues in their simulations of instrumental correlations for visual area V1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Butt et al., 2013</a>). For correlations between adjacent areas, coefficient values decreased gradually for the three smallest distance values then leveled off at larger disparities. Again, this small decrease likely reflects anatomical distance, and the profile of distance correlations differed from the correlation pattern measured in our real data. Critically, there was no significant difference in correlation strength across distance values between dorsal and ventral regions (e.g., V2d RH to V3v RH; <i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05) or across hemispheres (e.g., V2d RH to V2d LH; <i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05) (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We also scanned a phantom (using the same acquisition parameters as the resting data) to generate artificial data with the BOLD spatial autocorrelation, and found the same effects as with the randomly generated timeseries data. This control analysis demonstrates that the inherent (spatial) spread of BOLD imaging and anatomical distance cannot account for the observed correlations between areas with non-overlapping receptive fields (e.g., V2d RH to V2v RH or V2d RH to V2d LH), which we have focused on thus far (<a href=\"#fig4 fig6 fig7\">Figures 4, 6, 7</a>). If anything, this control analysis suggests that it is important to account for BOLD spatial autocorrelation when evaluating correlation patterns within individual areas (e.g., V1d RH to V1d RH) and between (anatomically) adjacent areas (e.g., V1d RH to V2d RH)."

Each visual hemifield map was separated into 36 bins: six divisions of eccentricity (E1\u2013E6) that each contained six divisions of polar angle (A1\u2013A6) such that each bin represented a unique part of visual space (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To visualize the pattern of correlations across all bins with respect to local (overlapping RF) and widespread (eccentricity and polar angle) connectivity patterns, data were plotted as a function of radial and angular distance (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Correlations were qualitatively strongest at the intersection of iso-polar angle and iso-eccentricity, and were generally elevated along iso-eccentricity representations, irrespective of polar angle distance (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). To quantify this, we assessed the relationship between the measured correlations across visual areas V1, V2, V3, and hV4 and several possible connectivity patterns using linear, least squares regression (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). For any pair of visual areas, we modeled correlations between all bin pairs (36 \u00d7 36) as the linear weighted sum of four sources of connectivity. Two sources reflect topographically local connectivity between regions that are in close anatomical proximity or contain overlapping receptive fields: (1) instrumental \u2018noise\u2019 connectivity: correlation pattern based on an assessment of the spatial auto-correlation and preprocessing in our data; (2) overlapping RF connectivity: correlation pattern based on the overlap of estimated population receptive fields (pRF; <a href=\"#bib28\">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amano et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Harvey and Dumoulin, 2011</a>). The two other sources reflect topographically widespread connectivity that span much of the visual field and are not specifically tied to receptive fields or anatomical proximity: (1) eccentricity connectivity: correlation pattern based on radial distance with correlations strongest at iso-eccentricity representations; (2) polar angle connectivity: correlation pattern based on angular distance with correlations strongest at iso-polar angle representations."

To quantify the apparent connectivity patterns, we conducted an initial regression analysis using a model that included all four sources of connectivity as predictors. For individual subjects, the combination of local and widespread predictors well fit intra-area correlation patterns, and moderately fit inter-area and inter-hemisphere patterns. The average individual subject variance explained by the full model ranged between 40% and 68% for intra-areal comparisons and between 11% and 28% for inter-areal comparisons. Across area pairs, there were consistent effects of both local and widespread predictors (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Across subjects, the coefficients for the overlapping RF predictor were significantly positive for all intra-hemisphere, intra-areal comparisons as well as for most other comparisons (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected). Coefficients for the eccentricity predictor were significantly positive for all but one comparison (V1\u2013hV4 inter-hemisphere) (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Coefficients for the polar angle predictor were significantly positive for most intra-hemisphere comparisons, but only for a few inter-hemisphere comparisons (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Though these results suggest some effect of both local and widespread connectivity, we found that both eccentricity and polar angle predictors were strongly correlated with the overlapping RF predictor for most intra-hemisphere area pairs (mean r = 0.54; STD = 0.08). Since the local and widespread predictors have a non-trivial degree of collinearity, the coefficient estimates for individual predictors from the full model may not be accurate for intra-hemisphere comparisons, which had the strongest correlations between local and widespread predictors. From these results, it is possible that some of the observed eccentricity and polar angle effects are due to shared variance with the local, overlapping RF model. However, it is very unlikely that all of the widespread effects can generically be explained by the overlapping receptive field model since significant correlations were observed in the eccentricity bin analyses between iso-eccentricity representations in distinct parts of visual space (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; e.g., between V2d RH and V2v LH)."

In contrast, consistent polar angle effects were generally only observed prior to removal of local connectivity variance. Eccentricity effects were generally stronger than polar angle both before and after removal of local connectivity variance, suggesting that this difference is driven by asymmetries in widespread, not local, connectivity patterns. In further support of this, the variance explained by the local connectivity model was strongly correlated with both eccentricity (mean r across areas = 0.50; STD = 0.08) and polar angle (mean r across areas = 0.49; STD = 0.07) predictors, and there was little difference between them (mean <i>r</i> difference across areas = 0.01; STD = 0.06).

It is important to note that significant polar angle correlations were observed in the full model analysis for several area pairs. However, these correlations were almost entirely explained by the overlapping RF connectivity model. As discussed above, the variance explained by the local connectivity model was strongly correlated with both the eccentricity and polar angle models, and there was little difference between them. Second, the residual widespread effects were not biased by any imbalance in the number of data-points (nodes) across data bins. We conducted a control analysis where we equalized the number of nodes in each bin of the topographic model analysis. We used bins with 20, 30, and 50 surface nodes. For bins that contained more than the maximum number of nodes, we subsampled the data. In some subjects, a few bins contained less than the set number of nodes. We conducted the control analyses both including and excluding these bins with few nodes. Eccentricity and (lack of) polar angle residual correlations were observed in these analyses and were consistent with the original results shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, and the interpretation of the results did not change. Thus, our analyses were sensitive enough to reveal polar angle connectivity effects, and the lack of consistent residual polar angle correlations between regions with non-overlapping RFs cannot be explained by such biases in our data."

Recent studies have demonstrated homotopic connectivity in visual cortex with respect to visual field representation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Heinzle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Butt et al., 2013</a>). Homotopic connectivity was evident in our data when plotting inter-hemisphere correlations with respect to the radial and angular distance after reflecting the position coordinates of one hemisphere across the vertical meridian onto the other hemifield (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Indeed, for inter-hemisphere comparisons, the homotopic RF predictor generally captured more variance than the overlapping RF predictor. We tested whether homotopic connectivity (with respect to the vertical meridian) could account for the inter-hemisphere eccentricity-based connectivity effects. We removed all variance explained by the homotopic RF predictor then recomputed the residual correlations. The eccentricity effects were still present in these residual correlations (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), though intra-areal hV4 correlations were notably weaker. This was to be expected as the eccentricity and overlapping RF predictors were highly correlated for intra-areal hV4, and removal of the local connectivity variance also removed a large portion of the variance attributable to the eccentricity predictor. Overall, these data show that the eccentricity-based connectivity effects were not driven by homotopic RF connectivity."

Critically, the eccentricity correlation patterns explained an additional, significant amount of variance in our data, which was not accounted for by the local connectivity model. For most inter-hemispheric comparisons, adding the eccentricity predictor more than doubled the variance explained by the local connectivity model, suggesting that it was the major component of the correlation patterns between hemispheres. Notably, after accounting for overlapping pRF connectivity, the strength of eccentricity correlations were similar within and across hemispheres for most comparisons between V1, V2, and V3, suggesting that this widespread connectivity pattern uniformly spans the whole visual field."

Local and widespread (spatial) patterns of correlated BOLD signal were observed in all experiments, both in the presence and absence of visual input. In agreement with prior reports, we observed topographically-local correlation patterns based on overlapping representations of visual space. In addition, we found strong evidence for topographically-widespread correlation patterns based on eccentricity within and across hemispheres, which spanned the entire visual field. The eccentricity-based correlation patterns were strongest between early visual areas (V1\u2013V3). The effects observed in extrastriate areas (hV4, V3A\u2013B, and VO1\u20132) were generally weaker than early visual areas, consistent with the coarser topographic organization of visual space and smaller surface area in these areas."

By modeling V1 inter-areal connections based on overlapping RFs, Gravel and colleagues (2014) generated polar angle and eccentricity maps for V2 and V3. However, Raemaekers and colleagues (2014) reported that such fine-scaled connectivity was only observable after filtering coarse-scale components. At a coarse scale, there has been evidence for a general foveal-peripheral distinction (<a href=\"#bib87\">Vincent et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nallasamy and Tsao, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Smith et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Raemaekers et al., 2014</a>), but these studies did not report a systematic <i>topography</i> of correlation patterns that reflects the underlying eccentricity organization, nor were effects of overlapping RFs and cortical distance controlled. Evidence for a more systematic relation to eccentricity was reported between V1 and ventral V3 (<a href=\"#bib94\">Yeo et al., 2011</a>), though such data are also consistent with overlapping RF connectivity as well as cortical distance since only ventral V3 was probed. Here, we explicitly and quantitatively combined these connectivity phenomena in a fine-grained analysis across a wider range of brain regions, replicating previous findings of overlapping RF and homotopic correlation patterns without filtering coarse spatial components (<a href=\"#bib46\">Heinzle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Haak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Butt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Gravel et al., 2014</a>). Even after accounting for these patterns, we found a robust widespread correlation pattern that reflects the eccentricity organization across much of visual cortex. Such systematic correlation patterns suggest orderly integration processes across the whole visual field at multiple levels of the processing hierarchy, not just a foveal-peripheral dichotomy."

Our results during rest demonstrate that regions with iso-eccentricity representations are likely to be co-active, even in the absence of visual input. Our results during the movie viewing condition demonstrate that the temporal dynamics yielding these eccentricity-based correlation patterns are also present during strong bottom-up input, and indicate that this organization is relevant for the processing of incoming visual input. In agreement with these findings, studies in macaques and cats have shown that the activity of neurons with similar response properties are correlated in the presence and absence of external input, suggesting that spontaneous neuronal activity is tightly linked to intrinsic cortical networks (<a href=\"#bib9\">Arieli et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Tsodyks et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Goldberg et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ghuman et al., 2013</a>).

Such wiring is necessary for the integration of information within focal points of our visual environment. Direct intra-areal anatomical connections between dorsal and ventral visual cortex at the horizontal meridians (<a href=\"#bib52\">Jeffs et al., 2009</a>) and between both hemispheres at the vertical meridians (<a href=\"#bib50\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Essen and Zeki, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Newsome and Allman, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Cusick et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Kennedy et al., 1986</a>) could support widespread functional connectivity across the visual field, though we are not aware of anatomical studies explicitly reporting eccentricity-based patterns of intra-areal connectivity. Further, while labeled cells of lateral connections in macaque striate and extrastriate cortex exhibit some anisotropy with respect to the cortical surface, this is thought to reflect cortical magnification factor, and yield isotropic visual field coverage (<a href=\"#bib5\">Angelucci et al., 2002</a>). Consistent with the anatomical connectivity, we found that correlation patterns between regions with overlapping RFs were comparable along eccentricity and polar angle dimensions. Beyond overlapping RFs, correlation patterns were <i>anisotropic</i> (with respect to visual field coverage) and reflected the underlying eccentricity organization. Alternatively, the observed eccentricity-based correlation patterns may actually reflect a broader-scale anatomical organization of direct (and indirect) connections, facilitated via differences in intra-areal projections between cortical sites representing central and peripheral space (<a href=\"#bib20\">Colby et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nakamura et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gattass et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Ungerleider et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib85\">2014</a>). Such a distinction has been characterized in the patterns of supra-areal anatomical connections between early visual and extrastriate cortex in non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rosa, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gattass et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rosa and Tweedale, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rosa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Buckner and Yeo, 2014</a>). It is not known whether these anatomical connectivity patterns are \u2018bi-modal\u2019, and only distinguish central and peripheral space, or reflect a finer-scale organization where connectivity patterns with intermediate eccentricity representations are distinguishable from central and peripheral connectivity profiles. Our results predict that these anatomical connections should reflect a gradient, though this remains to be explored. In particular, feedback projections from extrastriate areas with receptive fields covering wide swaths of the visual field to early and intermediate visual areas could facilitate such widespread, eccentricity-dependent correlation patterns. It is interesting to note that when comparing the profile of anatomical connectivity between V2/V4 and higher order cortex (e.g., <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Gattass et al., 2005</a>) with the organization of eccentricity across visual cortex in macaques (<a href=\"#bib15\">Brewer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Kolster et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Arcaro et al., 2011</a>), it is clear that higher order areas connected with peripheral parts of V2 and V4 (e.g., PO, PIP, LIP, DP, TF) have a large representation of the periphery, and higher order areas connected with foveal parts of V2 and V4 (e.g., TEO and TE) have a large representation of the fovea. The exact relationship between the observed correlation patterns and anatomical pathways will need to be further investigated."

Previous studies have proposed eccentricity as a large-scale functional organizing principle for higher order visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib58\">Levy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Hasson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Malach et al., 2002</a>).

Perceptually, these recognition processes require different visual acuities. For example, while fine acuity is needed for the featural discrimination among similar face and object exemplars (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fiorentini et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Goffaux et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Keil, 2008</a>), a coarser acuity is needed for mapping the surrounding layout necessary for navigation in space (<a href=\"#bib67\">Oliva and Schyns, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Oliva and Torralba, 2006</a>). Further, eye movement patterns during scene perception are related to the types of information within a scene (<a href=\"#bib17\">Buswell, 1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Henderson and Hollingworth, 1999</a>). People tend to foveate on faces while orienting their peripheral vision at landscape features and room contours (<a href=\"#bib93\">Yarbus, 1967</a>). These eccentricity biases are also reflected in the connectivity patterns between face and place category-selective regions in ventral temporal cortex with extrastriate visual area hV4 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Baldassano et al., 2012</a>). Our data show that this divergence in the computational processes necessary for foveal and peripheral recognition is evident even in early visual cortex."

The detailed retinotopic organization of visual cortex allowed for a unique opportunity to systematically compare patterns of correlated BOLD activity with the known underlying functional organization of the visual system. Across subjects and experiments, correlations were stronger between areas at matched eccentricities than within areas at large eccentricity distances, suggesting that functional connectivity analyses on BOLD data are more sensitive at revealing widespread, inter-areal connectivity patterns than the localization of individual retinotopic areas (see also <a href=\"#bib94\">Yeo et al., 2011</a>). Alternative connectivity approaches not based on similarity may prove useful at revealing area boundaries (<a href=\"#bib92\">Wig et al., 2014</a>), though this remains to be tested more thoroughly beyond the V1/V2 border. Thus, we propose that relating correlation patterns to known functional and anatomical data will prove important for identifying the functional pathways for the integration of information across individual, functionally specialized areas."

                                "text": "Data were analyzed using AFNI (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cox, 1996</a>) (<a href=\"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/\">http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/</a>), SUMA (<a href=\"http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/suma/\">http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/suma/</a>), MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA), and FreeSurfer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dale et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Fischl et al., 1999a</a>) (<a href=\"http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/\">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</a>). Functional data were slice-time and motion corrected. Motion distance (estimated by AFNI's 3dvolreg) did not exceed 1.0 mm (relative to starting head position) in any of the six motion parameter estimates (three translation and three rotation) during any run for any subject. In preparation for correlation analyses, several additional steps were performed on the data: (1) removal of signal deviation &gt;2.5 SDs from the mean (AFNI's 3dDespike); (2) temporal filtering retaining frequencies in the 0.01\u20130.1 Hz band; (3) linear and quadratic detrending; and (4) removal by linear regression of several sources of variance: (i) the six motion parameter estimates (three translation and three rotation) and their temporal derivatives, (ii) the signal from a ventricular region, and (iii) the signal from a white matter region. Removal of ventricular and white matter signal resulted in a general, broad decrease in the raw correlation values by about 0.2, though subsequent eccentricity-specific effects were slightly increased. These are standard preprocessing steps for resting-state correlation analyses (e.g., <a href=\"#bib87\">Vincent et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yeo et al., 2011</a>), though our results were not dependent on these preprocessing steps, and correlation analyses on the raw data yielded qualitatively and statistically similar results. Global mean signal (GMS) removal was not included in the analysis reported here given concerns about negative correlations (<a href=\"#bib35\">Fox et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Murphy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Saad et al., 2012</a>), though inclusion of GMS removal yielded statistically similar results. To minimize the effect of any evoked response due to the scanner onset, the initial 21.6 s and 19.5 s were removed from each rest and movie scan, respectively. All voxels that fell between the gray and white matter boundaries were mapped to surface model units (nodes). Only for figure illustrations from single seed correlation analyses, data were spatially filtered using a Gaussian filter to a maximum smoothness of 4 mm full-width at half-max (FWHM) (by estimating the FWHM before spatial filtering), ensuring uniformity across the surface and maintaining spatial specificity while increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chung et al., 2005</a>). No such spatial filtering was applied on data used for eccentricity bin or topographic model regression analyses. The timeseries from all surface nodes spanning early visual and extrastriate areas V1, V2, V3, hV4, VO1\u20132 (combined), V3A\u2013B (combined), were extracted into MATLAB for correlation analyses. Eccentricity measurements were coarse for the surrounding visual cortex, so no additional extrastriate visual areas (e.g., LO1/2, TO1/2, PHC1/2, IPS0-5) were included in the analyses."

Visual areas V1, V2, and V3 were separated into dorsal and ventral parts. Given the smaller surface area relative to V1, V2, and V3, visual areas V3A and V3B (as well as VO1 and VO2) were grouped together to increase the total number of samples (nodes). Due to the cortical magnification factor of early visual cortex, there were a limited number of voxels representing the periphery beyond 12.50\u00b0. Therefore, we restricted our analyses to the central 12.50\u00b0, and we refer to representations &gt;10\u00b0 eccentricity as peripheral-most. To increase signal-to-noise and control the extent of spatial signal blur, nodes were subdivided into 12 bins spanning 0.50\u00b0\u201312.50\u00b0 eccentricity for each visual area. Eccentricity values from a log-scaled stimulus were used for the current analyses because the cortical magnification factor in early visual cortex is accounted for, yielding an approximately uniform distribution of nodes (i.e., data points) across eccentricity bins. The boundaries between bins corresponded to: 0.50\u00b0, 0.84\u00b0, 1.24\u00b0, 1.71\u00b0, 2.27\u00b0, 2.93\u00b0, 3.71\u00b0, 4.63\u00b0, 5.73\u00b0, 7.02\u00b0, 8.55\u00b0, 10.36\u00b0, and 12.50\u00b0. For each visual area, the timeseries of all nodes within each eccentricity bin were averaged to derive a mean timeseries for each eccentricity bin. In each subject, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the mean timeseries of all eccentricity bins within as well as between visual areas, both within and between hemispheres. For each pair of visual areas, matrices were created containing all possible correlations between eccentricity bins. For each subject, these correlation matrices were created for each run separately and then averaged. Group average correlation matrices were also calculated for each area pair in each task (resting-fixation, resting-eyes shut, and movie-fixation). The magnitude of coefficients varied considerably between area pairs (e.g., correlation coefficients between V1 and V2 were larger than between V1 and hV4 at matched eccentricity bins). In order to illustrate the consistency in the pattern of eccentricity bin correlations across matrices (<a href=\"#fig2 fig3\">Figures 2C, 3</a> only), coefficients were z-score normalized for each area pair separately. This preserved the relative differences in correlations between eccentricity bins within each matrix, but removed large magnitude differences between matrices. Non-normalized correlation matrices were used for all subsequent analyses and statistics. To ensure that the log-scaled eccentricity stimulus was not confounding the results, analyses were also run using eccentricity values that were converted into visual degrees. Comparable eccentricity-based effects were observed in this control analysis, though larger eccentricities had relatively fewer nodes per bin, and correlations with these bins were therefore more variable."

This yielded several correlation estimates for each radial distance value. Grouped correlation coefficients were then averaged to yield a single, mean correlation coefficient for each radial distance from 0\u201311. Correlations were Fisher z-transformed for statistical tests. For each visual area pair, two-tailed t-tests were performed on the Fisher-transformed 0\u2013distance correlations to assess whether the subject population reliably differed from 0. False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections were applied for each condition separately (<a href=\"#bib12\">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</a>). A linear regression was performed across all distance correlations (0\u201311) for each visual area pair in each subject. For within area correlations (e.g., V1 to V1), 0 distance coefficients were excluded from the regression since the coefficients reflected correlations between identical timeseries (i.e., mean coefficients were always a value of 1). The slopes were used to evaluate the strength of eccentricity-based correlations between area pairs and across conditions. Correlation coefficients and slopes were then averaged across subjects to derive group mean distance correlations and group mean slopes for each visual area pair. Statistical significance of the group mean slopes was tested using a non-parametric permutation test in which the radial distance values were shuffled prior to grouping of individual correlations. For each iteration, the same label shuffling was applied to all subjects. Linear regression analyses were performed on each subject's permuted data and the mean slopes were calculated. This permutation was run 10,000 times. For all area pairs, the mean slopes (averaged across subjects) from the non-permuted data were larger than 97.5% of slopes from the mean permuted data (i.e., significant for a two-tailed test with \u03b1 = 0.05)."

To minimize this magnitude variability, but preserve the relation of correlations across radial distances for illustration purposes (<a href=\"#fig6 fig7\">Figures 6, 7</a>), correlation coefficients were normalized to the mean correlation coefficient at 0\u2013distance (i.e., iso-eccentricity) in individual subjects as follows:"

Importantly, the non-normalized coefficient values at and near the 0\u2013distance were always significantly positive.

Specifically, a linear relationship was estimated between pRFs and eccentricity from the minimum and maximum eccentricities reported for each area. For any given area, pRF sizes varied across studies. To best approximate the pRF sizes from these prior reports, the average slope and intercept across reports was used, though analyses using individual slopes and intercepts from each of the prior reports yielded qualitatively and statistically similar results. On average, the size of the pRFs for 0.5\u00b0 and 12.5\u00b0 eccentricities were calculated as 0.4\u00b0 and 1.6\u00b0 for V1, 0.48\u00b0 and 2.3\u00b0 for V2, 1.0\u00b0 and 4.15\u00b0 for V3. For hV4, the size of the pRFs for 0.5\u00b0 and 12.5\u00b0 eccentricities were calculated solely from <a href=\"#bib44\">Harvey and Dumoulin (2011)</a> as 1.2\u00b0 and 5.8\u00b0. pRFs were constructed for each node. Individual node pRFs were binned and averaged to construct a response field for each bin. Signal spread between bins was then calculated as the amount of response field overlap between bins relative to the total response field area of the bin pair."

Though these pRF size estimates were likely influenced by the point spread function of BOLD imaging, any unaccounted effect of the point spread function could lead to an underestimation of pRF coverage and thus of overlapping RF connectivity. We tested whether the observed connectivity patterns could be explained by such an underestimation of overlapping pRF effects. For each area pair, artificial data were generated with the correlation structure of the local connectivity via Cholesky decomposition. Artificial data were simulated for each run of resting and movie scans in individual subjects. These artificial data were then spatially smoothed with a 3.5 mm kernel Gaussian filter to approximate the point-spread function (<a href=\"#bib29\">Engel et al., 1997</a>), and correlations were computed between all 36 bins to generate a new local connectivity model. Though the instrumental noise predictor (NSE) in the local connectivity model accounts for the same point spread function, this connectivity model extends the effects of increased spatial blur for inter-areal, overlapping RF connectivity."

Several previous studies cited by the authors have identified resting-state correlations that include retinotopic components and other components that are spatially more widespread. The current study systematically examines the spatial pattern of correlations using two resting-state paradigms (with eyes closed and eyes open), plus a paradigm involving watching a movie while fixating. The most significant finding is that for all 3 paradigms the spatially extended correlations are stronger along iso-eccentricity bands. There is also a weaker component related to polar angle and another component related to homotopic (mirror-image retinotopy) in the opposite hemisphere."

The main finding is that the connectivity exhibits a striking organization across the visual cortical areas in which locations that retinotopically represent the same eccentricity of the visual field tend to be correlated, across adjacent cortical areas as well as across the ventral and dorsal subdivisions and across hemispheres. The consistency of this organization throughout the visual cortical areas argues that it is present both in the presence and absence of bottom-up anatomical connectivity. Steps are taken to control for effects such as receptive field size and spatial spread based on modeling their effects using previously reported measurements."

Because the cortical areas are elongated along the eccentricity direction there are more voxels to sample the progression of eccentricity than there are to sample the progressions of polar angles. Upon examining the plots in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> (and to some extent the plots in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) it appears that there is some consistent correlations across all areas averaged in the retinotopically corresponding region (especially well seen in seeds centered on 1 deg, 2.5 deg, and 5 deg), but also there seems to be some symmetry in the correlation patterns across quadrants in the 2.5 deg and 5 deg maps. One wonders if it is possible that there is a polar angle component to the organization as well, i.e., the correlations may not be only a function of eccentricity but could be a function of polar angle as well. This question gets at my main concern outlined above. Given the reduced resolution in the polar angle direction this question may be difficult to address using this data, and some attempt is made in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, but if the resolution is not sufficient perhaps the authors could discuss the potential of an unresolved polar angle organization as an alternate possibility."

Also, the new analysis accounting for the potential statistical biases arising from re-binning the data does not address the fact that there is higher effective spatial resolution of the eccentricity coordinate than the polar angle coordinate. The plots in <a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 3</a> are the most direct measure of this, since the observation that in some regions the correlation falls off with distance argues that there may be in some cases enough voxels along the polar angle direction to properly resolve a spatial gradient of correlation.

Its origin may reflect two very different gross processes computed at foveal and peripheral areas (Malach, 2004 TiCS). In contrast, our findings report a novel fine-scale topography of eccentricity-based correlation patterns, in which, for example, local regions representing 2\u00b0, 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0 eccentricities are most correlated, respectively, with other regions representing 2\u00b0, 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0 eccentricities within and across early visual (V1-V3) and extrastriate (hV4) areas. Such a systematic correlation pattern suggests orderly integration processes across the whole visual field at multiple levels of the processing hierarchy, not just a foveal-peripheral dichotomy.

Distinct from the Heinzle study, we found eccentricity-specific correlation patterns that cannot be accounted for by overlapping response fields. Heinzle and colleagues did not probe such separate eccentricity-based connectivity. As such, we feel that our study provides new insight into the intrinsic organization of visual cortex beyond the Heinzle study while also validating this previous report of overlapping receptive field connectivity.

Next, we tested whether other data-driven analyses based on correlation patterns between individual data points (i.e., nodes) could reveal such organization. We used a k-means clustering algorithm to segment our data. At a coarse segmentation (k=2), we observed a parcellation of visual cortex in individual subjects that reflects a foveal / peripheral distinction (note: this distinction is within our retinotopic maps, not outside like the ICA analyses). At larger k-segmentations, additional clusters appeared to be symmetric around the fovea, consistent with an eccentricity-based organization. At larger k-segmentations, there was also some differentiation between early visual (V1-V3) and higher-order cortical areas (V3A/B, LO / VO / MT / IPS), which is consistent with observations from our binning analyses and prior reports (<a href=\"#bib79\">Smith et al. 2012</a>). i.e., as seen in our binning analyses, peripheral regions of V1 were more strongly correlated with peripheral regions of V3A/B (vs. foveal V3A/B) even though peripheral regions of V1 were more strongly correlated with peripheral V3 (vs. peripheral of V3A/B). This differentiation between early visual and higher order areas is orthogonal to the current question of eccentricity-based connectivity patterns. To illustrate the relation of these clusters to the underlying eccentricity organization while minimizing the broad regional differentiation between early visual and higher-order cortex, we color coded each cluster based on the strength of their correlation with the foveal cluster in early visual cortex. In this visualization, a cluster organization similar to the eccentricity organization is apparent for segmentations based on intra- and inter- hemisphere correlations.

Our results would predict that the anatomical connections reflect a gradient, though this remains to be explored. In particular, feedback projections from extrastriate areas with receptive fields covering wide swaths of the visual field to early and intermediate visual areas could facilitate such widespread, eccentricity-dependent correlation patterns.

We observed comparable contributions of polar angle and eccentricity predictors for the variance explained by the overlapping RF model in our topographic model analysis (i.e., there was no bias for these comparisons). Due to the topographic nature of cortex, overlapping RF bin pairs will be, on average, in much closer anatomical proximity than non-overlapping RF bin pairs, and thus would actually be more susceptible to any biases driven by lack of sensitivity along the polar angle dimension.

Also, such an approach will not directly address the issue for several reasons: (1) Voxel sampling is in 3 dimensions and does not directly translate to biases across the cortical surface along polar angle and eccentricity dimensions, particularly for V2-V4 where cortical folding becomes more complex. (2) Spatial smoothing affects SNR, which could introduce another source of an asymmetrical, eccentricity-based bias. (3) Implementation is a challenge since the asymmetry of the smoothing would have to vary as a function of the cortical magnification and would also vary across subjects. However, our results do hold with the application of a general asymmetrical smoothing similar to the reviewer\u2019s suggestion. To achieve this, we reduced the effective resolution of eccentricity by blurring data across eccentricity bins. We applied a smoothing filter such that a weighted average was computed for the timeseries of each eccentricity bin and all bins at distance of 1 (50% weighting) and 2 (25% weighting) at the iso-polar angle representations. This has the effect of blurring the data along the eccentricity dimension, thereby reducing the effective resolution along that dimension specifically. Even when applying this blurring, we observed eccentricity effects comparable with the original analyses."
