We report here on a posture control system in <i>C. elegans</i> that coordinates these needs. Using quantitative posture analysis we explain worm locomotion as a composite of two modes: regular undulations versus flexible turning. Graded reciprocal regulation of both modes allows animals to flexibly adapt their locomotion strategy under sensory stimulation along a spectrum ranging from LDT to ARS. Using genetics and functional imaging of neural activity we characterize the counteracting interneurons AVK and DVA that utilize FLP-1 and NLP-12 neuropeptides to control both motor modes. Gradual regulation of behaviors via this system is required for spatial navigation during chemotaxis. This work shows how a nervous system controls simple elementary features of posture to generate complex movements for goal-directed locomotion strategies."

We report here on a posture control system in <i>C. elegans</i> that coordinates these needs. Using quantitative posture analysis we explain worm locomotion as a composite of two modes: regular undulations versus flexible turning. Graded reciprocal regulation of both modes allows animals to flexibly adapt their locomotion strategy under sensory stimulation along a spectrum ranging from LDT to ARS. Using genetics and functional imaging of neural activity we characterize the counteracting interneurons AVK and DVA that utilize FLP-1 and NLP-12 neuropeptides to control both motor modes. Gradual regulation of behaviors via this system is required for spatial navigation during chemotaxis. This work shows how a nervous system controls simple elementary features of posture to generate complex movements for goal-directed locomotion strategies."

Regular whole-body waves (undulations) efficiently drive long-distance travel, while more complex turning motions allow the animals to flexibly change direction and so explore the local environment. Furthermore, the worms can fine-tune their movement strategy by gradually transitioning between the two patterns. This finding is opposed to the standard view, where animals switch between distinct behavioral states."

These behavioral strategies often require very distinct types of motor patterns while employing the same muscle groups. For example, different modes of locomotion serve the optimal strategy for food finding. Under the assumption that food is nearby, a large variety of invertebrate and vertebrate species including mammals perform local or area-restricted search (ARS) consisting of short moves and frequent high-angled turns. Alternatively, in order to localize more distant food sources, animals disperse via long-distance travelling (LDT) by moving along straight paths (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bell, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fryxell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hills, 2006</a>).

Nematodes advance via undulatory crawling movements (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gray, 1953</a>), which can be precisely quantified (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Stephens et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yemini et al., 2013</a>). The animal\u2019s posture is tightly coupled to ventral and dorsal body wall muscle activity and therefore a reliable proxy to characterize the motor patterns underlying gait production (<a href=\"#bib8\">Butler et al., 2014</a>). When removed from food <i>C. elegans</i> performs frequent reorientation maneuvers, which consist of brief periods of backward crawling (reversals) followed by sharp turning (omega turns); however, when no food is detected for a prolonged time <i>C. elegans</i> maintains forward crawling and only infrequently reorients. These two locomotion strategies have been explicitly characterized as ARS after removal from food and LDT (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calhoun et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hills et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Peliti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tsalik and Hobert, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wakabayashi et al., 2004</a>). Also, two major locomotion strategies for goal-directed chemotaxis have been observed: the biased random walk, which is reminiscent of bacterial chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg and Brown, 1972</a>), where animals modulate the probability of reorientation depending on sensory history (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</a>), and weathervaning, where animals directly steer toward the favored direction by introducing a subtle bias to their path (<a href=\"#bib35\">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</a> ).\u00a0The above-mentioned studies have quantified locomotion by the frequency and duration of forward runs, reversals and omega turns; however, quantitative descriptions of the motor patterns underlying the different locomotion strategies of <i>C. elegans,</i> or those of any animal species in general, have been missing."

We show that the worm\u2019s undulatory motions can be decomposed into two modes corresponding to undulation and turning motions. By controlling the coordination of these modes animals can gradually adjust their locomotion strategy on a behavioral spectrum ranging from LDT to O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS. The interneurons AVK and DVA releasing the neuropeptides FLP-1 and NLP-12, respectively, are required for the control over this fine adjustment in response to acute sensory stimulation as well as during spatial navigation in O<sub>2</sub> gradients. In summary, this work shows how neuromodulatory circuit elements control elementary motor components to flexibly adjust the strategy of locomotion."

                                "text": "We analyzed the locomotion behavior of 1\u2009hr food-deprived worm populations filmed while freely crawling on agarose in a behavioral flow arena, which permitted tight control over ambient O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zimmer et al., 2009</a>). An immediate drop from atmospheric 21% to 10% O<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>2</sub> downshift) evoked a variety of behavioral changes, including transient reduction of locomotion speed and concomitant up-regulation of reversals and omega turns as previously described (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zimmer et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, we observed up-regulation of shallow turning maneuvers during forward movement, evident as increased curvature of the animals\u2019 locomotion trajectories (track curvature) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The compound effect of these behavioral changes was a drastic reduction in the spatial displacement of worms during the first three minutes upon O<sub>2</sub> downshift (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, a sudden drop in environmental O<sub>2</sub> concentrations evoked a change in the locomotion strategy switching from predominantly forward crawling to a mixture of reduced crawling and increased reorientations, i.e. from LDT to O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS (see also <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> upper left panel). This interpretation is in accordance with previous literature classifying similar behavioral strategy changes in the context of removal from food (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calhoun et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hills et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Peliti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tsalik and Hobert, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wakabayashi et al., 2004</a>). The changes in behavioral parameters all depended on an O<sub>2</sub> chemosensory neuron pair, termed BAG, which is activated upon O<sub>2</sub> downshift (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zimmer et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We first qualitatively evaluated these behaviors by examining single worms (see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Upon O<sub>2</sub> downshift, animals tended to stop forward locomotion and adopted complex and variable postures, unlike the more regular sinusoid-like postures associated with LDT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Some of these postures resembled omega turns, while others were associated with shallow turns and pauses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In order to obtain quantifiable time-series of animal postures, we skeletonized the worm images and calculated 24 inter-segment angles for each worm and movie frame (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>); an example is shown by the kymograph in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>. LDT was associated with long stretches of regular and coherent body posture patterns, while O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS after O<sub>2</sub> downshift exhibited variability in the amplitude, direction and frequency of body postural changes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Note that shallow turns, slowing bouts, reversals and omega turns also occurred sparsely during LDT; however, during O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS these behaviors were up-regulated 2-4-fold (compare pre- with post- stimulus period in all panels of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

However, the coordinated motions of the muscle-associated body segments can be quantified with far fewer than 95 parameters, leading to a reduced but comprehensive description of body posture (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stephens et al., 2008</a>). Briefly, in this approach, principal components analysis (PCA) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jolliffe, 2002</a>) calculates the eigenvectors (termed eigenworms, EWs) of the covariance matrix of inter-segment angles observed over many posture time series (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). EW\u2019s are a set of representative worm postures (as defined by a vector of inter-segment angles), in descending order of explanatory power; i.e. each EW contributes a certain amount of postural variance and linear combinations of the first four EWs account for the gross majority (&gt;85%) of the observed postural variance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For example, the first two eigenworms (EW1-2) capture the dominant correlations between segment body angles as reflected in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, and subsequent EWs capture secondary correlational structure between segment body angles. We found that despite the strong effect of O<sub>2</sub> downshift on the animals\u2019 postures, the respective underlying EWs were nearly identical (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, the relative contributions of each EW changed: the percentage of total variance explained by EW1 and EW2 decreased whereas the percentage of total variance explained by lower-order EWs increased (e.g. EW3-6, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, the different postures observed during LDT versus O<sub>2</sub>-induced\u00a0ARS can be described by linear combinations of the same elementary shapes, the relative weights of which are modulated upon stimulation."

Here and in all subsequent analyses throughout this manuscript we used canonical EWs calculated from the full wild type N2 time series (n\u00a0=\u00a036 population assays, ~25 animals per assay). The combination of EW1 and 2 corresponds to the regular undulatory movements along the worm\u2019s body, which generates forward and backward crawling (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stephens et al., 2008</a>). We thus reconstructed posture time series based only on EWs 1\u20132 (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details). This led to a regular wave-like pattern corresponding to the undulatory worm movements; we termed this pattern the \u2018undulation mode\u2019 (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> for an example). Subtracting the undulation mode from the full body posture time series, which is equivalent to reconstructing posture time series based on all remaining EWs 3\u201324, revealed a strikingly organized residual mode. Strong transients in the residual time series coincided with shallow turns as well as with highly bent omega turns (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> for examples); we thus termed this time series the \u2018turning mode\u2019. The turning mode was qualitatively different in comparison to the undulation mode: the head moved in\u00a0anti-phase with the tail and in phase with the mid-body whereas the undulation mode was generated by anti-phase undulations of head and mid-body and in phase undulation of head and tail. We quantitatively assessed these differences by signal cross-correlation analysis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). The undulation mode and turning mode were not independent as they were often phase-locked: signal cross-correlation analysis showed that the onset of turning movements lagged on average ~0.6\u00a0s behind the undulation mode (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). We graphically synthesized worm shapes from the undulation mode and turning mode separately, which illustrated that the undulation mode corresponded to regular sinusoid-like worm shapes, whereas the turning mode corresponded to more strongly bent postures during shallow turns and omega turns. The diverse and complex postures observed in worms were obtained by simple linear addition of undulation and turning shapes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

Biomechanical calculations indicate that both body bending amplitude and frequency synergistically generate thrust against the substrate thereby contributing to the animals\u2019 locomotion speed (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gray, 1953</a>). The sum of the absolute values of all inter-segment angles of the body posture is a measure of the total curvature (or tortuousness) of the animals\u2019 posture, which we term body amplitude. To obtain separate measures of worm locomotion during LDT and O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS, we performed analyses on the pre- and post-stimulus periods. High signals in turning amplitude consistently coincided with regions of high track curvature, i.e. events when animals adjusted their heading direction (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> for examples); track curvature was a graded function of turning amplitude (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Turning amplitude and undulation amplitude exhibited a graded inverse relationship to each other (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). As expected, undulation frequency exhibited a tight linear relationship with translational locomotion speed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) (See also reference [<a href=\"#bib55\">Stephens et al., 2008</a>]). We found that directional changes during forward movement were associated with slow locomotion: there was an inverse relationship between undulation frequency and centroid track curvature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). High undulation amplitude was associated with fast locomotion (high undulation frequency) whereas high turning amplitude was associated with slow, low-frequency locomotion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3F</a>). All relationships described were preserved during both pre- and post- stimulus periods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013F</a>)."

                                "text": "We hypothesized that undulation and turning modes are under control of some of the animals\u2019 pre-motor interneuronal circuits. To identify such circuits we analyzed candidate neuropeptide modulators that were reported to affect body posture and found roles for FLP-1 and NLP-12 neuropeptides: <i>flp-1</i> mutants have been reported to exhibit elevated body curvature and locomotion speed (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nelson et al., 1998</a>). NLP-12 neuropeptides have been reported to be exclusively released from the proprioceptive interneuron DVA; interfering with the DVA/NLP-12 system leads to decreased body curvature and locomotion speed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Garrison et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Janssen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2006</a>). We first confirmed these previously reported results in our 1\u2009hr food deprivation paradigm. We assayed <i>flp-1</i> and <i>nlp-12</i> mutants, DVA ablated (DVA-) animals, as well as transgenic <i>nlp-12</i> rescue strains in DVA, and found that all phenotypes could be recapitulated in 1\u2009hr fasted worms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Next, we aimed to identify the relevant site of FLP-1 release. <i>flp-1</i> is expressed in various interneurons of the worm\u2019s head and ventral ganglia (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nelson et al., 1998</a>). We found that <i>flp-1</i> expression in the single ventral ganglion interneuron class AVK, which we observed to be the neuron class with strongest expression, is sufficient to restore a wild type phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We generated AVK- animals, which caused enhanced body posture amplitude similar to <i>flp-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). <i>flp-1;nlp-12</i> double mutants as well as AVK-;DVA- animals exhibited intermediate total body amplitude similar to wild type levels, indicating an antagonism between both systems (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). For comparison across different genetic backgrounds, we calculated undulation and turning modes for all genetic backgrounds using the wild type N2 eigenworms as a common basis. The decomposition revealed that a large proportion of altered body posture across all phenotypes could be explained by a corresponding effect on undulation amplitude. Interfering with AVK/FLP-1 function increased undulation amplitude, while interfering with DVA/NLP-12 decreased undulation amplitude . <i>flp-1;nlp-12</i> double mutants exhibited intermediate phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In addition, all genotypes except <i>flp-1;nlp-12</i> double mutants and DVA- animals showed an increase in turning amplitude, which was especially strong for <i>flp-1</i> mutants and animals lacking AVK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). A comparison of 2D probability density distributions of undulation vs. turning mode revealed that to a large extent the postures of mutants and manipulated strains reflected postures that were exhibited, however less frequently, by wild type animals (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Besides their effects on worm postures at constant atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> levels, all analyzed mutant and cell ablation strains were compromised in regulating undulation and turning mode in response to O<sub>2</sub> downshift. The strongest defects in stimulus-evoked postural changes were seen in strains lacking AVK neurons, as well as in <i>flp-1;nlp-12</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013G</a>). The DVA/NLP-12 and AVK/FLP-1 systems were both implicated in controlling locomotion speed (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Cell-specific expression of <i>nlp-12</i> in DVA and <i>flp-1</i> in AVK partially restored the respective phenotypes, confirming these cells as important release sites for the respective neuropeptides (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C,E</a>)."

The DVA/NLP-12 and AVK/FLP-1 systems are required for normal body posture during LDT in constant environmental conditions as well as for the differential fine control of undulation and turning motions in response to both abruptly and smoothly changing environments. Our data suggest that decomposition of posture into undulation and turning modes is not only a useful quantitative description of behavior, but that these motor patterns are under differential neural control."

We performed high-magnification (40x) fluorescence Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, using the indicator GCaMP5K, simultaneously with lower magnification infrared behavioral recording of worms freely moving on agarose. A closed-loop tracking system kept neurons of interest in the field of view of the imaging objective (<a href=\"#bib18\">Faumont et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kato et al., 2015</a>) and oxygen levels were controlled via a custom-fabricated oxygen flow arena mounted on the microscope stage (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kato et al., 2015</a>). An example recording of AVK activity is shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>. We observed frequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of varying magnitude, which were associated with changes in the animal\u2019s locomotion speed. Consistent with this observation, AVK Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in average decreased upon O<sub>2</sub> downshift (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013C</a>). When measuring AVK activity in immobilized animals, we did not detect O<sub>2</sub> downshift-evoked activity changes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In freely moving animals, we found that AVK activity positively correlated with locomotion speed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), but unlike previously reported speed-encoding interneurons, which exclusively encode either forward or reverse locomotion speed (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kato et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Li et al., 2014</a>), AVK correlated with speed during both forward and reverse movement (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Consistent with our findings that speed and turning motions were reciprocally regulated, AVK activity negatively correlated with turning amplitude during forward movement (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The relationship of AVK activity with behavioral output was unchanged when comparing pre- and post-stimulus periods (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013H</a>). Our activity recordings were corrected for motion artifacts by co-expressing mCherry and calculating GCaMP/mCherry fluorescence ratios; additional control experiments using Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive GFP confirmed that our measurements were GCaMP-specific and thus not derived from possible motion artifacts (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The neural activity is consistent with the behavioral phenotypes of AVK- animals, which exhibit reduced locomotion speed (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) and strong up-regulation of turning maneuvers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that AVK activity promotes locomotion speed and suppresses turning.

DVA Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals increased on average upon O<sub>2</sub> downshift (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a> upper panel, see <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> for motion artifact controls). We found that DVA activity correlated with multiple aspects of locomotory behavior: DVA activity rose on average at the transition from forward to backward directed movement (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>) and DVA was strongly activated during periods of paused locomotion (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1F,\u00a0G</a>), a behavior that was observed more frequently upon O<sub>2</sub> downshift (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). After restricting the analysis exclusively to periods of forward locomotion, i.e. removing reversal and pausing periods from the data, we did not detect any O<sub>2</sub> downshift-evoked change in the residual DVA activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, lower panel). In contrast to AVK, a global correlation analysis did not detect a relationship between DVA activity and forward locomotion speed, turning amplitude or undulation amplitude (<i>R\u00a0</i>=\u00a0-0.04, <i>R\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.09, <i>R\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.06, respectively). However, discernable DVA Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were evident during periods of forward locomotion (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). To test whether these signals had a behavioral correlate, we calculated Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak-triggered averages of undulation amplitude, turning amplitude and body posture amplitude. This approach showed that DVA Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were on average associated with transient increases in undulation amplitude and transient decreases in turning amplitude (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Triggering body posture amplitude to DVA activity peaks did not reveal any discernible signal (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>); these findings highlight the strength of the eigenworm decomposition approach for decoding behavior from neural activity."

In the following sections we address whether animals make use of this behavioral repertoire in a navigational chemotaxis paradigm. Previous work has shown that <i>C. elegans</i> navigates O<sub>2</sub> gradients towards preferred intermediate O<sub>2</sub> concentrations avoiding both hypoxia and atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> levels (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cheung et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gray et al., 2004</a>). O<sub>2</sub> sensing by BAG sensory neurons is required for these behaviors under fasted conditions (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zimmer et al., 2009</a>). We thus analyzed the distribution of animal populations exposed to linear gas phase O<sub>2</sub> gradients ranging from 4% to 21% (0.6% O<sub>2</sub> /mm) generated in a previously reported microdevice (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gray et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The conditions used in the present study excluded the hypoxia regime (&lt;4% O<sub>2</sub>) since the neuronal mechanisms of acute hypoxia avoidance in <i>C. elegans</i> have not been identified yet (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gray et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zimmer et al., 2009</a>). The average distribution profile suggested that 1\u20131.5\u2009hr food-deprived animals strongly avoided low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, accumulated at intermediate O<sub>2</sub> concentrations around a bin center of 16.4% and slightly avoided atmospheric levels of 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). For each experiment a paired control experiment was performed (21% O<sub>2</sub> flow from both microdevice inlets), during which animals tended to slightly accumulate in the middle part of the arena (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>)."

Since it was unknown which strategies contribute to O<sub>2</sub> chemotaxis, we performed a quantitative characterization thereof. Here and in the subsequent section, we focused on the low oxygen avoidance condition (16% O<sub>2</sub>\u20134% O<sub>2</sub>). Finely controlled steering during navigation of chemical gradients was previously described as a chemotaxis strategy termed weathervaning: animals introduce a curving bias towards preferred conditions depending on their heading direction with respect to the gradient direction (bearing) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</a>). Heading straight towards 16% or 4% O<sub>2</sub> was defined as 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 bearing respectively while heading perpendicular to the gradient was defined as 90\u00b0 bearing (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). We then calculated the animals\u2019 curving bias, which is the average change in the bearing trajectory \u0394B/\u0394x as a function of bearing (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C\u2013D</a>). In comparison to control experiments lacking a gradient, animals exhibited a curving bias towards preferred O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, strongest at bearing orientations around 90\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Next, we investigated the modulation of reorientation rate and found that reversal rates were suppressed or increased at low or high bearing angles, respectively (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). We also observed a gradual reduction of locomotion speed as a function of increased bearing angles (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Finally, we detected individual shallow turning events based on finding local peaks of turning mode signal of the mid-body during forward locomotion, excluding omega turns. On average, turning increased gradually as a function of bearing angles during O<sub>2</sub> chemotaxis but not under control conditions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>)."

The low O<sub>2</sub> avoidance mechanisms employ multiple navigational strategies: when heading along directions around perpendicular to the gradient animals steer towards preferred O<sub>2</sub> concentrations using weathervaning, and when animals are heading away from preferred O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (high bearing angles) the random biased walk mechanism of chemotaxis is prevalent as indicated by an up-regulation of reversal rates. In addition, animals exhibit enhanced ARS-like behavior indicated by a gradual reduction of locomotion speed and up-regulation of turning dependent on their heading direction."

We subtracted the fractional animal distributions during controls from the distributions during gradient application in order to calculate O<sub>2</sub> chemotaxis indices for low O<sub>2</sub> concentration ranges. This revealed a compromised ability of <i>flp-1;nlp-12</i> double mutants to avoid low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). A similar defect was observed in <i>nlp-12</i> and <i>flp-1</i> single mutants but not in AVK- animals (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>).

This effect appeared similar to crowding behavior animals perform under conditions of high population density and food scarcity (unpublished observation).

Unlike previously described brief escape reflexes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Goodman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hilliard et al., 2002</a>), these behaviors are sustained for several minutes and can be described as a switch from LDT to O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS, in accordance to previous literature studying similar behavior strategies after removal from food (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calhoun et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hills et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Peliti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tsalik and Hobert, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wakabayashi et al., 2004</a>). The reduction in ambient oxygen could indicate the proximity of a food source and therefore evoke similar ARS behavior as observed after removal from food. In both paradigms the search strategy is thus likely built on the vicinity of a potential food source. However, whether the same interneuron circuits are controlling the two ARS behaviors has not been focus of this study and remains to be investigated. Yet, we know that NLP-12 neuropeptides play a role in both O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS (this study) and ARS after removal from food (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</a>) indicating some potential overlap between both circuits."

Therefore, posture time series are an indirect readout of muscle activity patterns (<a href=\"#bib8\">Butler et al., 2014</a>). Here we show that strikingly different movement strategies of <i>C. elegans</i> can be described by projecting posture time series to a common basis of EWs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We reconstruct two motor modes from these projections: reconstructing posture time series from EW1-2 reveals the regular undulation mode of the animal consisting of sinusoid-like postures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). The residual movement (turning mode) is a set of motor patterns with distinct characteristics (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), capturing the animals\u2019 curving and turning movements. Strikingly, complex postural time series can be additively composed out of these two simpler modes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>): The eigenworm approach decomposes the biphasic temporal profile of animal posture observed upon sensory stimulation into two reciprocally regulated, simpler, monophasic components (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This indicates that the undulation and turning modes may explicitly map to neural control mechanisms. We speculate that summation of distinct neural activity patterns might be an elegant solution for a neural system to generate complex movements. In this view the turning and undulation modes could have specific neural correlates at the level of interneurons and/or motor neurons, which are summed at the respective downstream postsynaptic targets. This hypothesis bears analogy to the proposal of muscle synergies producing coordinated movements in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tresch and Jarc, 2009</a>). Further imaging studies simultaneously recording the activity of muscles, motor neurons and interneurons are required to test this hypothesis."

All three parameters are in a lawful relationship: high undulation frequency is associated with high undulation amplitude, and both parameters are counter-regulated with turning amplitude (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a>). This finding demonstrates an important tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency of movement: explorative behaviors with frequent directional changes require flexible postures and slower locomotion while fast undulation for efficient displacement requires movements coherent across all body parts. Therefore, undulation and turning motor modes are counter-regulated; however, they are not mutually exclusive as their contributions to movement are graded (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Such counter-regulation might not be surprising, yet it has not been thoroughly described how animals in general coordinate underlying motor patterns for their purposes. Furthermore, counter-examples with co-regulation of those motor patterns exist in animal locomotion: e.g. hares sharply turn corners during fast escape runs, which suggests the need of neural coordination mechanisms of motor patterns."

AVK neuronal activity promotes undulation speed and suppresses turning (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The decreased activity after stimulation is consistent with an increase of turning amplitude during ARS. Changes of AVK activity after sensory stimulation are evident only in unrestrained animals. Therefore, AVK might function as part of a locomotor feedback system to monitor speed changes and to inversely couple turning motions to these changes. In addition, it is likely that AVK neurons receive input from their presynaptic partners, the RIG interneurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 1986</a>), which are among the major postsynaptic partners of BAG sensory neurons and candidate transducers of O<sub>2</sub> stimuli (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kato et al., 2015</a>), which could be a pathway for sensory-evoked postural control."

In our recordings DVA activity does not seem to encode sensory stimulus as it corresponds best to the execution of the various behaviors, the frequency of which changes upon stimulation. So far no candidate sensory to motor pathways from BAG to DVA have been characterized. DVA has been described as a proprioceptive neuron activated by body flexure in semi-restrained worms (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2006</a>).

This is a laboratory condition associated with abundant bacterial food (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gray et al., 2004</a>), which suggests that fasted animals utilize information about ambient O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in order to search for food. We show that <i>C. elegans</i> employs multiple strategies during O<sub>2</sub> chemotaxis, the choice of which depends on how the animals are oriented along the gradient: when their orientation is close to perpendicular to the gradient direction, the weathervaning strategy prevails (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). When heading straight up or down the gradient, they employ a biased random walk strategy by down- or up-regulating reorientation rate, respectively (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). Similar observations have been made in other chemotaxis paradigms in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</a>). In addition, we found that heading away from preferred O<sub>2</sub> levels causes the animals to slow down and up-regulate turning movements, i.e. they engage in an ARS-like behavior (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F,G</a>). <i>flp-1;nlp-12</i> double mutants exhibit specific defects in weathervaning, speed modulation and up-regulation of turning movements, while the random biased walk mechanism remains intact (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C\u2013F</a>). The overall consequence is a decrease in chemotaxis performance (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). These data indicate that the fine-tuned control of undulation and turning motions is essential for normal navigation of spatial gradients; nevertheless, the biased random walk strategy can partially compensate for these deficits. In bacteria the biased random walk strategy is the only reported mechanism supporting the organism to reach its goal (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg and Brown, 1972</a>). It will be interesting to find out whether similar counter-regulation of motor patterns underlies the chemotactic strategies of other animals, e.g. <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. These move via whole-body propulsions and are also capable of controlling run directions (= weathervaning) besides regulating timing and direction of whole-body turns in response to odorant gradients (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2014</a>)."

The undulation mode dominates LDT while turning movements shape O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS. However, these behaviors lie on a continuum. Neuromodulatory peptidergic circuits gradually adjust the underlying movement parameters while enforcing lawful reciprocal relationships between them. In this way, movement can be finely controlled according to the animals\u2019 instantaneous needs, allowing for a rapid sensory-evoked shift from LDT to O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS as well as for subtle movement changes during navigation. Our approach is thus complementary with others that describe different behaviors as discrete and maintained behavioral states between which animals switch (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ben Arous et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dankert et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kain et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wiltschko et al., 2015</a>). The coordination of motor patterns for foraging accounts for a tradeoff that animals have to make in order to effectively achieve the goals of each strategy: fast undulation requires a coherent coordination of all body parts, while slow search movements require flexibility in gait and posture. In this work we provide experimental support for this concept obtained from <i>C. elegans</i> and speculate that analogous control schemes may govern locomotion in higher animals."

It is build upon a previously reported script (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ramot et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tsunozaki et al., 2008</a>), available at <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/wormsense/tracker/\">http://med.stanford.edu/wormsense/tracker/</a>. Briefly, worms were detected by gray level thresholding. Worm trajectories were generated by connecting nearby centroid coordinates in adjacent frames and each trajectory coordinate was assigned with recorded binary images, centroid coordinates and shape parameters; the resulting data-structures are termed here worm tracks. Trajectories are terminated when worms collide with each other or with the boundaries of the arena. Each worm track therefore represents a fragment of each worm\u2019s complete behavior during the recording time. Worm tracks with a length of less than 200 (20\u00a0s duration) frames were discarded. Each worm is typically represented by multiple worm tracks of varying length. This is important to keep in mind when displaying and quantifying the data (see below). The resulting trajectories were smoothed and used to calculate instantaneous translational speed of the worm\u2019s centroid, which is measured along the axis of progression. Periods of backward locomotion were detected based on changes in angular velocity and building on the fact that animals were moving most of the time in forward direction, which was confirmed also for all mutants used in this study. Reversal frequency was calculated in 10\u00a0s bins. Reversals were usually excluded (data set to NaN) from the population behavioral assay analyses to obtain forward locomotion only. Time periods during which the animals were within 80pixels (=\u00a01.0\u00a0mm) distance to the Whatman paper were also excluded. Deep, so-called omega turns were detected based on characteristic changes in object eccentricity and angular speed, and their frequency was calculated in 10\u00a0s bins."

The result (change of heading angle per frame) was divided by the mean crossed distance per frame during the same 1\u00a0s interval. This yielded change of heading angle over distance. Data during which animals were barely moving (speed &lt; 0.03\u2009mm/s) had to be excluded as centroid 'wobbling' due to tracking issues at very low speeds caused falsely high curvature levels. Artificially high values (&gt;31\u2009rad/mm = 99.5 percentile) were removed. Data during reverse movement were excluded."

The pointy tail tips were omitted due to thresholding issues. The extracted splines were smoothed and divided into 25 equally spaced body segments. Artificially short skeletons were excluded and the data of these frames set to NaN. Images of worms forming coil-like postures could not be skeletonized. This typically occurred during deep bended omega turns when the head touches the tail. However, the most highly curved posture typically happened slightly before so that body posture, undulation mode and turning mode amplitude maxima during omega turns were still included in most of the data. Therefore, time points during those turning events before and after the moments of head-body touching could be skeletonized. Head positions were determined based on direction of movement and taking into account when the animals moved backward. Then skeletons were reordered accordingly. Head-tail flips were further prevented due to the fact that the head position could only change by limited distance in-between adjacent frames (0.1 s): both skeleton end points were compared to the head position of the previous frame and the end point with smaller distance was usually (except for identified deep omega turns, when head and tail position were very close) taken as the new head position. Manually proof checking confirmed the reliability of this method. We calculated 24 inter-segment angles between the adjacent segments from head (segment angle #1) to tail (segment angle #24). Segment angle time series were added to the worm tracks structures. They were termed body posture. Previous studies had used at least 48 (up to 100) segments (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Stephens et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yemini et al., 2013</a>). In this paper, we can recapitulate similar eigenworm shapes with 24 segment angles. The advantage of choosing (in comparison to these studies) lower resolution was being able to record from multiple animals simultaneously and to acquire data with the parallel worm tracker described above. This approach provides higher sample power required for trial averaging and statistics when assaying behavioral responses that naturally exhibit high single trial animal-to-animal variability."

Variance contribution per eigenworm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>) was calculated as the relative fraction each eigenvalue contributed to the sum of all eigenvalues. The difference between the cumulative variance distributions of the two 60\u00a0s intervals was evaluated for significance by a random resampling approach: the same angle time series were shuffled and then randomly split into two groups with n numbers matching the original counts of time series pre- or post-shift, respectively. Then PCA was performed on the concatenated angle time series per group (as before) and the cumulative difference between the two cumulative variance contributions was calculated. These steps were iterated one million times during which an equal or higher value than the one obtained from the original non-shuffled groups never occurred.

We chose different experimental conditions than in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang and Bargmann, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gray et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zimmer et al., 2009</a>) in order to optimally match all conditions across behavioral experiments in this study. The important parameters were: low population density, 1\u00a0hr food deprivation and no hypoxia conditions in the device (21-4% instead of 21-0% gradients). Hence different preferred O<sub>2</sub> levels are reported here (16\u201317% in this study versus 7-10%). Animals were starved for 1\u00a0hr on an NGM agar plate without <i>E. coli</i> feeding bacteria before the aerotaxis assays. In each assay, 30\u201340 adult (1 day post L4 larval stage) animals were transferred onto a new NGM agar plate and the PDMS device was placed over them. This device comprised an arena of 33\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm. Gas in- and outlets were included within 3\u00a0mm wide stretches on either side of the arena (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The gas was producing a linear gradient by diffusion. 21% or 4% (v/v) O<sub>2</sub>, balanced with nitrogen, was delivered with a flow rate of 0.75\u2009ml/min from gas-tight syringes using a syringe pump (PHD2000, Harvard Apparatus). Each gradient experiment was accompanied by a preceding control experiment performed with application of 21% O<sub>2</sub> on both sides. After performing control experiments for 30\u00a0min, gradients were established and animals were recorded for another time course of 30 min. The O<sub>2</sub> gradient establishment was confirmed in separate measurements with the VisiSens O<sub>2</sub> imaging system (PreSens) by ratiometric fluorescence imaging of an O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive foil covered with an agarose film and the gradient device. These experiments revealed that a nearly linear gradient is established within 10\u00a0min. Recordings of freely behaving animals illuminated with flat red LED lights were made at 3, 10 or 15 fps on a 4 megapixel CCD camera (Jai) at a pixel resolution of 0.0276 or 0.0155\u2009mm/ pixel using Streampix software (Norpix)."

Bearing (B, measured in degree\u00b0) was quantified as the instantaneous orientation of the animals\u2019 smoothed centroid heading relative to the optimal O<sub>2</sub> concentration isoline. We defined the metric range from 0\u00b0 (orientation exactly towards the isoline) to 180\u00b0 (orientation away from the isoline). Left or right orientation was neglected, as the gradient in the arena is one-dimensional. We excluded sections of the trajectories that were within 20 pixels (=0.55\u00a0mm) distance to the arena edges. Our weathervaning analysis was restricted to the area of the gradient with concentrations lower than 16% and 2\u00a0min after O<sub>2</sub> flow onset. Curving bias was calculated as the instantaneous change of bearing over distance travelled dB/dX (rad/mm) for each frame. The analysis was restricted to continuous forward run periods: Omega turns, reversals, forward runs of very short duration (&lt;3\u00a0s) or forward runs with a total displacement of less than 1\u2009mm were excluded. A negative curving bias indicates a change of orientation towards the optimum isoline. Curving bias, reversal frequency and speed of forward runs relative to bearing were obtained by calculating histograms using bins of 20\u00b0 bearing. For quantification and statistical comparisons curving biases were averaged across a bearing range of 40\u00b0\u2013150\u00b0. Relative reversal and speed change was calculated as the percent change of reversal frequency or speed, respectively, for animals with a bearing &gt;90\u00b0 relative to the reversal frequency or speed of all animals with bearing &lt;90\u00b0. These parameters were calculated independently for each experiment. Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s correction was used for comparing mutant strains against wild type N2 and Mann-Whitney test for comparing gradient vs. control for each strain. Sample size equals number of experiments (successfully worm-tracked control and gradient runs counted spearately). For calculating mean body turning with respect to the animals\u2019 bearing we used the high pixel resolution datasets (hence the lower n numbers in Figure 9G, 10F), skeletonized worms and performed eigenworm analysis as above. Peak values of the mid-body turning mode (segment angle #11) only during forward movement and excluding omega turns were detected with a peak-finding algorithm and averaged over bins of 5\u00b0 for corresponding bearing values. Standard MatLab functions were used for the linear fit and calculation of linear correlation coefficients. <i>p</i> values are calculated based on a Student's t distribution using the <i>corr</i> function in MatLab."

Adult (1 day post L4 larval stage) worms expressing both mCherry and GCaMP5K (or GFP) in the neuron of interest were placed on food-free nematode growth medium (NGM) agarose pads and sealed in a custom built airtight chamber with inlet and outlet connectors for gas delivery. Animals were starved for 1\u2009hr prior the imaging experiment on a food-free normal NGM plate. 21% (v/ v) O<sub>2</sub>, balanced with nitrogen, was applied for 4 min with a gas flow of 50\u00a0ml/ min, followed by a switch to 10% O<sub>2</sub> for 4 min. Gases were mixed with a static mixing element connected to mass flow controllers (V\u00f6gtlin Instruments). To avoid out of focus movement it was critical to carefully prepare plane agarose pads. For this, freshly made NGM agarose mix was melted and poured into a ring 2.45\u2009mm thick and 50\u2009mm in diameter and enclosed with glass on both sides to harden. Another ring of 38\u2009mm diameter was pressed onto the agarose in order to make an indentation into which 20\u00a0mM copper chloride was pipetted to restrict the worm to the center of the pad. The pad was then placed inside the chamber, which was sealed shut and covered with a glass slide (0.55\u2009mm thickness) 0.7\u2009mm from the agarose surface. The chamber was then placed onto a motorized stage with associated controller (MS-2000-PhotoTrack, Applied Scientific Instrumentation). Images were acquired on an inverted compound microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1) using two Charge-Coupled Device cameras (Evolve 512, Photometrics). Dual wavelength excitation light (470 and 585\u00a0nm) was provided by a CoolLED pE-2 excitation system using an ET-EGFP/mCherry filter set (59022x, Chroma) and dichroic (59022bs, Chroma). A long-distance 63x objective (Zeiss LD Plan-Neofluar 63x, 0.75 NA) was used to stream unbinned images at 33\u00a0ms exposure time (30\u00a0Hz) with Visiview software (Visitron Systems GmbH, Germany). A dichroic mirror (620 spxr, Chroma) directed high wavelength mCherry emission to a four-quadrant photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu) for recentering. The remaining emission was split by a DualCam DC2 cube (565 lpxr, Photometrics) to each of the two CCD cameras, one for mCherry emission (641/75\u00a0nm, Brightline) and one for GCaMP emission (520/35\u00a0nm, Brightline). mCherry emission was further reduced to 50% by a neutral density filter to prevent signal saturation. Simultaneous behavior recordings under infrared LED illumination (780\u00a0nm) were made using an IR-sensitive CCD camera (Manta Prosilica GigE, Applied Vision Technologies) at 4x magnification with 100\u00a0ms exposure time (10\u00a0Hz) and StreamPix software (Norpix).

For the GCaMP channel-derived images we measured the sum of pixels from the region matching the mCherry thresholded area. Both datasets were background-corrected by subtracting the average background pixel value (obtained from the respective first image frame capturing unspecific tissue signal) multiplied by the number of pixels thresholded in that frame. The ratio GCaMP5K/ mCherry was calculated per frame to correct for artificial GCaMP fluorescence changes due to motion artifacts or out-of-focus movements of the cell body. Very strong out-of-focus movements were automatically excluded, as there was no connected region &gt;50 pixels above threshold in these frames. In that case data were set to NaN. We further corrected for strong out-of-focus movements, not fully adjusted through the ratio calculation, by determining strong drops in mCherry fluorescence and occasionally unreasonably large drops in GCaMP fluorescence values. Normalized ratio dR/R (%) was calculated as the difference of R extracted from each frame to the mean R of the total recording and divided by mean R [(R-mean(R))/mean(R)]. Further signal artifacts were determined and excluded by determining extremely high ratio values (absolute and relative to a finer local mean) and drops (relative) of the normalized ratio, which had been carefully evaluated for each cell. All excluded data were set to NaN. GFP control data were extracted and processed exactly the same way as GCaMP data."

The stereotypy of the images permitted choosing a fixed manual threshold (an 8-bit grayscale value of 127) for every recording to separate worm from background. The thresholded worm was dilated by 3 pixels so as to smooth any imperfections, and then eroded by 8 pixels to achieve an accurate representation of the worm. The original algorithm was too stringent in rejecting poorly segmented worm shapes. Therefore, all thresholds for worm-shape rejection were relaxed by 80% without compromising the effectiveness of this step. Head/tail classification was a matter of determining which end of the worm was more central. Therefore, within video chunks of contiguous worm segmentations, individual skeletons were oriented relative to each other as previously described, then head and tail were determined by taking the mean distance of both worm ends from the video center. Thereafter, all steps to skeletonize the worm are as formerly described, save for a reduction in skeleton size to 26 worm points."

The worm channel was connected to a reservoir containing S-Basal buffer. All components were connected with Tygon tubing (0.02 in ID, 0.06 in OD; Norton) or polyethylene tubing (0.066 in ID, 0.095 in OD; Intramedic) using 23G Luer-stub adapters (Intramedic). 21% (v/v) O<sub>2</sub>, balanced with nitrogen, was applied with a gas flow of 50\u00a0ml/ min for 4 min, followed by a switch to 10% O<sub>2</sub> for 4 min. Gases were mixed with a static mixing element connected to mass flow controllers (V\u00f6gtlin Instruments). After 1-hr starvation on a food-free NGM plate, single adult (1 day post L4 larval stage) worms expressing both mCherry and GCaMP5K in AVK were loaded into the worm channel: Animals were transferred into a drop of S-Basal on the NGM plate. By applying a short vacuum to the worm outlet, we sucked animals up into Tygon tubing, which was afterwards connected again to the worm inlet to position the worm in the channel. We used an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CoolLED pE-2 excitation system to provide dual wavelength excitation light using an ET-EGFP/mCherry filter set (59022x, Chroma) and dichroic (59022\u00a0bs, Chroma), and an Optosplit II (Cairns) image splitter (filter set used: 580 nm beam splitter and 520/35 nm and 641/75 nm bandpass emission filters). Split imaging data were acquired with an Andor iXon 397 EMCCD camera with 100 ms exposure time, streaming images at 10\u00a0Hz acquisition rate to MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Fluorescence values were measured with a custom-made tracking script written in MetaMorph software. The region of bright mCherry signal is detected by thresholding and robustly tracked using the built-in track object function. Measurement regions for GCaMP signal as well as nearby regions for measuring background values were manually selected for the first image frame. Their positions were updated according to the frame-to-frame displacement of the mCherry-tracking region. Normalized ratio dR/R (%) was calculated in the same way as for the freely moving calcium-imaging data."

Movement is divided into \"crawling\" when posture fits the first two PCAs and \"steering\" for all other behavior. Worms steer more once oxygen drops, but this adapts in 3-minutes. Confirming previous reports, they show that two peptidergic-interneurons influence posture, and then show that disrupting the neurons or neuropeptide genes predictably effect posture with oxygen drop. The truly novel results image neuronal calcium in freely moving worms during oxygen drops. AVK activity roughly follows overall speed. DVA activity correlated with crawling and/or reversing, modes when the body is curved. Lastly, they find evidence for both pirouette and weathervane mechanisms for aerotaxis. The experiments are carefully performed and the data presented are clear and convincing. Writing is succinct and clear. Supplemental data are extensive but could be better integrated into the manuscript. Methods are described in detail."

Furthermore, we include a small section in the Discussion (fourth paragraph) explaining that O<sub>2</sub>-induced ARS of food-deprived animals and roaming-dwelling decisions in the presence of food likely employ different modulatory signaling pathways."
