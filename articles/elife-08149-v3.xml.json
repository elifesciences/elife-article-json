To find recognition proteins involved in lamination, we utilized microarray data from 13 subtypes to identify differentially-expressed extracellular proteins and performed a high-throughput biochemical screen. We identified ~50 previously-unknown receptor-ligand pairs, including new interactions among members of the FLRT and Unc5 families. These proteins show laminar-restricted IPL localization and induce attraction and/or repulsion of retinal neurites in culture, placing them in an ideal position to mediate laminar targeting. Consistent with a repulsive role in arbor lamination, we observed complementary expression patterns for one interaction pair, FLRT2-Unc5C, <i>in vivo</i>. Starburst amacrine cells and their synaptic partners, ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells, express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C. These data suggest a single molecular mechanism may have been co-opted by synaptic partners to ensure joint laminar restriction."

To find recognition proteins involved in lamination, we utilized microarray data from 13 subtypes to identify differentially-expressed extracellular proteins and performed a high-throughput biochemical screen. We identified ~50 previously-unknown receptor-ligand pairs, including new interactions among members of the FLRT and Unc5 families. These proteins show laminar-restricted IPL localization and induce attraction and/or repulsion of retinal neurites in culture, placing them in an ideal position to mediate laminar targeting. Consistent with a repulsive role in arbor lamination, we observed complementary expression patterns for one interaction pair, FLRT2-Unc5C, <i>in vivo</i>. Starburst amacrine cells and their synaptic partners, ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells, express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C. These data suggest a single molecular mechanism may have been co-opted by synaptic partners to ensure joint laminar restriction."

Visser et al. identified two families of proteins that might control the lamination of many different subtypes of neurons. The findings reveal some of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of neural circuits in the developing retina and suggest that a pair of synaptic partners may use the same recognition proteins to ensure that they target to the same layer. The next step will be to confirm whether the proteins identified are indeed responsible for organizing neurons into distinct layers during the development of the mouse retina."

This organization provides an architectural framework that facilitates the assembly of neural circuits in a stereotyped fashion, a crucial feature that underlies function of the structure. Laminated structures are composed of multiple different classes and subtypes of neurons that form distinct connections in specific stratified layers. During development, the cell bodies and/or neurites of these different neuronal subtypes become restricted to one or more distinct strata. Costratification of arbors promotes synaptic specificity by placing appropriate synaptic partners in close proximity to one another.

The inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina is a stratified neuropil composed of axons and dendrites belonging to ~70 different subtypes of neurons. These neurons synapse selectively on specific partners, forming a complex set of parallel circuits, so a high degree of specificity is required during the wiring process (for review see <a href=\"#bib57\">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hoon et al., 2014</a>). The IPL has been well-characterized structurally and functionally. Three major class of neurons (bipolar, amacrine, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)) form connections with each other in five IPL synaptic sublayers, termed S1-S5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Most neurons project selectively to just one or a few of these sublayers. There are many genetic and cell biological tools available to study neurons with lamina-specific projections and retinal neurons are amenable to culture <i>ex vivo</i> allowing in-depth analysis of the receptor-ligand interactions that underlie laminar organization. For all these reasons we chose the IPL region of the mouse retina as a model system to study lamination."

The screen is a modified version of an assay we previously described that is quantitative over a 70-fold range (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</a>) (see <i>Materials and\u00a0methods</i>). For this study, the workflow was converted from an insect cell strategy to one that would accommodate mammalian proteins. It is largely the case that interactions at the cell surface exhibit low affinities (K<sub>D</sub> ~ \u00b5M) and fast dissociation rates (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vandermerwe and Barclay, 1994</a>), kinetic properties that allow transient, contact-dependent interactions to occur between recognition proteins expressed on neighboring cells <i>in vivo</i> but often make biochemical detection <i>in vitro</i> difficult. Our ELISA-based binding assay surmounts this limitation because it utilizes a strategy that tetramerizes the AP-tagged receptor and Fc-tagged ligand proteins (see <i>Materials and\u00a0methods</i>). By inducing tetramers, which provides additive or avidity effects, the assay is highly\u00a0sensitive allowing proteins with micromolar affinities to be detected at nanomolar concentrations. Such clustering of cell surface proteins (through dimerization, trimerization, tetramerization and pentamerization) is standard practice for detecting ligand-receptor interactions <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bushell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ramani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Ozkan et al., 2013</a>) as well as in culture experiments where cellular responses to ligands are investigated (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis et al., 1994</a>)."

The high-throughput nature of the assay is due, in large part, to the ability to test AP- and Fc-tagged extracellular domain proteins for binding directly in conditioned culture media following transient transfection, thereby obviating the requirement for arduous protein purification. Furthermore, by employing secreted, recombinant proteins, the assay monitors direct protein-protein interactions so it does not suffer the caveat that interactions may reflect indirect binding. As such, this assay, along with two similar, independently-developed ELISA-based binding methods (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bushell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Ozkan et al., 2013</a>), provides a significant advancement for the study of extracellular protein-protein interactions over low-throughput techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation that, additionally, cannot distinguish between direct and indirect interactions."

The Dscam1 controls were included because some Dscam1-Dscam1 interacting pairs exhibit high levels of binding while others exhibit very low levels, thereby serving as a positive control for the sensitivity of the screen (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</a>). We tested the 126 proteins for binding in a matrix which reciprocally tests every pair-wise combination (i.e. 126 x 126 = 15,876 binding reactions) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Visser et al., 2015</a>). This includes 126 homophilic pairs and 7,875 unique heterophilic pairs. We included reciprocal pairs because sometimes a receptor-ligand interaction will occur in one orientation but not the other.

Previous studies have shown that five classes of Sema ligands (Sema3-7) interact directly with four classes of Plxn receptors (PlxnA-D) or indirectly through binding to the Plxn co-receptors, Nrp1 and Nrp2 (for review see <a href=\"#bib84\">Yoshida, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</a>). The specificity of Sema-Plxn interactions is largely restricted within distinct classes (e.g. Sema4s bind PlxnBs and Sema5s bind PlxnAs) with crosstalk occasionally observed (e.g. Sema4C binds PlxnD1). These broadly-defined principles of binding specificity have collectively emerged from a large number of studies that each investigated interactions between limited subsets of Semas and Plxns. Our screen included all members of these families (20 Sema, nine Plxn and two Nrp proteins) and, as such, is the first comprehensive study of Sema-Plxn and Sema-Nrp binding specificity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Notably, we observed 1) that Nrp1 and Nrp2 can directly interact with some members of both the Sema4 and Sema6 families; 2) that some Sema3s can interact directly with Plxns in the absence of Nrp1 or Nrp2 (previously only Sema3E was known to interact with PlxnD1 directly and signal in the absence of Nrp) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gu et al., 2005</a>); and 3) new Sema4/5/6-Plxn interaction pairs. In total, we identified twenty-four previously-unreported Sema-Nrp or Sema-Plxn interactions and confirmed four others that had been suggested by genetic interactions (see also <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). Together, the results of our screen reveal a wide variety of new interactions among cell surface proteins, which we expect will provide a useful resource to the community of investigators studying cell-cell recognition in a variety of different systems."

These families were selected for further study because they were some of the strongest hits, with binding levels comparable to positive controls such as Ncam1 homophilic binding and NetrinG1-Lrrc4c heterophilic binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Furthermore, of the 12 possible FLRT-Unc5 interactions (i.e. 3 FLRTs x 4 Unc5s), prior to our screen, four had been described in the literature (three in mouse and one in zebrafish) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Karaulanov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sollner and Wright, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yamagishi et al., 2011</a>) suggesting that the eight new FLRT-Unc5 binding pairs we identified were likely to represent biologically-relevant interactions rather than false positives."

Using the cell aggregation assay, we tested every combination of FLRTs and Unc5s and found that all pairs interact between opposing cells as evidenced by cell aggregation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

To investigate the cell biological response of primary retinal neurons (i.e. attraction or repulsion), we performed <i>ex vivo</i> stripe assays (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vielmetter et al., 1990</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">Delamarche et al., 1997</a>). Because the IPL contains arbors from ~70 different subtypes of neurons, each of which may respond differently (or not at all) to the same protein ligand, it was necessary for us to use a stripe assay that would provide single-cell resolution. The tremendous value of single-cell stripe assays is that they allow the response of an individual subtype of neuron to be observed within a mixed population. As such, we designed and fabricated microfluidic devices (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <i>Materials and methods</i>) to pattern 30 \u00b5m stripes, a width appropriate for the growth of single IPL neurons whose cell bodies average between 10-30 \u00b5m (data not shown).

We reasoned that proteins involved in mediating laminar organization, or other recognition events that play a role in neural circuit formation, would elicit a response (i.e. attraction or repulsion) in only a subpopulation of neurons. While the majority of neurons did not respond to FLRT or Unc5 stripes, growing indiscriminately across them, we observed small populations of neurons (5-18%) that responded to FLRT1 (n=61/375, 16% attractive; n=19/375, 5% repulsive), FLRT2 (n=63/344; 18% repulsive), FLRT3 (n=37/438, 8% attractive; n=33/438, 8% repulsive), Unc5C (n=45/396, 11% repulsive) and Unc5D (n=49/407, 12% repulsive) stripes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A-I</a>). No significant response of neurons was observed to Unc5B stripes (n=3/380, 1% repulsive) relative to control laminin stripes (n=1/88, 1% repulsive). There also were no attractive or repulsive responses to Unc5A stripes (n=257/257, 100% permissive) but we did observe a modest population-wide reduction in neurite outgrowth and decreased viability (data not shown). Together these data demonstrate that Unc5C, Unc5D, and all three FLRTs mediate recognition events between subtypes of retinal neurons and suggest that FLRTs and Unc5s may contribute to development of the retinal circuit."

Three patterns of developmental regulation were observed. One subset of proteins, FLRT2 and Unc5C, showed broad expression across the IPL at P2 that gradually became sublamina-restricted by P6. A second group, FLRT1 and FLRT3, showed sublaminar bias already at P2 that changed only slightly as the IPL expanded with age. The final group, Unc5A and Unc5D, added new sublayers at later ages: Unc5A was not observed in the IPL until P6, even though immunoreactivity was detected in neuronal somata at earlier ages, suggesting that IPL innervation by Unc5A-positive cells happens later than other family members. Unc5D, meanwhile, exhibited S1 restriction at P2-4 and then added expression in S5 at P6. Interestingly, the expression pattern of Unc5D may remain dynamic after P6, as immunostaining published by Feldheim and colleagues suggests that, while S5 expression is maintained, S1 expression is lost by P8 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sweeney et al., 2014</a>). The three patterns of laminar restriction we observed \u2013 termed 'initially diffuse,' 'initially precise,' and 'stepwise' lamination \u2013 have been seen in previous studies of IPL laminar targeting (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mumm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). The spatio-temporal and laminar-specific expression patterns of the FLRTs and Unc5s suggest that members of both families may contribute to specific cell-cell interactions that mediate these developmental strategies for laminar organization."

In our stripe assays we observe FLRT2-expressing retinal neurons that are repelled by Unc5C which is consistent with a model whereby Unc5C binding to FLRT2 induces repulsion in the FLRT2-expressing neuron; however, repulsive signaling downstream of FLRTs has not been reported. So we next asked whether Unc5C-FLRT2 interactions can induce repulsion in FLRT2-expressing retinal neurons by performing gain-of-function stripe assays. Using transient transfection, we ectopically expressed either full-length FLRT2-myc or full-length Unc5C-FLAG (control) in retinal neurons cultured on Unc5C stripes and monitored the response of neurons that expressed these exogenous proteins as assessed by anti-myc and anti-FLAG immunostaining, respectively. Importantly, this gain-of-function experiment was possible because only 11% of wild-type retinal neurons are repelled by Unc5C stripes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and, as such, the vast majority of neurons are available to exhibit a gain-of-function phenotype."

To determine whether SACs express FLRT2 during and following arborization within S2/4, we performed <i>in situ</i> hybridization against <i>Flrt2</i> in sections at both P1 and P6 along with calbindin immunostaining which selectively stains SACs at these ages (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kay et al., 2012</a>). Calbindin immunostaining was used to label SACs because VAChT immunoreactivity does not persist through the <i>in situ</i> hybridization protocol (nor does it label SAC cell bodies at P2-6). This analysis revealed that <i>Flrt2</i> is expressed by a subset of cells that includes: 1) SACs; 2) a sparse non-SAC population in the inner nuclear layer (INL) (presumably amacrines due to their laminar position close to the IPL and the fact that bipolar cells are not yet born at P1); and 3) a non-SAC population in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) that, based upon their large soma size, are likely to be retinal ganglion cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Notably, at P1, <i>Flrt2</i> expression is predominantly detected in ON SACs whose cell bodies reside in the GCL while, at P6, <i>Flrt2</i> expression is predominantly detected in OFF SACs whose cell bodies reside in the INL."

It was necessary to use these transgenic mice to visualize SACs in culture because the VAChT antibody that stains SACs in retinal sections does not stain cultured SACs (J.N.K., unpublished observations). Furthermore, it was necessary to perform FLRT2 immunostaining in dissociated cultured neurons because, in retinal sections, FLRT2 stains neurites in the IPL but not cell bodies in the adjacent INL and GCL (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) thereby preventing identification of the cell(s) to which the FLRT2-positive neurites belong. Immunostaining of dissociated SACs harvested at P2 demonstrated that tdTomato-positive SACs express FLRT2 (n=47/47) but not FLRT1 (n=0/55) or FLRT3 (n=0/67) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C-E</a>). Consistent with our <i>in situ</i> hybridizations, we also observed non-SAC neurons that expressed FLRT2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). As Unc5C expression localizes to S1/3/5 where SACs do not arborize (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we expected that SACs would not express Unc5C.

Indeed, we observed robust repulsion of SACs from Unc5C stripes (n=49/53, 92% repelled) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In contrast, SAC processes crossed FLRT2 stripes indiscriminately (n=71/71, 0% repelled) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Together these findings demonstrate that SACs express FLRT2 both during and after the developmental time when their neurites are becoming restricted to S2/4 and that SACs are repelled by Unc5C. Since SACs do not express FLRT1 and FLRT3, SAC repulsion by Unc5C could be due to interactions with FLRT2. These data suggest that repulsive FLRT2-Unc5C interactions may contribute to laminar organization of SAC neurons in the developing IPL."

Our approach is based on the widely-accepted notion that neuronal subtype-specific differences in composition and/or levels of cell surface and secreted proteins underlie the ability of neurons to recognize and respond to one another and the environment in a highly precise fashion.

While many binding partners within these families have been described, a comprehensive study of all Sema-Nrp and Sema-Plxn pairs has never been conducted. We included the complete families because our microarray data demonstrated that many members are differentially expressed in different subtypes of IPL neurons. Additionally, at the time we were selecting candidates for our screen, Kolodkin and colleagues reported that Sema5A and Sema5B interactions with PlxnA1 and PlxnA3 play a role in laminar organization in the developing mouse IPL (<a href=\"#bib48\">Matsuoka et al., 2011</a>). As such, we hypothesized that other family members are involved and reasoned that understanding the complete interaction network is necessary for evaluating genetic phenotypes <i>in vivo</i>. Previously, Sema3s were believed to require Nrp1 for signaling through PlxnA co-receptors (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tamagnone et al., 1999</a>) and Cntn2 was believed to interact with Sema3A only indirectly through <i>cis</i> interactions between Cntn2 and Nrp1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dang et al., 2012</a>). Direct protein-protein interactions observed in our screen between Sema3A-Cntn2 and Sema3A-PlxnA4 suggest that Sema3A may be able to signal directly through these receptors in the absence of Nrp1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The additional interaction partners we identified will thus enable the field to better understand how the interplay among Semas-Plxns-Nrps, as well as other potential Sema receptors such as Cntn2 and PlxnA4, contribute to laminar organization of the IPL and other cellular responses in a variety of different systems."

Further confirmation that the eight additional FLRT-Unc5 pairs we observed are biologically-relevant has been provided by Seiradake et al. who recently reported several of these interactions (<a href=\"#bib60\">Seiradake et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "FLRTs and Unc5s are broadly expressed in the developing nervous system as well as in other tissues. While in some regions FLRTs and Unc5s exhibit striking cell-type-specific expression patterns (including the cortex, hippocampus and the developing retina as we have shown here), in other areas multiple FLRTs and Unc5s are expressed in overlapping regions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haines et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Seiradake et al., 2014</a>). As such, the promiscuous binding of all FLRTs to all Unc5s seemingly presents a conundrum. Based upon the observed binding properties, a FLRT2-expressing neuron might well interact with all neurons that express any one of the four Unc5s. As such, how can FLRT-Unc5 interactions provide recognition specificity? Does promiscuous binding reduce the total possible number of distinct FLRT-Unc5 binding specificities from 12 (i.e. 3 FLRTs x 4 Unc5s) to one (i.e. FLRT-Unc5)? Our experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and those of others (<a href=\"#bib60\">Seiradake et al., 2014</a>) have demonstrated that different FLRT-Unc5 pairs exhibit differences in binding affinity (while our binding curves plateau due to saturated levels of detection and therefore preclude the determination of binding constants, the qualitative determination that there are differences can be inferred from the shifting of curves relative to one another along the x-axis). We speculate that these differences in binding affinity contribute to recognition specificity. The diverse cadherin family of homophilic and heterophilic cell surface proteins provides a classic example where this is the case. As with FLRTs and Unc5s, several members of the cadherin family exhibit similar levels of promiscuous homophilic and heterophilic binding in cultured cell-based assays but, when binding constants are determined using SPR or analytical ultra centrifugation, differences in binding affinity are observed which, in turn, mediate the sorting of cells into different tissues <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Katsamba et al., 2009</a>)."

Furthermore, in our stripe assays, FLRT2-expressing SACs and Drd4-GFP ooDSGCs did not respond to FLRT2 stripes. A recent study reported that FLRT homophilic binding is difficult to detect <i>in vitro</i> due to very low binding affinity and is highly sensitive to experimental conditions (<a href=\"#bib60\">Seiradake et al., 2014</a>). When measured using surface plasmon resonance, homophilic binding of FLRTs was below the sensitivity of detection (~100 \u03bcM) and, in SEC-MALS experiments, a minor increase in molecular weight (from ~70 kDa to ~80 kDa) was seen with increasing concentration, but no well-defined FLRT dimer fraction was observed. In addition, detection of FLRT-mediated homophilic cell aggregation required five days of continuous cell shaking, a time period considerably longer than standard protocols which typically monitor cell aggregation after shaking for 1\u22124 hours."

Mutations at this interface impaired tangential spread of pyramidal neurons between adjacent cortical columns <i>in vivo</i> which the authors interpreted as a resulting from a defect in attractive FLRT homophilic binding. Subsequent structural and biochemical studies by Lu et al. investigating interactions between FLRT and latrophilin, a cell surface adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor, demonstrated that, while the FLRT mutant exhibits a decrease in dimerization via size-exclusion gel filtration, binding of the FLRT mutant to latrophilin is completely abolished (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lu et al., 2015</a>). These findings, in addition to the authors' inability to detect FLRT homophilic binding between cells, led them to conclude that the FLRT homodimer likely occurs in <i>cis</i> and that the <i>in vivo</i> pyramidal neuron phenotype may be due to a defect in FLRT-latrophilin binding. In our stripe assays we observe subpopulations of primary retinal neurons that are attracted to FLRT1 and FLRT3 stripes. As latrophilins are expressed in the retina (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arcos-Burgos et al., 2010</a>)\u00a0(J.N.K., unpublished observations), it will be interesting to determine whether attraction of these neurons is mediated by FLRT interactions with neuronally-expressed latrohpilin or another yet-unidentified <i>trans</i> interaction partner."

These observations are consistent with a mechanism whereby binding of Unc5C ligand to FLRT2 receptor induces repulsive signaling in the FLRT2-expressing cell. Using a gain-of-function stripe assay, we found that FLRT2 expression is sufficient to elicit a repulsive response to Unc5C ligand. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that a bidirectional mechanism of repulsive signaling can occur whereby FLRT2-Unc5C interactions induce repulsion in both FLRT2- and Unc5C-expressing cells. A mechanism of bidirectional signaling has been well characterized between Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands (for review see <a href=\"#bib53\">Park and Lee, 2015</a>). Such a mechanism of Unc5C-FLRT2 mutual repulsion would provide an elegant and efficient molecular solution for directing laminar organization/restriction of both FLRT2- and Unc5C-expressing neurons into adjacent layers, S2/4 and S1/3/5, respectively, during development of the IPL. Our future studies will be aimed at identifying and characterizing the neuronal subtype(s) that arborizes in S1/3/5 and expresses Unc5C to determine whether they are repelled by FLRT2 and if they are necessary to ensure laminar restriction of SACs and ooDSGCs in S2/4. Furthermore, as additional subtypes that we have not yet characterized also express FLRT2, other neurons have the potential to utilize FLRT2 for laminar organization either through interactions with Unc5C or other FLRT2 binding partners."

By projecting to the same sublayer, circuit partners interact specifically with each other, facilitating appropriate synaptic partner choices. A striking example is the retinal circuit that detects image motion, the so-called direction-selective (DS) circuit, which comprises cofasciculated arbors of SACs and ooDSGCs stratified in IPL sublayers S2 and S4. Precise inhibitory connections from SACs onto DSGCs regulate DSGC firing in response to motion in particular directions, producing direction-selective responses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Demb, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wei and Feller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vaney et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Masland, 2012</a>). The mechanisms mediating the initial assembly of these IPL sublayers, or the co-recruitment of SAC and ooDSGC to those layers, are not known. The laminar choices of ON and OFF SACs are influenced by repulsive interactions between Plxn2 and Sema6A (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). However, in PlxnA2<sup>-/-</sup> and Sema6A<sup>-/-</sup>mutants, most SAC dendrites\u00a0still assemble in the correct sublamina and even when SACs make errors they still target to S2 or S4 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). This suggests that an additional molecular mechanism(s) functions in parallel to mediate precise laminar restriction of SACs. Here we show that SACs and at least one subset of ooDSGCs (the Drd4-GFP population) express FLRT2 and are repelled by Unc5C. We propose that these (and perhaps other) direction-selective circuit neurons become laminar-restricted in S2/4, and/or maintain their laminar restriction once formed, due to repulsive interactions with Unc5C expressed on neighboring neurites in S1/3/5. Definitive evidence that SACs and/or Drd4-GFP cells require FLRT2 and Unc5C for laminar targeting in S2/4 awaits genetic loss-of-function analyses. Nevertheless, our results suggest that evolution may have co-opted the same repulsive mechanism in both pre- and post-synaptic cells as a strategy for ensuring they both arborize in close spatial proximity to one another, thereby facilitating interactions between synaptic partners and limiting opportunities for inappropriate connections with neurons devoted to different visual processing tasks."

However, this study represents merely the tip of the iceberg. Our biochemical screen sampled only a small fraction of the recognition proteins present in a limited number of neuronal subtypes in the developing IPL. Here we present data that support a model for how a single receptor-ligand interaction contributes to the laminar organization of two subtypes of neurons. However, our ultimate goal is to understand lamination on a global scale. We are optimistic that combining 1) inclusive gene profiling data gathered from each of the ~70 different IPL neuronal subtypes (for which numerous more markers are now available) with 2) larger-scale biochemical screens aimed at identifying the entire IPL extracellular interactome, we can elaborate a comprehensive view of how laminar organization develops in the mouse IPL."

The technical aspects of the binding screen were modified from <a href=\"#bib76\">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</a> as follows: AP-tagged protein was used at 33 U/ul (where a unit [U] is equivalent to the activity of 10 pg of purified calf intestinal phosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce)) and Fc-tagged protein was used at 140 nM. This was necessary to convert the assay from one that tested <i>Drosophila</i> proteins expressed in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells to one that tests mammalian proteins produced in HEK293T cells.

After release peel from the casting master, 1.2 mm inlet and outlet holes were punched (Ted Pella Inc; Redding, CA) and devices were mounted feature side up on glass slides before wrapping in aluminum foil and autoclaving for 10 minutes.

Note that for expression in primary retinal neurons, the FLRT2-myc and Unc5C-FLAG transgenes were moved from pTT3 (vector used for cell aggregation assays) into the pUB vector, bearing the human Ubiquitin-C promoter. For reasons that are unclear to us, transfection of the pGreen vector gave rise to an ~10% transfection efficiency as determined by the number of Tuj1+/GFP+ vs Tuj1+/GFP- neurons but transfection with pTT3-FLRT2-myc yielded hardly any FLRT2-myc+ cells. When we moved the FLRT2-myc transgene into pUB, we obtained robust FLRT2-myc expression in ~10% of neurons.

Further, pairwise interactions defined in vitro may not reflect the situation in vivo should additional proteins be part of the functional protein complex.

Therefore, these claims appear overstated. The authors really need to examine IPL lamination in <i>Flrt2<sup>-/-</sup></i>and <i>Unc5C<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutant retinas, mutant mice that are available, to ask if FLRT+ SACs (see point 3) are repelled by Unc5C to modulate IPL lamination in vivo. It is recognized, however, that though these mutant mice are available, assessment of SAC lamination in these mutants likely falls outside of the revision timeframe <i>eLife</i> strives to achieve, and thus data from the KO mice are not required for the revision. However, if the authors have obtained these strains and have been able to investigate the phenotype, and the data validate the role suggested by the in vitro activities, it would greatly strengthen the paper and they are urged to submit these data."

To ask if this interaction is poised to guide lamination, as opposed to maintaining lamination established by other mechanisms, the authors should characterize the expression of FLRT2 and Unc5C at earlier developmental time points, when SACs and RGCs are first making decisions about neurite lamination neurites in the developing IPL. FLRT2 and Unc5C expression at P2 and P4, time points flanking SAC lamination in the IPL, should at the very least be examined. The authors reference the remaining FLRT and Unc5 expression patterns in the IPL as \"data not shown\" in the Discussion. These data should be included in the supplement to allow readers a comprehensive view of FLRT/Unc5 expression."

If retinal neurons cultured in the presence of anti-FLRT2 no longer avoid Unc5C stripes, and vice versa, this would strengthen the model that FLRT2 is indeed a receptor for repulsive signaling via Unc5C (and vice versa), as opposed to some other unidentified receptor for Unc5C. It is especially important to show that FLRT2 mediates the Unc5C repulsion, since the ectodomain of FLRTs can be shed."

Our first step was to find a transfection reagent and conditions that would allow efficient transfection of primary retinal neurons, something we had tried prior to our initial submission but were never successful in achieving. We pushed really hard, testing many different commercially-available transfection reagents and conditions and, while most were incapable of producing transfected neurons in our primary retinal neuron cultures, we eventually found one that gave us a 10% transfection efficiency making it possible to perform this experiment. However, while we could easily get GFP transfected neurons in our cultures (this is how we tested the various transfection reagents), we were unable to get FLRT-myc expressed (this was a problem specific to our neuronal cultures as FLRT2-myc expressed well in CHO.K1 cells). In the end, moving our FLRT2-myc transgene into a different expression vector (ironically, pUb from the Cepko lab) solved the problem (!) and we were able to get transgene expression and perform the gain-of-function experiment."

Using neurons harvested from Drd4-GFP mice (which label a subset of ooDSGCs), we found that Drd4-GFP neurons express FLRT2 protein and are repelled by Unc5C stripes. Thus, two members of the DS circuit, SACs and Drd4-GFP+ ooDSGCs exhibit identical growth responses to Unc5C in stripe assays. We were unable to determine the identity of the non-SAC cells in the INL, although their laminar position close to the IPL indicates they are an amacrine subtype.
