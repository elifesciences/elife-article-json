We thus sought to characterize behavioral trends of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, from the mid fourth larval stage through the mid young adult stage. We found that, outside of lethargus, animals exhibited abrupt switching between two distinct behavioral states: active wakefulness and quiet wakefulness. The durations of epochs of active wakefulness exhibited non-Poisson statistics. Increased G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling stabilized the active wakefulness state before, during and after lethargus. In contrast, decreased G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling, decreased neuropeptide release, or decreased CREB activity destabilized active wakefulness outside of, but not during, lethargus. Taken together, our findings support a model in which protein kinase A (PKA) stabilizes active wakefulness, at least in part through two of its downstream targets: neuropeptide release and CREB. However, during lethargus, when active wakefulness is strongly suppressed, the native role of PKA signaling in modulating locomotion and quiescence may be minor."

We thus sought to characterize behavioral trends of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, from the mid fourth larval stage through the mid young adult stage. We found that, outside of lethargus, animals exhibited abrupt switching between two distinct behavioral states: active wakefulness and quiet wakefulness. The durations of epochs of active wakefulness exhibited non-Poisson statistics. Increased G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling stabilized the active wakefulness state before, during and after lethargus. In contrast, decreased G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling, decreased neuropeptide release, or decreased CREB activity destabilized active wakefulness outside of, but not during, lethargus. Taken together, our findings support a model in which protein kinase A (PKA) stabilizes active wakefulness, at least in part through two of its downstream targets: neuropeptide release and CREB. However, during lethargus, when active wakefulness is strongly suppressed, the native role of PKA signaling in modulating locomotion and quiescence may be minor."

Each larval stage lasts 8\u201312 hr at 20\u00b0C, and under standard conditions, and ends with a molt, when epidermal cells synthesize a new cuticle and the old one is shed. Although <i>C. elegans</i> larvae are mostly continuously motile, each molt is accompanied by a 2\u20133 hr period of behavioral quiescence (<a href=\"#bib52\">Singh and Sulston, 1978</a>), referred to as \u2018lethargus\u2019. Thus, the larval stages can be divided into motile intermolt sub-stages (L1int\u2013L4int) and their corresponding lethargus sub-stages (L1leth-L4leth). However, behavior during distinct developmental sub-stages (<a href=\"#bib52\">Singh and Sulston, 1978</a>) has not previously been examined in detail.

The <i>gsa-1</i> gene encodes a G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> subunit, which activates the adenylyl cyclase ACY-1, and the GSA-1(G<sub>\u03b1s</sub>) pathway has been previously shown to affect locomotion. Activation ACY-1 by GSA-1 leads to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The binding of cAMP to the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit KIN-2 dissociates it from the inactive holoenzyme, releasing the PKA catalytic subunit, KIN-1. Increased PKA activity enhances signaling at the neuromuscular junction, as well as increases cAMP response element (CRE) mediated transcription in <i>C. elegans</i> neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kimura et al., 2002</a>). Thus, upregulating this signaling pathway has been reported to result in hyperkinetic phenotypes, typically described as a nonspecific increase in the rate of locomotion (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schade et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reynolds et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perez-Mansilla and Nurrish, 2009</a>), as well as in reduced quiescence during lethargus (<a href=\"#bib45\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belfer and Raizen, 2013</a>)."

We have analyzed the initiation, propagation and eventual demise of individual dorsoventral body bends over a 14-hr period, from the mid-L4int stage to the mid-young-adult stage. We found that some locomotion patterns undergo a gradual modulation, while others display abrupt switching. In particular, two behavioral states, active wakefulness and quiet wakefulness, were observed during the mid- to late- L4int stage. Active wakefulness was dominated by forward locomotion (propagation of body-bends from the anterior to the posterior), but included intervals of backward locomotion and \u2018dwelling\u2019 (non-directional dynamics of body bends). In contrast, quiet wakefulness was dominated by dwelling behavior, although it included intervals of directed locomotion. In individual animals, active wakefulness was observed to persist for epochs of 1\u2013100 min. Moreover, the switching between active and quiet wakefulness was abrupt, suggesting that they are distinct behavioral states. The process underlying these states exhibited the signature of ergodicity breaking, characteristic of a scale-free switch, as opposed to having a simple rate constant that governs the dynamics of switching. We further show that the transitions between behavioral states were regulated by the GSA-1(G<sub>\u03b1s</sub>) pathway: increased G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling stabilized the active wakefulness state both within and outside of lethargus, while decreased G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling destabilized this state, but only outside of lethargus."

The function we used for processing a single frame was limited to tracking a single animal. However, the modular design of PyCelegans can accommodate multi-animal tracking once an appropriate substitute for this function is implemented, without further changes. The rate of data capture for recording throughout a larval developmental stage at a sufficiently high temporal resolution can exceed 3,000,000 images per day. For a dataset of this magnitude, the required post-processing is the rate-limiting step of the experiment. Using PyCelegans, the rate-limiting component of the analysis scaled linearly with the number of available processing-cores. By using 256 cores we achieved a speed-up of two orders of magnitude relative to previous implementations. For proof of principle, analyses have been run on up to 1024 processors. The number of processors that could be utilized, for example, from publically available clusters, is in the tens of thousands for a single dataset."

Tertiary properties can then be computed from the resulting raw data. Our analysis of posture and locomotion was based on dividing the midline of the body of each animal into 20 segments and measuring the local angles between them (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). This method extended previous analyses based on body curvature as a function of time and body coordinate (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vidal-Gadea et al., 2011</a>): we tagged individual body-bends, followed them from initiation to eventual demise, and recorded their origin, velocity, amplitude, and life-time. The identification of the midlines and individual body-bends enabled measurements of local properties as a function of the body-coordinate (e.g., quiescence of individual body-segments, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), as well as global behavioral patterns such as mean curvature and growth rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) or modes of locomotion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). For instance, a 2% growth of body-length per hour was observed outside of lethargus, but during lethargus a 5% shortening of the body-length was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This shortening may be due to continuous growth in body-volume at a period where adding surface area to the (old) cuticle was restricted. PyCelegans enabled us to conduct such high-resolution measurements over extended periods for the first time."

It was thus possible that different body regions would exhibit distinct temporal dynamics of quiescence. To identify such patterns, we divided the midline of the animal to 20 equi-length segments, and quantified the fraction of time spent in quiescence by the individual angles between pairs of segments, during the period from mid L4int to the mid young adult stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). While an abrupt increase in the fraction of quiescence at the onset of lethargus occurred in all of the individual body-regions, most of them exhibited elevated quiescence during the preceding 2-hr period. Interestingly, the most anterior region was the least quiescent throughout the measurement. Subsequent regions exhibited successively increasing quiescence, with the mid-body being the most quiescent. As a result of this ordering, the temporal dynamics of quiescence of the entire animal mirrored that of the head/neck region. We thus concluded that the activity of the head/neck motoneuron circuits determined the outcome of previously reported measurements of whole-animal quiescence (<a href=\"#bib45\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Singh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bringmann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Iwanir et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belfer and Raizen, 2013</a>)."

To identify such phenomena, we focused on four categories of locomotion behavior: forward and backward locomotion were defined by the appropriate directional propagation of body-bends along the anterior-posterior axis, dwelling was defined as non-directional propagation of body-bends, and quiescence was defined as sub-threshold changes in body angles (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Aligning behavioral data by the onset of lethargus for each 10 hr measurement and averaging between animals, we observed a decrease in the percentage of time spent in forward locomotion during the 4 hr preceding L4leth and a corresponding increase in the percentage of time spent in dwelling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). During the first 1\u20132 hr following L4leth termination, wild-type behavior was characterized by a high, decreasing fraction of dwelling, and a low, increasing fraction of forward locomotion.

In addition, the propagation velocity of anterior-to-posterior body-bends and the frequency of generation of bends were gradually downregulated during late L4int, and upregulated during the early young adult stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Although the frequency of bend generation was naturally limited by how quickly bends propagated away from their point of origin, there was no a priori restriction on how low this frequency could be.

Since hyper-activation of PKA could bypass the requirement for UNC-31 in the docking of dense core vesicles (DCVs), the GSA-1(G<sub>\u03b1s</sub>) and the UNC-31/CAPS pathways were suggested to converge to control DCV release (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schade et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reynolds et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Charlie et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perez-Mansilla and Nurrish, 2009</a>). We could not analyze the behavior of <i>unc-13</i> mutants due to their severe locomotion defects, but in order to assess whether the modulation of locomotion during L4int depended on the release of DCVs, we assayed <i>unc-31</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The resulting phenotype was similar to that of <i>acy-1(lf)</i> mutants. As compared to wild-type animals, outside of lethargus <i>unc-31</i> mutants exhibited increased occupation of the quiet wakefulness state, a fragmented active wakefulness state, and overall lower velocities. In contrast, during L4leth, the dynamics of quiescence and locomotion of <i>unc-31</i> mutants were similar to wild-type. Unlike <i>acy-1(lf)</i> mutants, the mutation in the <i>unc-31</i> gene resulted in elevated levels of backward locomotion outside of lethargus and a decrease in directed locomotion during motion bouts in lethargus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7 and 8</a>). Taken together with the <i>acy-1(lf)</i> phenotype, these results support a model in which PKA activity stabilizes active wakefulness during L4int (at least in part) by regulating DCV exocytosis, but only plays a minor role in regulating locomotion during lethargus."

To address this question, we assayed <i>crh-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Outside of lethargus, <i>crh-1</i> mutants exhibited more poorly-defined global locomotion states, although a clear active wakefulness state was observed in 4 out of 16 animals 5\u20136 hr prior to L4leth. Gradual transitions between directed locomotion and dwelling were commonly observed during this period, in contrast to the abrupt wild-type switching. In addition, the mutants exhibited lower overall velocities and increased backward locomotion. During L4leth, the dynamics of quiescence of <i>crh-1</i> mutants were similar to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>).

However, to the best of our knowledge, quiet wakefulness was not previously reported in nematodes. During its larval development the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> is required to integrate newly differentiated neurons into its neural circuits (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sulston, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>) and to reshape the connections of existing cells (<a href=\"#bib70\">White et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Thomas et al., 1990</a>). At the same time, the animal grows, develops new organs, and undergoes four molts. Maintaining the functionality of essential motor programs such as feeding, locomotion and defecation concurrently with these anatomical and physiological changes imposes constraints on the developing animal; modulation of behavioral patterns may contribute towards satisfying these constraints. In particular, 2\u20134 hr prior to lethargus, the seam cells exhibit increased synthetic activity and begin to deposit the new cuticle (<a href=\"#bib52\">Singh and Sulston, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Monsalve et al., 2011</a>).

The distribution of durations of the epochs of active wakefulness supported a model in which this state was actively stabilized and ergodicity was weakly broken (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stefani et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burov et al., 2010</a>). We note that the global locomotion states that we report are distinct from the cGMP-dependent short intervals of continuous roaming or dwelling behavior, previously described in adults (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fujiwara et al., 2002</a>). We have shown that upregulating or downregulating G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling stabilized or destabilized active wakefulness respectively. Downregulated neuropeptide release in <i>unc-31</i> mutants, a gene encoding the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS) required for the priming and docking of DCVs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Speese et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lin et al., 2010</a>), affected behavior similarly to downregulated G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling. These findings extend the previously reported effects of PKA signaling on locomotion and quiescence (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schade et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reynolds et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Charlie et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Raizen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perez-Mansilla and Nurrish, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Belfer and Raizen, 2013</a>). Moreover, PKA was shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of tomosyn, a highly-conserved syntaxin-binding protein. Phosphorylation of tomosyn by PKA reduced its interaction with syntaxin and enhanced the formation of the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baba et al., 2005</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, tomosyn (TOM-1) was shown to negatively regulate synaptic transmitter release and UNC-31/CAPS-dependent neuropeptide release (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gracheva et al., 2007a</a>), and KIN-1 alleviated the suppression of both processes by phosphorylating TOM-1 (J Richmond, personal communications, February 2013). Interestingly, a mutation in the <i>tom-1</i> gene suppressed behavioral deficits and DCV accumulation in <i>unc-31</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gracheva et al., 2007a</a>). Similarly, enhanced PKA activity was shown to be sufficient for bypassing the requirement for UNC-31 for the release of DCVs (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Perez-Mansilla and Nurrish, 2009</a>). Taken together, these findings support a model in which KIN-1 and TOM-1 regulate locomotion."

These results were also consistent with a previous observation that acute activation of the photoactivated adenylyl cyclase PAC\u03b1 in cholinergic neurons evoked an enhanced activity response (<a href=\"#bib68\">Weissenberger et al., 2011</a>). Downregulating G<sub>\u03b1s</sub> signaling resulted in a clear locomotion phenotype outside of but not during L4leth. However, loss of CREB function resulted in an enhancement of directed locomotion, as well as changes in the dynamics of bouts of motion and quiescence (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>), during lethargus. In addition, <i>crh-1</i> mutants exhibited strong locomotion defects outside of lethargus. Studies of the effects of cAMP signaling on sleep in <i>D. melanogaster</i> and in mice have demonstrated that CREB, when activated by PKA, promotes the duration of wakefulness (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hendricks et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Graves et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shaw and Franken, 2003</a>). The mild loss of function phenotypes of <i>acy-1(lf)</i> and <i>unc-31</i> during lethargus may be explained by a floor effect, while the implications of the <i>crh-1</i> phenotype remain to be understood. Interestingly, a recent study reported that adenylyl cyclase activity increases the intensity of nighttime sleep in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">van Alphen et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, our analyses indicated that both PKA-dependent pathways acted in concert to regulate active wakefulness during L4int and the early young adult stages."

Visible phenotypes were invaluable for uncovering molecular pathways that regulated behavior, but were largely based on crude classifications such as hypo- or hyper-kinesis or a focus on arbitrarily defined features. It was recently shown that the space of shapes adopted by the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> is low dimensional, and that these dimensions (\u2018eigenworms\u2019) can provide a quantitative description of behavior (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stephens et al., 2008</a>). This exquisitely sensitive analysis revealed the underlying simplicity of complex locomotion dynamics as well as subtle behavioral phenotypes that had been previously undetectable (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stephens et al., 2010</a>,<a href=\"#bib59\"> 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2013</a>). However, this analysis does not provide an intuitive interpretation of the detected phenotypes that may directly relate to the underlying neuronal activity. Tracking of individual body-bends opens the door to a heuristic description of <i>C. elegans</i> locomotion, composed of intuitive building blocks. As in the case of the eigenworms, one underlying assumption of this analysis is that <i>C. elegans</i> does not maintain a \u2018mental map\u2019 of its environment, nor does it keep track of its own acceleration in the laboratory frame of reference. Rather, it responds to external and internal cues solely by altering its own body-posture. Specifically, the primary task of the motor neurons during directional motion is to generate body-bends and propagate them along the body in the appropriate direction (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stetina et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stephens et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Haspel and O\u2019Donovan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boyle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wen et al., 2012</a>). It follows that a natural, heuristic model for describing directional locomotion can be constructed using the rates of generation, propagation, and decay of body-bends. Tracking each body-bend from initiation to eventual demise thus provides direct experimental measurements of the basic building blocks of nematode locomotion."

The parallel worm tracker is geared towards analyzing many worms in parallel, and while it does not analyze worm posture, but rather movement of the center-of-mass, it can still be used to define forward and backward locomotion (or turns), as well as quiescence. It can be used to analyze single animals, or probably also a reasonable number of worms in parallel (to speed up the process). The system is using freely available Matlab code and requires only a comparatively simple video camera. Alternatively, if the authors have access to such a system, the tracking system used by Stirman et al (Nature Methods, 2011), can analyze behavior including body posture and forward as well as backward locomotion</i>."
