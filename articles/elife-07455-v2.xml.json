In this study, we explored the role of the mechanical properties of the underlying matrix in the regulation of CM maturation. We show that rat and mouse neonatal CMs cultured on rigid surfaces exhibited increased myofibrillar organization, spread morphology, and reduced cell cycle activity. In contrast, compliant elastic matrices induced features of CM dedifferentiation, including a disorganized sarcomere network, rounding, and conspicuous cell-cycle re-entry. The rigid matrix facilitated nuclear division (karyokinesis) leading to binucleation, while compliant matrices promoted CM mitotic rounding and cell division (cytokinesis), associated with loss of differentiation markers. Moreover, the compliant matrix potentiated clonal expansion of CMs that involves multiple cell divisions. Thus, the compliant microenvironment facilitates CM dedifferentiation and proliferation via its effect on the organization of the myoskeleton. Our findings may be exploited to design new cardiac regenerative approaches."

In this study, we explored the role of the mechanical properties of the underlying matrix in the regulation of CM maturation. We show that rat and mouse neonatal CMs cultured on rigid surfaces exhibited increased myofibrillar organization, spread morphology, and reduced cell cycle activity. In contrast, compliant elastic matrices induced features of CM dedifferentiation, including a disorganized sarcomere network, rounding, and conspicuous cell-cycle re-entry. The rigid matrix facilitated nuclear division (karyokinesis) leading to binucleation, while compliant matrices promoted CM mitotic rounding and cell division (cytokinesis), associated with loss of differentiation markers. Moreover, the compliant matrix potentiated clonal expansion of CMs that involves multiple cell divisions. Thus, the compliant microenvironment facilitates CM dedifferentiation and proliferation via its effect on the organization of the myoskeleton. Our findings may be exploited to design new cardiac regenerative approaches."

However, because the cells can no longer divide, the body is unable to replace heart muscle cells that are damaged by a heart attack or other illness. This lack of ability to regenerate heart muscle is a major challenge for medicine. While researchers have documented many of the changes that occur in heart muscle cells (known as cardiomyocytes) after birth, it is not known exactly what triggers these changes."

This process is accompanied by multiple, highly synchronized cellular changes. The expression of cell-cycle and embryonic markers falls precipitously in CMs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Walsh et al., 2010</a>), while the expression of CM differentiation genes increases, along with the appearance of sarcomeres, contractile units that undergo cross-striation to form a functional myoskeletal system within CMs. Further, mechanical and electrical cell-to-cell communication between CMs is established via intercalated discs, containing gap junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Noorman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sheikh et al., 2009</a>). In parallel, up-regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, as well as increased cross-linking of matrix proteins, also occurs postnatally, leading to an overall stiffening of the heart tissue (<a href=\"#bib20\">Janmey and Miller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Swift et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Majkut et al., 2014</a>).

Following this logic, we tested here the hypothesis that the decline in CM proliferative and regenerative capacities can be attributed to changes in the mechanical properties of the pericellular environment, which facilitate the assembly of a tightly organized myoskeletal structure. We hypothesize that matrix stiffening, which occurs in the heart after birth, and even more so following MI, is part of a mechanism that blocks CM cell cycle activity."

In contrast, a rigid matrix facilitates CM differentiation, characterized by tightly packed arrays of long and aligned sarcomeric bundles, cell cycle arrest, and binucleation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that matrix rigidity specifically affects CM cytokinesis, but not karyokinesis. We next demonstrated that disruption of the highly organized architecture of the CM myoskeleton, using the myosin-II inhibitor blebbistatin, induced CM cell cycle re-entry. We suggest that the mechanical properties of the postnatal heart play a key role in the acquisition of the fully differentiated phenotype, and inhibition of the specialized contractile system in CMs could be used to promote CM dedifferentiation."

Proliferating CMs were observed on all tested matrices (Ki67+/cTnT+, and PH3+/MHC+) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>, respectively). CMs cultured on either glass or on the stiff (2 MPa) substrate presented similar proliferative capacities (data not shown). However, CM proliferation was increased on the compliant substrates (5 kPa and 20 kPa) by \u223c50\u201365%, respectively, relative to the rigid substrate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, visualized with Ki67), and by \u223c25\u2013110% on the 5 kPa and 20 kPa substrates, respectively, marked by PH3+ MHC+ CMs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that myoskeletal disassembly, a tendency toward cell rounding, and increased CM proliferation are more compatible with compliant matrices, in comparison with the rigid matrix."

As in rat CMs, mouse neonatal CMs grew on all substrates, and developed normal beating within 48\u201372 hr after seeding. We quantified the percentage of proliferating Ki67+ cTnT+ CMs, and observed that both the 5 kPa and 20 kPa substrates facilitated CM proliferation by \u223c30\u201350%, respectively, relative to the rigid 2 MPa substrate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>). There was no significant difference in the area of cells plated on the different substrates (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similar to the rat system, CMs cultured on the rigid substrate were elongated and more polarized, compared to those on the compliant substrates (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A decrease in CM cell perimeter, indicative of roundness, was observed on the compliant substrates, compared to the rigid one (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Hence, compliant substrates promote CM proliferation as well as alterations in CM cell shape, in both rat and mouse neonatal cultures."

In order to explore the effects of matrix rigidity on CM cell division and the formation of new CMs, we established a live-cell imaging system of CMs derived from transgenic mice expressing the R26R-tdTomato reporter under the regulation of the <i>Myh6</i> promoter (<i>Myh6-Cre;R26R-tdTomato-lox)</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Live-cell video microscopy revealed two distinct CM cell-cycle phenotypes: karyokinesis followed by binucleation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), as opposed to karyokinesis followed by cytokinesis, resulting in the formation of two new CMs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In the first, CMs were relatively large, spread, and immotile (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>: 50\u2032, 60\u2032). These CMs underwent karyokinesis, leading to the formation of binucleated CMs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>: 50\u2032, 60\u2032), while remaining well spread and attached to the substrate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Strikingly, we found that compliant matrices did not affect nuclear cell division (karyokinesis), yet promoted cytokinesis and inhibited CM binucleation prominence, as determined by quantification of the division frequency, observed by live-cell imaging (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>)."

A significant increase in the number of newly formed CMs was observed on the 20 kPa substrate, relative to the rigid 2 MPa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Interestingly, we could observe rare events of cytokinesis even in binucleated CMs cultured on the 20 kPa substrate, resulting in two daughter CMs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). These successful events were also accompanied by mitotic rounding (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that culturing CMs on compliant matrices facilitate CM cell rounding and division (cytokinesis) that lead to formation of new CMs. In contrast, our results demonstrated that the rigid matrix promotes karyokinesis without cytokinesis, leading to CM binucleation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

We therefore tested whether inhibition of the CM myoskeleton function could boost CM proliferation. For that purpose, we used blebbistatin, a small molecule myosin II inhibitor that effectively blocks the actin-myosin interaction in several striated muscle (including CMs), in smooth muscle, and in non-muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dou et al., 2007</a>). Neonatal mouse CMs were cultured on PDMS substrates with the different rigidities, left to adhere for 72 hr, and then treated with 20 \u00b5M blebbistatin for 24 hr. After 24 hr of treatment, we fixed the cells and immunostained them for cTnT and Ki67. We found that blebbistatin severely disrupted CM myoskeleton morphology, leading to massive changes in CM cell shape, manifested by major flattening, dramatic fragmentation of the sarcomeric arrays, and complete loss of striations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>)."

This analysis indicated that blebbistatin-treated CMs display higher cell cycle activity compared to control (untreated) CMs on the 2 MPa and 20 kPa rigidities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Hence, we conclude that relaxation of the acto-myosin myoskelton in CMs by blebbistatin promotes cell cycle re-entry. The lack of blebbistatin effect on the 5 kPa substrate is consistent with the relaxed CM morphology induced by the 5 kPa substrate in the absence of blebbistatin. Taken together, these results suggest that complaint matrices promote CM proliferation primarily via their effect on myoskeletal organization."

Notably, most studies that address the impact of rigidity on cell fate decisions have focused on the differentiation processes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Engler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jacot et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bajaj et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bhana et al., 2010</a>). The terminology and characteristics of the reverse process are much less clear, but generally refer to the shift from a differentiated to a less-differentiated cellular stage within the same lineage (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jopling et al., 2011</a>). Here, we show that neonatal CMs cultured on compliant (compared to rigid) 2D matrices lose several key manifestations commonly associated with postnatal cardiac muscle differentiation in vivo, such as robust, well-aligned myoskeletel organization, expression of differentiation genes, and cell cycle arrest. Hence, we conclude that compliant substrates promote CM dedifferentiation and proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In line with these findings, we demonstrated that dedifferentiated CMs were able to undergo clonal expansion, which involves multiple cell divisions, suggesting a shift to a progenitor cell state."

Rigid substrates maintain the differentiated state of CMs, which is incompatible with cytokinesis. Blocked cytokinesis leads to binucleated CMs. A mitotic checkpoint determines the ability of CMs to re-enter the cell cycle. Compliant substrates control a second checkpoint, mechanical in nature, which enables cytokinesis. Compliant substrates induce CM dedifferentiation into a less organized, immature and proliferative state. This state involves cytoskeletal disarrangements leading to CM mitotic rounding, thus enabling cell division."

Ultimately, this physiological transition leads to an accumulation of binucleated CMs, correlating with the transition from embryonic hyperplastic growth of CMs, to postnatal hypertrophic growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Consistent with this, we show high polarity and organization of triangular CMs on rigid substrates, as opposed to low polarity, roundness, and disorganized sarcomeres on compliant substrates. Eukaryotic cell division requires cellular and cytoskeletal remodeling: cells become round and spherical upon entering mitosis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heng and Koh, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lancaster et al., 2013</a>). This mitotic rounding is, to some extent, considered a hallmark of cell division, and the interplay between the actin cytoskeleton, cell shape, and the developing mitotic spindle are all involved in this rounding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cadart et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lancaster and Baum, 2014</a>).

We show an increase in Ki67-expressing CMs in the presence of blebbistatin on the 2 MPa and 20 kPa rigidities. Blebbistatin treatment strongly perturbed CM myoskeletal organization and consequently induced CM cell cycle activity, suggesting that the development of a robust myoskeleton in CMs is linked to their cell cycle arrest. We suggest that compliant matrices promote CM proliferation primarily via their effect on the organization of the myoskeleton. More broadly, we propose that the rigid matrix increases the forces imposed on the CMs' actin myoskeleton and this facilitates CM differentiation, while inhibition of sarcomeric organization, function and contractility by blebbistatin has the opposite effect, eventually, leading to CM dedifferentiation. That said, it was previously shown that long blebbistatin treatment inhibits cell division, leading to generation of polyploid megakaryocytes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shin et al., 2011</a>). Polyploidity and binucleation are natural outcomes of postnatal CM proliferation events (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</a>).

We observed rare events of binucleated CMs attempting to divide, though most remain binucleated. However, the few successful division events were facilitated by growth on the 20 kPa matrix, further supporting the notion that CM can respond to matrix rigidity. Interestingly, transgenic expression of a constitutively active (ca) form of ErbB2 in mouse CMs during the neonatal and adult periods could stimulate CM division, expanding the postnatal proliferative and regenerative windows into adulthood. Stimulation of CM division by caErbB2 involved both CM dedifferentiation, and hypertrophy leading to cardiomegaly. In line with the observed dedifferentiation phenotype, caErbB2 signaling promoted proliferation of mono- and bi-nucleated CMs (<a href=\"#bib10\">D'Uva et al., 2015</a>)."

Specifically, we explored whether disruption of the highly organized architecture of the CM myoskeleton would induce cell cycle reentry. Towards that end, we used the methodology employed by Shin and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shin et al., 2011</a>), by culturing 1-day-old neonatal CMs on substrates of varying rigidities (2MPa, 20kPa, 5kPa), allowing them to adhere to the substrate for 72h, and then treating them with 20\u00b5M blebbistatin for 24 hours. We then fixed the cells and immunostained them for cTnT and Ki67. We found that blebbistatin severely disrupts the CM myoskeleton, leading to massive disorganization in the sarcomeric system. Blebbistatin treatment further induced a major shift in CM cell shape, manifested by major flattening, dramatic fragmentation of the sarcomeric arrays, and nearly complete loss of striations (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Taken together, our results indicate that blebbistatin treatment results in severe disorganization of contractile myofilaments in CMs (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

This analysis indicated that blebbistatin-treated CMs display higher cell cycle activity compared with control (untreated CMs) on the 2MPa and 20kPa rigidities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).
