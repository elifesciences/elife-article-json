How does the recombination machinery inside cells bring together and align a short stretch of single-stranded DNA with an identical sequence of double-stranded DNA located within a genome that is comprised of millions or even billions of base pairs? Writing in <i>eLife</i>, researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign present evidence to suggest that a protein called RecA can help the single-stranded DNA slide along the double-stranded DNA until the molecules are properly aligned (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ragunathan et al., 2012</a>)."

During homologous recombination, RecA binds to the single-stranded DNA that is generated at the double-strand break and forms a complex known as the pre-synaptic filament. This complex must somehow then survey the genome to find a matching double-stranded DNA partner through a process referred to as the \u2018homology search\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Once homologous DNA is found and the sequences are aligned, the pre-synaptic filament invades the duplex, ultimately allowing the DNA break to be repaired using the homologous DNA as a template to ensure fidelity."

It initially binds to the dsDNA through 3D diffusion (<b>A</b>), and then slides back and forth along the dsDNA as it search for the sequence (<b>B</b>).

And earlier this year, researchers at UC Davis reported the results of single-molecule experiments which showed that the pre-synaptic filament was able to locate regions of homology when the duplex DNA was allowed to relax: however, the search was inhibited when the duplex DNA was stretched out (<a href=\"#bib4\">Forget and Kowalczykowski, 2012</a>). These experiments convincingly demonstrated that intersegmental transfer does in fact contribute to the homology search, and that the pre-synaptic filament can simultaneously sample and move between different regions of double-stranded DNA that are far apart from one another. But this is not the end of the story."

Single-molecule FRET is basically a \u2018molecular ruler\u2019 that can measure the distance between two different molecules if each is labelled with a small dye molecule that emits fluorescent light. In particular, it can measure very small changes in distance, on the order of just one billionth of a metre, so it offers much higher spatial resolution than has been achieved previously."

The FRET signals fluctuated up and down, indicating that the pre-synaptic filaments were bound to the double-stranded DNA, and also revealing that the distance between the ends of the molecules was rapidly changing. By varying the length of the single-stranded DNA, Ragunathan, Liu and Ha determined that these fluctuations were caused by the pre-synaptic filament sliding along the double-stranded DNA fragments."

This allowed them to determine exactly how they were aligned at any given instant. As anticipated, they observed that the DNA molecules were aligned at one or other of the two homologous locations but, surprisingly, the Illinois team was also able to detect transitions between the two locations. Careful analysis of these transitions revealed that the pre-synaptic filaments could shuttle back and forth between the two regions of homology by sliding along the double-stranded DNA."

However, the two mechanisms are not incompatible, and it seems likely that both of these search modes are involved in homologous recombination. One possibility is that intersegmental transfer allows the pre-synaptic filament to sample different regions of double-stranded DNA over long distances, whereas 1D sliding is used for searching over much shorter distances (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

However, many important questions remain unanswered. For instance, how does the pre-synaptic filament actually sample the sequence of the double-stranded DNA to identify regions of homology? What are the relative contributions of 1D sliding and intersegmental transfer? How often must the pre-synaptic filament sample a region of homology before successful alignment can take place? Will eukaryotic proteins use similar mechanisms to align DNA sequences? How do the other proteins that are involved in homologous recombination influence the search for homology? And last but not least, how are searches for matching sequences carried out in the more complex physiological settings found in living cells? State-of-the-art single-molecule imaging technologies, such as those used by the Illinois team, are ready to start answering some of these questions."
