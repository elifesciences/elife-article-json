There is intense competition for publication in high-impact-factor journals, frequently resulting in multiple rounds of review and revision; and if the manuscript is ultimately rejected, the whole depressing cycle is often repeated at a new journal. The resultant delays in the communication of new findings hinder scientific progress and waste limited resources. The focus on publication in a high-impact-factor journal as the prize also distracts attention from other important responsibilities of researchers\u2014such as teaching, mentoring and a host of other activities (including the review of manuscripts for journals!). For the sake of science, the emphasis needs to change."

However, deans and heads of departments send out a different message, saying that letters of recommendation hold more sway than impact factors in promotion and tenure decisions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Zare, 2012</a>). Moreover, some research funders (including the <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTD002766.htm\">Wellcome Trust</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUKOpenAccessPolicy.pdf\">Research Councils UK</a>) now stress that assessments of funding applications should focus on the merits of the work proposed rather than the journals (and therefore their impact factors) in which an applicant has published. Similarly, researchers on the sub-panels assessing the quality of research in higher education institutions in the UK as part of the <a href=\"http://www.ref.ac.uk/faq/all/\">Research Excellence Framework</a> (REF) have been told: \u2018No sub-panel will make any use of journal impact factors, rankings, lists or the perceived standing of publishers in assessing the quality of research outputs\u2019. However, there is evidence that some universities are making use of journal impact factors when selecting the papers that will be included in their submission to the REF (<a href=\"#bib5\">Rohn, 2012</a>). And, it remains sadly true that at many institutions in countries where the internal resources may be inadequate to give proper consideration to expert letters and thoroughly review a candidate\u2019s published work, the impact factor remains a convenient crutch on which to base an imperfect evaluation of merit."

PLOS have been pioneers in this area and, since 2009, have been providing a rich array of <a href=\"http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/\">metrics</a> on every article published. Using these approaches, assessment can be further extended to a broader array of research outputs, via services that support the deposition of outputs other than full articles, such as Dryad (for datasets), Figshare (for the results of individual experiments, figures, datasets), and Slideshare (for presentations). The emergence of new services, such as Altmetric, Impact Story and Plum Analytics, which aggregate media coverage, citation numbers, social web metrics and so on of individual research outputs, will also provide authors with a more complete picture of the impact of their research."

Recommendations are proposed for all of the key constituencies involved\u2013researchers, publishers, institutions and funders\u2013because it will take commitment and persistence across these groups if we are to reform current practices."

Instead, we will continue to support a vision for research assessment that relies on a range of transparent evidence\u2013qualitative as well as quantitative\u2013about the specific impacts and outcomes of a collection of relevant research outputs. In this way, the concept of research impact can be expanded and enriched rather than reduced to a single number or a journal name."

Authors can choose their preferred venue based on service, cost and reputation in their field. All constituencies will then benefit from a deeper understanding of the significance and influence of our collective investment in research, and ultimately a more effective system of research communication."
