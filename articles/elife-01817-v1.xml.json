                    "text": "Gastrulation generates three layers of cells (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) from a single sheet, while large scale cell movements occur across the entire embryo. In amniote (reptiles, birds, mammals) embryos, the deep layers arise by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at a morphologically stable midline structure, the primitive streak (PS). We know very little about how these events are controlled or how the PS is maintained despite its continuously changing cellular composition. Using the chick, we show that isolated EMT events and ingression of individual cells start well before gastrulation. A Nodal-dependent \u2018community effect\u2019 then concentrates and amplifies EMT by positive feedback to form the PS as a zone of massive cell ingression. Computer simulations show that a combination of local cell interactions (EMT and cell intercalation) is sufficient to explain PS formation and the associated complex movements globally across a large epithelial sheet, without the need to invoke long-range signalling."

In amniote (reptiles, birds, mammals) embryos, the deep layers arise by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at a morphologically stable midline structure, the primitive streak (PS). We know very little about how these events are controlled or how the PS is maintained despite its continuously changing cellular composition. Using the chick, we show that isolated EMT events and ingression of individual cells start well before gastrulation. A Nodal-dependent \u2018community effect\u2019 then concentrates and amplifies EMT by positive feedback to form the PS as a zone of massive cell ingression. Computer simulations show that a combination of local cell interactions (EMT and cell intercalation) is sufficient to explain PS formation and the associated complex movements globally across a large epithelial sheet, without the need to invoke long-range signalling."

The cells of the epiblast then move to form the mesoderm and endoderm (in a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition). These cell movements also lead to the formation of a structure called the primitive streak that establishes the left-right symmetry of the organism, and also defines the midline of the body."

One involves cells inserting themselves between other cells at the midline of the epiblast, which causes a double whorl-like movement within the plane of the epiblast. At the same time small numbers of cells leave the epiblast, and as these cells accumulate under the epiblast, they initiate a positive feedback effect by which they encourage more cells to leave the epiblast. Voiculescu et al. found that this \u2018community effect\u2019 involves signalling by a protein called Nodal. This protein effectively amplifies the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and leads to the appearance of the primitive streak at the midline."

In the chick, the 50,000 or so cells that comprise the embryonic epiblast (area pellucida, 3\u20135 mm in diameter) move as two bilaterally symmetrical whorls, known as the \u2018Polonaise\u2019 pattern (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gr\u00e4per, 1929</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wetzel, 1929</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, stage EGK XI-XIV). The movements continue for 8\u201310 hr, culminating in the formation of a stable morphological structure in the posterior midline, the primitive streak (PS) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, stage HH2). Stage HH2 is very brief, as the PS then quickly narrows and elongates along the midline of the embryo, reaching about 2/3 of the diameter of the area pellucida in a further 8\u201310 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, stages HH3 and 3<sup>+</sup>). Once the PS forms, cells in the epiblast lateral to the PS start moving directly into it along trajectories perpendicular to its axis (for reviews see <a href=\"#bib45\">Spratt, 1946</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nicolet, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bellairs, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stern, 2004b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, stages HH3-3<sup>+</sup>). The PS acts as a gateway for gastrulation as epiblast cells internalize via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nieto, 2011</a>) and generate mesoderm and endoderm beneath the epiblast layer. At present we do not understand the cellular or molecular mechanisms of any of these events, nor do we know whether they are controlled separately or represent the manifestation of a single underlying process."

One type of model invokes long-range, diffusible chemotactic attractants or repellents emanating from various parts of the embryo, to which epiblast cells respond as individuals. For example, (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vasiev et al., 2010</a>) suggested that the tip of the PS produces repellents for cells in the rest of the epiblast, while (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sandersius et al., 2011</a>) proposed that the PS acts as a \u2018chemotactic dipole\u2019, secreting repellents at the tip and attractors at the base, to which epiblast cells respond. Differential adhesion between cells destined to ingress and the rest of the epiblast is also invoked by some models (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vasiev et al., 2010</a>). All of these models are complicated by the fact that the extracellular matrix, presumed to be the substrate over which the epiblast moves, is secreted by both epiblast and underlying hypoblast and actually moves along with the cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harrisson et al., 1985a</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Harrisson et al., 1985b</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zamir et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zamir et al., 2008</a>). Some models do not envision the extracellular matrix as a substrate for cell movements. One of these (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wei and Mikawa, 2000</a>) focused on streak elongation, proposing that oriented cell division could drive this process. Another class of mechanism involves epithelial intercalation of epiblast cells at right angles to the future midline in the presumptive domain of the PS, which is initially located along the posterior edge of the epiblast: this could drive the elongation of this domain and may also contribute to the Polonaise movements (<a href=\"#bib61\">Voiculescu et al., 2007</a>). However none of these models is sufficient to account for all four major movements of chick gastrulation: the Polonaise of the early epiblast, the elongation of the PS, the movement of epiblast cells towards the streak and their ingression through the streak (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To date, only a very complex combination of various unrelated mechanisms, involving oriented cell division in the streak, secretion of signals by the streak that repel its tip (\u2018mechanism M3\u2019 of <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasiev et al. (2010)</a>), induced cell polarization of the epiblast and differential adhesion of the prospective mesendoderm to neighbouring cells (\u2018mechanism 11\u2019 of Table 1 in <a href=\"#bib60\">Vasiev et al. (2010)</a>), has come close to delivering the full repetoire of key movement patterns."

One of these is how the PS is maintained as a morphologically stable structure despite the fact that cells are continuously moving into and out of it. We know very little about the dynamics of EMT for individual cells, how collective EMT arises and how the PS is maintained as a stable structure despite its constantly changing cellular composition. The PS acts like the blastopore (a canal connecting the outer and inner layers of the embryo) of lower vertebrates, but the PS does not have an obvious opening, raising the question of how cells are internalized through an apparently solid structure. It is also unclear how the epiblast preserves its integrity and characteristic columnar epithelial organisation of cells with apical-basal polarity during this process."

Using SEM, we observed that the apical surface of the epiblast displays depressions 3\u20134 cells wide (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bancroft and Bellairs, 1974</a>) at stages XIII-2 (just before and as the PS appears); these increase in width and depth by stage 3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), suggesting coordinated apical constriction. In multi-photon time-lapse sequences, ingression events can be seen to accelerate as the streak forms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3, 4</a>). Individual cells scattered throughout the epiblast undergo repeated cycles of incomplete delamination as they move towards the streak; this continues even at later PS stages (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Few cells far from the streak complete their delamination (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Ingression increases as cells approach the PS so that most of them ingress within 1 hr; however, cells reaching it at the same time do not necessarily ingress synchronously (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,F</a>) and some ingressions occur away from the PS midline. For example in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, a cluster of cells highlighted with different colours at the far left of the lower right hand panel (dorsal view of the epiblast) shows that cells that are close to each other ingress at different times and different positions along their trajectory towards the PS (middle of the panel): one of the red cells (higher in the panel) ingresses furthest from the streak and earliest, whereas the other red cell (the lowest in the group) ingresses only when it reaches the streak. Together, these observations show that ingression of epiblast cells occurs throughout the epiblast at a low rate, but this rate increases markedly in the region of the forming streak."

We chose these cells because they only contribute to lateral mesoderm and not to axial tissue (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hatada and Stern, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</a>); this differs from grafts of organizer or Koller's sickle (<a href=\"#bib24\">Izpisua-Belmonte et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bachvarova et al., 1998</a>), both of which contribute to and induce an organizer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Izpisua-Belmonte et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bachvarova et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Streit et al., 2000</a>). The grafted cells induce PS markers in the adjacent epiblast within 4 hr (<i>cBra</i>, 8/8 embryos, <i>cSnail2</i>, 10/10) and massive ingression ensues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). After 14 hr, a second, host-derived streak develops from the graft site (8/11; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), whereas the grafted cells (prospective lateral mesoderm [<a href=\"#bib23\">Hatada and Stern, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</a>]) migrate away. When a similar graft is made using mesoderm from more lateral cells that have emerged from the PS, no such induction occurs (see below). This is consistent with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vakaet, 1973</a>) using full-thickness grafts of posterior mature PS (\u2018nodus posterior\u2019). Our results implicate the mesoderm as the source of the inductive signals. Early ingressed cells induce mesendodermal identity and increase the probability of other epiblast cells undergoing EMT, suggesting that the PS forms and maintains itself by positive feedback mediated by a community effect (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gurdon, 1988</a>)."

We co-transplanted recently ingressed cells with COS cells secreting specific inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>) or beads soaked in chemical modulators of each pathway (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013I</a>). SU5402 (FGF-inhibitor), Crescent, Dkk and alsterpaullone (canonical-Wnt-modulators), chordin and noggin (BMP-inhibitors) did not inhibit induction (n = 9 each except Dkk, n = 7). However, Cerberus (BMP- and Nodal-inhibitor, 9/9; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) and Cerberus-Short (Nodal-inhibitor, 8/9; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), as well as SB4315412 (10/12; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>) and SB505124 (11/12; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>) (inhibitors of TGF\u03b2 superfamily receptors ALK4/ALK7) all prevented both the induction of PS markers (<i>cBra</i>, <i>cSnail2</i>) and ingression of epiblast cells adjacent to the graft. Importantly, they can do this without loss of the markers in the graft cells themselves (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>). Control COS cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and beads (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) do not prevent induction by the grafted mesoderm. Grafts of mesoderm from outside the PS do not induce the markers either in the presence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,K</a>) or absence (not shown) of beads or COS cells. These results suggest that TGF\u03b2-related factors, and most likely Nodal, are required for the community effect by newly-ingressed mesendoderm. <i>Nodal</i> is expressed before streak formation in a posterior domain of the epiblast (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Skromne and Stern, 2002</a>), but its activity is initially blocked by Cerberus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</a>), an antagonist produced by the hypoblast. This expression domain seems to be identical to the region in which we previously found cells to undergo intercalation parallel to the marginal zone, driven by the Wnt-PCP pathway (<a href=\"#bib61\">Voiculescu et al., 2007</a>). The domain of <i>Nodal</i> expression and intercalation adopts the shape of the forming streak."

Colours are additive when a cell is positive for more than one displayed state (see e.g., the row labelled \u2018combined\u2019, which symbolises the sum of all features in the rows above it for the forming primitive streak). Nodal(+) cells are shown in red (top row), Wnt-PCP(+) cells in yellow (second row). Cells positive for both Nodal and Wnt-PCP appear orange (third row). At Stage XI all cells in the future streak-forming region are Nodal and Wnt-PCP positive. Later, most continue to have both activities but some cells are only positive for Nodal (red). Cells undergoing EMT are shown in blue and \u2018mesendodermal\u2019 cells in aquamarine (fourth row). For combinations of Nodal, Wnt-PCP, EMT and mesendoderm, note that Nodal(+)-EMT cells appear purple (red + blue); if also Wnt-PCP(+) then approximately violet (red + yellow + blue) (\u2018combined\u2019). The hypoblast is shown chocolate-coloured and the endoblast greenish-slate (rows 6 and 8). Hypoblast displacement by the endoblast (at stage XIV; between stages XI and 2 in the Figure) disinhibits Nodal in the overlying epiblast (see text). Sequential cell positions are integrated by remembering all previous time points to form \u2018trails\u2019, as shown in row 7. For clarity, trails made from 15% of the cells are shown. The last three rows depict the embryo viewed from an oblique angle. In row 8 (\u2018hypoblast and endoblast\u2019), the position of the lower layer can be seen (also see above, <i>lower layer</i>). Initially this consists only of hypoblast (chocolate). At later stages, endoblast (greenish-slate) partially displaces the hypoblast. The epiblast is also seen from below (\u2018epiblast ventral view\u2019, row 9), allowing clear visualization of EMT (blue/purple/violet) and emerging and emerging middle layer (aquamarine) cells. The final row, \u2018epiblast dorsal view\u2019 (row 10), displays the epiblast from above with a pseudo-surface applied, simulating indentations caused by ingressing cells. These indentations sum as cells approach the posterior midline, generating a midline groove at the PS. The pseudo-surface is created by tessellating points representing the top of each epithelial cell (using the cell body for cells undergoing EMT)."

When cooperativity of EMT is triggered in the intercalation domain (by disinhibition of Nodal activity [<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</a>], because of the displacement of the hypoblast away from the posterior Nodal-expressing zone), massive ingression occurs. In line with experimental observations, this causes the movement pattern to be altered, with cells now entering the PS along direct lateral-to-medial trajectories. The simulations faithfully recreate the large-scale Polonaise movements as well as PS formation and its role as a gateway for gastrulation via cell ingression. Importantly, the global Polonaise movements follow passively from active events localized to the posterior PS-forming region and then the PS itself."

The anterior and lateral epiblast thus sweeps posteriorly and medially. At the same time, convergence and extension in the PS generates movement along the midline; this is mainly directed anteriorly, as the marginal zone limits posterior extension. Together these processes yield both the circumferential (lateral epiblast) and anterior (posterior midline epiblast) components of the Polonaise movement pattern as seen in normal embryos (<a href=\"#bib45\">Spratt, 1946</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

At pre-streak stages, we observe a complete arrest of the Polonaise movements (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gr\u00e4per, 1929</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wetzel, 1929</a>) across the entire epiblast (<a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8, 10</a>; in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> compare G, normal embryo, with I, where Wnt-PCP was blocked in the intercalation domain). Massive ingression is still triggered at the appropriate time, but in a posterior domain close to the margin of the embryo rather than at the midline. In these experiments, cells move posteriorly towards this zone of concentrated ingression along abnormal, straight-line trajectories (in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> compare H, normal embryo, with J, blocked intercalation). These findings suggest that shaping of the early PS in the normal embryo is mainly driven by intercalation, which results in coalescence and extension in the midline and the Polonaise movement pattern. After its formation, the PS is maintained as a zone of massive ingression that generates a more direct pattern of cell convergence, with cell trajectories perpendicular to the axis of the PS (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, stage 3+). We used the model to simulate this experiment. With standard parameters and without changing any other conditions, the model faithfully reproduces the altered movement pattern associated with the abrogation of intercalation using Wnt-PCP-Morpholinos in posterior cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">Voiculescu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7N\u2013O</a>)."

In the chick, some argue that all precursors of the streak arise from and multiply in a very small region of the posterior epiblast (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wei and Mikawa, 2000</a>), whereas others propose that the precursors of the early mesendoderm are present in all regions of the early epiblast, based on the observation that HNK1<sup>+</sup>/Acetylcholinesterase<sup>+</sup> cells are scattered randomly throughout the pre-PS epiblast (<a href=\"#bib12\">Drews, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Canning and Stern, 1988</a>), contribute to mesendoderm and are required for PS formation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stern and Canning, 1990</a>). Here we show that ingression of cells starts well before gastrulation, by individual cells sparsely scattered across the epiblast, in a pattern similar to the HNK1<sup>+</sup> cells. Our results strongly suggest that the early ingressing cells correspond to, or are a subset of the HNK1<sup>+</sup> population, which also explains why early ingressed mesoderm cells can rescue PS formation in embryos from which HNK1<sup>+</sup> cells have been ablated (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stern and Canning, 1990</a>). There are interesting parallels with the sea urchin, where gastrulation is initiated by maternally specified \u2018pioneer\u2019 cells, the Primary Mesenchyme cells (PMCs) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McClay et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sweet et al., 2002</a>), also characterised by their expression of Acetylcholinesterase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Drews, 1975</a>), which carries the HNK1 epitope (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bon et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Canning and Stern, 1988</a>). At present, it is not known when and how HNK1+ cells are specified in the chick epiblast, but they share two key characteristics with their sea urchin counterparts: they are required for proper gastrulation (mesendoderm formation) and have inductive abilities. We propose that as in the sea urchin, amniote mesendoderm formation is initiated before the PS forms by \u2018pioneer\u2019 cells that ingress as individuals at relatively low frequency throughout the epiblast."

In sea urchin, however, the inductive effect of PMCs on gastrulation is mediated by Notch signalling (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McClay et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sweet et al., 2002</a>)."

Medio-lateral intercalation in the epiblast prior to the start of gastrulation acts to displace and re-shape the Nodal domain and the prospective mesendodermal territory to the midline. Later in development, cell intercalation seems to continue to play a role in axial elongation by driving convergence/extension movements in the midline mesoderm and the overlying neuroectoderm (prospective floor plate), after the initial appearance of notochord cells. These later movements in the mesoderm and prospective floor plate are also found in anamniotes, as has been demonstrated in Xenopus and zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yeo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ezin et al., 2006</a>), whereas the early (pre-gastrulation) movements are unique to amniotes. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for how the displacement of the chick hypoblast (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</a>) (expressing <i>Cerberus</i>) by the endoblast, or of the mouse anterior visceral endoderm (AVE (<a href=\"#bib35\">Perea-Gomez et al., 2002</a>), expressing <i>Cerberus</i> and <i>Lefty1</i>) leads to extensive EMT and PS formation. We propose that apart from a role in nutrition of the embryo, the hypoblast/AVE acquired the function of delaying PS formation while repositioning the streak precursor cells to the midline (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stern and Downs, 2012</a>). This occurs because the <i>Nodal</i>-expressing domain also expresses components of the Wnt-PCP pathway and undergoes intercalation, independently of ingression (<a href=\"#bib61\">Voiculescu et al., 2007</a>). Distinct molecular pathways mediate the dual role of the hypoblast: FGF, which controls the Wnt-PCP pathway and positions the PS (<a href=\"#bib61\">Voiculescu et al., 2007</a>), and Nodal antagonism (perhaps together with Wnt antagonism), which regulates the timing of PS formation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</a>)."

(I) In the stages leading up to gastrulation, cells in a crescent-shaped posterior region of the epiblast express <i>Nodal</i> and the Wnt-PCP system. The Wnt-PCP system drives oriented intercalation of epithelial cells, parallel to the marginal zone (perpendicular to the future body axis). Nodal is a potent enhancer of EMT activity (ingression) and sensitizes cells to activity in neighbouring cells (community effect). However, underlying the epiblast is the hypoblast, a suppressor of Nodal activity (through Cerberus). Thus cells outside the posterior region (Nodal-negative) and cells within the region (Nodal-positive but hypoblast suppressed) only attempt EMT at a low rate, and most of these attempts are unsuccessful: they do not result in cell ingression. The Wnt-PCP system causes this posterior cohort of Nodal-positive cells to converge to, and extend along, the midline. Movement of these cells towards the midline draws in neighbouring cells, the displacements are propagated outwards and, through the geometry of the roughly circular epiblast confined within the marginal zone, the Polonaise movement pattern ensues. (II) Endoblast derived from the posterior germ wall (the deep, yolky cells of the area opaca, <a href=\"#bib49\">Stern, 1990</a>) displaces the hypoblast away from the posterior part of the embryo, unleashing Nodal activity in the Nodal-positive population, now localized at the posterior midline. Under the influence of Nodal, ingression accelerates and becomes self-reinforcing, generating the PS. The now massive loss of cells through ingression within the midline PS pulls in lateral neighbours and the displacements are propagated laterally, resulting in a transverse movement pattern. As lateral cells enter the PS, they become Nodal and Wnt-PCP positive and fuel the process. The PS continues to elongate through incorporation of lateral cells and oriented intercalation."

During each tick the simulation performs certain global functions; each cell is addressed individually and its actions are based partly on the combined effects of the various influences described above. Many of these actions involve iterative processes. This hierarchical structure generates a checkpoint system whereby various actions that are not necessarily correlated within the model can be coordinated and the model tissue can be time-matched to the biological tissue. This also allows model parameters to be specified in simple real-world terms (e.g., the length of G2 is 30 \u00b1 3 min) without the need to specify details of how the program manages the underlying mechanics.

This is formulated using a logistic function with \u2018effective neighbour equivalents\u2019 (N<sub>eff</sub>) as the dependent variable (<a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 5.1</a>). N<sub>eff</sub> in turn includes components representing the cell itself, near-neighbours in the epiblast plane and more distant local neighbours whose effect is attenuated with distance (<a href=\"#equ10\">Equation 5.2</a>). Three classes of Nodal-secreting effector cells are distinguished: (i) the receiving cell itself (if already secreting Nodal); (ii) <i>near-neighbour</i> cells (those directly abutting the receiving cell in the epithelial layer), and (iii) <i>local neighbour</i> cells (those within some proximity, excluding near-neighbours). For local neighbours the effect falls off with distance. Each of these classes is assigned a coefficient that modulates their relative effect. Inhibitors may impact the effect of each of these classes by modification of the coefficients. Inhibition of Nodal by Cerberus from the hypoblast (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</a>) is modelled by decreasing the coefficient for the neighbour effects when the hypoblast is present, the decrease in the local neighbour effect being greater than that of the near-neighbour effect. This formulation is designed to be consistent with the action of hypoblast derived Cerberus [<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertocchini and Stern, 2002</a>] which binds to and blocks Nodal in the extracellular space [<a href=\"#bib36\">Piccolo et al., 1999</a>]."

This community effect on cell ingression is modelled using Nodal as the direct effector. However the model can accommodate one or more other effectors that become active either secondary to Nodal action or by a mechanism involving disinhibition after the hypoblast becomes replaced by endoblast. The base rate of ingression is low for cells in Nodal-negative regions (anterior and lateral epiblast) or Nodal-positive but refractory regions (the PS forming region prior to hypoblast withdrawal). When the hypoblast withdraws, cells in the PS region become Nodal-active and the rate of ingression increases. As the process continues, Nodal-positive ingressing cells accumulate beneath the epithelium and cooperativity accelerates. As the steep region of the logistic curve is reached, massive ingression occurs. The influx and incorporation of lateral epiblast into this zone of massive ingression fuels the process and helps to keep it localized. Nodal-active t-emt cells where exposure to Nodal is at or beyond a threshold are prohibited from rejoining the epithelium, as are cells where the cell body has descended fully beneath the BM. The threshold is chosen as the magnitude of the Nodal effect that a Nodal-positive cell would have on itself in the absence of hypoblast inhibition. Thus, reversion is prohibited for disinhibited Nodal-positive cells, but also for disinhibited Nodal-negative cells if surrounded by numerous Nodal-positive neighbours. This mechanism contributes to the enhanced rate of ingression at the PS."

For each cell, a polygon is calculated such that each edge is perpendicular to and passes though a line connecting the centre of the cell with that of its near-neighbour and bisects the separation between the cells. This polygon is roughly analogous to a Voronoi region (VR) and is termed the pseudo-Voronoi region (pseudo-VR). Voronoi regions often are termed \u2018cells\u2019. To avoid confusion with biological cells, the term region will be used here. For a true Voronoi region, each edge should maintain equal distance from the physical cell [<a href=\"#bib33\">Okabe et al., 2000</a>]. For biological cells schematized as variable size spheres (circles in two-dimensions) the edges would therefore be curved (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2006</a>). The straight-sided polygons used here are simplifications adequate for the proposed cell behaviours and computationally simpler. The centroid of the pseudo-VR is then determined and a displacement vector created from the current cell centroid to the polygon centroid (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). A single near-neighbour is highlighted in this diagram, but all near-neighbours are involved. Each near-neighbour movement causes its own pseudo-VR to change and the process is propagated across the tissue. Although here cells begin in a regular array, cells in the model are not so constrained. Application of this vector acts to move the cell to a more \u2018central\u2019 location among its near-neighbours and when applied to the cell population in iterative fashion tends to make cell density homogeneous throughout the tissue. This is recognizable as a form of Lloyd\u2019s algorithm or Voronoi iteration (<a href=\"#bib13\">Du et al., 1999</a>)."

Hence the algorithm is run for a fixed number of iterations (1000 per tick) rather than to some equilibrium criterion."

Only one near-neighbour is shown for simplicity, but the displacement vectors to all near-neighbours are summed to produce the final oriented intercalation displacement vector. Since the algorithm is applied iteratively to all cells, during the each iteration the near-neighbour(s) will also move according to the same algorithm. Thus, rather than the cell moving completely to align with near-neighbours, the cell and its neighbours will both incrementally move towards an equilibrium position. In the illustration both cell and near-neighbour have parallel orientation vectors although this is not necessary (or even common) in the simulations."
