The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to be responsible for processing and encoding distinct contextual associations in response to highly similar inputs. The mossy fiber (MF) axons of the dentate granule cells convey strong excitatory drive to CA3 pyramidal neurons and express presynaptic, PKA-dependent forms of plasticity. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the PKA anchoring protein, AKAP7, in mouse MF axons and terminals. Genetic ablation of AKAP7 specifically from dentate granule cells results in disruption of MF-CA3 LTP directly initiated by cAMP, and the AKAP7 mutant mice are selectively deficient in pattern separation behaviors. Our results suggest that the AKAP7/PKA complex in the MF projections plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity and contextual memory formation."

The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to be responsible for processing and encoding distinct contextual associations in response to highly similar inputs. The mossy fiber (MF) axons of the dentate granule cells convey strong excitatory drive to CA3 pyramidal neurons and express presynaptic, PKA-dependent forms of plasticity. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the PKA anchoring protein, AKAP7, in mouse MF axons and terminals. Genetic ablation of AKAP7 specifically from dentate granule cells results in disruption of MF-CA3 LTP directly initiated by cAMP, and the AKAP7 mutant mice are selectively deficient in pattern separation behaviors. Our results suggest that the AKAP7/PKA complex in the MF projections plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity and contextual memory formation."

The DG receives input from the entorhinal cortex and sends its output via dentate granule cell (DGC) axons or mossy fibers (MFs) to synapse with proximal dendrites of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amaral et al., 2007</a>). Previous theoretical studies predicted that one function of the DG is to accurately separate similar memories by orthogonally encoding discrete non-overlapping input patterns onto the CA3 field (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee and Solivan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rolls, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>). This precise form of encoding is known as pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gilbert et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kesner and Rolls, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Leutgeb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>). Behavioral studies have helped to clarify the role of the circuit between the DG and region CA3 in modulating spatial and contextual pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aimone et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Myers and Scharfman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Treves et al., 2008</a>).

Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key mediator of both pre- and postsynaptic forms of long-term plasticity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kandel et al., 2014</a>). A Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) are multi-domain scaffolding proteins that localize PKA and other proteins to discrete subcellular domains and spatially restrict intracellular signaling events that are required for neuroplasticity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dell'Acqua et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Scott et al., 2013</a>). We, and others, have shown that genetic deletion of a dendritic AKAP (AKAP5) results in delocalization of PKA from the postsynaptic dendrites of CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons and leads to behavioral defects in memory and learning (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tunquist et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</a>).

The molecular nature of this presynaptic LTP is not fully understood, although several protein targets have been identified (<a href=\"#bib7\">Castillo, 2012</a>). A model for MF-LTP suggests that presynaptic calcium influx activates calcium-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that produce cyclic AMP (cAMP) leading to PKA activation and the phosphorylation of substrates (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Villacres et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Weisskopf et al., 1994</a>). MF-LTP can be induced either synaptically by repetitive stimulation of MFs (tetanus) or by direct elevation of cAMP by the application of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator, forskolin. Previous studies using mice with defects in specific cyclases or subunits of PKA have suggested mechanistic differences in synaptic versus forkolin-induced LTP in this pathway (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wong et al., 1999</a>). The role of sub-cellular localization of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway has not been addressed in DGCs and could play a critical role in both synaptic plasticity and contextual discrimination."

In the hippocampal formation, AKAP7 is selectively expressed in DGCs and localizes to both dendrites and the MF presynaptic projections. Loss of AKAP7 results in delocalization of PKA-RII\u03b2 from the MF projections. AKAP7 global KO mice demonstrate deficits in non-cued spatial and contextual pattern separation, behaviors that have been associated with DG function. Moreover, we deleted AKAP7 from DGCs and found that the behavioral deficits seen in the global KO are specific to the DG-CA3 pathway. Slice electrophysiology revealed that AKAP7 deficient animals were severely impaired in cAMP-induced MF-LTP. Our results identify AKAP7 as a unique AKAP that localizes PKA to axons and terminals of adult neurons and we demonstrate that AKAP7 functions to regulate both synaptic plasticity and behavior."

Only the final exon, containing the PKA-binding domain characteristic of AKAPs, is shared by all AKAP7 isoforms. The final exon also contains a modified leucine zipper domain which interacts with brain Na<sup>+</sup> and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and facilitates PKA modulation of ion conductance through these channels (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marshall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tibbs et al., 1998</a>). Long and short AKAP7 isoforms differ in subcellular localization. Long isoforms, \u03b3/\u03b4, are predominantly cytosolic, although they contain a potential nuclear\u00a0localization sequence. Only the short \u03b1\u00a0isoform contains N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation sites, facilitating plasma membrane association (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gray et al., 1998</a>).

Since the AKAP7 KO mice revealed a dramatic delocalization of PKA from MF projections, we reasoned that presynaptic PKA-dependent forms of long-term plasticity might be disrupted. To examine this possibility, we monitored MF-CA3 synaptic transmission and plasticity in acute hippocampal slices acquired from AKAP7 WT and KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Cyclic AMP-induced LTP, monitored with extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings, was nearly abolished in the AKAP7 KO mice when compared to WT littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To more directly measure presynaptic function at the MF-CA3 synapse, we performed whole-cell recordings of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) under experimental conditions designed to reduce polysynaptic contamination generated by associational-commissural inputs onto the CA3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwon and Castillo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</a>).

We also examined tetanus-induced LTP using whole cell recordings of NMDAR-EPSCs and found a similar result (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since tetanus-induced LTP in the MF-CA3 pathway has previously been shown to be presynaptic and require PKA (<a href=\"#bib65\">Weisskopf et al., 1994</a>), we tested the possibility that compensation in AKAP7 KO mice might have produced a PKA-independent form of LTP. We pharmacologically inhibited PKA with H89 and observed that the tetanus-induced LTP in AKAP7 KO slices remained dependent on PKA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). A previous report found that presynaptic long-term depression (LTD) at MF-CA3 synapses also relies on cAMP/PKA signaling (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tzounopoulos et al., 1998</a>). We therefore examined the AKAP7 KO and found that LTD was preserved in the AKAP7 KO mice compared with WT controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). To determine if basal presynaptic function was altered in AKAP7 KO mice, we assessed short-term plasticity while monitoring NMDAR-EPSCs. All measured short-term plasticity dynamics, paired-pulse facilitation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>) and frequency facilitation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H and I</a>) were comparable to WT controls. These results are consistent with our anatomical findings that deletion of AKAP7 does not cause gross changes in basal synaptic function. Collectively, our results suggest that cAMP-induced LTP requires high levels of localized PKA signaling in MF axons and presynaptic terminals, whereas tetanus-induced LTP does not."

To test for alterations in contextual pattern separation in the AKAP7 KO mice, we first employed a contextual fear discrimination paradigm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>). WT and KO animals received a foot-shock in \u2018context A\u2019 but not in \u2018context B,\u2019 where the two contexts differed only in the flooring and wallpaper. WT mice demonstrated intact contextual pattern separation because they rapidly learned that context B was comparatively safer and reduced their freezing behavior in context B after just one trial while retaining a robust freezing response in context A. However, AKAP7 KO mice took 7\u20138 trials to distinguish context B from context A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). The AKAP7 KO mice were also slightly delayed in extinction of freezing behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), which is thought to involve inhibitory learning (<a href=\"#bib39\">Myers and Davis, 2007</a>). Apart from these behavioral differences, KO mice were not impaired in a typical contextual memory task (Barnes maze) and did not display changes in anxiety as assessed by elevated plus maze, open field and marble burying (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). There were also no differences in gross motor function as measured by wire hang, pole test, and rotarod (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This assay determines the ability of mice to recognize spatial differences in the location of a food reward within a radial arm maze without relying on visual cues. This test involves reward-based learning rather than the contextual fear discrimination paradigm employed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and has also been used extensively to study the role of DGCs in pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Guo et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>). We compared all four genotypes: WT, global KO, DG-KO and Het. Animals were first trained to find a food reward (R) at the end of one open arm after being placed in the start (S) arm. After finding the reward, mice were removed and a third arm was opened and baited. The mice learned to ignore the previously baited arm and go to the third open arm for reward. Mice were then returned to the maze to test whether they could correctly identify this new reward arm while ignoring the previous reward arm location (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). For this test, arms that are closer together (2-arm) are more difficult to discriminate between compared to arms that are further apart (4-arm) and the 2-arm test robustly detects DGC defects (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>). AKAP7 KO and DG-KO animals committed significantly more errors in the 2-arm configuration compared to WT and Het over the 5-day experiment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In the 4-arm separation task, AKAP7 KO and DG-KO animals performed similar to WT and Het animals during the fourth and fifth day of training. Critically, the specific loss of AKAP7 from DGCs was sufficient to disrupt non-cued spatial pattern separation to the same degree as observed for the global KO when animals were challenged in the 2-arm test (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These results demonstrate that defective pattern separation is directly linked to AKAP7 function in DGCs."

In the hippocampus, AKAP7\u03b1 is primarily restricted to DGCs, although it is expressed in other brain regions including the cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In MF axons, AKAP7 is apparently the only anchor for PKA-RII\u03b2 since the two proteins colocalize throughout the axons and terminals and the loss of AKAP7 results in delocalization of PKA-RII\u03b2 and C subunits from these presynaptic projections as indicated by a strong reduction in immunofluorescence. In contrast, dendritic and cytoplasmic PKA-RII\u03b2 increases in the AKAP7 KO. Dendritic PKA remains localized in the AKAP7 KO and is likely to bind other postsynaptic AKAPs including AKAP5 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sanderson and Dell'Acqua, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tunquist et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Weisenhaus et al., 2010</a>), AKAP12 (gravin) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Havekes et al., 2012</a>) and MAP2 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zhong et al., 2009</a>). We do not know whether AKAP7 plays any specific role in dendrites that cannot be compensated for by these other AKAPs. The modest elevation in dendritic and somatic PKA in the AKAP7 KO could potentially compete for cAMP during postsynaptic signaling in response to perforant path stimulation from the entorhinal cortex, but this seems unlikely given the highly organized domain structure of PKA signaling complexes in the postsynaptic density."

Early studies found that colchicine induced lesions in the DG, but not CA1 regions of the hippocampus in rats, produced deficits in spatial discrimination (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gilbert et al., 2001</a>). Genetic disruption of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor specifically in DGCs results in a defect in discrimination between similar contexts (pattern separation) in mice (<a href=\"#bib37\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>). The discovery that neurogenesis is occurring in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and adult-born DGCs are constantly integrating into the DG circuits (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altman and Das, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">van Praag et al., 2002</a>) led to intensive efforts to understand the function of the DG and determine whether these adult born DGCs play a distinct role in contextual discrimination (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aimone et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sahay et al., 2011</a>). Although the mechanisms are not resolved, the studies indicate that adult born DGCs are preferentially involved in accurate pattern separation, and the mature DGCs are required for pattern completion or generalization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Danielson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>). We found that deleting AKAP7 did not affect adult neurogenesis, but the function of AKAP7 in pattern separation could preferentially involve these adult born DGCs.

                        "text": "MF-LTP can be induced by repeated trains of tetanic stimulation or direct activation of cyclases with forskolin to elevate cAMP. Early efforts to understand the role of cAMP and its effectors in MF-LTP relied on pharmacological and genetic tools that affected cAMP and cAMP effectors throughout the DGCs. Bath application of PKA inhibitors during tetanus blocks the induction of MF-LTP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Weisskopf et al., 1994</a>). The role of adenylyl cyclases was demonstrated by genetic deletion of the calcium-stimulated cyclases, AC8 and AC1. Deletion of AC1 or AC8 reduced tetanus-induced MF-LTP and the AC1/AC8 double KO completely eliminated tetanus induced LTP. It is interesting to note that the LTP induced by direct cyclase activation with forskolin was unaffected in the AC1/AC8 double KO (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wong et al., 1999</a>) suggesting that forskolin is acting on another cyclase in the DGCs to induce LTP. Targeted disruption of either the C\u03b2 or RI\u03b2 subunit gene of PKA inhibited tetanus-induced LTP at MF-CA3 synapses without decreasing cAMP-induced LTP (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 1995</a>). Recently, the contribution of another cAMP effector, Epac2, was examined. Epac2 is a cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1/2, and electrophysiological recordings from Epac2 KO mice demonstrate defects in both tetanus- and cAMP-induced MF-LTP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>). These approaches clearly establish that cyclases, PKA, and Epacs are involved in the mechanisms that underlie MF-LTP, but do not provide an understanding of the importance of subcellular localization of signaling complexes in axons, soma or dendrites of DGCs. Our study demonstrates that AKAP7 anchors PKA in the axonal projections of DGCs and coordinates the cAMP-induced LTP pathway without affecting the PKA dependent, synaptically-induced MF-LTP. This surprising result suggests that localization of PKA could play a differential role in these two different modes of eliciting LTP. One possibility is that synaptically\u00a0induced LTP is more dependent on the axonal transport of synaptic vesicle proteins that might be phosphorylated in the soma and delivered to the terminals. Rates for transport of these Golgi-derived vesicles are as high as 2\u20135 \u00b5m/s (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown, 2000</a>), and they could therefore travel the\u00a0~1000 \u00b5m distance from the DGC body to the terminals and play a role in the sustained LTP seen 30\u201340 min after tetanic stimulation. Severing the MF axons near the DGC body prevents synaptically\u00a0induced LTP without affecting cAMP-induced LTP further supporting a role for the cell body in maintenance of synaptically\u00a0induced LTP (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calixto et al., 2003</a>). RI and RII isoforms of PKA have different anchoring characteristics (<a href=\"#bib13\">Di Benedetto et al., 2008</a>) with PKA-RI typically concentrated in the soma of neurons (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yang et al., 2014</a>), while PKA-RII\u03b2 is usually tightly anchored to AKAPs in dendrites and, in this study, axonal projections. This leads us to speculate that tetanus-induced LTP depends on PKA activation in the somatodendritic compartment and cAMP-induced LTP depends on PKA-RII\u03b2 in the MF projections. The expression of AKAP7 in other brain regions suggests a possible PKA anchoring role in other presynaptic pathways where PKA-dependent LTP has been observed and our <i>Akap7</i><sup>lox/lox</sup> mouse line will facilitate these future studies."

The function of the LTP mechanism that can be directly engaged by forskolin and is disrupted in the AKAP7 KO is unknown. One possibility is that direct activation of localized Gs-coupled receptors, cyclases and PKA in the axons and presynaptic terminals could alter the excitability of those MF projections and might act synergistically with perforant path induced DG excitation. Extrinsic neuromodulatory projections from the locus coeruleus terminate in the stratum lucidum (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amaral et al., 2007</a>) and may provide noradrenergic modulation of MF-LTP (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang and Kandel, 1996</a>). There is evidence for synergism between the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, and repetitive synaptic stimulation of MF-LTP in slice culture (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang and Kandel, 1996</a>). More recently, it has been observed that a weak tetanic stimulation of the MF-CA3 pathway <i>in vivo</i> can synergize with lateral ventricle administration of isoproterenol to elicit LTP lasting more than 24 hr (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2012</a>). In addition, the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) receptor is highly expressed in DGCs and this Gs-coupled GPCR is localized to MF projections (<a href=\"#bib43\">Otto et al., 1999</a>). Targeted disruption of the PACAP receptor (<i>Adcyap1r1</i>) in neocortex and hippocampus led to deficits in both MF-LTP and contextual fear conditioning (<a href=\"#bib42\">Otto et al., 2001</a>). We propose that AKAP7-localized PKA provides an intracellular signaling mechanism to potentiate the actions of neuromodulators targeting G-protein-coupled receptors expressed specifically on the MF projections. DG dysfunction has been implicated in a wide range of psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and addictive behavior (<a href=\"#bib15\">Garc\u00eda-Fuster et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kheirbek et al., 2012</a>).

The two chambers differed only in the floor (white plastic-B versus shock grid-A) and wallpaper (striped wallpaper-B versus white-A). For context A, animals were placed in the chamber and allowed to explore for 3 min, given a 2 s, 0.65 mA foot shock and removed 1 min after foot shock. Context B followed the same procedure, except that animals received no foot shock. Testing in A occurred once daily for 3 days. Between every trial, the chamber was cleaned with 5% NaOH and the floor scented with 1% Acetic Acid. On day 4, animals experienced only context B. On day 5, animals experienced context A without a foot shock. On the remaining days 6\u201317, animals were placed in each context once daily, presented in pseudorandom order. Animals were always shocked at the end of their time in context A but never in context B. Video recordings were analyzed by Noldus EthoVision software.

Experiments were carried out at 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00b0C. To monitor synaptic transmission and plasticity, conventional field and whole-cell recordings were made with a Multi-Clamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices).

Summary data are expressed as mean \u00b1SEM. Statistics were performed using OriginPro (Origin Lab), and statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. Only statistically significant differences are indicated. To elicit long-term plasticity, two trains containing 125 pulses at 25 Hz, 20 s inter-train interval, were delivered via the stimulating pipette. Alternatively, 10 \u00b5M forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, was bath applied for 10 min and then washed out.

They go on to show that both global deletion of AKAP7 and a targeted deletion of AKAP7 in DGCs alone interferes with a specific behavior that has been shown to require the mossy fiber pathway, contextual pattern separation. Thus, the function of AKAP7, which is to localize RII\u03b2-PKA to DGC axons and terminals, is necessary for animals to display proper contextual pattern discrimination. This appears to be the first time that localization of a particular PKA isoform within neurons by an AKAP has been shown to influence a high level behavior. The study is elegantly done and very interesting. However, the reviewers have several suggested revisions that would improve the manuscript."

It would be preferable to move the discussion of the apparently different mechanisms underlying these two forms of presynaptic plasticity to the introduction, or at least to an introductory paragraph motivating the experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. One important contribution of the study is the requirement for AKAP7 in direct cAMP induction of PKA-dependent MF-LTP, but not tetanus-induced MF-LTP (which is also PKA-dependent). The Discussion section makes this clear, and the work provides the impetus for future studies characterizing the different roles of AKAP-PKA signaling in DGC cell bodies versus MF terminals in plasticity regulation as well as roles for neuromodulators acting on local PKA signaling in axon terminals.

This might disrupt LTP induction, particularly late-LTP induction, in the perforant path-DG synapse. For example, four cAMP molecules are required to bind simultaneously to the dimer of R subunits to release active catalytic units, the increase in R2C2 complexes in the somas would have the effect of suppressing activation of PKA because the bound cAMP would be spread over more tetramers, and it would take more total cAMP to activate the same number of catalytic units. However, another reviewer pointed out that since most type II PKA signaling takes place in micro/nanodomains anchored to AKAPs, where cAMP concentrations are locally controlled by AC and PDE activities typically found in these same complexes, as opposed to free in the bulk cytoplasm, the extra Type II PKA in the DG neuron soma/dendrites of AKAP7KO mice is not likely to inhibit normal regulation of AKAP-anchored Type II PKA signaling in those locations. With AKAP anchoring sites likely already being fully occupied, the extra pool of Type II PKA will most likely be cytosolic and primarily found outside these AKAP-organized micro/nanodomains. Signaling by Type I PKA, either unanchored in the cytoplasm (where RI is usually more abundant than RII) or anchored to RI preferring AKAPs, is also not likely to be inhibited by competition for cAMP binding from extra cytosolic type II PKA, both because RI has a higher cAMP affinity than RII and RII is not likely to displace RI from the few known RI preferring AKAPs, which bind RI with greater affinity than RII. This is in contrast to the majority of other AKAPs that are RII preferring, like AKAP7. If the authors agree with this reasoning, the issue should be addressed in the discussion, along with the possibility that a change in plasticity at the DGC dendritic or somal synapses could contribute to the behavioral effect (Although this is less likely than the direct explanation.)."
