Despite much research, if and to what extent such influences exist remains a matter of debate (<a href=\"#bib2\">Heard and Martienssen, 2014</a>). When discussing this question, we need to distinguish between epigenetic effects, which are expected to remain stable across several generations (and are thought to involve chemical modifications to DNA or histone proteins; <a href=\"#bib3\">Miska and Ferguson-Smith, 2016</a>), and parental effects, which might only apply to first-generation offspring."

It should be easier to understand how the environment experienced by the father affects offspring because, in mammals, fathers contribute little more than the sperm cell during fertilization (<a href=\"#bib1\">Crean and Bonduriansky, 2014</a>). However, although several paternal effects have been reported (<a href=\"#bib4\">Rando, 2012</a>), it has been difficult to tie a crucial event experienced by the father to a specific effect observed in the offspring. Now, in eLife, Oliver Rando, Andrew Tapper and colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Medical School \u2013 including Markus Vallaster as first author \u2013 report that many paternal effects (and maybe maternal effects as well) might be much more generic than previously thought (<a href=\"#bib6\">Vallaster et al., 2017</a>)."

However, the picture changed when Vallaster et al. \u2018acclimated\u2019 both groups of offspring to nicotine by adding small amounts of nicotine to their drinking water for several days. Among the acclimated mice, the chances of the offspring from nicotine-fed males of surviving the injection of a toxic dose of nicotine were almost twice those of the offspring of control males. Thus, a combination of supplying nicotine to the fathers with acclimation to low doses in the offspring leads to enhanced nicotine tolerance."

Related to this, a number of detoxification-related genes were also up-regulated in the offspring of the nicotine-fed fathers but not in the offspring of the control father. However, somewhat surprisingly, these genes were similarly up-regulated in both the acclimated and the non-acclimated offspring of the nicotine-fed fathers. It remains unclear why the increase in nicotine detoxification required exposure to nicotine in the father <i>and</i> in the offspring. A similar observation has been made in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, where increased tolerance towards saline conditions was achieved only after two subsequent low-dose treatments (<a href=\"#bib5\">Sani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Wibowo et al., 2016</a>)."

In all combinations where exposure of the father was followed by acclimation of the offspring, the detoxification capacity was higher. Even when fathers were simultaneously treated with nicotine and a drug that prevents nicotine dependence, the effect in the offspring persisted."

Further research is needed to investigate if this effect is linked to specific genes on the Y chromosome, to a process called X dosage compensation (in which genes on the X chromosomes in females behave differently to the same genes in males), or if there is another explanation. Lastly, studying the effects of nicotine on gene expression in the liver with higher cellular and temporal resolution should help us to ultimately understand the molecular mechanism underlying the potential to develop tolerance to toxins."
