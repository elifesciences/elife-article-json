Local signals such as synaptic input can regulate cargo trafficking, motivating the leading conceptual model of neuron-wide transport, sometimes called the \u2018sushi-belt model\u2019 (Doyle and Kiebler, 2011). Current theories and experiments are based on this model, yet its predictions are not rigorously understood. We formalized the sushi belt model mathematically, and show that it can achieve arbitrarily complex spatial distributions of cargo in reconstructed morphologies. However, the model also predicts an unavoidable, morphology dependent tradeoff between speed, precision and metabolic efficiency of cargo transport. With experimental estimates of trafficking kinetics, the model predicts delays of many hours or days for modestly accurate and efficient cargo delivery throughout a dendritic tree. These findings challenge current understanding of the efficacy of nucleus-to-synapse trafficking and may explain the prevalence of local biosynthesis in neurons."

Local signals such as synaptic input can regulate cargo trafficking, motivating the leading conceptual model of neuron-wide transport, sometimes called the \u2018sushi-belt model\u2019 (Doyle and Kiebler, 2011). Current theories and experiments are based on this model, yet its predictions are not rigorously understood. We formalized the sushi belt model mathematically, and show that it can achieve arbitrarily complex spatial distributions of cargo in reconstructed morphologies. However, the model also predicts an unavoidable, morphology dependent tradeoff between speed, precision and metabolic efficiency of cargo transport. With experimental estimates of trafficking kinetics, the model predicts delays of many hours or days for modestly accurate and efficient cargo delivery throughout a dendritic tree. These findings challenge current understanding of the efficacy of nucleus-to-synapse trafficking and may explain the prevalence of local biosynthesis in neurons."

In some cases neurons simply recycle components or make new ones where they are needed, but experiments suggest that they transport other essential components up and down neurites as though on a conveyor belt. Individual parts of a neuron are believed to select certain components they need from those that pass by.

To maintain accurate delivery, neurons must be able to tolerate delays of hours to days for components to be distributed. Neurons can reduce these delays, for example, by manufacturing more components than they need. However, such solutions are costly. Tradeoffs between the speed, accuracy and efficiency of delivery thus limit the ability of neurons to adapt and repair themselves, and may constrain the speed and accuracy with which they can form new connections and memories."

Distributing biomolecular cargo within neuronal morphologies is therefore a considerable logistical task, especially for components that are synthesized in locations distant from their site of use. Nonetheless, molecular transport is important for many neurophysiological processes, such as synaptic plasticity, neurite development and metabolism. For example, long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity appear to depend on anterograde transport of mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nguyen et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bading, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kandel, 2001</a>) and specific mRNAs are known to be selectively transported to regions of heightened synaptic activity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Steward et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Steward and Worley, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Moga et al., 2004</a>) and to developing synaptic contacts (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lyles et al., 2006</a>)."

Versions of the model predict testable interactions between trafficking-dependent processes, while the model as a whole suggests that time-critical processes like synaptic plasticity may be less precise, or less dependent on global transport than is currently assumed."

The sushi-belt model (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doyle and Kiebler, 2011</a>) proposes that local mechanisms modify local trafficking rates and capture cargo as it passes. For these local signals to encode the demand for cargo, some feedback mechanism must exist between the local concentration of cargo and the signal itself. There are many biologically plausible mechanisms for locally encoding demand (see Materials and methods). For our main results, we did not focus on these details and simply assumed a perfect demand signal. We have thus addressed the performance of the transport mechanism per se, with the most forgiving assumptions about the reliability of the demand signal."

A na\u00efve calculation based on this figure might suggest that subcellular cargo can be delivered precisely within a few hours in most dendritic trees. However, this ignores the stochastic nature of biochemical processes \u2013 motors spontaneously change directions and cargo can be randomly delivered to the wrong site. Such chance events are inevitable in molecular systems, and in the case of active transport they lead to diffusion of bulk cargo in addition to directed movement. If this kind of biochemical stochasticity played out in the sushi restaurant analogy, then the waiting time for a dish wouldn\u2019t simply equate to the time taken for the chef to prepare the dish and for the belt to convey it. Instead, the restaurant would be beleaguered by fickle customers who pick up dishes they do not want, either withholding them for an indefinite period, or setting them on another belt destined for the kitchen."

Over a wide range of assumptions the model exhibits inherent and surprisingly punishing trade-offs between the accuracy of cargo delivery and the time taken to transport it over these morphologies. Using conservative estimates based on experimental data, the canonical sushi-belt model predicts delays of many hours or even days to match demand within 10%. Producing excess cargo and permitting reversible detachment from the microtubules can mitigate this tradeoff, but at a\u00a0substantial metabolic cost, since a large amount of excess cargo is required."

Genes that are transcribed in response to elevated activity can regulate synaptic strengths (<a href=\"#bib23\">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bloodgood et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Spiegel et al., 2014</a>), and it has been suggested that nucleus-to-synapse trafficking of Arc directly regulates synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Okuno et al., 2012</a>). None of these findings imply that all kinds of molecular cargo are transported from the soma to distal dendritic locations, since mRNA can be sequestered and locally synthesized within dendrites (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kang and Schuman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cajigas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Holt and Schuman, 2013</a>).

Many of these effects should be experimentally testable. For example, transport bottlenecks can be induced if demand signals target local trafficking rates along microtubules (the DDT model). Transport to distal compartments will be substantially faster when proximal demand is introduced (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). On the other hand, uniform trafficking combined with locally controlled detachment (DDD model, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) can avoid bottlenecks, and often leads to faster transport. However, this is not always the case, as was shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, where uniform trafficking is slower/inaccurate because cargo explores the basal dendritic tree even though there is no demand in that region. Spatial tuning of trafficking speed permitted more efficient cargo delivery in the model\u00a0(see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6)</a>. However, this has yet to be observed experimentally and would require extremely stereotyped morphology and physiological needs for it to be effective."

For irreversible cargo detachment, the capture rate needs to be roughly an order of magnitude slower than trafficking, otherwise, compartments proximal to the soma receive disproportionately high levels of cargo. This scaling is unfavorable for achieving high accuracy: if it takes roughly 100 min to distribute cargo throughout the dendrites, it will take roughly 1000 min (16\u201317 hr) before the cargo dissociates and is delivered to the synapses. If, instead, cargo is able to reattach, then fast reattachment favors exploration at the cost of greater excess (i.e. non-utilized) cargo, while slow reattachment hinders transport, since more cargo is detached and thus immobile. Even when the vast majority of cargo is produced as excess, global delivery times of several hours persist. Furthermore, if a neuron needs to rapidly replace a cargo that is already present in high concentrations, the strategy of generating excess cargo will result in large dilution times."

Therefore, optimizing for any one of these properties comes at the expense of the others. For example, in the model without reattachment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), the same distribution of cargo can be achieved by: (a) location-dependent trafficking followed by uniform release, (b) uniform trafficking followed by location-dependent release, or (c) a mixture of these two strategies. Experimental findings appear to span these possibilities. (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kim and Martin, 2015)</a> identified three mRNAs that were uniformly distributed in cultured <i>Aplysia</i> sensory neurons, but were targeted to synapses at the level of protein expression by localized translation (supporting option b). In contrast, the expression of <i>Arc</i> mRNA is closely matched to the pattern of Arc protein in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (possibly supporting option a; <a href=\"#bib63\">Steward et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Farris et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Steward et al., 2014</a>). Trafficking kinetics do not just differ according to cargo identity \u2013 the same type of molecular cargo can exhibit diverse movement statistics in single-particle tracking experiments (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dynes and Steward, 2007</a>). These differences lead us to speculate that different neuron types and different cargoes have adapted trafficking strategies that match performance tradeoffs to biological needs."

Real neurons might use unanticipated mechanisms, such as a molecular addressing system, or nonlinear interactions between nearby cargo particles, to circumvent the tradeoffs we observed. For this reason, it is crucial to explore, quantitatively, the behavior of existing conceptual models by replacing words with equations so that we can see where discrepancies with biology might arise. More generally, conceptual models of subcellular processes deserve more quantitative attention because they can reveal non-obvious constraints, relationships and connections to other biological and physical phenomena (<a href=\"#bib60\">Smith and Simmons, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bressloff, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fedotov and M\u00e9ndez, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Newby and Bressloff, 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bhalla, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bressloff and Newby, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla, 2014</a>). Other modelling studies have focused on the effects of stochasticity and local trapping of cargo on a microscopic scale, particularly in the context of low particle numbers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bressloff, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bressloff and Earnshaw, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fedotov and M\u00e9ndez, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Newby and Bressloff, 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bressloff and Newby, 2013</a>). We opted for a coarse-grained class of models in order to examine transport and delivery across an entire neuron. The model we used is necessarily an approximation: we assumed that cargo can be described as a concentration and that the multiple steps involved in cellular transport can lumped together in a mass action model."

However, the mass-action model can often provide a good fit in this regime with appropriately re-fit parameters (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

As long as the single-particles have stochastic and identically distributed behavior, the ensemble will be well-described by a normal distribution by the central limit theorem. This only breaks down in the limit of very long unidirectional runs, as the system is no longer stochastic (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

A common approach is to plot the mean displacement and mean squared displacement of particles as a function of time. The slopes of the best-fit lines in these cases respectively estimate the drift and diffusion coefficients. Diffusion might not accurately model particle movements over short time scales because unidirectional cargo runs result in superdiffusive motion, evidenced by superlinear increases in mean squared-displacement with time (<a href=\"#bib16\">Caspi et al., 2000</a>). However, over longer timescales, cargoes that stochastically change direction can be modelled as a diffusive process (<a href=\"#bib61\">Soundararajan and Bullock, 2014</a>)."

We used the default spatial compartments and set the trafficking and dissociation parameters of the mass-action transport model without reference to the geometry of the compartments.

In these simulations, we scaled the trafficking parameters inversely proportional to the squared distance between the midpoints of neighboring compartments, which is mathematically appropriate to keep the (approximated) diffusion coefficient constant across the neural morphology.

Importantly, tuning the trafficking rates in this manner does not alter the diffusion coefficient along the length of the cable (since <math id=\"inf158\"><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math> is constant by construction). These manipulations produce a nonzero drift coefficient to the model, which corrects for the proximal bias in cargo delivery."

The goal is to understand the tradeoff between speed versus precision during cargo transport along microtubules by motor proteins. The manuscript opens with a rather general discussion (mass-action model) of convection-diffusion in a channel that is coarse-grained at the level of adjacent boxes. This idea is extended to model pyramidal neurons where the steady state distribution of cargo is calculated w.r.t. a target profile. The authors then model a bottleneck situation by assuming low cargo transition rates (epsilon) into a compartment, and test how the system converges to steady state as a function of epsilon. The model is taken further by introducing detachment from microtubules (possibly followed by diffusion-recapture \u2013 details unclear), and looking at efficiency of transport under two possibilities \u2013 cargo is selectively transported to target or is uniformly distributed (combined with detachment)."

Most of the assumptions of the mathematical model appear valid, their rate constants seem to match the experimental velocities and they seem to have taken into consideration various scenarios during cellular transport. However, we feel that the paper starts off being rather general, and remains more-or-less so till the end. For example, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C-D</a> show that the target cargo distributions are always achieved irrespective of the transport/detachment ratio. What is one expected to learn from this, and how might it be useful to plan future experiments? If the message is that many strategies can be employed to achieve target distributions, then this is a rather weak message unless this theme is developed further with specific examples and suggestions. Similarly, the observation (subsection \u201cConvergence rate\u201d, last paragraph) that transport will achieve steady state faster if bottlenecks are removed \u2013 why is this surprising? This part is followed up by a few poorly explained lines where the results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) seem interesting, but are obscured by unnecessary usage of complicated Latin words. On the same lines, in the places where it is mentioned, the connection to experiments is rather weak. Whether these assumptions hold true in a biological setting has not been tested for any neuronal cargoes. Live imaging to show that at least a few cargoes follow this model would have helped."

Models that attempt to answer high-level questions using intricate mechanistic details are far more sensitive to assumptions and measurement error than appropriately coarse-grained models (see, for example, O'Leary, Sutton & Marder 2015, Curr Opinion in Neurobiology)."

We believe our study can provide this motivation."
