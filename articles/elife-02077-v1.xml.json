We used nontargeted metabolite profiling to follow age-associated trajectories of &gt;15,000 metabolites in <i>Drosophila</i> subjected to control and lifespan-extending diets. We find that aging is associated with increased metabolite diversity and low-abundance molecules, suggesting they include cumulative damage. Remarkably, the number of detected compounds leveled-off in late-life, and this pattern associated with survivorship. Fourteen percent of metabolites showed age-associated changes, which decelerated in late-life and long-lived flies. In contrast, known metabolites changed in abundance similarly to nontargeted metabolites and transcripts, but did not increase in diversity. Targeted profiling also revealed slower metabolism and accumulation of lifespan-limiting molecules. Thus, aging is characterized by gradual metabolome remodeling, and condition- and advanced age-associated deceleration of this remodeling is linked to mortality and molecular damage."

We used nontargeted metabolite profiling to follow age-associated trajectories of &gt;15,000 metabolites in <i>Drosophila</i> subjected to control and lifespan-extending diets. We find that aging is associated with increased metabolite diversity and low-abundance molecules, suggesting they include cumulative damage. Remarkably, the number of detected compounds leveled-off in late-life, and this pattern associated with survivorship. Fourteen percent of metabolites showed age-associated changes, which decelerated in late-life and long-lived flies. In contrast, known metabolites changed in abundance similarly to nontargeted metabolites and transcripts, but did not increase in diversity. Targeted profiling also revealed slower metabolism and accumulation of lifespan-limiting molecules. Thus, aging is characterized by gradual metabolome remodeling, and condition- and advanced age-associated deceleration of this remodeling is linked to mortality and molecular damage."

Up-regulation of stress response and repair pathways, often linked to conditions of mild stress or hormesis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rattan, 2010</a>), may also promote longevity. On the other hand, the specific molecular processes that accompany the delay in the aging process are not well understood."

The source of damage is frequently linked to metabolic activities, such as those that produce reactive oxygen species and increase oxidative modifications (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kirkwood and Austad, 2000</a>). Damage may also be driven by global metabolic infidelity and engage nearly all biological processes involving synthesis and breakdown of cellular components (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kirkwood and Austad, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gladyshev, 2013</a>). The exact mechanisms responsible for tolerance against molecular damage are not fully understood, but studies identified robust transcriptional remodeling that accompanies the aging process (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pletcher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">McCarroll et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">de Magalhaes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Somel et al., 2010</a>). How such responses are linked to cumulative damage is not known, since gene expression changes may not reflect immediate biological activities and metabolic fluxes. Another complication in such analyses is that individual damage types (e.g., mutations, lipofuscin accumulation, oxidative modifications) vary across conditions and among species (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rattan, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Edman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Magalhaes, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jonker et al., 2013</a>). The patterns of damage accumulation are also incompletely defined since many of the previous studies did not analyze samples representing very old ages (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andziak et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Edman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jonker et al., 2013</a>). Yet, insights into the properties of cumulative damage are required for comprehensive assessment of the activity-driven damage models of aging. Addressing these critical questions requires examination of damage composition and heterogeneity and the mortality-associated trends in the accumulation of numerous damage forms under both control and lifespan extending conditions. Aside from damage forms, it is unclear how cellular components generally change as a function of age, whether their patterns mimic the transcriptional responses and whether possible changes in their levels can have causal roles in the aging process."

Another strength of metabolite profiling lies in nontargeted profiling, which enables analysis of thousands of small molecules, albeit of unknown chemical properties. Nontargeted profiling may also be used to characterize patterns of molecular damage by following changes in metabolite diversity. For example, damaged molecular species are expected to exhibit age-associated mass shifts, which may be represented by an increase in metabolite diversity, potentially offering a larger repertoire of damage forms than analyzed previously. By following global changes in metabolome remodeling in response to aging and lifespan-extending interventions, the nontargeted profiling may also lead to the identification of small molecule regulators of the aging process."

We discover that metabolite diversity shows a robust age-associated increase. In contrast, known metabolites as well as many metabolites that are detected at all ages show bi-directional trends during aging: they fall predominantly into increasing and decreasing age-associated clusters. Interestingly, older cohorts feature deceleration in both the rise in metabolite diversity and overall cellular activity. Together, these data suggest that changes reflecting biological activity are linked to the display of metabolome diversity, which is reflected in the appearance of new small molecule species. We followed metabolites implicated in certain forms of damage and found their levels to be higher in long-living flies. These data further implicate a heterogeneous nature of damage whose effect on survivorship is condition dependent. Overall, these metabolite analyses provide critical insights into the activity-driven nature of the aging process."

In contrast, analysis of metabolite diversity using a panel of 205 known metabolites did not show significant age-associated trends (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Furthermore, the distribution of signal intensities between targeted metabolites and metabolites, which show diversity fluctuations throughout lifespan were different by few orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), suggesting that the latter generally corresponded to molecules of low abundance and were not due to errors of detection. Also, changes in metabolite diversity could not be attributable to the presence of yeast-derived metabolites in our diet, since the chemically defined diet contained no cellular products. Lastly, the observed changes in metabolite diversity could be explained by the presence of outliving cohorts in samples near the end of the lifespan curve, as previously proposed for mortality rates (<a href=\"#bib11\">Curtsinger et al., 1992</a>).

Using repeated measures ANOVA and stringent statistical cut-off that estimated &lt;0.2% of false positives (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we identified 2234 and 2216 metabolites (\u223c14% of all detected metabolites) that qualified as age-associated in the standard and defined diets, respectively. This revealed widespread and dynamic metabolome reorganization throughout lifespan. Of the detected age-associated features, 1,066 were common to both dietary regimens (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These molecules exhibited very similar trajectories of change between the two diets (median Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.76), in contrast to the lack of such correlation when using all metabolite pairs between the diets (permutation test p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To further characterize these age-related metabolites, we performed two types of scaling: between-group (a metabolite was scaled across both dietary conditions) and within-group (a metabolite was scaled within each dietary condition). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the between-group scaled values segregated samples first by diet and then by age (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that the magnitudes of these metabolites were affected by dietary conditions. On the other hand, PCA of the within-group scaled data revealed an age-dependent, but diet-independent segregation, with the replicate samples of both diets grouping closely together (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thus, these metabolites indeed followed very similar trajectories with age, after normalization of differences in their intensity levels. Furthermore, most age-related changes in metabolite intensity (levels hereafter for simplicity) within individual diets did not exceed 4\u20138-fold across lifespan (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), which was consistent with the differences in gene expression between <i>Drosophila</i> subjected to dietary restriction or stress (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pletcher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Girardot et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Landis et al., 2012</a>).

We carried out k-mean clustering to group metabolites with similar trajectories, separately for those with below twofold and above twofold inter-dietary changes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which showed that the diet-influenced changes were relatively underrepresented. Specifically, among the 1,542 age-related metabolites common to both diets, 76% showed less than twofold changes between the two diets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), indicating that the influence of diet was noticeable, but mostly small in magnitude. These age-related changes may be linked to longevity as there was high prevalence of strong correlations (both positive and negative) between individual metabolite levels across lifespan and lifespan curves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). While only a small fraction of metabolites showed more than twofold changes between the diets, they typically exhibited strong correlation with lifespan, suggesting they might represent mechanisms through which dietary modification (e.g., dietary restriction) affected longevity. Next, to visualize the changes in metabolite levels during aging, we performed hierarchical clustering on both within-group and between-group scaled data for all signals commonly changing with age in both diets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Interestingly, a very large fraction of metabolites that decreased with age was derived from the lipid fraction, and this observation applied to both diets (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Lipid profiles also declined with age in other animals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Houtkooper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lapierre et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Singh and Cuervo, 2012</a>), suggesting that our analysis captures a general scheme of age-related changes in lipid metabolism. Among decreases, metabolites in clusters 6 and 8 declined more rapidly beginning in early, very young samples, suggesting that these signals had an earlier role, for example, during development and morphogenesis. In fact, age-related transcripts with the roles in morphogenesis experienced similar trends (Clusters 6, 7, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Although most of the decreases in clusters 6 and 8 were significant, they were not strongly different between the diets. This may reinforce the idea of the developmental role for these lipid profiles as flies were reared on the standard medium until day 3 post eclosion, before the transfer to dietary restricted media. In contrast, most polar metabolites increased with age and their rates of change between the diets were more dynamic (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In summary, the majority of age-related trajectories were very similar in both diets: they showed strong correlations to lifespan curves and were largely continuous as they followed trajectories observed in younger samples, while very few showed mid-life reversals (clusters 10\u201312) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Some of the variations in metabolite magnitude between the diets, on the other hand, may be responsible for the observed lifespan differences."

For this, we analyzed a gene expression data set that sampled mated female flies raised similarly to our two dietary regimens (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pletcher et al., 2002</a>). By applying similar statistical methods as those used for identifying the age-associated metabolites, we identified 1172 age-associated genes (ca. 8% of total) common to both diets (repeated measures ANOVA, p&lt;0.0013). Clustering analysis revealed that about 70% of age-related genes also featured gradual transitions throughout lifespan, both increasing (clusters 2 through 5) and decreasing (clusters 6 through 8) with age (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We used Gene ontology (GO) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashburner et al., 2000</a>) to test for enrichment of biological processes within each cluster and found that longevity in dietary restricted (DR) flies was associated with reduced metabolism (cluster 2), increased transport (cluster 11) and altered response to pathogens, albeit early in life (cluster 4) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Similarly to previous studies in mammals and other species, genes with increased levels in cluster 1 were enriched for stress response genes, whose expression rose at slower rate in DR flies, suggesting that improved homeostasis in these individuals may reduce the need for certain stress protection (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">de Magalhaes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Plank et al., 2012</a>). Another interesting observation was that all clusters, except for clusters 4 and 5, were enriched for non-overlapping GO terms, suggesting that the age-related changes in distinct biological processes proceeded synchronously.

First, for transcript changes, there were two types of diet-dependent effects: progressive, which differed at all age points (clusters 1\u20133, 8, 10 and 11) and intermittent which differed at some, but not all age points (clusters 6, 9 and 12). The diet-independent effects, however, predominated (68%) and fell into clusters 4, 5 and 7. Strikingly, we observed similar frequencies for age-related metabolites whereby clusters 2, 3, 6 and 10 can be categorized as diet-independent making up to 62% of total age-related signals common to both diets. The remaining fraction represented both progressive (clusters 4, 5, 7, 8, and 11) and intermittent (clusters 1, 9 and 12) effects. The diet-dependent differences in metabolite levels were more obvious after the clusters were separated into groups with below and above twofold inter-dietary difference (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The observed gradual, dynamic metabolome remodeling throughout lifespan, including both increases and decreases in metabolite signals, implied a role of predetermined, programmatic (but not necessarily programmed), genetically-defined aging (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pletcher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Somel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Magalhaes, 2012</a>). Importantly, similarities between their trajectories indicate that age-related metabolites effectively recapitulate gradual and continuous aging transitions. We propose that the vast majority of age-related metabolite trajectories are directly related to aging and may contribute to its manifestation and/or delay."

Interestingly, these age-related changes (both increases and decreases common to both diets) in either gene expression or metabolite levels were delayed in long-living flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Moreover, metabolome remodeling represented by these signals was decelerated with age within each dietary group (i.e., the signals initially showed robust changes, but then almost leveled off). Together with the analyses that revealed the diet-associated changes in the metabolome composition, these findings suggested that a change in lifespan involves both a delay in age-related metabolome and gene expression remodeling and a change in the set of expressed metabolites and genes at any point throughout lifespan. These data also resemble the metabolite diversity pattern (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and suggest a close relationship between activity-dependent damage accumulation and aging."

We addressed this by examining several metabolic pathways by screening for age-associated profiles among 205 annotated metabolites, which we recalled from nontargeted spectral features and confirmed using authentic in-house standards. Among these, 81 metabolites displayed age-associated trends under both dietary regimens (repeated one-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.05) and were associated with biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids, energy homeostasis, and damage production (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). As a whole, the clustering analysis by means of inter-dietary comparison of these age-associated molecules showed no prevalence for metabolite downregulation in flies from the dietary restricted regimen: there was nearly an equal frequency of diet-dependent to diet-independent effects (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Examination of the molecules within individual clusters (as they share similar age-related trajectories) led to several important observations. First, we find that, as in the case of nontargeted metabolite profiles, decreases of targeted signals were predominantly associated with lipids (cluster 1, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Eighty percent of metabolites in this cluster were triglycerides (TAGs) and diacylglycerols (DAGs), all of which normally rise highly during larval growth but decline thereafter (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>). The high developmental expression of these lipid species may explain their rapid drop during adulthood in our data, well before the first major change in survivorship curves. Such patterns are also present within decreasing clusters of nontargeted metabolites that contain a large number of metabolites from the lipid fraction (clusters 6, 8, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Also, the age-associated tendencies between our standard and DR-like regimens suggest increased synthesis (or reduced utilization) of lipids in long-living flies and agree with higher lipid stores and starvation resistance of DR flies in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Katewa et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, we observed a progressive age-associated increase in the cholesteryl esters in our long-living flies compared to controls (cluster 11). While accumulation of this lipid class has been inferred to negatively affect mammalian fitness (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lawton et al., 2008</a>), it may extend <i>Drosophila</i> lifespan via increased pathogen protection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caragata et al., 2013</a>). Second, consistent with the effects of dietary restriction, we find that downregulated metabolites in long-lived flies (clusters 5\u20138, n = 39) were associated with insulin signaling, energy homeostasis, and amino acid metabolism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Third, a striking observation was the elevation of methionine sulfoxide, which represents damage (<a href=\"#bib38\">Orentreich et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ruan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Koc et al., 2004</a>), and taurine, a product of cysteine degradation and a component of bile acids (<a href=\"#bib34\">Massie et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brosnan and Brosnan, 2006</a>), in long-lived but not in control flies (cluster 9, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). The levels of these molecules started to decline at the point corresponding to high mortality in both groups (at 40 and 50 days, respectively), which may be due to the low levels of these metabolites in cohorts surviving to old age (<a href=\"#bib11\">Curtsinger et al., 1992</a>). Tryptophan is also a lifespan limiting amino acid (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Marte and Enesco, 1986</a>) and a member of that cluster showing a similar pattern. Such bell-shaped lifespan-associated curves are not surprising as degradation of tryptophan and rise of the downstream metabolite kynurenine (also lifespan limiting metabolite [<a href=\"#bib40\">Oxenkrug et al., 2011</a>] expressed higher on the defined diet) were reported in older individuals (<a href=\"#bib37\">Moroni et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Frick et al., 2004</a>). In sum, the higher levels of methionine sulfoxide, tryptophan, and kynurenine in our long-living flies are consistent with the notion that lifespan extension by dietary restricted regimen may increase damage tolerance. We suggest that long-living species may also feature higher levels of lifespan-limiting molecules and that metabolome remodeling upon dietary interventions activates compensatory mechanisms. Whether this is broadly applicable to a variety of lifespan-extending conditions and to long-lived species is a possibility worth exploring."

Yet, individual damage forms, for example, damage caused by reactive oxygen species, proved to be both condition- and species-specific, challenging the relevance of damage accumulation to aging (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blagosklonny, 2008</a>). However, aging may be associated with cumulative damage, whereby mild effects of the myriad damage forms may exhibit additive effects on organism's fitness. In this case, increased mortality may be associated with inevitable accumulation of heterogeneous damage forms, which are also condition dependent. For example, in interventions that extend lifespan (e.g., dietary restriction) reduction of some damage forms may be compensated by accumulation of other forms of damage. In addition to the role of damage, the contribution of changes in the levels of purposely used metabolites remains unclear. An age-related remodeling has been described for transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome, but how these changes relate to each other and what the role of metabolome remodeling is in the progression of aging is not well understood."

Our initial observations showed that global metabolite profiling effectively recapitulated distinct stages of the aging process and revealed metabolites that strongly correlate with organismal survivorship. Specifically, analysis of nontargeted features showed a robust increase in the number of detected molecules as a function of age, followed by cessation of the increase in late life. This pattern corresponded to the transitions in the lifespan curves and was also in concert with the observed decelerated metabolome remodeling in late life, altogether supporting the idea that aging subsides at advanced ages. On the other hand, the increase in the number of detected metabolites clearly differed from general age-associated changes, and its commonalities in the two dietary conditions exclude the role of exogenous compounds. The extended metabolome composition may include by-products that affect viability and damage forms that reach and pass the detection thresholds during organism's aging (<a href=\"#bib43\">Phoenix and de Grey, 2007</a>), but they likely represent only the tip of the iceberg of cumulative damage. Further advances in instrumentation and sensitivity of metabolite profiling should expose additional metabolites that characterize cumulative damage."

                        "text": "We further followed age-related trajectories of 1066 individual metabolites common to short- and long-living flies and found that the trajectories of most metabolites correlated between the two dietary groups, yet varied in magnitude from initial to final concentration changes, suggesting that differences in accumulation of individual metabolites, in addition to the overall pattern, were responsible for lifespan differences. A substantial fraction of these signals showed biologically-relevant differences during aging and correlated with survivorship of flies. Metabolite trajectories were gradual and continuous starting from early adulthood, with very few signals showing mid-life reversals. These results are generally consistent with the observations from the studies on transcript and protein profiles across diverse aging populations (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pletcher et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Somel et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, our analysis of age-associated gene expression involving both control and dietary restricted long-lived individuals indicates that metabolites and transcripts exhibit nearly identical frequencies of diet-dependent to diet-independent effects. Thus, metabolites, similarly to genes, may exhibit diverse lifespan-regulatory roles. Similarly to targeted metabolite profiling in mammals (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tomas-Loba et al., 2013</a>), the gradual transitions in thousands of nontargeted metabolites may be used to derive a signature that predicts survivorship across variable lifespans. Consistent with this idea, we observed a delay in the age-associated changes in transcripts and metabolites in the case of longer-lived flies. Thus, a change in lifespan (here, in response to a dietary regimen, but this should also apply to longevity-related genetic manipulations and evolutionary processes that affect species lifespan) involves both a change in the expressed transcripts and metabolites at any time throughout lifespan and a delay in age-related changes for those transcripts and metabolites that commonly change with age in both conditions (or genotypes)."

Together with the component that reflects diet-specific patterns of metabolite change, it should help define the aging process in model systems and beyond. For instance, comparison of inter-dietary age-associated trajectories using known metabolites reveals that a fraction of downregulated signals were associated with slower metabolism in long-living flies. However, we also found that the molecular species with higher levels in long-living flies represented damage forms. While the inter-dietary differences for such increases were below twofold and varied in significance across age, the data nonetheless implies that lifespan extension may be associated with damage tolerance via compensatory mechanisms. In fact, long-living flies, when compared to control, featured a large set of nontargeted metabolites that increase at higher levels. How many of these metabolites represent damage will need to be determined through structural elucidation of nontargeted signals."

All data were acquired using an LC-MS system comprised of a Nexera X2 U-HPLC (Shimadzu, Marlborough, MA) and a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) analyses of water soluble metabolites in the positive ionization mode were carried out by extracting 10 \u00b5l homogenate using 90 \u00b5l of 74.9:24.9:0.2 vol/vol/vol acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid containing stable isotope-labeled internal standards (valine-d8, Isotec; and phenylalanine-d8, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Andover, MA). The samples were centrifuged (10 min, 9000\u00d7<i>g</i>, 4\u00b0C) and the supernatants were injected directly onto a 150 \u00d7 2 mm Atlantis HILIC column (Waters; Milford, MA). The column was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 250 \u00b5l/min with 5% mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in water) for 1 min followed by a linear gradient to 40% mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 10 min. The electrospray ionization voltage was 3.5 kV and data were acquired using full scan analysis over m/z 70\u2013800 at 70,000 resolution and a 3 Hz data acquisition rate. Negative ion mode analyses of polar metabolites were achieved using a HILIC method under basic conditions. Briefly, 30 \u00b5l homogenate was extracted using 120 \u00b5l of 80% methanol containing inosine-<sup>15</sup>N4, thymine-d4, and glycocholate-d4 internal standards (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories; Andover, MA).

MS full scan data were acquired over m/z 70\u2013800. The ionization source voltage is \u22123.0 kV and the source temperature is 325\u00b0C. Lipids were extracted from 10 \u00b5l of homogenate using 190 \u00b5l of isopropanol containing 1-dodecanoyl-2-tridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids; Alabaster, AL). After centrifugation, supernatants were injected directly onto a 150 \u00d7 3.0 mm Prosphere HP C4 column (Grace, Columbia, MD).

While such a trend is understandable, it is not obvious that the presented data cannot be explained by other aging hypotheses. Furthermore, authors would be advised to try to provide more evidence that metabolome changes and survival changes are really as well correlated as claimed. For instance, to provide additional support for the aging hypothesis promoted by the authors, one may need to show that differences in survival curves between dietary controlled animals and common animals can be linked with differences in the shapes of metabolite repertoire curves. It is not clear however, whether data provided by the authors could unambiguously support such a claim. Thus, in the absence of additional evidence, a much more balanced data interpretation considering other aging hypotheses would be advised."

Also, interestingly, the rate of metabolome changes is decelerated during aging, though such deceleration is not observed in gene expression (although the latter data is from another experiment). The authors further find higher levels of potentially damage-representing metabolites in long-lived DR flies, than standard diet fed flies, which they suggest could be explained by extra stress resistance of DR flies."

While such a trend is understandable, it is not obvious that the presented data cannot be explained by other aging hypotheses. Furthermore, authors would be advised to try to provide more evidence that metabolome changes and survival changes are really as well correlated as claimed. For instance, to provide additional support for the aging hypothesis promoted by the authors, one may need to show that differences in survival curves between dietary controlled animals and common animals can be linked with differences in the shapes of metabolite repertoire curves. It is not clear however, whether data provided by the authors could unambiguously support such a claim.

In addition, selected damage markers (e.g. DNA mutation rate, lipofuscin accumulation, ROS levels, etc.) are insufficient for assessing cumulative damage and their resolution is too low at the moment to conclude on the pattern of changes (beyond the fact that damage increases with age). In our study, we attempt to address these deficiencies by using non-targeted metabolite profiling and including multiple late time points to decipher the patterns of metabolite damage and their relationship to metabolism.

We are familiar with the nice meta-analysis study mentioned by the reviewer as well as with another one by Plank et al. and also with the datasets from Pletcher, Tower and Khaitovich groups and many others. Similarly, studies on aging DNA methylomes (e.g., Hannum et al. Mol Cell 2013) show bi-directional changes, for which additional evidence implicates some of them as adaptive. However, unlike bi-directional changes in the regulatory and/or responsive pathways the damage pattern is largely unidirectional and is always rising (e.g., oxidative damage, somatic DNA mutations, protein aggregates, etc. all rise with age). In our study, we show that metabolite diversity rises with age and the rises are largely represented by low abundance molecules. These considerations argue that the observed changes in metabolite diversity expose cumulative damage. In contrast, an analysis of non-targeted metabolites with steady diversity (ones detected in all ages) and known metabolites shows that they have bi-directional changes. We can only argue that this second type of change in metabolomes reflects biological activity (possibly adaptive responses too) and they should not be fully regarded as damage. We have made a distinction between the two by adding the following statement (Results): \u201dAmong signals consistently detected in all aging samples (those showing no difference in diversity) there may be metabolites that are passengers or drivers of the aging process which would be similar to the genes with age-associated differential expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al. 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">de Magalhaes et al. 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Plank et al. 2012</a>)\u201d We also commented on a possibility of adaptive changes contributing to the observed changes in metabolites."

For example, five molecules of a by-product produced by an enzyme during lifetime of a cell would not be \u201cseen\u201d by evolution, would not be detected by analytical methods, and would not show measurable role in aging when taken in isolation, but they would contribute, with the millions of other five-molecule by-product forms, to cumulative damage.

Also, interestingly, the rate of metabolome changes is decelerated during aging, though such deceleration is not observed in gene expression (although the latter data is from another experiment).

Unlike systemic changes that are bi-directional (increases and decreases) we observe a very negligible decrease in metabolite diversity and instead see a strong and prominent increase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This would be analogous to the age-associated rise in DNA mutations, except in our case we cover a much larger repertoire of molecular targets. This allows us to monitor the rate of cumulative damage, and this is more accurate that using limited set of damage markers reported in previous studies."
