However, finding new components or mechanisms of such systems is extremely time-consuming due to the low efficiency of currently available functional screening techniques. To overcome such obstacles, we utilize pan-neuronal calcium imaging to broadly screen the activity of the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system in response to thermal stimuli. A single pass of the screening procedure can identify much of the previously reported thermosensory circuitry as well as identify several unreported thermosensory neurons. Among the newly discovered neural functions, we investigated in detail the role of the AWC<sup>OFF</sup> neuron in thermal nociception. Combining functional calcium imaging and behavioral assays, we show that AWC<sup>OFF</sup> is essential for avoidance behavior following noxious heat stimulation by modifying the forward-to-reversal behavioral transition rate. We also show that the AWC<sup>OFF</sup> signals adapt to repeated noxious thermal stimuli and quantify the corresponding behavioral adaptation."

However, finding new components or mechanisms of such systems is extremely time-consuming due to the low efficiency of currently available functional screening techniques. To overcome such obstacles, we utilize pan-neuronal calcium imaging to broadly screen the activity of the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system in response to thermal stimuli. A single pass of the screening procedure can identify much of the previously reported thermosensory circuitry as well as identify several unreported thermosensory neurons. Among the newly discovered neural functions, we investigated in detail the role of the AWC<sup>OFF</sup> neuron in thermal nociception. Combining functional calcium imaging and behavioral assays, we show that AWC<sup>OFF</sup> is essential for avoidance behavior following noxious heat stimulation by modifying the forward-to-reversal behavioral transition rate. We also show that the AWC<sup>OFF</sup> signals adapt to repeated noxious thermal stimuli and quantify the corresponding behavioral adaptation."

Our current understanding of its neural functions involves three major levels of hierarchical systems: genes, neurons, and behaviors. In the neuroscience of <i>C. elegans</i>, the most common approach to study neural functions is to apply a perturbation at the genetic or cellular level through techniques such as mutation, cell-ablation, or optogenetic stimulation, and then screen the worm at the behavioral level. Although proven to be effective, this approach is far from ideal because the behavioral screening is performed in a different hierarchical level than the level at which the perturbation was initially applied (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999</a>). The general difficulty in making connections between these different hierarchies has hindered our ability to elucidate neural mechanisms connecting genes to behavior in <i>C. elegans</i> despite its extreme simplicity."

Through the power of optogenetics, it has become possible to make parallel measurements of multiple neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> via 3D imaging of calcium activities (<a href=\"#bib24\">Prevedel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Schr\u00f6del et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kato et al., 2015</a>). More recent work describes methods to record pan-neuronal activities in moving worms using spinning disk confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#bib33\">Venkatachalam et al., 2016</a>). Here we have taken an integrated approach and developed a pan-neuronal functional screening system in which the neural activities from many of the neurons are recorded concurrently in an intact animal in response to precisely applied thermal stimuli, similar to previously reported systems with some customization to meet our experimental needs. We then connected these signals to behavioral outputs by repeating the thermal stimuli in carefully quantified behavioral assays."

Unlike most other pair-wise neurons, AWC neurons are functionally asymmetric: the AWC<sup>ON</sup> neuron senses butanone odor, and AWC<sup>OFF</sup> senses 2,3-pentanedione, while both neurons symmetrically sense benzaldehyde and isoamyl alcohol (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wes and Bargmann, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>), which are essential for proper chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mori and Ohshima, 1995</a>)."

As for the sensory neuron AWC, there have been some contradicting reports in terms of its involvement in thermosensation and thermotaxis. One group reports that AWC exhibits AFD-like continuous calcium transients in temperature ramps, and that its thresholds depend on the previously exposed temperature (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kuhara et al., 2008</a>). Another group also reports AWC\u2019s role in thermosensation but their calcium transients are more similar to interneuron AIY signaling (Figure 2B), in the way that they consist of short stochastic transients whose frequency responds to the previous temperature (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biron et al., 2008</a>). Also there is an electrophysiological study which detected no membrane current in AWC neurons in the thermal ramps (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ramot et al., 2008</a>). A more recent study states that removal of AWC by laser ablation or cell-specific recCaspase expression results in no significant disruption either in positive or negative thermotaxis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Luo et al., 2014</a>)."

However, when we applied either a very fast temperature rise (a few degrees in less than 50\u00a0ms) or high absolute temperature (33\u00b0C), we detected very deterministic AWC signals that are asymmetric in AWC<sup>ON</sup> and AWC<sup>OFF</sup>: the calcium transients in AWC<sup>OFF</sup> neurons are always positively correlated to the nociceptive thermal stimuli whereas the transients in AWC<sup>ON</sup> neurons are negatively correlated. This novel activity was then tested in freely moving animals in which the nociceptive stimulation was applied to further investigate their role in physiological behaviors utilizing asymmetry mutants and laser ablation of AWCs. Indeed, the thermal avoidance behavior, which has been linked to the activities in the AFD, FLP, PVD, and PHC neurons (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mohammadi et al., 2013</a>) is also strongly coupled to the AWC<sup>OFF</sup> neurons but not AWC<sup>ON</sup>. By combining pan-neuronal calcium imaging with our novel behavioral analyses, we found that the AWC<sup>OFF</sup> neuron is essential and sufficient for noxious heat sensation and the subsequent avoidance behavior."

As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2006</a>), we detected very strong and deterministic signals in the nuclei of AFD thermosensory neurons, when we gradually increased the worm\u2019s temperature, consistent with a dependence on the cultivation temperature (T<sub>C</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, top, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also detected similar but smaller signals from the nuclei of AIY interneurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, second), as shown previously, confirming the efficacy of this approach (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2006</a>). We then screened for temperature-dependent signal changes in previously unreported neurons. One notable neuron was the GABAergic RIS neuron, which previously has been linked to quiescence but not thermosensation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Turek et al., 2013</a>). Unlike AFD or AIY neurons, the signals from the RIS neuron are broad and less consistent, but they are nonetheless dependent on the previously exposed temperature on average, and start to rise about 3\u00b0C above the T<sub>C</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, third). RIS is one example in this screening, and there were other neurons such as RMDV and SMDV, which showed negative correlation to the AFD or RIS activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pan-neuronal functional screen in finding novel neural functions in response to external perturbations."

Instead of a thermoelectric heat pump, we used a focused infrared laser (1440 nm) to rapidly heat up the head region of <i>C. elegans</i>.

To reveal such subtle differences in behavior, we calculated the mean transition rates between all four behavioral states for all strains. We found that for the <i>nsy-1</i> mutant, the forward-to-reversal (FR) transitions during the first heating phase were reduced compared to the N2 wild-type and <i>nsy-7</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure\u00a04D</a>). It seems that the <i>nsy-1</i> mutation also affects the reversal-to-forward (RF) transition rates (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), thus resulting in apparently wild-type reversal fraction. To visualize such complex relations between the behaviors and mutations, we generated network graphs of the major behaviors, in which the nodes represent the behavioral fractions and the edges represent transition rates (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The graphs indicate that the apparent reduction of the turn fraction in <i>nsy-1</i> is due to the balanced reduction in both the FR and the reversal-to-turn (RT) transitions. Likewise, the apparent similarity in the reversal fraction in <i>nsy-1</i> is the result of the reduction in both the FR and the RF transition as mentioned above. The <i>nsy-1</i> mutation did not significantly affect the turn-to-forward (TF) transition."

In order to reinforce this hypothesis, we focused on this FR transition and sought to observe altered reversal behaviors by inflicting instantaneous noxious stimuli on the worms. In order to perform this task, we have developed a worm-tracking system with a 1440\u2009nm laser and galvanometer scanners on which a freely crawling worm can be programmatically zapped at a precise time and body location. A 100 ms laser pulse (50 mA) heats a small region (150\u00a0\u00b5m) ~1.2\u00b0C above the ambient temperature (23\u00b0C). A heating pulse with these parameters to the head region of a worm causes a deterministic noxious avoidance response: a long reversal locomotion usually followed by an omega turn. We tested whether there is any abnormality in this avoidance behavior among the AWC asymmetry mutants."

Up until now, much effort has been spent on finding such causative correlations by first screening for abnormal behaviors among mutants, making educated guesses as to which neurons were responsible for the abnormality, and then generating transgenic animals that express functional probes such as a fluorescent calcium indicator in the candidate neurons. Only after this lengthy process could one start looking at specific neurons for the evidence of neural mechanisms. If there were no difference in the neural activities of the candidate neurons in the mutants, then the whole process would have to be repeated.

If correlations between the applied perturbation and neural activities can be identified, it is relatively easy to functionally manipulate the network by using readily available techniques such as cell-specific mutations, cell ablations, and optogenetics, in order to reveal the neural mechanisms. With a pan-neuronal approach, the critical steps can be performed within the same level of the system\u2019s hierarchy, thus facilitating the interpretation of the results. Once the responsible neurons are identified for the perturbation, one can proceed to behavioral assays using similar stimuli, and identify the behavioral outputs to complete the mapping of the entire signal transduction from the external perturbation to behavioral output via the identified neuronal circuitry."

For the transition rates of the behaviors in the plate-heating experiment, the genetic conversion of AWC<sup>OFF</sup> to AWC<sup>ON</sup> resulted in reduced FR, RF, and RT transitions and the mutation also caused an overall reduction of omega turns. Moreover, for the head-directed laser stimulation assay, the duration of the escape response (reversal) was reduced only when AWC<sup>OFF</sup>\u00a0was absent. In the previous studies concerning olfactory functions in AWC neurons, AWC<sup>OFF</sup> was implicated in detecting the removal of attractive odor, and in activating a local search behavior consisting of reversal and omega turns (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). Our findings are in good agreement with the previous ones in that both in the olfactory and nociceptive sensation, AWC<sup>OFF</sup> is required for reversal locomotion and omega turns."

The plate-heating behavioral measurement of <i>nsy-7</i> implied a slightly elevated reversal fraction with decreased RF and TF transition rates during nociceptive stimulation.

This is only a speculation since we did not detect strong nuclear calcium signals in AWC neurons in the physiological temperatures using our pan-neuronal calcium indicators.

Our imaging is done while the worm is paralyzed and in principle the signals we see here might be different than those in a freely behaving worm. However, this is why we follow up with detailed behavioral measurement using similar thermal stimuli on freely moving worms, so we can connect neuronal function with behavioral output. Recent work has demonstrated measuring calcium signals in freely behaving worms (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nguyen et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Venkatachalam et al., 2016</a>) and so a completely integrated experiment with the detailed signal and behavioral measurements shown here is certainly possible. Also, our pan-neuronal calcium indicators are localized only to the nuclei and so we miss a number of functional signals that are located in the cytoplasm, perhaps far distal to the cell body. Furthermore, vigorous research is currently taking place to improve the performance of functional fluorescent indicators. Newer indicators such as GCaMP6 might reveal neuronal signals with more detail due to the difference in their physical properties such as calcium dissociation constant, which might be more suitable for some neurons in <i>C. elegans</i>. We proceeded here with this limitation because we knew that cellular identification and segmentation would be challenging, and after identifying neuronal candidates we follow up with traditional cytoplasmic calcium indicator expression and measurement. As the computational process of segmentation advances, future research may try to express the calcium indicators in some of the interneurons in other subcellular compartments such as the cell body and neurites. In such scenario, one should perhaps use calcium indicators with different fluorescence wavelengths to differentiate the neural fibers that are located closer than the diffraction limit of visible light. Alternatively, superresolution microscopy may be utilized to resolve the congested neural fibers, so that the pan-neuronal imaging might be practicable without relying on the nuclear expression of the indicators."

Briefly, starting from all the pixels in the first image, the computed GVF is used to find the initial location of all the neurons. A small region is cropped out from the center of each neuron in the next image, and the local flow tracking is performed in the cropped region. The local flow tracking is repeated until the last image for all the initial neurons. The acquired time series were resampled by linear interpolation for statistical analyses. Mean calcium activity and standard errors were calculated after they were normalized to the minimum of the time series, which is usually the baseline of the transients. For population behavioral analyses, transition time points were extracted first, then the length of behavior immediately before the transition was measured. Inverse of the pre-transition duration is the rate of transition. Average transition rates were calculated by harmonic mean, and corresponding standard deviation by jackknife estimation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lam et al., 1985</a>). For statistical comparison of two means, we employed the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test to see if they have significant difference. As for the error bars in the plots, we used 83.4% confidence interval to visualize the statistical difference of the means (non-overlapping 83.4% CIs correspond to P-value being &lt;0.05)."

These devices were used synchronously to rapidly heat a 10 cm agar pad for the delivery of noxious heat stimuli. A sCMOS camera (pco.edge, PCO, Kelheim, Germany), an LED illuminator (120LED, X-Cite), and the temperature controller were connected to a PC and controlled by a software package (available upon request) written in MATLAB. Temperature of the agar was carefully calibrated, monitored, and automatically adjusted during the assay. About 20 worms were washed twice with M9 buffer matching the T<sub>C</sub>, and carefully transferred to the agar pad by a siliconized pipette tip. Excess liquid was removed by gentle puff of nitrogen. We let worms crawl around for 5 min before the start of acquisition. The image stream was saved as a raw binary on an SSD RAID system for maximum possible frame rate and resolution (20 fps, 2048 x 2048). A GUI based script was developed to quickly go through the image stream to manually label the worm\u2019s behavior frame by frame."

Two galvanometer scanners (GVS002, Thorlabs), an analog output module (NI 9263, National Instruments), a fiber-coupled IR laser (FOL1404QQM-617-1440, Fitel), a laser diode controller (LDC240C, Thorlabs), and a temperature controller (TED350, Thorlabs) were added to steer and deliver an IR laser beam with high precision. A laboratory-developed software package in LabVIEW (National Instruments) controls all the devices, acquires images, recognizes a freely-moving worm, continuously moves the stage for tracking, and steers galvanometer scanners to deliver IR zaps to the head region of the worm. 100\u00a0ms, 50\u2013250\u00a0mA laser zaps were used as noxious heat stimuli.

Most of the transgenes used in this study were prepared either by PCR fusion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hobert, 2002</a>) or the Gateway system (MultiSite Gateway, Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts). For a list of strains, recombination sites, genotyping conditions, and primers used in this study, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>. Microinjection was performed essentially same as previously established (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mello and Fire, 1995</a>), with a micromanipulator (MO-202U, Narishige, East Meadow, New York), and microinjector (PLI-100, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts) on an inverted microscope (TE2000E, Nikon). The injection needle (fire polished aluminosilicate glass with filament, O.D.: 1.0 mm and I.D.: 0.64 mm, AF100-64-10, Sutter) was pulled with a micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter, Novato, California) with the following parameters (P = 999, Heat=482, Vel = 50, and Time = 250): this combination produces vastly superior injection needles both in durability and sharpness to conventional borosilicate ones described elsewhere. Cell ablation assays were performed essentially same as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bargmann and Avery, 1995</a>), with a UV laser (DUO-220, Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, California), laser dye (10 mM coumarin 440, A9891, Sigma), and an objective lens (Plan Apo 100x Oil NA 1.40, Nikon). Transgenic L2-L3 worms were transferred to a coverslip and anesthetized with 20 mM levamisole (31742, Sigma-Aldrich). A small number (100\u20131000) of 25 \u00b5m microbeads (07313, Polysciences, Warrington, Pennsylvania) were added as spacers between the coverslips to prevent the squashing of the worms. We found this method to be better than the traditional technique, which uses a high concentration of agarose, because it had slower dehydration levels and was easier to set up. Because AWC neurons are located in the outermost region, it is easier and effective to kill the neuron closer to the objective first, and then simply flip the coverslip sandwich for the neuron on the other side."

This claim to a novel screening method mars an otherwise great scientific publication. The paper should instead strictly focus on the scientific findings of asymmetric roles for the AWCs in thermal nociception. Specifically, it is recommended that the authors remove the claim of novelty in developing a \"pan-neuronal functional screening system\" (Introduction, second paragraph) by looking at pan-neuronal calcium responses in response to stimuli. The concept is obvious but, avoiding such discussions, this \"technique\" was pioneered initially by Kato et al. in their 2015 Cell publication \"Global Brain Dynamics Embed the Motor Command Sequence of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>\" wherein a pan-neuronal calcium signal is screened during fictive locomotory behavior and the active neurons identified through fluorescent reporters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> of the Kato paper)."
