The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIE consists of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Here we have identified and characterised the function of the TFIIE\u03b2 homologue in archaea that on the primary sequence level is related to the RNAPIII subunit hRPC39. Both archaeal TFE\u03b2 and hRPC39 harbour a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster, which is crucial for heterodimerization of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 and its engagement with the RNAP clamp. TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stabilises the preinitiation complex, enhances DNA melting, and stimulates abortive and productive transcription. These activities are strictly dependent on the \u03b2 subunit and the promoter sequence. Our results suggest that archaeal TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 is likely to represent the evolutionary ancestor of TFIIE-like factors in extant eukaryotes."

The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIE consists of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Here we have identified and characterised the function of the TFIIE\u03b2 homologue in archaea that on the primary sequence level is related to the RNAPIII subunit hRPC39. Both archaeal TFE\u03b2 and hRPC39 harbour a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster, which is crucial for heterodimerization of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 and its engagement with the RNAP clamp. TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stabilises the preinitiation complex, enhances DNA melting, and stimulates abortive and productive transcription. These activities are strictly dependent on the \u03b2 subunit and the promoter sequence. Our results suggest that archaeal TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 is likely to represent the evolutionary ancestor of TFIIE-like factors in extant eukaryotes."

But several recent discoveries suggest that the origin of the eukaryotes lies within the archaeal domain. The genetic material of all of these living organisms is made up of DNA, and genes within DNA contain the instructions to make other biological molecules. Making these molecules involves first copying these instructions into a molecule of RNA via a process called transcription."

Archaea and bacteria have a single type of RNAP, whereas all eukaryotes have at least four different kinds of RNAP. The RNAPs found in archaea share many common features with their eukaryotic counterparts. In both cases, the RNAPs do not work alone. Instead, a class of proteins known as transcription factors assist in the first step of the transcription process. One of the eukarotyic RNAPs, termed RNAP II, works with a transcription factor that contains two protein subunits (called TFIIE\u03b1 and TFIIE\u03b2). While the archaeal counterpart for TFIIE\u03b1 (called TFE\u03b1) is known, the counterpart for TFIIE\u03b2 is not."

Further analyses show that the TFE\u03b2 protein is actually related to a protein subunit that is unique to RNAP III, another eukarotyic RNAP. Both of these proteins contain clusters of iron and sulphur. Blombach et al. also found that these iron-sulphur clusters enable TFE\u03b2 to bind to its TFE\u03b1 partner to form a transcription factor that can interact with the RNAP and help it to carry out transcription."

                        "text": "The conserved core of the archaeal and eukaryotic transcription machineries encompasses a highly complex multisubunit RNAP as well as evolutionary conserved transcription factors that govern its activities through the transcription cycle. The minimal requirements for promoter-directed and start site-specific transcription are identical for the RNAPII system in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Parvin and Sharp, 1993</a>) and the RNAP of archaea (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hausner et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Qureshi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Werner and Weinzierl, 2002</a>). Two basal transcription factors, TBP (<span class=\"underline\">T</span>ATA-<span class=\"underline\">b</span>inding <span class=\"underline\">p</span>rotein) and TFB (TFIIB in eukaryotes), are necessary and sufficient to initiate transcription in archaea in vitro. TBP and TFB facilitate promoter recognition and the recruitment of RNAP (<a href=\"#bib50\">Werner and Grohmann, 2011</a>). In archaea as well as eukaryotes a third factor TFE (TFIIE) enhances the next step in initiation, the transition of the closed to the open complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Holstege et al., 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Werner and Weinzierl, 2005</a>). Eukaryotic TFIIE is a heterodimer composed of subunits TFIIE\u03b1 and TFIIE\u03b2 in humans (Tfa1 and 2 in yeast). Archaeal TFE (hereafter referred to as TFE\u03b1) is monomeric and homologous to TFIIE\u03b1, but lacks its C-terminal acidic domain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hanzelka et al., 2001</a>). To date no archaeal homologue of TFIIE\u03b2 has been identified. During open complex formation the DNA strands are separated (melted) and the template strand is loaded into the active centre of RNAP. Similar to TFIIE, TFE\u03b1 facilitates open complex formation by directly interacting with the non-template DNA strand (NTS), and via an allosteric mechanism that is likely to involve structural changes in the RNAP clamp and stalk (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grohmann et al., 2011</a>). While in archaea the closed-to-open complex transition occurs spontaneously (<a href=\"#bib51\">Werner and Weinzierl, 2002</a>), on most eukaryotic RNAPII promoters it is dependent on the translocase activity of TFIIH (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guzman and Lis, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fishburn et al., 2015</a>). However, the dependency on TFIIH changes with DNA template topology. Strand separation and subsequent initiation from linear DNA templates strictly depends on TFIIH, but for some promoters this requirement can be overcome by using negatively supercoiled DNA templates (<a href=\"#bib39\">Parvin and Sharp, 1993</a>). Under these conditions DNA melting is weakly stimulated by TFIIE, an effect that is obscured by the strong melting activity of TFIIH (<a href=\"#bib24\">Holstege et al., 1995</a>). Since TFIIH is not strictly essential for RNAPII initiation per se, similar molecular mechanisms are likely to operate during open complex formation of archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs. The archaeal model systems provide a distinct advantage in this respect allowing us to study how TFIIE/TFE facilitates DNA melting in the absence of a TFIIH-like factor."

The common past of all types of nuclear eukaryotic RNAP systems is reflected in the sequence, structure and function of RNAP subunits and associated basal transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</a>). TFIIE is a prominent example of this relationship. The human RNAPIII subunits hRPC62/39 (C82/34 in yeast) are positioned at the periphery of RNAPIII nearly identical to the binding site of TFIIE on RNAPII (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vannini and Cramer, 2012</a>). TFE\u03b1, TFIIE\u03b1 and hRPC62 contain homologous winged helix (WH) domains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carter and Drouin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lef\u00e8vre et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

The origin and evolution of these factors and their role in the multiplication of parallel transcription systems in eukaryotes has remained elusive."

While we found no evidence that the RNAP, TBP or TFB1 co-purified with Sso0944, TFE\u03b1 co-eluted with Sso0944, indicating that TFE\u03b1 and Sso0944 are associated in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Sypro Ruby-stained SDS-PAGE of the affinity-purified material demonstrates that the polypeptides form a dimeric complex, that is, their association is not dependent on additional factors (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To rule out the possibility that the affinity tag of Sso0944 prevented its stable association with the RNAP we fractionated a wild type <i>S. solfataricus</i> P2 cell lysate by size exclusion chromatography and analysed the fractions using immunodetection. The elution profile of endogenous Sso0944 overlapped with that of TFE\u03b1 consistent with a heterodimeric TFE\u03b1/Sso0944 complex of 36.1 kDa. The elution profile of TFE\u03b1 was somewhat broader indicating that part of TFE\u03b1 might be present in the monomeric form. RNAP eluted in earlier fractions corresponding to its molecular weight of approximately 400 kDa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As Sso0944 is not stably incorporated into RNAP in contrast to the related RNAPIII subunit hRPC39, but rather forms a complex with TFE\u03b1, we renamed the archaeal protein TFE\u03b2."

                                "text": "In order to carry out a structure-function analysis of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 we expressed and purified a recombinant form of the TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 complex in in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Concentrated recombinant TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 has a dark brown colour and its absorption spectrum displays a shoulder at 410 nm that is characteristic for iron-sulphur cluster harbouring proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In order to define the origin of this absorption more precisely we recorded continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-EPR) spectra. The profile of the cw-EPR spectrum with a g-value of 2.01, its sensitivity to the reducing agent sodium dithionite and the sharp decrease in signal at temperatures above 20 K are consistent with a signal corresponding to a cubane [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Double integration and comparison with a spin standard indicate a low cluster-occupancy of approximately 4%, which is in contrast to the strong 410 nm signal in the absorption spectrum. It is common that before reduction aerobically prepared proteins containing [4Fe-4S] clusters display a [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> signal due to oxidative impairment (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beinert et al., 1996</a>). Addition of a reducing agent often results in the disappearance of the signal of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster concomitant with the appearance of the signal from the intact [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster. Here, however, only the former effect is observed: [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> clusters may not be reduced\u2014and remain EPR-silent\u2014if the redox potential is lower than that of the reducing agent (dithionite), or if the rate of reduction is too slow. Alternatively the reduced [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster could be present in a high spin state, which could give rise to a signal too broad to be detected. To investigate the presence of an EPR-silent [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster, we recorded native mass spectra (MS) of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). The spectrum contained two major species one with a mass of 21,236.6 Da and the other with a mass of 36,530.8 Da. The former corresponds to the expected mass for TFE\u03b1 with a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion bound by its zinc ribbon (ZR) domain while the later corresponds to the mass of the TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 harbouring a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion and a [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster. Given that the TFE\u03b1 ZR harbours a Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion, the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster must be coordinated by the four cysteines in the C-terminal domain of TFE\u03b2. As this domain is highly conserved in human hRPC39 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), we examined the human protein for the presence of an equivalent FeS cluster. Similar to archaeal TFE\u03b2, the human hRPC62/C39 complex shows an absorption spectrum with a shoulder at 410 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>); its cw-EPR signature is characteristic for a [3Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> cluster with low occupancy (&lt;3%) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The native mass spectrum this time revealed three major species with masses of 35,555.7, 62,516.3 and 98,455.5 Da corresponding to hRPC39, hRPC62 and hRPC62/C39 complex bound to a [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Tandem MS experiments revealed that the cluster was bound to hRPC39 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>)."

In order to characterise the interaction network between the domains in the TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimer, we tested the dimerization properties of domain deletion and substitution variants using a metal affinity co-purification approach and a His-tagged TFE\u03b2 variant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The input fractions show that all mutant variants were expressed in a soluble and heat-stable form with the exception of TFE\u03b2 \u03941\u201384. The TFE\u03b1 WH domain is essential for dimerization (\u03941\u2013110), while the ZR domain is dispensable (\u0394114\u2013147, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, the WH alone is not sufficient for dimerization (\u0394111\u2013178), but requires the C-terminal tail (\u0394148\u2013178) for interaction with TFE\u03b2. The ZR domain of <i>Sso</i> TFE\u03b1 includes only three of the four conserved cysteine residues that coordinate the Zn ion in archaeal TFE\u03b1 and eukaryotic TFIIE\u03b1. In line with the ZR being dispensable, mutation of the unpaired cysteine in TFE\u03b1 (C117S) does not impair complex formation with TFE\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In yeast TFIIE, the N-terminal tip of \u03b1-helix 3 of the Tfa1 WH domain is essential for dimerization (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gr\u00fcnberg et al., 2012</a>). We tested whether the corresponding region in the TFE\u03b1 WH domain is essential for TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 dimerization by introducing point mutations (K46E, D49T, R51E/K52E) or deleting the entire region (\u039446\u201352) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). None of these mutations abrogated dimerization with TFE\u03b2, which reflects that the interaction network differs between yeast TFIIE and TFE\u03b1/\u03b2."

The same \u22124/\u22121 pre-melted T6 promoter template was used in EMSA and permanganate assays, which accordingly result in a strong signal at \u22121. The ternary complex (DNA-TBP-TFB) gives in addition, and to a much lesser extent, a signal at \u22125 likely due to thermal breathing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The inclusion of RNAP displayed a similar pattern, while the addition of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 led to new strong signals at \u22125, \u22127 and \u221212, which reflects that the factor stimulates open complex formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Deletion of the TFE\u03b2 WH or the TFE\u03b1 ZR domain did not perturb the promoter opening activity of the TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 complex, while TFE\u03b1 was inactive, congruent with its lack of PIC stabilisation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Similar experiments with two other \u22124/\u22121-premelted endogenous promoters from <i>Sso</i> (<i>Sso</i> Rpo5 and <i>Sso</i> tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>) confirmed that TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 strongly enhances open complex formation up to position +4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The WH domains of TFE\u03b2, hRPC39/C34 and TFIIE\u03b2/Tfa2 show little conservation, but they commonly carry sets of lysine residues in the wing formed by the two C-terminal \u03b2-strands and the loop between them (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) that may play a role in electrostatic interactions with the phosphate-backbone of the NTS. We generated two charge reversal mutations in the TFE\u03b2 WH domain, K56E/K57E and K64E. In EMSA experiments, both mutants showed reduced stimulation in PIC formation when compared to WT TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In permanganate footprinting assays both mutants supported open complex formation similar to WT TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 or TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 \u0394WH (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

We compared the viral T6 and five cellular promoters of protein encoding genes (<i>Sso</i> EF-1\u03b1, <i>Sso</i> SSB, and <i>Sso</i> Rpo5), as well as noncoding RNA genes (<i>Sso</i> tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and 16S/23S rRNA) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). On all tested promoters the addition of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulated transcription by approximately twofold to fourfold, with the strong T6 and 16S/23S rRNA promoters showing a weaker response (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that the stimulation of transcription by TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 is dependent on the sequence of the promoter. Considering that TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulates DNA melting we hypothesised that the initially melted region of the promoter (\u221212 to +4) determines the amplitude of the stimulation. We generated hybrid promoters encompassing the TATA-box and surrounding region (position \u221246 to \u221213) of the weakly stimulated 16S/23S rRNA promoter with the initially melted and transcribed regions of the stronger stimulated <i>Sso</i> tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> (\u221212 to +5) or EF-1\u03b1 promoters (\u221212 to +7). In absence of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 the hybrid promoters show reduced activity compared to the wild-type rRNA promoter underlining that the initially melted region contributes to the strength of the ribosomal promoter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). In line with our hypothesis TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulated transcription on the two hybrid promoters to greater extent when compared to the wild-type rRNA promoter, confirming that the sequence of the initially melted region determines the extent of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulation.

The gene encoding TFE\u03b2 is essential in <i>S. acidocaldarius</i> and most likely this is true for crenarchaea in general given its strict conservation in the crenarchaeal phylum. On the sequence level TFE\u03b2 is homologous to the eukaryotic RNAPIII subunit hRPC39 and we show that both <i>Sso</i> TFE\u03b2 and human hRPC39 harbour a cubane FeS cluster at their C-termini. Several proteins involved in nucleic acid metabolism have been reported to harbour FeS clusters including multi-subunit RNAPs and TFIIH subunit XPD/Rad3 (<a href=\"#bib53\">White and Dillingham, 2012</a>). Notably, the <i>Sso</i> RNAP subunit Rpo3 includes a structural [4Fe-4S] cluster that is highly stable under aerobic conditions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hirata et al., 2008</a>). Although TFE\u03b2 could be purified under aerobic conditions with high FeS cluster occupancy, the FeS cluster was lost within a few hours, as apparent from the decolouration of the protein preparation. Furthermore, oxidation with ferricyanide oxidation causes destruction of the TFE\u03b2 cluster (data not shown). This difference between the two FeS clusters in <i>Sso</i> RNAP and TFE\u03b2 likely reflects different functions. The FeS cluster in the catalytic subunit of yeast DNA Polymerase Pol \u03b4 is essential for the interaction with its two auxiliary subunits Pol31 and Pol32 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Netz et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, the FeS cluster is required for TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 dimerization and cluster damage results in its dissociation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Our results demonstrate that steady-state levels of TFE\u03b2 are depleted in the stationary phase\u2014the FeS cluster in TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 may provide a handle for fast inactivation of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 during stress response. In line with this hypothesis we found oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide leads to rapid depletion of <i>Sso</i> TFE\u03b2 (data not shown)."

The position of euryarchaeal TFE\u03b1 on the RNAP clamp and Rpo4/7 stalk has previously been mapped in the context of the complete PIC from the euryarchaeote <i>M. jannaschii</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grohmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nagy et al., 2015</a>).

The proximity of <i>M. jannaschii</i> TFE\u03b1 WH with the NTS at position \u221212 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grohmann et al., 2011</a>) and the location of the human TFIIE\u03b2 WH across the DNA binding channel (<a href=\"#bib22\">He et al., 2013</a>) suggest that TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 modulates the handling of the DNA strands by RNAP, for example, during DNA melting and open complex formation. Our permanganate footprinting experiments suggest that TFE\u03b1/\u03b2, and not TFE\u03b1, triggers DNA melting creating a bubble ranging in its extremes from position +4 to \u221212 position relative to the TSS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). TFE\u03b1/\u03b2, but not TFE\u03b1, stimulates the formation of the first phosphodiester bond in an abortive transcription assay as well as productive transcription. The stimulatory effect of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 on DNA melting and productive transcription appears not to depend on the TFE\u03b1 ZR and TFE\u03b2 WH domains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6C, 7E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, in experiments monitoring PIC formation using EMSA that relies to a greater extent on complex stability (as the complexes have to remain intact during electrophoresis), deletion of either TFE\u03b1 ZR or TFE\u03b2 WH strongly reduces PIC stability (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Similarly, stable interaction with the RNAP clamp depends on the TFE\u03b1 ZR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This suggests that the core TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 composed of the TFE\u03b1 WH and the TFE\u03b2 FeS domains can trigger DNA melting and thereby stimulate transcription initiation. The TFE\u03b1 ZR or TFE\u03b2 WH domains bring addition stability to the complex that becomes crucial in the cellular context. In line with a stabilizing role for the ZR domain, mutation of the cysteine residues in the yeast Tfa1 ZR in vivo confer a thermosensitive phenotype (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuldell and Buratowski, 1997</a>)."

While hRPC39 as part of RNAPIII plays a role in the specific recruitment of RNAPIII to its noncoding RNA gene promoters, the hRPC39-like archaeal TFE\u03b2 clearly acts as a general transcription initiation factor stimulating transcription from all promoters tested. Our results show that the steady state levels of TFE\u03b2 are drastically reduced in stationary phase compared to exponential growth phase, in contrast to other components of the basal <i>Sso</i> transcription apparatus. TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 stimulates transcription of different genes to varying extent, dependent on the sequence of the initiatlly melted region within the promoter. Thus, promoters that are strongly stimulated by TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 could be downregulated in stationary phase, while expression of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 unresponsive (or only mildly stimulated) promoters would be less affected. We do not provide direct evidence for a regulatory role of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2, however, our results suggest that TFE\u03b2 has the potential to reprogram transcription in response to different growth phases.

For co-expression of <i>Sso</i> TFE\u03b1 (<i>Sso0266</i>) and <i>Sso</i> TFE\u03b2-His (<i>Sso 0944</i>) a bicistronic expression construct was produced (p1076). A corresponding construct for co-expression of hRPC62 and hRPC39 (p1159) was created likewise. To generate a pRSF-1b-based vector for expression of C-terminally His-tagged <i>Sso</i> TFE\u03b2, the gene was amplified from a pET21a+ expression vector including the vector-encoded His-tag and inserted into the pRSF-1b vector that does not encode a His-Tag otherwise. The resulting construct (p1077) was also used as backbone to generate the different <i>Sso</i> TFE\u03b2 truncation mutants. All plasmids generated by restriction enzyme-based cloning are listed in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. Site-directed mutagenesis of TFE\u03b1 and TFE\u03b2 was performed to yield single or double amino acid substitutions as listed in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>.

As-isolated samples were transferred directly to EPR quartz tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Reduced samples were prepared by supplementing a fraction of the same protein stock with 20 mM sodium dithionite by adding 1/100 vol of a 2 M solution to the buffer before freezing. All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen prior to cw-EPR experiments, and showed no change in EPR signal over a period of several months. Cw-EPR measurements were performed on a Bruker EMXplus spectrometer operating at 9.4 GHz (<i>X</i>-band) equipped with a 4122SHQE resonator, with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 cryostat for measurements at cryogenic temperatures. Typically spectra were acquired in the temperature interval 10\u201340 K to enable FeS cluster identification. Measurements were performed with a magnetic field sweep from 50 to 600 mT (to allow the detection of possible high and low spin Fe species), a microwave power of 2 mW, modulation amplitude of 0.5 mT and a modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Three independent preparations were tested, all of which gave consistent results. Spin quantification was carried out by comparison with a standard solution of Cu(II)EDTA according to the method reported in (chasteen). The magnetic field was calibrated with a bismuth doped silicon sample."

They show the Sso0944/TFE\u03b2 gene is essential for viability. They demonstrate that the \u03b2 subunit, like the Pol III subunit RPC39, contains a 4Fe-4S domain. Mutagenesis and functional assays show that the FeS domain is important for dimerization of the \u03b1-\u03b2 subunits. Finally, they demonstrate that the TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 factor stimulates PIC stability, enhances DNA melting from a slightly pre melted promoter and stimulates transcription initiation. They conclude with an interesting speculation on the evolutionary history of TFE/TFIIE in LUCA, archaea and eukaryotes. These are important findings as they tie together the function of the archaeal and eukaryotic factors. Conceptually, these findings advance our understanding of the evolutionary relationship between transcription systems. The authors provide a clear and comprehensive description of a wide variety of experimental methods used in this study. This manuscript is of high quality and well suited for publication in <i>eLife</i> after successful revision."

Thus, promoters that are strongly stimulated by TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 could be downregulated in stationary phase, while expression of TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 unresponsive (or only mildly stimulated) promoters would be less affected.

The reasons that the contaminants\u2019 contribution is higher in mutant than wt factors is simply due to the fact that their expression levels are considerably <span class=\"underline\">lower</span>. In order to clarify this detail and allow a direct comparison, we have re-scaled the absorption y-axis of all elution profiles in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> to the same maximum (1,200 mU). In addition, we would like to emphasize that in all TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 preparations (wt and mutant variants) the early fractions of the elution peak from the IMAC purification containing potential nucleic acid contaminants were discarded. IMAC purified TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 preparations that were additionally purified via heparin-affinity chromatography were indistinguishable in all activity assays. As some of the mutant TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 variants did not bind to heparin-sepharose, this purification step was omitted in experiments where mutant and wt TFE\u03b1/\u03b2 were compared."

In this minimal complex the deletion of the TFE\u03b1 ZR weakens the binding considerably. In contrast, in the DNA melting experiments a much larger interaction surface for TFE is presented\u2014the entire RNAP\u2014and in this context the ZR deletion has no phenotype presumably because additional contacts compensate for the weakened interaction. Robust EMSA signals require stable PICs because all components of the complex have to remain associated throughout the entire electrophoresis. EMSAs are nonequilibrium experiments, when PICs dissociate they will give rise to \u2018fuzzy\u2019 band shifts, or disappear altogether. This implies that EMSAs are very sensitive and ideally suited to test weakening effects of mutations, in this case TFE mutations such as the TFE\u03b2 WH deletion. This mutant, as well as the TFE\u03b1 ZR deletion, barely stimulates PIC stability compared to the wt factor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The permanganate foot printing experiments have a completely different \u2018window of opportunity\u2019; as soon as the DNA strands are separated non-basepaired T-residues are modified (and subsequently cleaved). This in turn implies that the method is less sensitive to the effect of attenuated mutant variants, as our experiments demonstrate TFE\u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1 \u0394ZR/\u03b2, and \u03b1/\u03b2 \u0394WH all stimulate permanganate reactivity to a similar extent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."
