                    "text": "<i>mir-17-92</i>, a potent polycistronic oncomir, encodes six mature miRNAs with complex modes of interactions. In the <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma model, <i>mir-17-92</i> exhibits potent oncogenic activity by repressing c-Myc-induced apoptosis, primarily through its <i>miR-19</i> components. Surprisingly, <i>mir-17-92</i> also encodes the <i>miR-92</i> component that negatively regulates its oncogenic cooperation with c-Myc. This <i>miR-92</i> effect is, at least in part, mediated by its direct repression of Fbw7, which promotes the proteosomal degradation of c-Myc. Thus, overexpressing <i>miR-92</i> leads to aberrant c-Myc increase, imposing a strong coupling between excessive proliferation and p53-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, <i>miR-92</i> antagonizes the oncogenic <i>miR-19</i> miRNAs; and such functional interaction coordinates proliferation and apoptosis during c-Myc-induced oncogenesis. This <i>miR-19:miR-92</i> antagonism is disrupted in B-lymphoma cells that favor a greater increase of <i>miR-19</i> over <i>miR-92</i>. Altogether, we suggest a new paradigm whereby the unique gene structure of a polycistronic oncomir confers an intricate balance between oncogene and tumor suppressor crosstalk."

In the <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma model, <i>mir-17-92</i> exhibits potent oncogenic activity by repressing c-Myc-induced apoptosis, primarily through its <i>miR-19</i> components. Surprisingly, <i>mir-17-92</i> also encodes the <i>miR-92</i> component that negatively regulates its oncogenic cooperation with c-Myc. This <i>miR-92</i> effect is, at least in part, mediated by its direct repression of Fbw7, which promotes the proteosomal degradation of c-Myc. Thus, overexpressing <i>miR-92</i> leads to aberrant c-Myc increase, imposing a strong coupling between excessive proliferation and p53-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, <i>miR-92</i> antagonizes the oncogenic <i>miR-19</i> miRNAs; and such functional interaction coordinates proliferation and apoptosis during c-Myc-induced oncogenesis. This <i>miR-19:miR-92</i> antagonism is disrupted in B-lymphoma cells that favor a greater increase of <i>miR-19</i> over <i>miR-92</i>. Altogether, we suggest a new paradigm whereby the unique gene structure of a polycistronic oncomir confers an intricate balance between oncogene and tumor suppressor crosstalk."

Due to their small size and the imperfect nature of target recognition, miRNAs have the capacity to regulate many target mRNAs through translational repression and mRNA degradation, thereby acting as global regulators of gene expression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Filipowicz et al., 2008</a>). Unlike mammalian protein-coding genes that follow the one-transcript, one-protein paradigm, many miRNA genes are expressed as polycistronic primary transcripts, generating multiple mature miRNAs under the same transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Megraw et al., 2007</a>). miRNA polycistrons further expand the gene regulatory capacity, since different miRNA components can confer specific yet overlapping biological effects, and their functional interactions can yield unusual complexity."

The <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> mice carry a <i>c-myc</i> transgene downstream of the immunoglobulin (<i>Ig</i>) heavy chain enhancer <i>E\u03bc</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Langdon, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 1985</a>)<i>,</i> which functionally resembles the <i>Ig-MYC</i> translocations that occur frequently in Burkitt\u2019s lymphomas (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tagawa et al., 2007</a>). The resulting B-cell specific, aberrant c-Myc activation promotes excessive proliferation, yet also evokes potent, p53-dependent apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schmitt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hemann et al., 2003</a>). Thus, c-Myc-induced apoptosis enables a self-defense mechanism against malignant transformation, producing B-lymphomas with a late onset (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lowe et al., 2004</a>). In our adoptive transfer model (<a href=\"#bib45\">Olive et al., 2009</a>), <i>E\u03bc-myc/+</i> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice, generating chimeric mice that faithfully recapitulated the late tumor onset of the <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> transgenic mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Unexpectedly, the oncogenic cooperation between c-Myc and <i>mir-17-92</i> was significantly stronger when <i>miR-92</i> was deleted within this oncomir (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The average survival of <i>E\u03bc-myc</i>/<i>17-92\u039492</i> mice was 66 days, significantly shorter than that of <i>E\u03bc-myc</i>/<i>17-92</i> mice (112 days, p&lt;0.0001). <i>mir-17-92\u0394</i>92 carried a deletion of <i>miR-92</i> pre-miRNA and its flanking sequences, which might alter the expression of the remaining <i>mir-17-92</i> components (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We then engineered a 12-nucleotide <i>miR-92</i> seed mutation within <i>mir-17-92</i> to abolish the functional <i>miR-92</i> with minimal disruption to the overall gene structure. The resulting <i>mir-17-92Mut92</i> phenocopied <i>mir-17-92\u0394</i>92 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), significantly enhancing the oncogenic cooperation with c-Myc without altering the level of any remaining <i>mir-17-92</i> components (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This unexpected effect was specifically attributable to <i>miR-92</i>. Mutations of <i>miR-20</i> or <i>miR-17</i> failed to affect oncogenesis in the <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and data not shown), and mutations of both <i>miR-19</i> miRNAs nearly abolished this oncogenic cooperation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Olive et al., 2009</a>).

Therefore, we searched genes known to negatively regulate <i>c-myc</i> for the presence of putative <i>miR-92</i> binding sites. Using the Targetscan and RNA22 algorithms (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miranda et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bartel, 2009</a>), we identified eight candidate <i>miR-92</i> targets, each of which contained one or more predicted <i>miR-92</i> binding sites in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR). Real-time PCR analysis of these candidate genes confirmed <i>fbw7</i> (F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7) as a likely target of <i>miR-92</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). <i>fbw7</i>, which contains two <i>miR-92</i> target sites within its 3\u2032UTR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), is the substrate recognition component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the degradation of several proto-oncoproteins, including Myc, Cyclin E, c-Jun, and Notch (<a href=\"#bib56\">Welcker and Clurman, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Crusio et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). A luciferase reporter or a FLAG-tagged <i>fbw7</i>-encoding ORF (open reading frame), when fused to the wild-type <i>fbw7</i> 3\u2032 UTR, were both significantly repressed in a <i>miR-92</i> dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)<i>.</i> Yet enforced <i>miR-92</i> expression failed to repress the luciferase reporter that contained an <i>fbw7</i> 3\u2032UTR with two mutated <i>miR-92</i> binding sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggesting that <i>miR-92</i> binding to <i>fbw7</i> 3\u2032UTR is required for this repression. Furthermore, <i>miR-92</i> effectively repressed endogenous Fbw7 protein level, as demonstrated by the decreased <i>fbw7</i> mRNA level and Fbw7 immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Consistent with <i>fbw7</i> as an important target for <i>miR-92</i>, enforced <i>miR-92</i> expression upregulated multiple <i>Fbw7</i> substrates at their protein levels, including c-Myc and cyclinE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Observations from our in vivo experiments also supported this post-transcriptional regulation of Fbw7 by <i>miR-92</i>, as we observed an inverse correlation between the level of <i>miR-92</i> and <i>fbw7</i> when comparing <i>E\u03bc-myc/17-92\u039492 and E\u03bc-myc/17-92</i> lymphoma cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Recent findings indicate that the acute inactivation of tumor suppressor Fbw7 imposes a strong oncogenic stress to induce p53-dependent apoptosis, conferring a selective advantage to cells with deficient p53 function (<a href=\"#bib39\">Minella et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Onoyama et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Matsuoka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Grim et al., 2012</a>). This p53-dependent apoptosis is, at least in part, due to an aberrant increase of c-Myc dosage (<a href=\"#bib46\">Onoyama et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Matsuoka et al., 2008</a>). These findings suggested that a major mechanism through which <i>miR-92</i> enhanced the c-Myc protein level, and subsequently, c-Myc-induced apoptosis, could be through its direct repression of Fbw7. In support of this hypothesis, <i>miR-92</i> overexpression significantly increased the c-Myc protein level in wild-type Hct116 cells, but not in <i>FBW7</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> Hct116 cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), suggesting <i>FBW7</i> was essential for <i>miR-92</i> to induce c-MYC increase. Functionally, acute <i>fbw7</i> knockdown in <i>R26</i><sup><i>MER/MER</i></sup> MEFs partially phenocopied the effect of <i>miR-92</i> to enhance c-Myc-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>); while overexpression of an <i>fbw7\u03b1</i> open reading frame (ORF), albeit above its physiological level, completely abolished this apoptotic effect of <i>miR-92</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Nevertheless, it is still likely that additional mechanisms downstream of <i>miR-92</i> also promote its apoptotic effects, because <i>fbw7</i> knockdown largely recapitulated the extent of c-Myc upregulation by <i>miR-92</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), yet only partially phenocopied its pro-apoptotic effects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). In addition, overexpression of <i>fbw7</i> above its physiological level might amplify the extent of functional interactions between <i>fbw7</i> and <i>miR-92</i> in regulating apoptosis. Despite these caveats, our results strongly argue that the <i>miR-92</i>-Fbw7 axis constitutes a major mechanism underlying the pro-apoptotic effects of <i>miR-92</i>."

Unfortunately, due to technical limitations, we were not able to demonstrate an increased c-Myc protein level as a result of <i>miR-92</i> overexpression in the <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> premalignant B-cells. There was a significant depletion of the <i>E\u03bc-myc/92</i> premalignant B-cells due to excessive apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), making it difficult to collect enough cells to analyze the c-Myc protein level by western analyses.

Under normal physiological conditions, this <i>miR-19</i>:<i>miR-92</i> antagonism could attenuate the detrimental oncogenic signaling by inducing apoptosis in cells with inappropriate <i>mir-17-92</i> induction. During malignant transformation, and particularly during c-Myc-induced oncogenesis, this <i>miR-19</i>:<i>miR-92</i> antagonism could be disrupted to favor cell survival. Using real time PCR analyses, we compared the relative abundance of <i>miR-19</i>a, <i>miR-19</i>b, and <i>miR-92</i> in normal splenic B-cells, premalignant <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-cells, and <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> lymphomas (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Comparing to normal splenic B-cells, the levels of all three mature miRNA species were elevated in both premalignant and malignant <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-cells, possibly due to transcriptional activation of <i>mir-17-92</i> by c-Myc (<a href=\"#bib10\">Donnell et al., 2005</a>). However, the <i>miR-19</i> to <i>miR-92</i> ratios significantly increased during c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In other words, when normalized to the respective miRNA levels in normal splenic B-cells, mature <i>miR-19</i> (including <i>miR-19a</i> and <i>miR-19b</i>) exhibited a greater increase in premalignant and malignant <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-cells than mature <i>miR-92</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). This differential increase was most evident in premalignant <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-cells; the fully transformed <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-lymphoma cells exhibited a lesser difference (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). This observation is consistent with premalignant <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-cells having an intact p53-dependent apoptotic response, thus a stronger selective pressure for a greater <i>miR-19:miR-92</i> ratio. In comparison, most <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-lymphomas have a defective p53 response, hence a less strong selective pressure to maintain a high <i>miR-19:miR-92</i> ratio. We also validated this observation using northern analysis. Comparing normal splenic B-cells and multiple <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> lymphoma cells, the levels of the mature <i>miR-19a, miR-19b</i> and <i>miR-92</i> were all elevated in transformed B-cells; however, the degree of increase for <i>miR-19a</i> and <i>miR-19b</i> was significantly higher than that of <i>miR-92</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This differential increase of <i>miR-19</i> and <i>miR-92</i> was also observed in human Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cell lines when compared to normal B-cells isolated from the periphery blood (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). More importantly, this phenomenon was not limited to <i>c-myc</i> driven B-lymphomas. In the LT2-MYC murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where tumor development was initiated by tetracycline-inducible c-Myc expression, <i>miR-19a</i> and <i>miR-19b</i> also exhibited a stronger increase than <i>miR-92</i> when comparing tumor cells and the normal counterpart (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>)."

A high level of <i>mir-17-92</i> in normal or premalignant cells could lead to suboptimal consequences that are counter-balanced through an intrinsic negative regulation by <i>miR-92</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). As we demonstrated in vitro where <i>miR-92</i>, by directly downregulating Fbw7, enhances c-Myc protein level to promote apoptosis, the ability of <i>miR-92</i> to repress Fbw7 in vivo could similarly constitute a major mechanism to enhance c-Myc-induced apoptosis. This effect of <i>miR-92</i> is a double edged sword in c-Myc driven tumors, as its overexpression gives rise to a strong and obligated coupling between excessive proliferation and a potent, p53-dependent apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). This coupling is consistent with the previous observation that a lower level of constitutive c-Myc acts more effectively to promote tumor initiation, while a higher level of c-Myc is selected by the terminal tumors with defective apoptosis machinery (<a href=\"#bib42\">Murphy et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, <i>mir-17-92</i> encodes an internal component to confer a negative regulatory feedback on its oncogenic activity, imposing a strong selection for anti-apoptotic lesions to shape the path of malignant transformation. More interestingly, c-Myc transcriptionally activates <i>mir-17-92</i> that encodes <i>miR-92</i> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hemann et al., 2005</a>), which in turn enhances c-Myc dosage, at least in part, by repression Fbw7. It is possible that aberrant c-Myc activation triggers a positive feedback loop to further increase c-Myc dosage to strengthen the apoptotic response and to eliminate cells with oncogenic potential. It is worth noting that the <i>miR-92</i> apoptotic effect described in this study depends on an intact p53 response. Consequently, in terminal <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> B-lymphoma cells that often carry a defective p53 response, <i>miR-92</i> failed to enhance c-Myc-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mu et al., 2009</a>)."

It is important to recognize that <i>miR-92</i> is not a tumor suppressor miRNA. Like c-Myc, <i>miR-92</i> elicits potent oncogene stress to engage tumor suppressor response, at least in part, by activating p53. In the premalignant <i>E\u03bc-myc/92</i> B-cells, the effect of <i>miR-92</i> to repress Fbw7 most likely results in an increase of c-Myc level, which coupled with the intact p53 response to strongly sensitize the cells to <i>miR-92</i>-induced apoptosis. Under other contexts when proliferation becomes a rate-limiting event for oncogenesis, or when p53-dependent apoptosis is compromised, <i>miR-92</i> could render a pro-proliferative effect that is strictly oncogenic (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tsuchida et al., 2011</a>). Likewise, the functional readout of other <i>mir-17-92</i> components also heavily depends on cell types and biological contexts. <i>miR-19</i> promotes c-Myc-induced B-lymphomas by repressing apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Olive et al., 2009</a>), yet has little effects in promoting <i>Rb</i>-deficient retinoblastomas (<a href=\"#bib6\">Conkrite et al., 2011</a>); <i>miR-17</i> allows the bypass of Ras-induced senescence by promoting proliferation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hong et al., 2010</a>), yet fails to affect c-Myc-induced lymphomas, possibly due to its functional redundancy with c-Myc."

Although all <i>mir-17-92</i> components are co-transcriptionally regulated, different changes of <i>miR-19</i> vs <i>miR-92</i> during oncogenesis could be a result of differential miRNA biogenesis and/or turn-over.

Interestingly, in the case of <i>mir-17-92</i>, <i>miR-92</i> has a different evolutionary history compared to the other <i>mir-17-92</i> components. <i>miR-92</i> is evolutionary conserved in Deuterostome (including vertebrates and chordates), Ecdysozoa (including flies and worms), and Lophotrochozoa, yet the remaining <i>mir-17-92</i> components are only found in vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The functional antagonism between the more ancient <i>miR-92</i> and the newly evolved <i>mir-19</i> might result from the convergence of these two separate evolutionary paths at the origin of vertebrates. This antagonism could evolve to regulate cell proliferation and cell death downstream or independent of c-Myc in both normal development and disease.

Furthermore, deleting this component results in earlier-onset lymphomas. This central discovery was made using a model developed by Dr. He and her collaborators (Nature 2005; G&amp;D; 2009), wherein premalignant hematopoietic progenitors from <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> mice are transduced with various miR-encoding retroviruses and used to reconstitute irradiated recipients.

This is an important claim, however, some of the quantifications are difficult to understand. For example, in panel 7D, <i>miR-19</i> and <i>-92</i> levels in Burkitt's cell lines are normalized separately for those found in \u201cnormal PB-cells\u201d. Assuming that PB stands for \u201cperipheral blood\u201d, this does not appear to be a relevant control, since a circulating lymphocyte is not a cell of origin for Burkitt's \u2013 or other human lymphomas, for that matter. A direct comparison between <i>miR-19</i> and <i>miR-92</i> levels would be more helpful. According to a recent profiling paper [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/bcj.2012.1\">doi:10.1038/bcj.2012.1</a>], <i>miR-19b</i> and <i>miR-92</i> are overexpressed at comparable levels in Burkitt's samples."

In particular, it would be safe to assume that this cluster evolved to regulate cell growth and proliferation downstream or independent of MYC. Hence, the different miRs in the cluster might be subject to regulation via microRNA processing in addition to the expression of the cluster mRNA precursor. In this regard, are the relative levels of <i>miR-92</i> to other miRs in the cluster differentially affected by cellular stresses that lead to apoptosis (serum or growth factor deprivation, nutrient deprivation?)?

In this experiment, <i>fbw7</i> knockdown largely recapitulated the extent of c-Myc upregulation by <i>miR-92</i>.

Since <i>fbw7</i> knockdown only partially phenocopies <i>miR-92</i> in promoting c-Myc induced apoptosis, one possible scenario is that <i>miR-92</i> engages additional mechanisms to promote c-Myc apoptosis. Nevertheless, the <i>miR-92</i>-Fbw7-Myc axis does constitute a major mechanism to mediate the pro-apoptotic effects of <i>miR-92</i>.

However, we have encountered technical limitations in detecting the endogenous Fbw7 protein in our tumor lysates. In our experience, we have not found any Fbw7 antibodies that can reliably detect endogenous Fbw7 proteins by simple immunoblotting. We have tested several commercial antibodies for detection of endogenous Fbw7, including those sold by Abcam, Sigma, and Invitrogen, and we are unable to detect endogenous Fbw7 cleanly, using proper controls (Fbw7-null HCT116 cell lysate). In lysates from cultured MEFs, which we can expand greatly, we use an immunoprecipitation-western blot method that does detect endogenous Fbw7 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5E</a>), as detailed in our Methods section. The limitation of this approach is that one needs a large amount of cell pellet for this experiment. As an alternative, we performed <i>fbw7</i> QPCR analyses, using <i>E\u03bc-myc/17-92</i>, <i>E\u03bc-myc/17-19b</i>, and <i>E\u03bc-myc/MSCV</i> lymphoma cells.

In addition to the <i>miR-92</i>-Fbw7 axis that regulates c-Myc dosage, a <i>miR-92</i> and<i>fbw7</i> independent mechanism can also enhance c-Myc dosage in the transformed <i>E\u03bc-myc</i> lymphoma cells.

However, we must point out the intrinsic caveats associated with absolute quantitation of different mature miRNAs. Currently, two methods are most popular for the absolute quantitation of mature miRNAs miRNA Taqman assays or high-throughput sequencing (HTS). However, both methods have technical caveats that prevent an accurate quantitation. For the Taqman miRNA assays, the different RT efficiency for different mature miRNAs can introduce systematic bias in quantitation and preclude an accurate quantitation of different mature miRNAs. For the HTS approach, different mature miRNAs have different cloning efficiency due to RNA-ligase-dependent bias (Hafner et al., RNA 2011). Given the intrinsic technical limitations to accurately compare copy numbers of different mature miRNAs, we think it is the most appropriate to leave this out for our manuscript. We included a discussion about this issue in the revised manuscript."
