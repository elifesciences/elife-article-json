Human cancer is enhanced by PPAR\u03b3 loss-of-function mutations, but inhibited by PPAR\u03b3 agonists such as TZD diabetes drugs including rosiglitazone. However, it remains enigmatic whether and how macrophage contributes to PPAR\u03b3 tumor-suppressive functions. Here we report that macrophage PPAR\u03b3 deletion in mice not only exacerbates mammary tumor development but also impairs the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone. Mechanistically, we identify Gpr132 as a novel direct PPAR\u03b3 target in macrophage whose expression is enhanced by PPAR\u03b3 loss but repressed by PPAR\u03b3 activation. Functionally, macrophage Gpr132 is pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor. Genetic Gpr132 deletion not only retards inflammation and cancer growth but also abrogates the anti-tumor effects of PPAR\u03b3 and rosiglitazone. Pharmacological Gpr132 inhibition significantly impedes mammary tumor malignancy. These findings uncover macrophage PPAR\u03b3 and Gpr132 as critical TAM modulators, new cancer therapeutic targets, and essential mediators of TZD anti-cancer effects."

Human cancer is enhanced by PPAR\u03b3 loss-of-function mutations, but inhibited by PPAR\u03b3 agonists such as TZD diabetes drugs including rosiglitazone. However, it remains enigmatic whether and how macrophage contributes to PPAR\u03b3 tumor-suppressive functions. Here we report that macrophage PPAR\u03b3 deletion in mice not only exacerbates mammary tumor development but also impairs the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone. Mechanistically, we identify Gpr132 as a novel direct PPAR\u03b3 target in macrophage whose expression is enhanced by PPAR\u03b3 loss but repressed by PPAR\u03b3 activation. Functionally, macrophage Gpr132 is pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor. Genetic Gpr132 deletion not only retards inflammation and cancer growth but also abrogates the anti-tumor effects of PPAR\u03b3 and rosiglitazone. Pharmacological Gpr132 inhibition significantly impedes mammary tumor malignancy. These findings uncover macrophage PPAR\u03b3 and Gpr132 as critical TAM modulators, new cancer therapeutic targets, and essential mediators of TZD anti-cancer effects."

Emerging evidence supports a functional association between inflammation and cancer. Chronic inflammation is implicated in &gt;15% of cancers (<a href=\"#bib17\">Coussens and Werb, 2002</a>) and shown to promote tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blaser et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kuper et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Scholl et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shacter and Weitzman, 2002</a>). As a key player in inflammation and cancer progression, TAM strongly correlates with poor cancer prognosis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bingle\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Noy and Pollard, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Qian and Pollard, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ruffell et al., 2012</a>). For example, overexpression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1 or M-CSF) leads to accelerated tumor progression in mice and human (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Scholl et al., 1994</a>). Moreover, TAM also modulates therapeutic responses (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ruffell and Coussens, 2015</a>). Although numerous clinical studies and experimental mouse models support that macrophages generally play a pro-cancer role, anti-tumor property has also been reported for certain subtypes of macrophages, suggesting that macrophage regulation of cancer malignancy is pleotropic and context-dependent (<a href=\"#bib33\">Krzeszinski and Wan, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Noy and Pollard, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Qian and Pollard, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ruffell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ruffell and Coussens, 2015</a>)."

Limited clinical trials to date are inconclusive on the effects of TZDs on human cancer outcome (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burstein et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mueller et al., 2000</a>). Provocatively, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reveal that the incidence of cancer malignancies was significantly lower in rosiglitazone-treated patients than in control groups, although rosiglitazone did not significantly modify the risk of cancer (<a href=\"#bib42\">Monami et al., 2008</a>). These findings not only support an anti-tumor role of TZDs but also suggest that TZDs may act to impede tumor progression rather than tumor initiation."

Using a series of genetic and pharmacological, gain- and loss-of-function, in vitro and in vivo approaches, here we uncover macrophage PPAR\u03b3 as an important suppressor of breast cancer progression and a key mediator of the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone that functions by repressing a novel target Gpr132 in macrophages."

Transient transfection and reporter assays reveal that luciferase output from both 0.5 Kb and 1 Kb <i>Gpr132</i> promoter was reduced by the co-transfection of PPAR\u03b3 and further diminished by rosiglitazone treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). These results indicate that PPAR\u03b3 represses <i>Gpr132</i> promoter via critical element(s) within the 500 base pairs upstream of <i>Gpr132</i> transcription start site. Indeed, we identified a PPAR response element (PPRE) half site in this region (-188: CATCCGAGCA<b>AGGTCA</b>GAC). Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that PPAR\u03b3 could bind to the endogenous <i>Gpr132</i> proximal promoter in macrophages but not an upstream negative control region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>); this binding was not significantly altered by rosiglitazone (not shown). Moreover, ChIP assay revealed that H3K9Ac active transcription histone mark at the Gpr132 transcriptional start site was enhanced upon PPAR\u03b3 knockdown and reduced by rosiglitazone in a PPAR\u03b3-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). These mechanistic studies indicate that PPAR\u03b3 directly represses <i>Gpr132</i> transcription in macrophages upon activation by either endogenous or synthetic ligands."

To explore the significance of Gpr132 in human breast cancer, we analyzed the RNA-Seq and clinical data of breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Because <i>Gpr132</i> is highly expressed in human macrophages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) but absent in human breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), the\u00a0<i>Gpr132</i> expression in tumors mainly originates from hematopoietic cells in the microenvironment such as macrophages.

(<b>Q</b>) A simplified working model for how macrophage PPAR\u03b3 inhibits inflammation and tumor growth by repressing the transcription of macrophage Gpr132, a novel pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor membrane receptor. Upon sensing and activation by tumor signals, macrophage Gpr132 may modulate macrophage intracellular signaling and downstream targets, which in turn promotes cancer cell proliferation (indicated by the dashed line). Macrophage PPAR\u03b3 deficiency increases Gpr132 level to afford better tumor sensing by macrophages, thereby promoting tumor growth. Pharmacological Gpr132 inhibition via either PPAR\u03b3 agonist or Gpr132 blockade attenuates breast cancer progression. Moreover, both macrophage PPAR\u03b3 and Gpr132 are key mediators of the anti-tumor effects of the clinically used TZD drug rosiglitazone."

Because macrophage precursors reside in hematopoietic tissues such as blood, bone marrow and spleen that can be efficiently targeted by siRNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Larson et al., 2007</a>), we chose to employ siRNA-mediated Gpr132 knockdown. We treated WT female mice with si-Gpr132 or si-Ctrl for 18 days via intravenous injection at 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse twice/week, three days before and 15 days after cancer cell graft. The results showed that si-Gpr132 significantly reduced tumor volume compared with si-Ctrl (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5O</a>), as the result of depleted Gpr132 expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5P</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Body weight was unaltered by si-Gpr132 (not shown), indicating a lack of overt toxicity by Gpr132 inhibition. These results support the\u00a0Gpr132 inhibition as a novel anti-cancer strategy."

Here we have uncovered a crucial yet previously unrecognized role of macrophage PPAR\u03b3 in suppressing cancer progression and mediating the anti-tumor effects of rosiglitazone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Q</a>). Mechanistically, PPAR\u03b3 activation in macrophages tunes down inflammatory programs by repressing the transcription of a novel target gene Gpr132, which is a pro-inflammatory membrane receptor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Q</a>). Consequently, tumor growth is inhibited when the\u00a0macrophage Gpr132 level is low by either Gpr132 deletion/inhibition or PPAR\u03b3 activation via rosiglitazone; whereas tumor growth is exacerbated when the\u00a0macrophage Gpr132 level is high as the result of macrophage PPAR\u03b3 deficiency. Importantly, Gpr132 deletion abolishes the cancer regulation by macrophage PPAR\u03b3 or rosiglitazone, indicating that Gpr132 is an essential mediator of PPAR\u03b3 functions in macrophages and tumor progression. These findings reveal PPAR\u03b3 and Gpr132 as fundamental key players in TAM, providing new mechanisms how macrophages interact with tumor cells to promote cancer malignancy."

                        "text": "Although our co-culture experiments suggest that tumor cell-macrophage contact is required for macrophage PPAR\u03b3 regulations, other possible mechanisms may exist. For example, (1) tumor cell-macrophage close proximity (rather than direct contact) may be required so that an increased macrophage Gpr132 expression can better sense a gradient of the signal sent from tumor cells - this is supported by previous studies indicating Gpr132 as a pH and lipid sensor that may regulate immune cell trafficking (<a href=\"#bib27\">Justus et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vangaveti et al., 2010</a>); (2) upon activation by tumor signals, macrophage Gpr132 may modulate macrophage intracellular signaling and downstream targets, which in turn promotes cancer cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Q</a>). Our findings have opened an exciting new path for future investigations to delineate how macrophage Gpr132 senses tumor signals and then exacerbates tumor malignancy."

Thus, in terms of how macrophage PPAR\u03b3 impacts tumor progression, only the phenotype speaks of the truth. Our in vivo and in vitro findings all support an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor role of macrophage PPAR\u03b3 activation, and a pro-inflammatory and pro-tumor effect of macrophage PPAR\u03b3 deletion. Among the many downstream events that mediate the pro-tumor effects of inflammatory macrophages, it is possible that macrophage PPAR\u03b3 not only regulates cancer cell behavior but also modulates tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to alter immune surveillance (<a href=\"#bib19\">Engblom et al., 2016</a>)."

Interestingly, although Tie2-g-KO mice harbored more complete PPAR\u03b3 deletion than Lyz-g-KO mice and both mouse models showed enhanced tumor growth and tumor macrophage recruitment, the phenotype was more pronounced in Lyz-g-KO. It is possible that the\u00a0PPAR\u03b3 deletion in other hematopoietic cells outside of the myeloid lineage exerted opposite albeit minor effect on tumor growth in the Tie2-g-KO mice, which was absent in the Lyz-g-KO mice."

By elucidating the mechanisms that macrophages use to promote cancer and inflammation, effective diagnostic tools as well as innovative anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory therapeutics can be designed. For example, macrophage levels of PPAR\u03b3 and Gpr132 may predict not only tumor aggressiveness but also the pharmacological responses to rosiglitazone or Gpr132 inhibitors. Our findings may explain why rosiglitazone exerts anti-tumor effects in certain cancers but not others \u2013 cancers with abundant PPAR\u03b3-positive macrophages may be sensitive whereas cancers with limited macrophages or PPAR\u03b3-negative macrophages may be resistant."

The immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib66\">Su et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). Briefly, after dewaxing with xylence and dehydration with gradient ethanol, the tissue microarrays were incubated with antigen retrieval buffer (BD Biosciences) for 1\u2009hr at 95\u00b0C, followed by treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) for 10\u2009min. Specimens were blocked with 5% defatted milk for 1\u2009hr at room temperature, and incubated with anti-human-Gpr132 antibodies (Sigma; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10745673\">AB_10745673</a>; 1:100) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) for 30\u2009min at room temperature. Immunostaining was performed using a diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (Thermo scientific,\u00a0Waltham, MA). The expression levels of Gpr132 were scored in a blind fashion semi-quantitatively according to the staining intensity and distribution using the immunoreactive score as described previously (<a href=\"#bib66\">Su et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). Briefly, the IHC score = staining intensity (negative\u00a0=\u00a00; weak\u00a0=\u00a01; moderate\u00a0=\u00a02; and strong\u00a0=\u00a03) \u00d7 percentage of positive cells (0%\u00a0=\u00a00; 0\u201325%\u00a0=\u00a01; 25\u201350%\u00a0=\u00a03; and 75\u2013100%\u00a0=\u00a04)."
