Here, we study interacting rats to investigate audio-haptic coordination and multisensory integration in the auditory cortex. We find that facial touch is associated with an increased rate of ultrasonic vocalizations, which are emitted at the whisking rate (\u223c8 Hz) and preferentially initiated in the retraction phase of whisking. In a small subset of auditory cortex regular-spiking neurons, we observed excitatory and heterogeneous responses to ultrasonic vocalizations. Most fast-spiking neurons showed a stronger response to calls. Interestingly, facial touch-induced inhibition in the primary auditory cortex and off-responses after termination of touch were twofold stronger than responses to vocalizations. Further, touch modulated the responsiveness of auditory cortex neurons to ultrasonic vocalizations. In summary, facial touch during social interactions involves precisely orchestrated calling-whisking patterns. While ultrasonic vocalizations elicited a rather weak population response from the regular spikers, the modulation of neuronal responses by facial touch was remarkably strong."

Here, we study interacting rats to investigate audio-haptic coordination and multisensory integration in the auditory cortex. We find that facial touch is associated with an increased rate of ultrasonic vocalizations, which are emitted at the whisking rate (\u223c8 Hz) and preferentially initiated in the retraction phase of whisking. In a small subset of auditory cortex regular-spiking neurons, we observed excitatory and heterogeneous responses to ultrasonic vocalizations. Most fast-spiking neurons showed a stronger response to calls. Interestingly, facial touch-induced inhibition in the primary auditory cortex and off-responses after termination of touch were twofold stronger than responses to vocalizations. Further, touch modulated the responsiveness of auditory cortex neurons to ultrasonic vocalizations. In summary, facial touch during social interactions involves precisely orchestrated calling-whisking patterns. While ultrasonic vocalizations elicited a rather weak population response from the regular spikers, the modulation of neuronal responses by facial touch was remarkably strong."

These social interactions are initially characterized by anogenital sniffing followed by facial contacts which occur at a constant rate (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wolfe et al., 2011</a>). Facial contacts have also been shown to be involved in dominance-related behaviors in naturalistic settings (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blanchard et al., 2001</a>). Facial contacts consist of extensive whisker-to-whisker and snout-to-snout touch episodes, largely mediated by macrovibrissae (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wolfe et al., 2011</a>). The use of macrovibrissae results in a strong activation of the barrel cortex and, importantly, the neurons appear to represent the social context of these interactions by distinct firing rates (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bobrov et al., 2014</a>)."

While the alarm calls are elicited by a range of threats (dominant or aggressive conspecifics, predators, and aversive stimuli [<a href=\"#bib10\">Brudzynski, 2009</a>]), the 50-kHz calls are produced in anticipation of/in response to direct social contact (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blanchard et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bialy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brudzynski and Pniak, 2002</a>), mating (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bialy et al., 2000</a>), and homo-specific (rough-and-tumble) or hetero-specific (tickling) play behaviors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Burgdorf et al., 2008</a>).

However in the awake auditory cortex, a sparse representation of playback sounds has been demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hrom\u00e1dka et al., 2008</a>). Little is known about the representation of the whole repertoire of conspecific calls in awake, behaving animals. Likewise, there is little information about the integration of multisensory social signals in the auditory cortex, with the notable exception of experience-dependent modulation of auditory responses by natural odors in mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cohen et al., 2011</a>). To address these issues, we employed the gap paradigm (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wolfe et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">von Heimendahl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bobrov et al., 2014</a>), wherein a combination of USVs and facial touch enables the study of multisensory coordination and integration of social signals in the auditory cortex. Specifically, we pose the following questions: (i) How are calls and whisking related on coarse and fine time scales? (ii) How does auditory cortex respond to calls in interacting animals? (iii) How does auditory cortex respond to facial touch? (iv) Are responses to calls in the auditory cortex modulated by touch?"

We analyzed three scenarios: (i) when the subject rat was present alone on the setup (\u2018Subject alone\u2019), (ii) after the introduction of stimulus rats during which interactions took place (\u2018Social setting\u2019), and (iii) specifically during the facial touch episodes (\u2018Facial touch\u2019). In all these scenarios, a vast majority of USVs (\u223c80%) were composed of just three call categories, that is, trill, complex, and flat (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Interestingly, the proportion of trills was greater in social contexts whereas the proportion of flats was greater when the animals were alone. A similar trend was observed in some of the minor call categories (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). While the baseline calling rate was low when the subject rat was alone (0.13 Hz), a substantial increase (0.80 Hz) occurred in the social setting. Within the facial touch episodes, a further increase in vocalization (1.50 Hz) was observed. Indeed, the calling rate for all call categories increased during facial touch compared to periods outside of it (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), with trills showing the highest increase. Analysis of peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) also revealed an increase in calling associated with the onset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and a sharp decrease with the offset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) of facial touch. For interactions with non-social stimuli, the calling rate was lower (0.36 Hz) and there was no increase in calling during touch (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). On the whole, this increase in calling rate indicates a role for USVs in social communication in our paradigm."

To assess this, we tracked precise whisker positions in high-speed videos and mapped the call times onto this information. As shown in the representative example (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), calls were typically emitted in the retraction phase of the whisking cycle of the call emitter (top trace), whereas there was no systematic relationship of calling to the whisking of the interacting partner (bottom trace). Hence, when all whisking traces were aligned and averaged relative to calls, the whisking rhythmicity was preserved in the resulting call-triggered whisking average (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We observed that the relationship of call onsets to whisking phase was distributed significantly non-uniformly relative to whisking for call emitter (n = 664, p = 0.0014, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, top, Hodges\u2013Anje test) but not for interacting partner (n = 705, p = 0.06, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, bottom).

This was consistent with previous observations that whisking is not coordinated across animals (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wolfe et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, in the analysis of the distribution of time intervals between the start of two subsequent vocalizations of the putative call emitter, a prominent peak was observed at 144 ms (\u2018auto\u2019, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, middle). Such rhythmicity was not obvious when the call onsets across interaction partners were analyzed (\u2018cross\u2019, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, right), suggesting that the coordination of whisking and vocalization is restricted to individuals. This analysis is constrained by the fact that \u223c1 in 5 calls is incorrectly assigned to a particular call source. Sessions with a single source of USVs (where subject rats interact with plastinated rats/objects) would ideally provide unambiguous evidence as there is only one source of USVs. However, since very few calls are produced in such sessions, we presented subject rats with anaesthetized stimulus rats to elicit extensive vocalization. Analysis of tracked whiskers in the high-speed videos relative to call onset shows that the temporal coordination of calling and whisking is indeed observable (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

To rule out this potential confound, we applied bootstrapping analysis (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) to compute the mean response indices for our data set and plotted the frequency distribution histograms as before. These bootstrapped data show that neuronal responses in RS (but not FS) neurons were strongly modulated during touch, independent of the number of samples (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Another possible reason for this greater modulation could be the higher effective intensity of vocalizations in touch when the animals were closely juxtaposed. This would suggest that the response of RS neurons would be stronger to stimulus calls in touch while the response to the subject's own calls would not show much modulation (under the assumption that the subject rat vocalizes and perceives its own calls at roughly the same intensities). There, however, does not appear to be any greater responsiveness to stimulus calls during touch. This would suggest that the intensity differences are probably not responsible for the higher modulation during touch (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the responsiveness to USVs in the auditory cortex is modulated by facial touch."

Social transmission of food preference which relies on the combined use of olfactory and gustatory cues (<a href=\"#bib19\">Galef and Wigmore, 1983</a>) is probably the most extensively studied example of this. In addition, the use of unimodal signals including vision (ear wiggling [<a href=\"#bib17\">Erskine, 1989</a>]), smell (cheek gland pheromones, [<a href=\"#bib24\">Kannan and Archunan, 2001</a>], and somatosensation [<a href=\"#bib6\">Blanchard et al., 2001</a>]) has also been reported. However, little is known about the multisensory integration of these signals, which would play a critical role in facilitating social interactions. In this inquiry, we study interacting rats to investigate audio-haptic coordination and multisensory integration in the auditory cortex. We demonstrate that facial touch during social interactions is associated with an increased production of USVs. We observe a temporal coordination of vocalization and whisking, with calls being associated with the retraction of whiskers. USVs elicited excitatory responses in a small fraction of RS neurons in the auditory cortex, whereas almost all FS neurons showed a strong activation. Facial touch however resulted in a robust inhibition of the primary auditory cortex. Moreover, we observed a remarkable off-response at the end of the touch episode, possibly reflecting a release of touch-induced inhibition, which was surprisingly the largest response modulation observed in our study. Finally, it appears that the response of auditory cortex neurons to USVs is modulated by facial touch."

A reduction in social interaction and ultrasonic communication has also been reported in a mouse model of monogenic heritable autism (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jamain et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, using the gap paradigm, we observed an increase in the rate of vocalizations during the presentation of social (but not non-social) stimuli. Interestingly, the calling rate also showed a sharp decrease at the end of interactions."

We observe that a vast majority of calls in our paradigm belong to one of the three categories that is, trill, complex, and flat. Further, the proportion of trills and flats appear to be modulated by the presence of conspecifics. These results are in line with the finding that there is a greater prevalence of flats in singly tested rats whereas trill vocalization is increased in pair-tested rats (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wright et al., 2010</a>). A role for trills in social contexts has also been reported during play behavior (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schwarting et al., 2007</a>). Taken together, these results would suggest that specific call categories could play a role during specific components of social interactions. This idea is supported by a recent study which reports that male mice emit distinct vocalizations when females leave the environment (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2013</a>)."

We observed a locking of calling to whisking, with calls being produced during the retraction phase of the whisking cycle. The retraction phase has been correlated to the exhalation phase of breathing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Moore et al., 2013</a>), which would correspond to call production. Previous studies have shown that in addition to a correlation of respiration and USV production (<a href=\"#bib36\">Roberts, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Riede, 2011</a>), sniffing and whisking are also tightly correlated (<a href=\"#bib46\">Welker, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ranade et al., 2013</a>). The neural substrate of such coordination is thought to lie in the joint architecture of pattern generators for whisking and breathing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Moore et al., 2013</a>).

Our findings on the temporally precise audio-haptic coordination in social signaling are reminiscent of much earlier findings on the multisensory orchestration of sensory acquisition (<a href=\"#bib45\">Welker, 1971</a>)."

However, this explanation can be ruled out as: (i) responses to both own and stimulus were the same even though the subject rats were obviously always close to their own calls and (ii) FS cells responded robustly and significantly to calls. To our knowledge, this is the first report of neuronal responses to conspecific calls in awake behaving rats.

The role of FS neurons in blanking out the animal's own calls and facilitating increased response to stimulus calls would be a tempting speculation. There also appears to be auditory cortex sub-region-wise differences, in that AuD and Au1 respond significantly to calls. Despite the temporal coordination of whisking and calling, we do not observe any strong preference of the auditory cortex to the whisking phase at the population level.

Indeed, high sensitivity to broadband stimuli has been reported in the cat auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bar-Yosef and Nelken, 2007</a>). Sound intensity measurements were performed but no change was detected due to whisker movement and contacts, at least at the microphones.

To test this, we analyzed the responsiveness of Au1 neurons to USVs in and out of touch. Interestingly, RS neurons exhibited a greater modulation to calls during touch as compared to out of touch. However, this was not the case with FS neurons. This large modulation of call responsiveness by touch could be construed as a sampling issue as calls during touch are fewer than those out of touch. However, bootstrapping analysis rules out this interpretation. Similarly, a higher intensity of stimulus calls during touch (due to close proximity) is less likely to be a contributing factor. Interestingly, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that inhibition in the auditory cortex could actually be responsible for an increased responsiveness to auditory stimuli. It has been reported that balanced inhibition underlies tuning and sharpens spike timing in auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>) and that inhibition might contribute to auditory processing (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hamilton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Shamma, 2013</a>).

The tag was covered with silver paint and fixed with superglue. Stimulus rats also received a black dot on the head to facilitate head tracking. Social interactions were recorded using a high-speed camera (A504k, Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany) at 250 Hz with 1280 \u00d7 1024 pixels. Video frames were streamed directly to a PCIe 1429 express card (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX, USA).

The process consisted of manual setting of head center and nose positions, automated contour detection and setting of whisker base and tag positions. Head axis (posterior to anterior) and whisker direction (outwards from whisker base) were acquired with custom-written MATLAB software. The head\u2013whisker-angle was defined as zero in the orthogonal position, with protraction taking positive values up to a theoretical maximum of 180\u00b0 and retraction being negative analogously. Whisker traces, that is, time series of whisker angle, were processed for signal cleansing, quality criteria, and signal decomposition as described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hill et al., 2011</a>). This includes up-sampling to 1000 Hz and 1\u201325 Hz bandpass filtering (fourth order Butterworth filter). Whisker cycles were disregarded when not between 50 and 250 ms length or when amplitude was &lt;7.5\u00b0. Hilbert transform yielded the phase within the whisking cycle starting at maximum protraction (0\u00b0), via maximum retraction (back-directed movement up to 180\u00b0) and return (\u2264360\u00b0). Whisking cycle phases at the onset of calls were analyzed for both the calling animal and the one towards which the calls were putatively directed."

To the resulting polar plots, circular Rayleigh statistics were applied to calculate the Rayleigh vector (the summation of unit vectors in all individual angle observations to find a tendency in overall direction). The following criteria was set to identify putative phase locked cells: (i) minimum number of spikes (10) in a tracked episode, (ii) Rayleigh vector greater than 0.2, and (iii) shuffling test (see below) showing significance at a confidence interval of 5%. The shuffling test is necessary because regular tests, such as Rayleigh or Hodges\u2013Ajne test for non-uniformity of circular data, are sensitive to very low- or high-spike numbers because of the extreme (high or low) variance among bins. Also, the number of bins can affect the test result. To test independently of these, the spike train was randomly time shifted relative to the whisker phase trace. The Rayleigh vector was computed again and this procedure repeated 10,000 times to simulate a random set of Rayleigh vectors from the spike series. If the original Rayleigh vector was in the 95% quantile of that distribution, it was presumed to be phase locked."

Stability of the units was quantified as follows: for each recording session, time periods outside interactions (as many in number and length as interactions on that day) were selected. This was performed on randomly distributed periods for 1000 permutations, and a linear correlation between time and firing rate was calculated. Average Pearson's R value was used as a measure of stability (higher R means stronger drift) and units with a value &gt;0.4 were excluded from analysis."

Auditory cortex single unit waveforms normalized by peak voltage were used to compute a whole host of features (height, trough, width parameters). Of these, two closely related features, full spike width and second half width showed bi-modal distributions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). For this analysis, the waveforms were compared to the widest spike in the dataset (which was designated the value of 1).

For RS neurons, pair-wise comparison of basal firing rates were significantly different to the firing rates in the call duration alone (p = 0.0049) and call duration + 25 ms (p = 0.0006, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test) response windows. However for FS neurons, the response was significantly different in the call duration + 25 ms window (p = 0.006), while it was not the case during the call duration alone (p = 0.0605). We also computed the onset responses in various time windows (0\u201325, 26\u201350, 51\u201375, 76\u2013100 ms after call onset) as reported earlier (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hrom\u00e1dka et al., 2008</a>). For RS neurons, we found significant increase in all four time windows while for FS it was significant only for the 26\u201350 and 51\u201375 ms time windows. It must be noted that since the stimuli are not all of the same duration (for e.g., trills: 50.9 \u00b1 26.2 ms, mean \u00b1 SD, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), the ideal response windows should span the entire call durations. Thus it appears that the call duration + 25 ms response window sufficiently well describes the responses of both RS and FS neurons in our study and this was used to compute the neuronal responses to USVs. For facial touch, firing rate was defined as average firing rate during all interactions with an interaction partner. The off-response due to facial touch was calculated as the mean firing rate in a 200 ms window after the end of the touch episode. These firing rates were compared with a matched baseline period, which was as long as the USVs/interactions and shifted \u221210,000 ms relative to these on the spike train (jumping over any periods which contained a USV or interaction). For each neuron, a response index was calculated as follows: Response Index = (<i>in</i> \u2212 <i>out</i>)/(<i>in</i> + <i>out</i>), where <i>in</i> and <i>out</i> are the firing rates during a call/interaction and baseline firing rates, respectively."

These are exciting results. However, the manuscript suffers from the fact that it is divided into two almost-independent parts, the first one dealing with the relation between whisking and vocalizations during facial interactions, and the second one describing the physiological correlates in auditory cortex. It would be desirable to further analyze the relationship between behavior and physiology, as described below. In addition, some of the major conclusions are not fully supported by the data that is presented."

For example, the Geffen lab (the Carruthers 2013 paper cited in the Introduction) used similar sounds and saw quite robust responses to vocalizations in rat A1. The simplest possibility is that the authors are recording in part of A1 that is not sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies; a change in 500 um can make a big difference in terms of the frequencies that neurons respond to, but it is difficult to tell from the coronal slices they show and the coordinates they describe, and they don't appear to do any kind of tone frequency mapping to figure out exactly where they are in A1. In addition, there could be a suboptimal choice of analysis windows (which were very long relative to the standard responses in auditory cortex). This issue can be resolved by more detailed analysis of the auditory responses."

In order to address this, we performed whisker tracking of high-speed videos and analysed the auditory cortex activity relative to the phase of whisking. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 5</a>, we did not observe any systematic relationship between whisking phase and auditory cortex activity at the population level (in the 127 cells for which we obtained whisking data). A few cells did show a strong locking of firing rates with the retraction phase of the whisker, but this appeared be an artefact of the temporal coordination between whisking and calling. Indeed, these cells also showed a strong response to USVs."

FS neurons on the other hand in general appear to less call selective, though examples to the contrary can also be seen. The panels in this supplementary figure also document the heterogeneity in responses to calls (early, late, sharp and sustained) that we observed."

Indeed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, we report a much greater modulation of the neurons by USVs when in touch compared to out of it. Furthermore, this effect is seen in the regular-spiking but not fast-spiking neurons. Second, the referee asks about time locked on or off responses. We have included a supplementary figure (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</a>) to demonstrate several example of time locked on responses. As far as off responses are concerned, we saw no clear examples, possibly due of the different call durations. One could however speculate that the sustained and delayed responses are possibly due to calls of various durations eliciting an off response in some cells. In our paradigm of freely interacting animals, the number of \u2018trials\u2019 (facial interactions) and \u2018calls\u2019 depends on the animals leading to very variable sampling episodes and consequently varying levels of significance. We think that for such a data set, our statistical assessment (which does not build on z-scores) is informative. Specifically, we show plots of raw spike rates, compute response indices and apply non-parametric tests to assess the significance of the responses. The referee also raises the issue of non-social touch, to which we have responded above."

For example, the Geffen lab (the Carruthers 2013 paper cited in the Introduction) used similar sounds and saw quite robust responses to vocalizations in rat A1. The simplest possibility is that the authors are recording in part of A1 that is not sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies; a change in 500 um can make a big difference in terms of the frequencies that neurons respond to, but it is difficult to tell from the coronal slices they show and the coordinates they describe, and they don't appear to do any kind of tone frequency mapping to figure out exactly where they are in A1. In addition, there could be a suboptimal choice of analysis windows (which were very long relative to the standard responses in auditory cortex).

We have now included new supplementary panels (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B, C</a>) to show the location of our recording sites over 8 animals and a range of Bregma values. Despite this, as the referee points out, we could still have been missing the USV responsive cells by being just slightly away. We did take up the suggestion of suboptimal choice of analysis windows and have indeed found much better responses to calls in shorter response windows. We would like to thank the reviewer for this particular suggestion. We analysed responses to calls in three shorter time windows: in the call duration alone, call duration + 25 ms and call duration + 50 ms. It must be noted here that since the stimuli are of varying durations (e.g. trills: 50.9 \u00b1 26.2 ms, mean \u00b1 SD), the ideal response windows should span the entire call duration. We find strong responses in the call duration + 25 ms window for both RS and FS neurons and have used this to analyse the rest of the data (see Materials and Methods). In addition, we confirmed this fact by looking for onset responses in 0-25, 26-50, 51-75 and 76-100 ms windows as had been analysed earlier (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hrom\u00e1dka et al., 2008</a>).

While whisker-touch and snout-touch elicited little or no change of recorded audio power across all frequencies, USVs expectedly led to a large increase (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus, at least according to the microphones, touch is not associated with increased sound pressure levels.
