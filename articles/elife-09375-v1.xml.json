The crystallized protein simultaneously showed three different structural states \u2013 one where the citrate binding site faces the outside of the cell, and two where the binding site faces the inside of the cell.

Sodium ions attach to SeCitS, and then citrate binds to the transporter from outside the cell. This binding causes part of the protein to undergo a substantial rotation, shifting it to an inward-facing state and moving the citrate and sodium ions inside the cell. The release of the citrate and sodium ions then triggers the reverse rotation of the transporter, bringing the empty binding site back to the outside of the cell for a repeat of the cycle."

The human citrate transporter NaCT plays a central role in fatty acid synthesis and glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gopal et al., 2007</a>), and is a potential drug target against obesity and diabetes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Liang et al., 2015</a>). The <i>Drosophila</i> INDY gene encodes a related dicarboxylate transporter implicated in fat storage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rogina et al., 2000</a>). The x-ray structure of VcINDY, a homologous dicarboxylate transporter from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> is known in the inward-facing state (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mancusso et al., 2012</a>). Unexpectedly, a recent cryo-EM structure\u00a0of the citrate transporter KpCitS from <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kebbel et al., 2013</a>)\u00a0revealed a similar overall domain architecture to VcINDY (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mancusso et al., 2012</a>) and to archaeal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters of the NhaP family (<a href=\"#bib15\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Paulino et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">W\u00f6hlert et al., 2014</a>), in both cases without detectable sequence homology.

The two homologues share a remarkably high sequence identity of 92% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), indicating that their transport mechanisms must be very similar. Iso-citrate and, to a lesser extent, malate inhibit Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent <sup>14</sup>C-citrate uptake by SeCitS into proteoliposomes. Succinate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, and glutaric acid reduce uptake slightly, whereas tricarballylic acid, which lacks the citrate hydroxyl group, has no effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This demonstrates the specificity of the CitS binding site for 2-hydroxycarboxylates. Malate, which is smaller than citrate, inhibits citrate uptake by SeCitS but is not transported (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Citrate symport is driven by Na<sup>+</sup> but not by K<sup>+</sup> or Li<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C, D</a>), demonstrating the exquisite specificity of SeCitS for Na<sup>+</sup> ions. Sodium transport is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.89, whereas citrate is not, suggesting that citrate transport is coupled to at least two Na<sup>+</sup>\u00a0ions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). SeCitS is active between pH5 and pH8 with an optimum at pH7, resulting in a roughly bell-shaped pH profile (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Down-regulation of transport at low pH can be attributed to a limitation in sodium binding, while at elevated pH the availability of the HCit<sup>2-</sup> citrate species is limiting. Citrate uptake is enhanced at lower outside pH (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Under these conditions, transport by SeCitS is electroneutral, since valinomycin has no effect (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). A lower outside pH would shift the citrate buffer equilibrium towards HCit<sup>2-</sup>. Therefore, a low outside pH increases the local substrate concentration, while a high inside pH tends to deprotonate the HCit<sup>2-</sup> substrate and thus removes it from the transport equilibrium. We conclude that protons do not participate directly in the transport mechanism. This conclusion is substantiated by the observation that an increase in the internal Na<sup>+</sup> concentration does not stimulate citrate uptake (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), which argues against a previously proposed citrate/proton symport (or citrate/hydroxide antiport) in exchange for internal sodium (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pos and Dimroth, 1996</a>)."

The most conspicuous differences are manifest in the vertical positions of the two hairpins H6 and H12 in the helix bundle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Comparing the two protomers of dimer 1, the C-terminal end of H6 projects 16 \u00c5 above the outer membrane surface in protomer A, while it hardly protrudes in protomer B. Conversely, the cytoplasmic H12 ends roughly at the inner membrane surface in protomer A, but extends 13 \u00c5 above it in protomer B. The relative position of helices and hairpins within each bundle is unchanged. Evidently, the whole bundle moves as a rigid body from its position in protomer A to that in protomer B, while the central dimer contact domain remains static. The crystal contacts of both dimers in the asymmetric unit are different. Since the polyptide structures of the two dimers are almost identical, the observed asymmetry cannot be attributed to crystal packing. Dimer asymmetry is equally striking with respect to surface structure and electrostatic potential distribution. Protomer A has more positive charges on the periplasmic side than protomer B (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). On the cytoplasmic side, positive charges predominate on the surface of protomer B, while positive and negative charges are roughly evenly distributed on protomer A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Overall, positive charges dominate on the cytoplasmic side of the dimer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C, 6D</a>), in line with the positive-inside rule for membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nilsson and von Heijne, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">von Heijne, 1992</a>)."

The only residue in the static contact domain involved in substrate coordination is Tyr348 in H10, which forms a \u03c0-\u03c0-interaction with a citrate carboxyl. One ordered water molecule participates directly in citrate binding. Its trigonal-bipyramidal coordination geometry (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) might suggest a Na<sup>+</sup> ion rather than water, which would imply that the transported entity is NaCit<sup>2-</sup> rather than HCit<sup>2-</sup>. Because the electron density is weak and the coordination distance of &gt;2.8 \u00c5 is longer than would be expected for Na<sup>+</sup>, we interpret this density as a water molecule. In both outward-facing protomers, two Na<sup>+</sup> ions are clearly resolved next to the citrate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7A</a>). In the Na1 site, four backbone carbonyls in the unwound hairpin stretches coordinate one Na<sup>+</sup>.

Helices of the rotating bundle domain are coloured, while helices in the static dimer contact domain are shown in grey behind their corresponding transparent electrostatic surface. The negatively charged periplasmic surface of SeCitS (transparent red) attracts Arg205 of H7 (green), which, in the inward-facing state, forms an ion bridge to Asp112 in H4 and a hydrogen bond to Tyr348 (lavender) in H10 of the dimer contact domain. In the outward-facing state, Asp112 interacts with Tyr348, which rotates to block access to the substrate-binding site in the inward-facing state. A detergent molecule (yellow) in the hydrophobic pocket between H5 (purple), H13 (cyan) and the dimer contact domain, is displaced in the inward-facing state by the movement of H13. H5, which is straight in the outward-facing state, kinks during the bundle rotation to prevent its partial exposure to the cytoplasm."

In the inward-facing state, the binding affinity for the substrate is reduced (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pos and Dimroth, 1996</a>), so the citrate can detach. We propose that the three citrate positions we observe in the two inward-facing protomers mark the path of the substrate during its release from the binding site past the highly conserved Arg428 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>), along a trajectory that guides the negatively charged substrate towards the cytoplasm, where it is metabolized. Partial release of the citrate di-anion would weaken Na<sup>+</sup> binding, which explains why only one Na site is occupied in B\u2019. Since transport is electroneutral, both Na<sup>+</sup> ions must dissociate from the inward-facing state. MD simulations suggest that in other Na-dependent transporters such as LeuT (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grouleff et al., 2015</a>), GltPh (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zomot and Bahar, 2013</a>), vSGLT (<a href=\"#bib44\">Watanabe et al., 2010</a>), at least one of the Na<sup>+</sup> ions is released before the main substrate. In the case of SeCitS, comparison of the inward-facing protomers B and B\u2019 indicates unambiguously that citrate is released before Na<sup>+</sup>, and that Na2 is released before Na1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D, E</a>). Once the citrate has left the binding site, the helix hairpins or H13 would need to rearrange to release Na1, while a minor reorientation of the Asp407 or Ser427 sidechains is sufficient to release Na2."

Therefore the complete transport mechanism entails the following six steps: (1) The Na sites are occupied by Na<sup>+</sup>\u00a0in the outward-facing state; (2) a citrate binds from the external medium; (3) citrate binding triggers the arc-like rotation of the helix bundle in the transition from the outward-facing to the inward-facing state; (4) in the inward-facing state, the citrate becomes hydrated and diffuses into the cytoplasm; (5) the sodium ions come off; (6) the release of all substrates enables the reverse arc-like rotation of the helix bundle to expose the empty binding site again to the cell exterior, and the cycle repeats (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>)."

Citrate uptake by SeCitS is substantially slower at 1.2 molecules per minute (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Therefore, the arc-like rotation of the helix bundle that translocates the bound substrate across the membrane is not rate-limiting. The same seems to hold true for GltPh, which shows a slow substrate uptake rate of 0.29 molecules per minute (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ryan et al., 2009</a>), while crosslinking experiments show that the conformational change happens within seconds (<a href=\"#bib32\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>).

The crystallographic unit reveals four distinct protomers arranged into two dimers, with two distinct conformational states and several different substrate binding states. The structures provide extensive insights into the details of the binding sites, and the conformational change required to transition from outward-facing substrate-bound to inward-facing substrate-bound states for this transporter. Several biochemical measurements are also included using proteoliposomes under various conditions to demonstrate that the transporter can transport citrate in the presence of sodium, ruling out other di- and tri-carboxylic substrates, and testing the effect of pH, from which they conclude that the transporter does not translocate H<sup>+</sup>. Their measurements also indicate that malate and isocitrate are competitive inhibitors. The manuscript is clearly written and the structure analyzed in detail."

Finally, some issues need to be clarified with respect to the substrates being transported, particularly the species of citrate. My concerns are laid out by topic below."

First, \"van der Rest\" et al. 1992 is cited as evidence that CitS transports HCit<sup>2-</sup>. There seem to be two problems with this citation: the van der Rest paper studies <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> CitS, not <i>Salmonella enteric</i>, and it is entirely possible that they transport different species. At the least, the reasons to make that assumption should be explored and described, including mentioning the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>'s of the different protonation states of citrate. In addition, van der Rest et al. concluded that the stoichiometry is one sodium and two protons, whereas the current work concludes that sodium is cotransported but not protons. The roles of the different species are interconnected, so these two different scenarios could lead to different conclusions about the citrate protonation state in order that the process is electroneutral. It is therefore important that the arguments or uncertainties relating to the transport stoichiometry and species be laid out more clearly."

The authors may have been lucky that OG binds there, as it may be stabilizing the outward-facing state in the crystal, but OG is not the same as a physiologically relevant phospholipid. Indeed, in a different secondary transporter called LeuT, an OG detergent molecule binds to the extracellular cavity and stabilizes the outward-facing conformation (Nissen and coworkers). No-one would argue that this site is required for a lipid interaction during transport. These references (including to H13 \"dislodging\" the detergent molecule\") should be removed.

Biochemical evidence, and molecular simulations would be useful to support such assertions, but even then, it is difficult to state conclusively that such interactions are maintained outside of the crystal lattice, and/or are important for function. Indeed, D112 is not conserved across other homologues shown in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, and nor is R205 or Y348.

This issue becomes further contradictory when visualizing the movie (s), which are shown as one citrate and one sodium coming off together (see below), and then when looking at the schematic of the transport cycle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), when the substrate, and then the sodiums, come off one after another. I strongly recommend that these descriptions of the steps of unbinding be mentioned only in passing and clearly described as speculation.

First, the sodiums bind essentially to the same state of the protein as the substrate-bound form (or one in which some side chains have been selected to move out of the way). There is no known structure of the sodium-free or substrate free forms of SeCitS, and evidence from other proteins shows that the protein backbone changes when those substrates are missing; therefore it is misleading to suggest that the structure remains the same. Similarly in the inward-facing states, it is implied by the movie that one sodium and citrate come off before the second ion; however none of those intermediates are known; in fact, they contradict the occupancy shown in protomers B and B'."

The dimeric transporter is captured in the crystal in an asymmetric state such that one domain occupies an outward position and the other is inward. Thus, this single structure reveals the key aspects of CitS transport mechanism. Specifically, the structure shows that CitS belongs to a growing class of secondary active transporters that function by an elevator-like mechanism. In these transporters, one domain carrying the bound substrate and coupled ions moves across the bilayer along a proteinous track provided by another, stationary domain, which is involved in subunit association. Despite some concerns, I feel that overall the work is technically sound and most conclusions are well founded. I do not have major concerns that would require extensive rebuttal. However, I feel that the manuscript could be substantially improved through editorial changes, and I have a number of questions and suggestions. These are only minor comments. Overall, these fall into three categories: (A) concerns regarding the presentation and discussion of the functional data, including certain vagueness of the methods; (B) information content of the structural figures and corresponding structural discussions, which I think can be significantly strengthened; (C) putting results into overall perspective, which I feel could also be improved."

In LeuT the OG molecule has an inhibitory effect, blocking the S2 site from the outside. In SeCitS, OG binds to an intracellular cavity, which rules out a similar effect as in LeuT. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that our structure shows both an inward- and an outward-facing protomer, which are present simultaneously under identical conditions. If the bound detergent were to stabilize the outward-facing conformation, we would expect both protomers in the dimer to be in this conformation. Nevertheless we cannot exclude that a detergent molecule in this position stabilizes the outward-facing conformation.

The only molecules in the crystallization buffer that might account for the observed electron density are citrate, TRIS or TCEP. Refinement against each of these indicated that only citrate explains the data well. Therefore the omit densities in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> are best described by citrate molecules."

In SeCitS substrate binding requires only sidechain (Arg402 & Arg48) and slight main chain rearrangements in the loop regions of the helix hairpins. To us it seems evident that protomers B and B\u2019 demonstrate the release order of sodium. In protomer B\u2019 citrate is only loosely attached to SeCitS and hydrated, indicating that basically it has been released. On the other hand the empty Na2 site in protomer B\u2019 indicates without doubt that Na1 is released last.

Specifically, the structure shows that CitS belongs to a growing class of secondary active transporters that function by an elevator-like mechanism. In these transporters, one domain carrying the bound substrate and coupled ions moves across the bilayer along a proteinous track provided by another, stationary domain, which is involved in subunit association.
