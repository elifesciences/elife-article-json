However, the molecular nature of these barriers, their mode of action and their cellular functions are unclear. Here, we show that misfolded proteins of the ER remain confined into the mother compartment of budding yeast cells. Confinement required the formation of a lateral diffusion barrier in the form of a distinct domain of the ER-membrane at the bud neck, in a septin-, Bud1 GTPase- and sphingolipid-dependent manner. The sphingolipids, but not Bud1, also contributed to barrier formation in the outer membrane of the dividing nucleus. Barrier-dependent confinement of ER stress into the mother cell promoted aging. Together, our data clarify the physical nature of lateral diffusion barriers in the ER and establish the role of such barriers in the asymmetric segregation of proteotoxic misfolded proteins during cell division and aging."

However, the molecular nature of these barriers, their mode of action and their cellular functions are unclear. Here, we show that misfolded proteins of the ER remain confined into the mother compartment of budding yeast cells. Confinement required the formation of a lateral diffusion barrier in the form of a distinct domain of the ER-membrane at the bud neck, in a septin-, Bud1 GTPase- and sphingolipid-dependent manner. The sphingolipids, but not Bud1, also contributed to barrier formation in the outer membrane of the dividing nucleus. Barrier-dependent confinement of ER stress into the mother cell promoted aging. Together, our data clarify the physical nature of lateral diffusion barriers in the ER and establish the role of such barriers in the asymmetric segregation of proteotoxic misfolded proteins during cell division and aging."

While these daughters are born young and form eternal lineages, the mother cells divides only a limited number of times (20\u201350) before stopping and dying. This process, termed replicative aging (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egilmez and Jazwinski, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Steinkraus et al., 2008</a>), is a consequence of the retention and accumulation of aging factors in the mother cell. A large variety of cellular features have been implicated in limiting the life span of yeast mother cells, including DNA-repair by-products called extra-chromosomal ribosomal DNA circles (ERCs), carbonylated proteins, oxidized lipids (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nystr\u00f6m, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Steinkraus et al., 2008</a>), multi drug transporters (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eldakak et al., 2010</a>), vacuolar pH and mitochondrial integrity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>). How many more factors contribute to aging, whether and how these factors influence each other, which of them are early and primary causes of aging, and which of them actually kill the cell at the end of its life remain unclear. We also know little about how the segregation of these factors is biased towards the mother cell during mitosis."

Accordingly, barrier defective cells are long-lived while their successive daughters become progressively shorter lived as they are born to mothers of increasing age. However, these mothers still age, indicating that they still accumulate some aging factors. Furthermore, the retention of old multi drug transporters in the mother cell is independent of the diffusion barriers (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eldakak et al., 2010</a>). Thus, several mechanisms control the segregation of aging factors towards the mother cell. However, what these mechanisms are and what their respective contribution to age segregation is remain unclear."

Briefly, the endogenous copy of the ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP/Kar2 is expressed as a fusion protein with the super-folding green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) to form Kar2-sfGFP. The sfGFP is followed by the amino acids HDEL which are the yeast equivalent of the ER retention signal (KDEL in animal cells), such as to maintain it in the ER-lumen. This protein is fully functional as a chaperone (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lajoie et al., 2012</a>). The diffusion of this Kar2-sfGFP, as recorded by FRAP, slows down as the levels of unfolded and aggregated proteins, with which it interacts, increase (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lajoie et al., 2012</a>). We exploited this assay to investigate the occupancy of Kar2-sfGFP with clients in the mother and bud compartments. In homeostatic wild type cells, the initial half time (<i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub>) of Kar2-sfGFP fluorescence recovery was 8.5 \u00b1 2.3 s in the mother compartment and similarly, 7.7 \u00b1 1.9 s in the bud (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). Consistent with the previous reports (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lajoie et al., 2012</a>), the mobility of Kar2-sfGFP dramatically decreased upon treating cells with a lethal dose of tunicamycin (Tm, 1 \u00b5g/ml), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, in both mother and bud (<i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 25.6 \u00b1 9.8 s and 23.4 \u00b1 10.1 s, respectively, after 2 hr, data not shown). However, when cells where treated with a non-lethal dose of the drug but for a longer time (0.5 \u00b5g/ml for 2 hr), to let misfolded proteins progressively accumulate, the situation was quite different (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Kar2-sfGFP diffusion slowed down with the incubation time in tunicamycin (<i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 15.1 \u00b1 6.8 after 1 hr and <i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 20.7 \u00b1 9.7 s after 2 hr, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The fraction of fast particles derived from the FRAP curves dropped from 65.7% in untreated mother cells to 19.0% in mother cells treated for 2 hr with Tm. Whereas Kar2-sfGFP diffusion was clearly slowed down in the mother cell, it remained quick in the bud (<i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 11.4 \u00b1 4.8 s after 1 hr and <i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 11.1 \u00b1 4.3 s after 2 hr, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), indicating that misfolded proteins accumulated slowly in the mother cell and did not invade the bud."

Therefore, impairing protein quality control in the ER by deleting <i>YOS9</i> or <i>HRD3</i> leads to a measurable increase in misfolded proteins in the mother part of the cell over time, but little in the bud. Since the <i>yos9\u0394</i> and <i>hrd3\u0394</i> mutant cells are also defective in ER associated degradation of misfolded proteins (ERAD), this data excludes the possibility that the low abundance of misfolded proteins in the bud compared to the mother is due to a more potent ERAD pathway in the bud."

Thus, we next characterized the localization of CPY*, a mutated form of the vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) that fails to properly fold and exit the ER. For visualization, we overexpressed GFP-tagged CPY* using the <i>GAL1</i>-promoter and monitored the fate of the protein by time-lapse microscopy. Over time, CPY*-GFP accumulated up to high levels in mother cell, but not in their buds. Even cells that underwent budding with high levels of CPY*-GFP in the ER in the mother cell showed no or very low levels of GFP signal in their growing bud (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, see also Figure 6C, upper panel). Prolonged over-expression of CPY*-GFP lead to the formation of strongly fluorescent dots in the mother cell that progressively became static. In order to monitor the dynamics of these aggregates, we performed a FRAP experiment on these cells. The aggregates did recover some fluorescence (from 37% \u00b1 5.4% 10s after bleaching to 53% \u00b1 10.4% 5 min after bleaching, n = 10 cells, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Therefore, the dynamics of the aggregates themselves is rather slow. Following the cells that underwent budding, we observed that the CPY*-GFP dots remained in the mother cell (Figure 6C). The buds started to form dots themselves only after they had separated from their mother. Thus, no aggregate or otherwise misfolded material appeared to diffuse from the mother cell into its bud."

At high temperature, Sec61-2 misfolds and is rapidly degraded. We tagged this allele with GFP and followed its localization. Its levels were already low at permissive temperature, and rapidly decreased upon incubation at 37\u00b0C as already shown for the untagged mutant protein (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bordallo et al., 1998</a>). We rationalized that even at permissive temperature, Sec61-2 is significantly misfolded. Therefore, we compared the segregation of Sec61-2 protein to the wild type, correctly folded, Sec61 protein in cells grown at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We measured the cortical ER mean fluorescence intensity in the mother cell (Im) and its growing bud (Ib), choosing the frame before anaphase as a reference point and calculated its asymmetry index ((Im\u2212Ib)/(Im + Ib)). This index had a value of 0.00 \u00b1 0.09 (n = 52 cells) for wild type Sec61-GFP showing that Sec61-GFP distributes equally between the cortical ER of the mother cell and its bud (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

We then used a strain in which Sec61-2-GFP is a bit more stable, since the ERAD gene <i>UBC7</i> is deleted. In <i>ubc7\u0394</i> mutant cells the asymmetry index of Sec61-2-GFP reached an even higher value (0.27 \u00b1 0.14, n = 71 cells) than in the single Sec61-2-GFP mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>, p&lt;0.0001 <i>t</i> test), consistent with a stabilization of misfolded Sec61-2 proteins and their specific retention in the mother cell. Unlike for CPY*-GFP, no large dots or aggregates were observed. Therefore, we conclude that misfolded Sec61-2 is asymmetrically retained in the mother compartment, and that retention does not require aggregation."

To determine whether confinement of ER stress to the mother cell required ER compartmentalization, we next set out to characterize in more details how the ER diffusion barrier is established. Based on its published genetic interaction with the septin mutation <i>cdc3-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Costanzo et al., 2010</a>), we discovered that the sphinganine C4-hydroxylase Sur2 is required for proper barrier formation. Evidence for ER compartmentalization was obtained using fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ellenberg et al., 1997</a>) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Luedeke et al., 2005</a>), using the ER membrane protein Sec61-GFP as a reporter. Upon repeated photobleaching of a small area of the cortical ER in the mother cell, fluorescence loss elsewhere in the cell is proportional to the exchange rate of the reporter protein between the considered and the photobleached area. As reported for other ER-membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib31\">Luedeke et al., 2005</a>), Sec61-GFP fluorescence is rapidly depleted throughout the wild type mother cell (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, red curves), but not in her bud (green curves), indicating that exchange through the bud neck is reduced.

The value of this index increases when exchange between mother and bud becomes limited. In wild type cells, the BI was 7.5 \u00b1 2.3. In contrast, in <i>sur2\u0394</i> mutant cells Sec61-GFP compartmentalization was reduced, with a BI of 3.5 \u00b1 1.1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>). Based on this, we rationalized that sphingolipids may contribute to barrier formation. To test this hypothesis, we used the same assay to characterize the involvement of other genes required for sphingolipid biosynthesis. We disrupted the serine palmitoyl-transferase Lcb1 (required for the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis) by either using a temperature sensitive allele (<i>lcb1-100</i>) or the Lcb1 specific inhibitor Myriocin, the ceramide phosphoinositol transferase Aur1 using the inhibitor Aureobasidin A and the Inositolphosphotransferase Ipt1 (involved in the synthesis of mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide) through deletion of its gene. In all these cases, Sec61-GFP compartmentalization was strongly affected (BI between 3.6 and 4, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In contrast, the ER diffusion barrier was not significantly affected upon inhibition of the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway (<i>gpt2\u0394, sct1\u0394,</i> BI = 6 and 5.8, respectively, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>), the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway (<i>cho2\u0394</i> BI = 5.8), the lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis pathway (<i>alg3\u0394</i> BI = 5.9, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>) or the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (<i>erg3\u0394</i>, <i>erg5\u0394</i> BI = 6.2 and 6.3, respectively, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

It is therefore important that factors required for its establishment localize early on to the bud site. Therefore, we speculated that factors acting in early polarization events, leading to bud emergence, might also promote barrier formation. The earliest event in bud formation consists in the selection of the future site of bud emergence and the recruitment of the polarization machinery. This is achieved by the GTPase Bud1/Rsr1(<a href=\"#bib6\">Bender and Pringle, 1989</a>), which is activated at the future site of bud emergence and recruits and activates Cdc24, the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho-related GTPase Cdc42, a broadly conserved regulator of cellular polarity in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chant et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Powers et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bender, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Park et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zheng et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shimada et al., 2004</a>). At the plasma membrane, Bud1 is activated by its own GEF, Bud5, which is deposited at the site of the previous cytokinesis through its interaction with the septin cytoskeleton. Upon bud emergence Bud5 re-localizes to the neck of the newly growing bud, where it stays throughout bud growth and where its function is unknown. The Bud2 protein forms the GTPase activating protein (GAP) involved in Bud1 inactivation. Due to the ability of the Cdc24/Cdc42 module to auto-activate, <i>bud1\u0394</i> cells still form buds, but at random positions."

A <i>CDC24</i> mutant allele, <i>cdc24-4</i>, abolishes this interaction at room temperature (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shimada et al., 2004</a>), a condition under which it is otherwise fully functional, that is, promotes normal cellular polarization and bud emergence, albeit at a random position. Thus, we tested whether the <i>cdc24-4</i> mutant cells still compartmentalized the ER membrane properly under this regime. In addition, we used the <i>cdc42-1</i> temperature sensitive allele to test whether Cdc42 contributed to barrier formation. FLIP experiments were carried out using Sec61-GFP as a reporter in the <i>cdc24-4</i> mutant cells at room temperature and in the <i>cdc42-1</i> mutant cells shifted to the restrictive temperature (37\u00b0C) after bud emergence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Both, <i>cdc24-4</i> (BI = 2.8 \u00b1 1.1) and <i>cdc42-1</i> mutations (BI = 2.5 \u00b1 1.4) abolished barrier assembly in the cortical ER-membrane to the same extent as <i>BUD1</i> inactivation. Taken together, our results indicate that Bud1 mediates the formation of the diffusion barrier in the cortical ER essentially through regulation of Cdc24 and activation of the GTPase Cdc42."

Thus, we asked whether these molecules also contributed to the assembly of the diffusion barrier in the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boettcher et al., 2012</a>). We performed FLIP on either the nuclear pore complex component Nup49 or the outer nuclear membrane protein Nsg1, each tagged with GFP. For both reporters, repeated photobleaching in a small area of early anaphase nuclei in the mother cell caused the rapid and complete depletion of fluorescence in the entire mother part of the nucleus. In contrast, the fluorescence in the bud part of the anaphase nucleus of wild type cells remained high (BI = 23.2 \u00b1 5.4 for Nup49, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and 9.5 \u00b1 3.7 for Nsg1, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>). In the <i>sur2\u0394</i> mutant cells, the fluorescence loss in the bud was significantly faster than in wild type cells (BI = 12 \u00b1 1.4 for Nup49, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and 4.9 for Nsg1, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Remarkably, the <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutation affected the compartmentalization of neither Nup49 nor Nsg1 (BI = 26.1 \u00b1 13.1 and Nsg1-GFP 10.9 \u00b1 2.6, respectively, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Similarly, the <i>cdc24-4</i> mutation did not affect nuclear envelope compartmentalization at room temperature (BI = 9.1 \u00b1 2.4 for Nsg1, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Therefore, the Bud1 signaling module functions in the assembly of the barrier in the cortical ER specifically, whereas sphingolipids are involved in the formation of barriers in both the cortical ER and the nuclear envelope."

In order to determine this, we first analysed the dynamics of Kar2-sfGFP in <i>sur2\u0394</i> and <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutant cells. The <i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> of Kar2-sfGFP in mother and buds of these mutant cells was very similar to wild type values (8.2 \u00b1 2.1 s and 7.7 \u00b1 2.6 s in <i>sur2\u0394</i>; 7.6 \u00b1 2.6 s and 7.4 \u00b1 2.5 s in <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutant cells; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), indicating that neither of these mutations caused misfolding or ER stress on their own. As reported earlier, treatment with Tm (2 hr, 0.5 \u00b5g/ml) slowed down Kar2 dynamics over time in the mother cell much more than in the daughter cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Similarly, Kar2-sfGFP mobility strongly decreased in the <i>sur2\u0394</i> and <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutant cells treated with Tm (in mother cells <i>t</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub> = 26.5 \u00b1 8.1 and 25 \u00b1 10.6, respectively; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). However, the asymmetry of Kar2-sfGFP between mother and bud was lost, the mobility of Kar2-sfGFP being considerably slowed down in the bud as well (<i>sur2\u0394</i> = 19.7 \u00b1 7.4 and <i>bud1\u0394 =</i>18.7 \u00b1 8.8, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Thus, inactivation of Sur2 and Bud1 did not affect the appearance of misfolded proteins and the emergence of ER stress in the presence of Tm, but caused misfolded proteins to distribute more equally between mother and bud."

Supporting this view, the <i>yos9\u0394 bud1\u0394</i> double mutant cells (22 generations) lived similarly long as the <i>bud1\u0394</i> (23 generations) and significantly longer than the <i>yos9\u0394</i> single mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Likewise, the <i>sur2\u0394 yos9\u0394</i> double mutant cells (28 generations) lived nearly as long as the <i>sur2\u0394</i> (30 generations) and longer than the <i>yos9\u0394</i> single mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Thus, weakening the cER diffusion barrier is sufficient to suppress the toxic effect of the <i>YOS9</i> deletion on life span. However, we note that <i>sur2\u0394</i> mutant cells are longer lived than wild type cells, whereas <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutant cells are slightly shorter lived (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We previously showed that weakening the ER and the nuclear envelope diffusion barriers through the deletion of the <i>BUD6</i> gene extended life span, probably by passing on aging factors to the mother's cell progeny (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>). Here, Sur2 is required for the formation of both barriers, hence for the retention of aging factors from both the ER and the nucleus, whereas Bud1 is only required for the ER barrier. Since <i>sur2\u0394</i> mutant cells are long-lived and <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutant cell slightly short lived, it seems that the ER diffusion barrier is not required for the retention of the aging factors limiting the life span of cells growing under optimal conditions. The ER diffusion barrier seems to become critical for aging only upon induction of ER stress."

Furthermore, sphingolipid biosynthesis was among the only requisites conserved in both the cortical and the nuclear diffusion barriers. These observations suggested that the barrier might consist of a specialized lipid domain in the ER-membranes at the bud neck. We rationalized that the exclusion of the proteins Sec61 and Hmg1 from the bud neck region (<a href=\"#bib31\">Luedeke et al., 2005</a>) might indicate that the ER-membrane composition is indeed distinct in this area. Therefore, we next wondered whether all ER membrane proteins were excluded from the ER-membrane at the bud neck. A set of such proteins, namely Lcb1, Sur2, Get1 and Ste24 was tagged with GFP in cells expressing the ER lumen marker dsRed-HDEL (<a href=\"#bib37\">Onischenko et al., 2009</a>), and their localization to the bud neck was characterized. Lcb1 and Sur2 are both required for the biosynthesis of sphingolipids (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dickson, 2008</a>), Get1 is involved in the insertion of tail anchored proteins into the ER membrane (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schuldiner et al., 2008</a>) and Ste24 is a conserved zinc metalloprotease required for alpha-factor peptide maturation and CAAX-box protein processing (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boyartchuk et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fujimura-Kamada et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tam et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">2001</a>). All of these proteins were excluded from the bud neck region, whereas dsRed-HDEL was not (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Therefore, all ER membrane proteins tested so far are excluded from the bud neck region. As previously shown (<a href=\"#bib31\">Luedeke et al., 2005</a>), dsRed-HDEL localization showed that the ER is a continuous organelle between the mother and bud.

To test this possibility, we asked whether disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis affected the exclusion of trans-membrane proteins from the ER membrane at the bud neck. Therefore, we characterized the localization of Sec61-GFP at the bud neck in various barrier mutants. The phenotypes observed for individual cells were sorted in three categories (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). In the group 1 (green) Sec61-GFP was totally excluded from the bud neck. At the other extreme, Sec61-GFP localization was continuous at the bud neck periphery in at least one side of the neck in the cells from the group 3 (red). The group 2 (grey) consisted of the cells with intermediate phenotypes. In wild type cells, 81% of cells totally excluded Sec61-GFP from the bud neck (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). The <i>shs1\u0394</i> mutant cells showed the most prominent loss of Sec61-GFP exclusion from the bud neck (\u223c5%; <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). The <i>bud1</i>\u0394, <i>bud5</i>\u0394, <i>cdc24-4</i> and <i>lcb1-100</i> single mutant cells formed the second strongest set of mutants, showing a very strong defect in Sec61-GFP exclusion (between 27\u201335%, <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>), closely followed by the <i>sur2</i>\u0394 and <i>bud6</i>\u0394 mutant cells (44\u201347% exclusion).

Therefore, formation of the exclusion zone in the ER-membrane at the bud neck is the most downstream event in the pathway of barrier formation, and the only event to depend on sphingolipid biosynthesis.

Similar to Sec61-GFP, total exclusion of DiOC<sub>6</sub> from the bud neck was most strongly affected in the <i>shs1\u0394</i> septin mutant cells (wt = 77%, <i>shs1\u0394</i> = 10% exclusion), followed by the <i>lcb1-100</i>, and <i>bud6\u0394</i> single mutant cells (38%, 40% exclusion, respectively, <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). The <i>sur2</i>\u0394, <i>bud1</i>\u0394, <i>bud5</i>\u0394 and <i>cdc24-4</i> mutations caused a slightly weaker phenotype (between 46\u201350% exclusion), whereas the <i>alg3</i>\u0394 and <i>gpt2</i>\u0394 mutations showed the weakest or no phenotype (between 64\u201373% exclusion, <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). Thus, the entire barrier pathway was required for the exclusion of the lipid dye DiOC6 from the ER membrane at the bud neck, including sphingolipids, supporting the conclusion that barrier formation involves the assembly of a specialized membrane domain of unique lipid composition in the ER membrane at the bud neck."

To start addressing these questions, we investigated the organization and function of ER barriers in budding yeast. This study establishes several points. Firstly, they reveal the importance of sphingolipids in the organization and compartmentalization of the ER. Together with the observation that most membrane proteins are partially excluded from the barrier area, our data suggest a mechanism for how barriers form and function, (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a> and \u2019Diffusion barriers as specialized lipid domains of the ER membrane\u2019). Secondly, our study indicates that different barriers are probably based on similar principles, yet their formation is dictated by different signaling mechanisms. We have identified some of the signaling processes involved in the assembly of the diffusion barrier in the cortical ER, namely the Bud1 and the Cdc24 module. However, the nuclear envelope diffusion barrier is not affected in the <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutant cells, indicating that assembly of the nuclear barrier is controlled differently. Thirdly, this difference in regulation allows the barriers to be studied individually to assess their specific functions. In general, these studies underline the importance of lateral diffusion barriers in the confinement of cellular stress to the mother cell. They also allow distinguishing the relative impact of different types of stresses on cellular aging under different growth conditions. We discuss below each of these three aspects of our findings in more detail."

Replicative aging of the mother is thought to be caused by the accumulation of damages, which they do not share with their daughters. However, what these different factors are and how they are retained in the mother cell is unclear. Here, we show that misfolded ER-proteins are retained in the mother cell by two distinct mechanisms: the formation of nearly immobile aggregates, and the retention of smaller entities by the diffusion barrier in the cortical ER membrane at the bud neck. Interestingly, the fact that the barrier in the ER membrane helps retaining individual, misfolded proteins in the mother cell, although many of them, including CPY*, are luminal, indicates that an unidentified receptor may anchor them in the membrane. Under optimal growth conditions, wild type cells appear to contain only little misfolded proteins and ER stress does not appear to be the main cause of their demise with age. Indeed, if ER stress were a constitutive cause of aging, disruption of the barrier in the cortical ER should systematically increase the longevity of the cells, which is not the case. However, low concentrations of tunicamycin or affecting protein quality control increased the load of misfolded proteins, and accelerated aging. Allowing mothers to pass stress on to their daughters by down regulating the ER diffusion barrier diluted this stress, as shown by the fact that it reduced the load in the mother cells and restored the life span of the <i>yos9</i>\u0394 mother cells. Thus, retention of ER-misfolded proteins in the mother cell caused stress and accelerated aging. ER stress may therefore be considered as a conditional aging factor. This might be particularly the case in highly secreting cells, such as beta-pancreatic cells in mammals (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kennedy et al., 2010</a>)."

But it was unclear how septins, which are closely apposed to the plasma membrane, promote formation of a barrier on both sides of the ER lumen. Two observations may help solving this conundrum. First, the role of septins in barrier assembly is partly indirect. The fact that the GTPases Bud1 and Cdc42 contribute to barrier formation downstream of septins suggests that the localization signal originating at the plasma membrane spreads from there to specialize the ER-membrane at the bud neck (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). This signal regulates the assembly of a specialized membrane domain, which itself functions as a barrier. However, none of the mutants characterized shows as strong a phenotype as the septin mutant <i>shs1</i>\u0394. Therefore, septins might function above more than only one pathway in barrier assembly.

Although the luminal marker dsRed-HDEL confirms the presence of the ER at the cortex of the bud neck, Sec61 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Luedeke et al., 2005</a>) and all the ER-membrane protein that we visualized, as well as the lipid dye DiOC6 are excluded from the ER in this area.

Thus, it would be in principle possible that an ER-specific pool of sphingolipids is directly involved in barrier formation. If this were the case, it would explain why DiOC6 is excluded from the ER-membrane in the barrier areas. DiOC6 stains membranes essentially through interaction with hydrophilic heads of lipids, and shows little affinity for sphingolipid-rich membranes.

The idea that such lipids form a core component of lateral diffusion barriers is attractive for several reasons. The long fatty acid chains would promote the formation of a thicker lipid bilayer. This would explain why proteins with transmembrane domains tailored to fit the average thickness of the ER membrane are excluded from the barrier area. Furthermore, long-chain sphingolipids are thought to be prone to form liquid ordered domains (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aresta-Branco et al., 2011</a>), promoting their separation from other lipids. In this area, the membrane would be predicted to be less fluid and to disperse only slowly, two ideal conditions for the formation of a localized barrier. However, it is very unlikely that this domain would be stable by itself. Therefore, it is likely that the barrier must be continuously reassembled and thus would comprise protein components to stabilize it. Bud6 is an excellent candidate for such a function. Indeed, its localization to the bud neck does not depend on sphingolipids, yet Bud6, which is a peripheral membrane protein (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jin and Amberg, 2000</a>), acts in forming the specialized membrane domain. Thus, one of Bud6 function may be to stabilize a sphingolipid domain in the ER membrane at the bud neck, probably together with other not yet identified proteins. Actin would be here an excellent candidate, given the role of Bud6 in actin cable formation and actin binding. However attractive this model is, we have so far no dye that stains sphingolipids in yeast, such that we are not in the position yet to determine whether sphingolipids indeed accumulate in the ER-membrane at the bud neck. Identifying sphingolipid-binding proteins will probably be necessary in order to solve this issue. Future studies will also need to identify the exact identity of the sphingolipids involved."

However, we still know little about whether the ER is also compartmentalized in other eukaryotes. Based on the function of ER barriers in yeast, namely the asymmetric segregation of damages and aging determinants, it is tempting to assume that similar barriers will be found to play similar roles in a wide variety of other cell types, and particularly in cells that show strong self renewal."

The cells were imaged on a confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a Plan Apochromat 63 \u00d7 /1.4 NA oil immersion objective, using 2% of argon laser intensity (488 nm line) at 40% output. The ZEN 2010 software (Carl Zeiss) was used to control the microscope. GFP emission was detected with a 505 nm long pass filter. Photobleaching was applied on a region of interest (ROI) as indicated in the figures. For FLIP experiments, the bleaching regions were irradiated with 80 iterations at 80% laser power and 40% transmission over a period of 40 frames. For FRAP experiments, bleaching was applied once with 60 iterations in the bud compartment or 70 iterations in the mother compartment at 80% laser power and 40% transmission. All photobleaching experiments were performed at 30\u00b0C, unless stated otherwise."

All experiments were pooled and transferred to Prism 5.0b (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California), in which a one-phase decay curve constraining the first bleaching point to 100% was fitted.

The nature of the diffusion barrier and the signaling pathways and factors that mediate its formation are poorly understood. This study sheds light on the formation and lipid composition of the nuclear and ER membrane diffusion barrier, and shows that misfolded and presumably aggregated proteins are also asymmetrically retained within the mother cell. The main findings regarding the hierarchical roles of septins, Bud/Cdc42 signaling and sphingolipid biosynthesis for the formation of the diffusion barrier are well substantiated and represent a significant advance in the field."

The protein encoded by the sec61-2 allele is known to misfold and to be sent for degradation by ERAD at restrictive temperature (Bordallo, Plemper, Finger, &amp; Wolf, 1998). Already at permissive temperature, the levels of Sec61-2-GFP were much lower than those of wild type Sec61-GFP, suggesting that misfolding and degradation already happened. In an ERAD mutant (here <i>ubc7\u0394</i>), misfolded Sec61-2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bordallo et al., 1998</a>) and Sec61-2-GFP (this study) are degraded much slower, allowing to look at its distribution. Measuring the cortical ER fluorescence intensity, we observed that Sec61-2-GFP is retained is the mother part (asymmetry index of 0.27 in <i>ubc7\u0394</i> and 0.12 in wild-type), whereas wild type Sec61-GFP is symmetrically distributed (asymmetry index of 0.00). Therefore, when misfolded this ER-transmembrane protein is also retained in the mother cell during asymmetric cell division. Note that in this case we do not observe the formation of aggregates as is the case for CPY*-GFP. This suggests that misfolded proteins do not require their aggregation or at least the formation of large structures to be selectively retained in the mother cell."

Hence, aggregation takes place in the retention compartment."

If instead we acutely stress the cells, for example using high tunicamycin concentrations, misfolding takes place in both the mother and the bud and BiP is very rapidly slowed down in both compartments. Thus, the slowing-down of BiP and misfolded CPY*-GFP observed in the mother cell are most likely not due to retro-transport of stress from the bud into the mother cell, but more probably to the fact that the stress confined into the mother accumulates there over the time while the buds grow protected from this stress."

As can be observed, while the bud grows, the CPY* aggregates already existing remain in the mother cell and increase in intensity, whereas the bud forms its own aggregates only later. For what concerns Sec61-2-GFP, at permissive temperature the cells grow buds that inherit much less of the protein than what is present in their mother. Again, equilibration takes place, but after division is completed. In both cases, elimination of the diffusion barrier using the <i>bud1\u0394</i> mutation speeds up equilibration, which takes place now during bud growth and prior to the separation of the bud from its mother."

Supporting our view, we observe that in the mother compartment the dynamics of Kar2 are slower and slower as the duration of tunicamycin treatment increases, while it remains fast in the buds emerging from these mothers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Thus, these data are supporting the idea that the asymmetry between the mother and the bud builds with time due to the retention of material in the mother."

It is difficult to give precise information because in the long-term the proportion of recovery as well as recovery speed are limited by the exchange between mother and bud, the amount of fluorescence bleached in the first place, and the fraction trapped in the immobile fraction. Thus, all what we can say is that indeed the recoverable fraction drops in stressed cells, indicating that indeed a substantial fraction of Kar2 is immobilized in response to stress. We added a two-phase association analysis of Kar2-sfGFP FRAP curves of untreated mother cells and mother cells treated with Tm. We observe that in the untreated cells the fraction of fast moving particles is rather high (65.7%) while it becomes low in cells treated with tunicamycin (19.0%). About whether this reflects immobilization into big aggregates or tethering to other structures is difficult to tell. We observe that there are indeed \u201cdots\u201d forming in response to TM and overall the signal appears more granular. But whether this is due to trapping of Kar2 into aggregates or other, more functional structures is not known."

With our new CPY*-GFP movies (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) we can see that CPY*-GFP accumulates in the mother cell while the bud grows largely free of misfolded proteins. The accumulation of general misfolded proteins is also reported clearly by the slowing down of Kar2-sfGFP dynamics in the mother cells after one hour or two hours Tm treatment (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Finally our new experiments with Sec61-2-GFP shows that this misfolded protein stays in the mother cell while the bud grows (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a> and g, and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Also wild type buds form aggregates, but only after they have completed mitosis and separated from their mother. Thus, misfolded proteins formed in the mother cell are retained by the barrier in the mother compartment where they may eventually be immobilized further by aggregation. Overall our new data suggest that the formation of large, mainly immobile, and slowly dynamic structures and the retention of smaller misfolded entities by the cER diffusion barrier lead to progressive accumulation of stress in the mother and help the formation of a bud largely free of proteotoxic species. This view is supported by the aging experiments."

Hence, we conclude that under optimal growth conditions ER stress is not noticeably limiting the lifespan of the mother cells, whereas a nuclear factor probably does."
