The molecular mechanisms governing secretory granule maturation are largely unknown. Here, we investigate a highly conserved protein named HID-1 in a mouse model. A conditional knockout of HID-1 in pancreatic \u03b2 cells leads to glucose intolerance and a remarkable increase in the serum proinsulin/insulin ratio caused by defective proinsulin processing. Large volume three-dimensional electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging reveal that ISGs are much more abundant in the absence of HID-1. We further demonstrate that HID-1 deficiency prevented secretory granule maturation by blocking homotypic fusion of immature secretory granules. Our data identify a novel player during the early maturation of immature secretory granules."

The molecular mechanisms governing secretory granule maturation are largely unknown. Here, we investigate a highly conserved protein named HID-1 in a mouse model. A conditional knockout of HID-1 in pancreatic \u03b2 cells leads to glucose intolerance and a remarkable increase in the serum proinsulin/insulin ratio caused by defective proinsulin processing. Large volume three-dimensional electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging reveal that ISGs are much more abundant in the absence of HID-1. We further demonstrate that HID-1 deficiency prevented secretory granule maturation by blocking homotypic fusion of immature secretory granules. Our data identify a novel player during the early maturation of immature secretory granules."

Secretory granules (SGs, also known as dense core vesicles, DCVs) are specialized organelles of the regulated secretory pathway and play crucial roles in a wide variety of biological processes, including organism development, synaptic plasticity, immunity and metabolism. After passing through the TGN, peptide hormones and neuropeptides are first packaged and stored in immature secretory granules (ISGs). ISGs then undergo multiple maturation steps to become mature secretory granules (MSGs). These maturation steps include 'sorting-by-entry' of SG-specific cargoes, homotypic fusion of ISGs, acidification of granular lumen, condensation and processing of peptide hormones by prohormone convertases PC1/3 and PC2, and 'sorting-by-retention' (or 'sorting-by-exit') to remove cargoes not destined for SGs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arvan and Castle, 1998</a>). Homotypic fusion of ISGs has been observed in several neuroendocrine cells, including PC12 cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahras et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tooze et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wendler et al., 2001</a>), pituitary cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Farquhar and Palade, 1981</a>)\u00a0and mast cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hammel and Meilijson, 2015</a>), and in the formation of large dense core vesicles in yeast (<a href=\"#bib8\">Asensio et al., 2013</a>), but\u00a0it has not been observed in pancreatic \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Arvan and Halban, 2004</a>). Hence, it remains unclear whether homotypic fusion is universally required for SG maturation."

SNARE proteins (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein (SNAP) receptors) are essential components of the highly conserved machinery involved in membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</a>). An\u00a0in vitro fusion assay has revealed that ISG homotypic fusion is dependent on NSF and \u03b1-SNAP (<a href=\"#bib66\">Urbe et al., 1998</a>) and on the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 (STX6), but not on syntaxin 1 or SNAP-25 (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wendler et al., 2001</a>). It has been suggested that Syt-IV, a synaptotagmin protein that interacts with SNAREs, localizes to ISGs and is involved in SG maturation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahras et al., 2006</a>). While SNAREs are essential components of membrane fusion, they often require other accessory proteins to facilitate the assembly of SNARE complexes and to\u00a0coordinate the tethering/docking and priming of vesicles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pfeffer, 1999</a>).

We first generated <i>Hid1</i>-floxed mice by introducing two LoxP sites into the intronic region flanking exons 2\u20136 of the mouse <i>Hid1</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Then, <i>Hid1</i>-floxed mice were mated with mice overexpressing Cre recombinase under the control of the rat insulin 2 gene promoter (RIP-Cre mice) to produce cell-specific HID-1 KO mice (Hid1-betaKO, homozygous for <i>Hid1<sup>flox/flox\u00a0</sup></i>and heterozygous for RIP-Cre). As demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, HID-1 protein was greatly reduced in islets isolated from Hid1-betaKOmice compared to that\u00a0in\u00a0age-matched RIP-Cre mice, which were used thereafter as wild-type (WT) controls. The remaining expression of HID-1 in KO islets was only 20% of that from WT islets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). By positive immunofluorescence staining, we verified that HID-1 was highly expressed in pancreatic \u03b2 cells, but only weakly expressed in \u03b1 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Histogram analysis of HID-1 levels in individual \u03b2 cells confirmed the largely reduced expression of HID-1 in KO \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Hid1-betaKOmice are viable and fertile, and the mice showed no obvious phenotype with respect to body weight (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), feeding, mating performance and overall behavior. To determine whether the disruption of HID-1 in \u03b2 cells corresponds to abnormalities in the temporal control of glucose metabolism, we analyzed glucose profiles upon intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of glucose or insulin. At 10\u201312 weeks of age, Hid1-betaKOmice exhibited higher basal glucose levels and glucose intolerance than RIP-Cre mice during glucose-tolerance testing (GTT, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). However, Hid1-betaKO mice performed normally in insulin-tolerance testing (ITT) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). These results indicate that impaired glucose tolerance may be caused by insufficient insulin release."

Interestingly, the serum proinsulin level was markedly elevated from 5 pM in WT mice to 78 pM in Hid1-betaKOmice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), whereas the basal insulin level was only slightly increased (150 \u00b1 29 pM for WT and 198 \u00b1 39 pM for KO mice). The ratio between proinsulin and insulin was determined to be 3.3%, consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wijesekara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhu et al., 2002</a>). This value increased to 39.4% in KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The increase of proinsulin may be partially caused by the prolonged plasma half-life of proinsulin, as compared with insulin,\u00a0in the circulation. To address this possibility, we directly measured glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from isolated islets. We found that isolated size-matched islets from Hid1-betaKO mice released much less insulin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), but more proinsulin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), in response to glucose stimulation. It has been reported that RIP-Cre mice have Cre expression in a population of hypothalamic neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). To rule out the possibility that the elevated proinsulin phenotype in Hid1-betaKO mice was secondary to HID-1 function in neurons, we generated HID-1 KO in all neurons employing Nestin-Cre mice. Pan-neuronal ablation of HID-1 failed to increase proinsulin in the serum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the elevated proinsulin phenotype was mainly due to lack of HID-1 function in pancreatic \u03b2 cells."

Conversion of proinsulin to insulin involves cleavage at two sites to remove the C-peptide that links the B and A chains (<a href=\"#bib56\">Steiner et al., 2016</a>). In pancreatic \u03b2 cells, PC2 and PC1/3 are present in the SGs, and these enzymes are believed to cooperate in the processing of proinsulin. It has been suggested that PC1/3 first acts at the B\u2013C junction to produce the intermediate des-31,32 proinsulin, whereas PC2 preferentially cleaves at the A\u2013C junction to produce the intermediate des-64,65 proinsulin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Halban and Irminger, 1994</a>). To further confirm the involvement of HID-1 in proinsulin processing and to\u00a0understand which cleavage steps are affected in the absence of HID-1, we knocked out HID-1 in the insulin-secreting cell line (INS-1) using TALEN technology. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, western blotting confirmed the complete absence of HID-1 protein, increased proinsulin and reduced insulin in HID-1 KO INS-1 cells."

Insulin1 was analyzed because products from the <i>Ins1</i> gene are predominant in rats (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gishizky and Grodsky, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Michael et al., 1987</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

The insulin/proinsulin ratio was significantly lower in the KO cells than in WT controls during the chase period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). These results were in accordance with the phenomenon observed in Hid1-betaKO mice. The retarded appearance of both des-31,32 and des-64,65 Proinsulin1 during the chase period indicated the concurrent impairment of PC1/3 and PC2 function in the KO INS-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>)."

Consequently,\u00a0we\u00a0employed immunofluorescence imaging to reveal the subcellular localization of proinsulin. Interestingly, we observed a dispersed distribution of proinsulin throughout the HID-1 KO cells, which\u00a0was\u00a0unlike the perinuclear localization seen in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The density of proinsulin vesicles was significantly increased from 0.58 \u00b1 0.10/\u00b5m<sup>3</sup> in WT cells to 0.99 \u00b1 0.07/\u00b5m<sup>3</sup> in KO cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Since proinsulin is a specific ISG marker, the increase in proinsulin signals may reflect an increase in the number of ISGs. To test this hypothesis, we further checked other ISG markers, VAMP4 and Syt-IV. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A and C</a>, both VAMP4 and Syt-IV localized to the peri-nuclear region, and co-localized with proinsulin puncta to a similar extent (similar Pearson coefficient). In HID-1 KO \u03b2 cells, proinsulin and Syt-IV were similarly dispersed throughout the cytosol and displayed a\u00a0similar extent of co-localization as in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> A and C, bottom, B and D). By contrast, VAMP4 remained in the peri-nuclear region and did not co-localize with proinsulin in KO cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> A and B). Thus, proinsulin-positive ISGs in HID-1 KO cells seem to retain Syt-IV but not VAMP4, suggesting that\u00a0VAMP4 recruitment to\u00a0r retention\u00a0in ISG depends on HID-1. Besides, a\u00a0previous study has suggested that VAMP4 is not an essential component for ISG\u2013ISG fusion process (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wendler et al., 2001</a>)."

As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, ultrathin sectioning of granules of this size gives rise to various sub-maximum cross-sections, depending on where the section is on the z-axis, which leads to under-estimation of the granule size and makes it difficult to analyze the density and detailed morphology of the granules. The recent development of combining scanning EM (SEM) with focused ion beam (FIB) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) has provided a powerful new method to study the morphology and distribution of SGs in whole cells at nanometer resolution (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>,<a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). Typical SGs exhibit a dark (electron dense) central core and a delimiting membrane, separated by a clear region (halo) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The grey levels of the dense core indicate the extent of packaging and condensation of insulin. It has been suggested that ISGs exhibit lighter dense cores than MSGs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Furuta et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wijesekara et al., 2010</a>). Since the grey levels of dense cores are not directly comparable between different SEM experiments, we compared the grey level distribution between the Golgi region and the peripheral region (&lt;1\u2009\u03bcm from the PM) from the same SEM volume (13.7\u00a0x\u00a011.8\u00a0x\u00a05 \u03bcm<sup>3</sup>) in both WT and KO \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). Our results showed that in WT \u03b2 cells, the grey levels of dense cores are mostly distributed in a zone with higher values (grey level &gt; 190, designated as denser cores in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and only a small proportion are in a zone with lower values (grey level &lt; 190, designated as lighter cores in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The lighter core SGs were mostly from the Golgi region (84.0%), while the peripheral SGs are almost denser cores (99.2%). This result confirms the existence of at least two populations of SGs, ISGs and MSGs in resting WT \u03b2 cells, and suggests that only a small fraction of ISGs are in the Golgi region. However, in KO cells, the clear distinction between the two populations was replaced by continuous distribution of grey levels from light to dense values (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Adopting the same separation of grey level as for WT cells, we found that there were many more granules with a lighter dense core (&lt;190) in KO cells than in WT cells for both peripheral (47.6% vs 0.8%) and Golgi (87.8% vs 11.7%) regions, suggesting the appearance of more ISGs in both regions in the absence of HID-1. We further compared SG size and found that the SGs in peripheral regions were significantly larger than those in the Golgi region in WT \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>). The presence of larger SGs in the peripheral regions is consistent with the maturation of SGs on their way from the Golgi to the periphery because it has been reported that ISGs can fuse with each other and become larger in size during maturation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib66\">Urbe et al., 1998</a>). However, HID-1 deficiency significantly decreased the size of SGs in the peripheral region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2F,G</a>), suggesting abnormal maturation of SGs."

                                "text": "Early morphological studies showed that newly generated ISGs are small as they emerge from the TGN, and then appear to fuse together to form larger MSGs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Salpeter and Farquhar, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Smith and Farquhar, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tooze et al., 1991</a>). Later, this concept of homotypic fusion of ISGs was validated using in vitro reconstitution assays (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tooze and Huttner, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Urbe et al., 1998</a>). It is believed that homotypic ISG fusion is important for the\u00a0condensation and refinement of the contents and for\u00a0remodeling of the membrane. However, homotypic ISG fusion has been reported in neuroendocrine cells, including PC12 cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahras et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tooze et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wendler et al., 2001</a>), mammotroph pituitary cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Farquhar and Palade, 1981</a>)\u00a0and mast cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hammel and Meilijson, 2015</a>), and in yeast (<a href=\"#bib8\">Asensio et al., 2013</a>), but not in endocrine cells such as pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Evidence for an absence of homotypic fusion in \u03b2 cells mainly rests on the analysis of granule size. First, a\u00a0dominant-negative construct against STX6 caused a delay in proinsulin processing but failed to affect the size of insulin granules (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuliawat et al., 2004</a>). Second, EM data in \u03b2 cells did not reveal an increase in diameter of MSGs, but rather some shrinkage of granules as they age (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hutton, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Noske et al., 2008</a>). Determination of the granule size on thin sections can be tricky because planar sectioning at random depths through spherical granules tends to underestimate the diameter of granules and largely increase the variation. Besides, the study by\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Noske et al. (2008</a>)\u00a0did\u00a0not compare the size of ISG and MSG, but rather reported a size change of older granules between two cells. Hence, large-volume 3D EM analysis of intact granules from multiple cells is needed for unbiased estimation of granule size and for\u00a0comparison between ISGs and MSGs. In this study,\u00a0we employed automatic FIB-SEM to visualize a\u00a0large volume (13.7\u00a0x\u00a011.8\u00a0x\u00a03~8 \u03bcm<sup>3</sup>) at nanometer resolution and analyzed thousands of intact granules from 15 cells. We analyzed not only the diameter, but also the grey level of the cores and the subcellular localization of granules. This comprehensive analysis enables us to separate ISGs from MSGs clearly\u00a0and to\u00a0conclude that MSGs have larger size in \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Moreover, we have directly visualized homotypic fusion events (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) despite their rareness. Together with\u00a0data\u00a0from in vitro ISG fusion assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), these lines\u00a0of\u00a0evidence clearly demonstrate the existence of homotypic ISG fusion in endocrine \u03b2 cells. Please note that maturation of SGs may not always come with an increase in diameter, MSGs can either become smaller or larger than ISGs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tooze et al., 2001</a>). Maturation involves membrane remodeling steps of both homotypic fusion and budding events. Homotypic fusion would result in an increase in the size of ISGs, whereas budding of clathrin-coated vesicles from ISG would allow removal of excessive membrane and reduction in size (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arvan and Castle, 1998</a>). Hence, the size of MSGs is determined by the\u00a0coordinated action of fusion and budding events and is likely to\u00a0be\u00a0a cell-specific property."

                                "text": "The search for molecules\u00a0that\u00a0are involved in homotypic ISG fusion has led to the identification of NSF and \u03b1-SNAP (<a href=\"#bib66\">Urbe et al., 1998</a>), which promote membrane fusion by disassembling cis-SNAREs to form fusogenic trans-SNARE complexes between donor and target membranes. Later, the SNARE protein STX6, which localizes to ISGs but not MSGs, was found to be required for homotypic ISG fusion (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wendler et al., 2001</a>). SM proteins are essential partners for SNARE proteins in fusion \u2013 without one or the other, no fusion occurs physiologically (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</a>). The interaction between Munc18-1, a neuronal SM protein, and syntaxin 1 is critical for the docking and priming of synaptic vesicles, which also requires Munc13 proteins. Munc13s, and related neuronal proteins called CAPS (calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion), are essential players during priming, and contain a large module called the MUN domain. It has been proposed that the MUN domain dramatically accelerates the transition from the closed syntaxin 1\u2013Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex, probably by extracting the SNARE motif of syntaxin 1 from the closed conformation and providing a template for SNARE complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). Structural analyses have shown that the MUN domain has a similar architecture to domains found in vesicle tethering factors such as Sec6, Tip20, and Exo70 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). As such, Munc13s\u00a0and\u00a0CAPS belong to a family named CATHCR (complex associated with tethering containing helical rods) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rizo and Sudhof, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yu and Hughson, 2010</a>). CATCHR proteins\u00a0have general function(s) in vesicle fusion by providing a physical link between donor and target membranes (sometimes called docking and sometimes called tethering) (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yu and Hughson, 2010</a>). Moreover, as described above for Munc13-1 and for the HOPS complex, tethering factors bind to SNARE proteins and can accelerate SNARE complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ren et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wickner, 2010</a>). These \ufb01ndings suggest that the docking and assembly of the SNARE complex may be mediated by similar but not identical mechanisms in different systems. As HID-1 localizes to ISGs,\u00a0it will be intriguing to test whether HID-1 can serve as a tethering factor to bridge disparate ISG membrane or as a priming factor for SNARE complex assembly. The large volume SEM and in vitro fusion assays we developed here provide the first evidence of ISG homotypic fusion during the maturation of insulin granules."

It is not clear how homotypic fusion affects proinsulin processing. One possibility is that the processing enzymes, PC1/3 and PC2, are mis-sorted to lysosomes for degradation, as suggested for Rab-2 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Edwards et al., 2009</a>). However, PC1/3 and PC2 levels in the HID-1 KO \u03b2 cells were only slightly decreased (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and this small change is not sufficient to\u00a0explain the drastic blockade of proinsulin processing. Another possibility is that the endopeptidase activities of PCs are affected in the absence of HID-1. It has been demonstrated that acidification is one of the most important steps in proinsulin processing and granule maturation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Orci et al., 1986</a>). Specifically, PC1/3 and PC2, which process proinsulin, are strictly pH-dependent (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lamango et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Orci et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Seidah et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Smeekens et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Steiner, 1998</a>). Indeed, we have provided the first evidence that granule acidification is blocked in the absence of HID-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Hence, it is plausible that HID-1 KO inhibits ISG homotypic fusion and thereby blocks granule acidification, which impairs the pH-dependent activity of PCs and retards proinsulin processing."

In the current study, we have identified HID-1 as a novel player in homotypic ISG fusion, ablation of which impairs proinsulin processing. Apparently, many factors are required to orchestrate multiple steps of SG maturation from biogenesis at the TGN, through homotypic fusion and granule acidification, to cargo refinement. These players include, but are not limited to, Rab2, Rab2 effectors and SNARE accessory proteins. Rab2 localizes to the Golgi and is likely to be involved as a master regulator in multiple steps of vesicular trafficking, including budding from TGN, transportation, homotypic fusion, and sorting of cargoes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Edwards et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Stenmark, 2009</a>).

Data sets were collected from three different mice for both WT and KO mice. Periphery regions were selected randomly with a relative size of the golgi region in each cell. We use a semi-automatic procedure to calculate the diameter of SGs (membrane edge to membrane edge) and the grey level of dense cores as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib39\">Marsh et al., 2001</a>). We manually draw a single contour around individual SGs where the area was maximal among cross sections. The area within this contour was calculated, and used to determine the diameter of an equivalent circle. Granule selection and calculation were done by three different researchers using ImageJ open source software (National Institute of Health)."

First, we applied a grey morphological operation to estimate the local background level and noise level. Then we subtracted the local background from the denoised image, and used a smooth function to remove noise and small particles. When the background and noise were removed, we applied auto local-maxima detection to identify the center of the vesicle dense core, and normalized the threshold for vesicle core segmentation. Finally, after applying filters to reject falsely detected results, the identification and segmentation of the dense core were completed. The grey level was calculated as the average grey level of the dense core."

Briefly, 8\u201312 plates (10\u00a0cm) of cells were collected and homogenized. The post nuclear supernatant (PNS) was acquired and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation and then the ISG and MSG fractions were collected. For in vitro fusion assays, the ISGs from GFP-labeled cells were incubated with PNS from mOrange2-labeled cells in the presence of 11.25\u2009mM HEPES, 1.35\u2009mM Mg(Ac)<sub>2</sub>, 0.18\u2009mM DTT, 45\u2009mM KAc, 1.5 mg/ml WT or KO INS-1 cytosol, and an ATP-regenerating system containing 3.3\u2009mM ATP, 26.7\u2009mM creatine phosphate and 107\u2009U/ml creatine kinase or an ATP-depletion system containing 150\u2009U/ml hexokinase and 25\u2009mM glucose.

For each reaction, about 20 random fields were imaged and the acquired images were analyzed. A co-localized dot would be counted as a fusion event when the distance between the fluorescent centers of the two channels was less than 1 pixel and the difference between the fluorescent intensity of two channels was less than 3fold to eliminate potential crosstalk."

The authors and the Nonet lab have shown previously that HID-1 localizes to the intracellular membranes like Golgi apparatus and dense-core vesicles through myristoylation at its N-terminus (Mesa et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011). It was proposed that HID-1 is involved in some step of LDCV biogenesis, maturation or trafficking, however, which step is affected remained unclear. In this manuscript Du et al. generate a conditional knockout of HID-1 and show in a very elegant series of experiments that HID-1 is required for homotypic fusion of immature LDCV precursors. As a result, HID-1 KO mice show an increase in serum proinsulin levels and glucose intolerance."

For example, Further evidence for a role for STX6 in homotypic fusion of immature secretory vesicles would be interesting, and evidence that HID1 plays a role would be entirely novel. Similarly, the authors could strengthen their conjecture by demonstrating that an open form of STX6 bypasses a requirement for HID1, or that STX fails to be recruited to immature secretory vesicles in <i>hid1</i> mutants or some other functional interaction. Considering the time it will take to do these experiments, the reviewers recommend the authors save the STX6 data for the next paper and eliminate them from the current manuscript."

The specific emphasis on SNAREs in the current Introduction, without the discussion of accessory proteins, is unintentionally misleading. Clarity about HID-1 could be provided by briefly discussing its domain structure and what is known about its ability to associate with membranes. A brief discussion of the granule proteases, ISG acidification, and/or other maturation factors would also be more relevant to the authors findings. Furthermore, HID-1 was also identified in a screen mislocalizing RBF-1 rabphilin, a RAB-27 effector and both of these proteins have important roles in DCV maturation and exocytosis. I think this literature might serve as better introduction to HID-1, and other maturation factors, as opposed to its significance to high-temperature-induced dauer formation and the suppression of HID-1 by the daf-16 transcription factor."

A finer resolution of <i>hid1</i>'s effects on granule maturation, beyond homotypic fusion, seem beyond the scope of this paper. Additionally, while interesting, these experiments were not conducted as rigorously as other experiments in the paper and are difficult to interpret. For example, these experiments may have been more informative if the analysis was restricted to the perinuclear region (as it was in other experiments) and if they were not maximum projections. It might also be helpful to know more about the deconvolution and see some examples of the raw data to properly evaluate the colocalizaiton data."

However, the dogma is that homotypic fusion does not occur in endocrine cells, but rather only in neuroendocrine cells. On the other hand, the data against homotypic fusion in endocrine cells are not particularly strong, and that is in part why this manuscript is interesting. The potential conflict with the dogma should be mentioned in the Introduction and expanded upon in the Discussion. Evidence for homotypic fusion is observed in cells that form large dense-core granules such as neuroendocrine cells, including PC12 cells (1,2,3), mammotroph pituitary cells (4), mast cells (5), and in the formation of LDCVs in yeast (6). Evidence for an absence of homotypic fusion in endocrine cells rests on two observations: First, disrupting syntaxin-6 using a dominant negative construct did not exhibit a defect in insulin granule formation in INS-1 \u03b2-cells, but rather a delay in pro-insulin processing (7). Second, electron microscopy data in \u03b2 cells (8, 9) does not reveal an increase in diameter in mature secretory granules. The strengths and weaknesses of these previous data should be mentioned in the Discussion."

Furuta 1998 and Wijesekara 2010 both note that immature granules are lighter, but did not report diameters. Noske et al. suggest that old granules are smaller, not larger. In fact, Noske et al. were not studying immature granules, they report a size change in older cells. Orci 1986 also states that maturation involves condensation of the matrix, and reduction in granule diameter. The authors observed the opposite \u2013 they see larger mature vesicles suggesting homotypic fusion. The authors may be the first to study granule maturation in any comprehensive way; block in the prohormone convertase or the zinc transporter are unlikely to affect membrane trafficking events."

Second, proinsulin is still present in the granules. Third, the presence of immature granule membrane proteins reinforces this conclusion, in particular synaptotagmin 4. Thus, the synaptotagmin 4 data should be included. It is unfortunate that the authors did not include syntaxin 6 staining, to demonstrate that proteins required for homotypic fusion were both still on the pro-insulin granules, which would provide evidence that granule maturation is blocked at a step before homotypic fusion. But that is a quibble; the manuscript should be published. VAMP4 was not mislocalized in the <i>hid1</i> KO. This result does not challenge the author's conclusion about a role for HID1 in homotypic fusion. VAMP4 has not been shown to be required for fusion of immature secretory granules, whereas syntaxin-6 is required. The authors conclude that HID1 is required for VAMP4 inclusion in immature secretory granules. Alternatively, VAMP4 may be removed by an intact 'sorting-by-exit' mechanism in the <i>hid1</i> KO. These data are an interesting facet of the KO phenotype and should be included. The mature granule marker VAMP2 is not observed on immature granules in <i>hid1</i> KO cells. These data are consistent with their model that granules are not mature in <i>hid1</i> KO cells. However, the authors did not validate that the VAMP2 antibody was associated with mature insulin granules in the wild type. Thus the negative result is not clearly interpretable and these data unfortunately should not be included."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1A and C</a>, VAMP4 and synaptotagmin IV both localized to the peri-nuclear compartment, similar as the distribution of proinsulin in WT \u03b2 cells. VAMP4 and synaptotagmin IV partially co-localized with proinsulin puncta to a similar extent (similar Pearson coefficient). In HID-1 KO \u03b2 cells, proinsulin and synaptotagmin IV staining dispersed throughout the cytosol and co-localized to a similar extent as in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1A and C</a>, bottom, B and D). In contrast, the localization of VAMP4 was unchanged and remained in the peri-nuclear region. As a consequence, the co-localization of proinsulin and VAMP4 was significantly reduced in KO cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1A and B</a>). Thus, proinsulin-positive secretory granules in HID-1 KO cells seem to retain synaptotagmin IV but not VAMP4, suggesting VAMP4 recruitment or retaining to ISG depends on HID-1. Besides, previous study has shown that VAMP4 antibody did not inhibit homotypic fusion of PC12-derived ISGs, which indicates that VAMP4 is not an essential component for ISG-ISG fusion process (Wendler et al., 2001). As for MSG marker VAMP2, its dispersed localization was not altered by HID-1 KO and there was few co-localization between proinsulin and VAMP2 in WT and KO cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1E and F</a>), suggesting VAMP2 is not recruited to proinsulin granules in either WT or KO cells. We are not sure whether to include these data or not and would like to hear the advice from the reviewers."

The specific emphasis on SNAREs in the current Introduction, without the discussion of accessory proteins, is unintentionally misleading. Clarity about HID-1 could be provided by briefly discussing its domain structure and what is known about its ability to associate with membranes. A brief discussion of the granule proteases, ISG acidification, and/or other maturation factors would also be more relevant to the authors findings. Furthermore, HID-1 was also identified in a screen mislocalizing RBF-1 rabphilin, a RAB-27 effector and both of these proteins have important roles in DCV maturation and exocytosis. I think this literature might serve as better introduction to HID-1, and other maturation factors, as opposed to its significance to high-temperature-induced dauer formation and the suppression of HID-1 by the daf-16 transcription factor.</i> "

However, the dogma is that homotypic fusion does not occur in endocrine cells, but rather only in neuroendocrine cells. On the other hand, the data against homotypic fusion in endocrine cells are not particularly strong, and that is in part why this manuscript is interesting. The potential conflict with the dogma should be mentioned in the Introduction and expanded upon in the Discussion. Evidence for homotypic fusion is observed in cells that form large dense-core granules such as neuroendocrine cells, including PC12 cells (1,2,3), mammotroph pituitary cells (4), mast cells (5), and in the formation of LDCVs in yeast (6). Evidence for an absence of homotypic fusion in endocrine cells rests on two observations: First, disrupting syntaxin-6 using a dominant negative construct did not exhibit a defect in insulin granule formation in INS-1 \u03b2-cells, but rather a delay in pro-insulin processing (7). Second, electron microscopy data in \u03b2 cells (8, 9) does not reveal an increase in diameter in mature secretory granules. The strengths and weaknesses of these previous data should be mentioned in the Discussion.</i> "

Thus, the synaptotagmin 4 data should be included. It is unfortunate that the authors did not include syntaxin 6 staining, to demonstrate that proteins required for homotypic fusion were both still on the pro-insulin granules, which would provide evidence that granule maturation is blocked at a step before homotypic fusion. But that is a quibble; the manuscript should be published. VAMP4 was not mislocalized in the hid1 KO. This result does not challenge the author's conclusion about a role for HID1 in homotypic fusion. VAMP4 has not been shown to be required for fusion of immature secretory granules, whereas syntaxin-6 is required. The authors conclude that HID1 is required for VAMP4 inclusion in immature secretory granules. Alternatively, VAMP4 may be removed by an intact 'sorting-by-exit' mechanism in the hid1 KO. These data are an interesting facet of the KO phenotype and should be included. The mature granule marker VAMP2 is not observed on immature granules in hid1 KO cells. These data are consistent with their model that granules are not mature in hid1 KO cells. However, the authors did not validate that the VAMP2 antibody was associated with mature insulin granules in the wild type.
