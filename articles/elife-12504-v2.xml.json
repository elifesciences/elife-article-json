                    "text": "Mitotic spindle orientation is used to generate cell fate diversity and drive proper tissue morphogenesis. A complex of NuMA and dynein/dynactin is required for robust spindle orientation in a number of cell types. Previous research proposed that cortical dynein/dynactin was sufficient to generate forces on astral microtubules (MTs) to orient the spindle, with NuMA acting as a passive tether. In this study, we demonstrate that dynein/dynactin is insufficient for spindle orientation establishment in keratinocytes and that NuMA\u2019s MT-binding domain, which targets MT tips, is also required. Loss of NuMA-MT interactions in skin caused defects in spindle orientation and epidermal differentiation, leading to neonatal lethality. In addition, we show that NuMA-MT interactions are also required in adult mice for hair follicle morphogenesis and spindle orientation within the transit-amplifying cells of the matrix. Loss of spindle orientation in matrix cells results in defective differentiation of matrix-derived lineages. Our results reveal an additional and direct function of NuMA during mitotic spindle positioning, as well as a reiterative use of spindle orientation in the skin to build diverse structures."

                    "text": "Mitotic spindle orientation is used to generate cell fate diversity and drive proper tissue morphogenesis. A complex of NuMA and dynein/dynactin is required for robust spindle orientation in a number of cell types. Previous research proposed that cortical dynein/dynactin was sufficient to generate forces on astral microtubules (MTs) to orient the spindle, with NuMA acting as a passive tether. In this study, we demonstrate that dynein/dynactin is insufficient for spindle orientation establishment in keratinocytes and that NuMA\u2019s MT-binding domain, which targets MT tips, is also required. Loss of NuMA-MT interactions in skin caused defects in spindle orientation and epidermal differentiation, leading to neonatal lethality. In addition, we show that NuMA-MT interactions are also required in adult mice for hair follicle morphogenesis and spindle orientation within the transit-amplifying cells of the matrix. Loss of spindle orientation in matrix cells results in defective differentiation of matrix-derived lineages. Our results reveal an additional and direct function of NuMA during mitotic spindle positioning, as well as a reiterative use of spindle orientation in the skin to build diverse structures."

A structure called the mitotic spindle helps to ensure each new cell gets the correct amount of DNA. Cells often precisely position their mitotic spindle during division, and this spindle orientation is important for generating different types of cells and for establishing the three-dimensional structure of tissues. How cells rotate their spindles into the correct position is not well understood, but a protein called NuMA is important for this process."

This revealed that the correct placement of the mitotic spindle is important for the development of the skin of mouse embryos and the formation of the hair of adult mice. Seldin et al. also found that the NuMA protein binds to the tips of the microtubules that make up the mitotic spindle. This binding activity is important for NuMA to be able to position the mitotic spindle correctly in the cell. The findings suggest similarities between how cells orient mitotic spindles and how they segregate DNA during cell division."

ACDs are driven by robust positioning of the mitotic spindle, a tightly regulated process that is orchestrated by several conserved proteins. However, our incomplete understanding of the mechanism underlying spindle orientation, as well as the lack of genetic tools to specifically perturb this process in adult mammalian tissues have prevented us from appreciating its function in various organ systems."

Loss-of-function studies on these proteins have revealed their essential roles in spindle orientation and force generation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bowman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Izumi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Siller et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Skop and White, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Williams et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, targeting dynein/dynactin to the cell cortex was sufficient to induce spindle movements, consistent with it playing a direct role in force generation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kotak et al., 2012</a>). These data have led to the proposition that LGN and NuMA form a passive tether, which provides a high level of regulatory control over dynein accumulation at the cell cortex, and that dynein-dependent forces position the spindle (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kotak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kotak and Gonczy, 2013</a>)."

For example, local taxol treatment at the posterior end of the <i>C. elegans</i> zygote prevented spindle movement toward that pole (<a href=\"#bib19\">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, in contrast to the current model in metazoans, the spindle orientation process in yeast requires not only dynein-dependent pulling forces, but also MT depolymerization at the cell cortex (<a href=\"#bib29\">ten Hoopen et al., 2012</a>). Present models include a kinetochore-like mechanism of capturing the energy from MT depolymerization to power spindle movement. Therefore, there is precedence for MT dynamics playing an important role during spindle orientation."

This MT-binding domain (MTBD) is conserved among flies, worms, and mammals and has been characterized to stabilize and bundle MTs.

The tissue architecture allows for robust and reproducible determination of spindle angles while genetic and cell culture systems have allowed further exploration of the mechanisms. In embryonic development, spindle orientation is required for proper stratification and differentiation of the epidermis. The role of spindle orientation in epidermal appendages like hair follicles, which are highly organized structures, has not yet been reported. That said, stereotypical spindle orientations have been reported at several stages of hair follicle morphogenesis, suggesting that they may play important roles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Niessen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Rompolas et al., 2012</a>).

When expressed in cultured mouse keratinocytes, however, we observed only weak co-localization between GFP-MTBD and MTs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This was true at both high and low levels of expression, and including or excluding the adjacent LGN-binding domain of NuMA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, when constructs that encoded additional amino-terminal regions were transfected, we noted robust association with the MT lattice in cells that expressed high levels of the fusion proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This was true in constructs containing the linker region between the 4.1 and LGN binding domains of NuMA, but not those that lacked this region. When highly overexpressed, the fusion proteins appeared to stabilize and bundle MTs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At lower levels of expression, however, we observed punctate MT localization of the fusion proteins that contained the linker region, LGN binding domain and the MTBD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Zoomed-in views of these images show that these puncta localize along MTs and often accumulate at MT tips (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2019,C\u2019</a>). The MT density is very high in many keratinocytes, which makes it challenging to see a precise co-localization. We therefore examined the localization of these fusion proteins in regions of the cell periphery where MTs were sparse. Co-staining with \u03b1-tubulin revealed discrete localization to MT plus tips near the cell periphery (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013G\u2019\u2019</a>). Thus, a region of NuMA spanning the linker domain (which follows the 4.1-binding domain) to the MTBD localizes to MT tips. We refer to this entire region as 'NuMA-TIP' (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Many +TIP tracking proteins bind exclusively to growing MT ends and are displaced under depolymerization conditions, which can be triggered using nocodazole treatment. In stark contrast, NuMA-TIP localized specifically to both MT plus and minus ends following treatment with nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,K\u2019,K\u2019\u2019</a>). This was in contrast to Eb1, which was displaced from the tip and labeled the MT lattice upon nocodazole addition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K\u2019\u2019</a>). Since nocodazole significantly decreased the density of MTs and helped resolve MT ends, this treatment revealed that NuMA-TIP clearly favors binding to MT ends over MT sides. This same localization pattern was also observed in transfected HeLa cells, demonstrating that this MT tip-binding behavior of NuMA is not unique to keratinocytes (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

NuMA-TIP localization to nocodazole-treated MT ends suggested that it might preferentially bind to depolymerizing MTs and/or to those exhibiting protofilament curling. To determine whether NuMA-TIP localization correlates with the status of MT tips, we treated cells with either low doses of vinblastine, which promotes protofilament curling, or taxol, which straightens MT ends (<a href=\"#bib6\">Elie-Caille et al., 2007</a>). Under the vinblastine conditions used, this drug did not significantly alter MT density or organization. We found that a higher percentage of vinblastine-treated cells showed MT tip localization of NuMA-TIP when compared with DMSO-treated cells, while taxol treatment resulted in a significant loss of MT tip localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). This suggests that NuMA preferentially recognizes flayed MT ends over straight ends and is consistent with a report that NuMA interacts preferentially with vinblastine-induced curled MTs over taxol-stabilized MTs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Volkov et al., 2015</a>). Nevertheless, while NuMA-TIP co-localized well with MT tips in the presence of low-dose vinblastine,\u00a0we did not observe association with the tubulin aggregates formed in cells treated with higher doses of vinblastine (data not shown)."

We therefore examined which regions of NuMA were necessary for MT tip localization. Analysis of full-length NuMA localization requires the examination of mitotic cells, since NuMA is sequestered in the nucleus in interphase. To circumvent this issue, we examined the localization of NuMA fusion constructs lacking the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) alone, or in combination with the loss of the MTBD or the entire NuMA-TIP domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We observed association of GFP-NuMA\u0394NLS with MT tips when the fusion protein was expressed at low levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Conversely, cells expressing a NuMA construct that lacked both the NLS and TIP region did not exhibit any MT tip localization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This region is therefore both necessary and sufficient for NuMA\u2019s MT tip interactions. Importantly, deletion of the MTBD domain alone (which keeps the LGN-binding domain intact) compromises tip-localization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The LGN-binding domain is required for cortical targeting of NuMA, which is necessary for its role in spindle orientation. Therefore, a NuMA mutant harboring a MTBD domain deletion allows us to test the role of MT tip-binding activity during spindle orientation without disrupting other critical domains of NuMA that are known to be required for its cortical localization."

To address this, we performed time-lapse analysis of GFP-NuMA-TIP dynamics in cultured keratinocytes either alone or in combination with ensconsin\u2019s MT-binding domain (EMTB) fused to tdTomato to label MTs. Live-imaging of cells expressing low levels of the construct revealed puncta that corresponded to MT tips. Many of the brighter puncta were stationary, consistent with NuMA-TIP\u2019s role in stabilizing MTs. In addition, we observed motile GFP puncta tracking toward the cell periphery along MT plus tips (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, these puncta remained localized to the ends of depolymerizing MTs. This behavior was also evident at the centrosome (which displayed NuMA-TIP localization as well) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data demonstrate that NuMA can remain attached to both growing and shrinking MT ends and suggests that this may be functionally important for facilitating the interactions of astral MT tips with the cell cortex during spindle orientation."

We used NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (which harbor a floxed allele of Numa1 Exon 22) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Silk et al., 2009</a>) to generate NuMA\u0394MTBD keratinocytes. Cre-induced recombination in these cells results in the in-frame deletion of NuMA\u2019s MTBD (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>).

To generate these cells, we treated primary keratinocytes isolated from NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with either adeno-GFP (control) or adeno-Cre virus (mutant), picked clones, and validated recombination by PCR (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

To determine whether NuMA-MT interactions were critical for spindle orientation in vivo, we crossed the NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse line described above with Keratin 14-Cre mice (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vasioukhin et al., 1999</a>), generating an in-frame deletion of the MTBD in epidermal progenitors. Due to the small change in protein size, we validated recombination by PCR analysis of isolated epidermis (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We analyzed NuMA localization in embryonic tissue sections and confirmed that the mutant form localized normally to spindle poles and the cortex of mitotic cells, consistent with our findings in cultured cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). We then scored spindle orientation using cryosections from e17.5 backskin by measuring the angle between the anaphase spindle and the basement membrane. In agreement with previous studies, controls showed a bimodal distribution of orientations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). Quantitation of spindle angles in mutant epidermis showed a dramatic decrease in perpendicular spindles coupled with an increase in oblique and parallel spindles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). This defect was not an indirect effect of loss of polarity or cell death, as both the Golgi and centrosomes showed proper polarization and cleaved caspase 3-positive cells did not significantly increase in number (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). While previous work on spindle orientation in NuMA knockdown mice revealed a dramatic shift toward parallel spindles (<a href=\"#bib35\">Williams et al., 2011</a>), it is important to note that the basal cells of those mice were largely devoid of NuMA, thus preventing cortical dynein recruitment. The randomized spindle angles observed in NuMA\u0394MTBD mice are likely due to the maintenance of cortical dynein, which cannot efficiently orient the spindle in the absence of NuMA-MT interactions."

However, previous analysis of NuMA\u0394MTBD mice harboring a full body deletion suggested that this region was essential for development and that cultured mutant fibroblasts had mitotic spindle defects (<a href=\"#bib25\">Silk et al., 2009</a>). To reconcile these findings, we analyzed mitotic spindles in both NuMA\u0394MTBD cultured keratinocytes and mouse epidermis. We did not detect any defects in mitotic morphology, stage, or number in mutant keratinocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013G</a>). Metaphase and anaphase spindles exhibited normal morphology (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). The localization of NuMA to the cell cortex, the incidence of abnormal spindles and the extent of mis-aligned DNA were all similar between control and NuMA\u0394MTBD cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013F</a>). This was true both in primary keratinocytes directly isolated from newborn backskin as well as the clonal lines described above. There were also no significant differences in the percentage of cells in different mitotic stages or their spindle lengths (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis of mutant epidermal cells revealed no evidence of aneuploidy or polyploidy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J</a>). Finally, the phenotype that we observed is distinct from those caused by mutations in mitotic regulators, arguing against an underlying mitotic defect (<a href=\"#bib8\">Foijer et al., 2013</a>). This stands in stark contrast to past findings in cultured fibroblasts and thus suggests the possibility of cell-type specific roles for NuMA.

Mice with epidermal loss of NuMA\u2019s MTBD were neonatal lethal (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This lethality was associated with a mild barrier defect, as observed by an X-gal penetration assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These observations led us to investigate whether underlying differentiation defects contributed to lethality. In control mice, keratin 5/14 marked a monolayer of proliferative basal cells, while keratin 10 was present in their differentiated progeny (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In mutant mice, we observed an expansion of K5/14- positive cells into suprabasal layers and their mixing with K10-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These defects were noticed as early as e16.5, before epidermal barrier activity is fully established (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Later differentiation markers, such as loricrin and filaggrin, were present at much lower levels in mutant skin, explaining in part the compromised barrier and neonatal lethality (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>). There was also a dramatic upregulation of the stress marker keratin 6 in mutant skin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013I</a>). Consistent with a differentiation defect, we observed increased numbers of cycling cells in the mutant suprabasal epidermis by both BrdU and phospho-histone H3 staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J\u2013P</a>). In addition, we noted an increase in basal cell proliferation, which is likely a consequence of barrier dysfunction. In support of this, analysis of e16.5 epidermis (a stage at which the barrier is just beginning to form) revealed an increase in suprabasal cell divisions, but not in basal divisions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5N</a>). These studies demonstrate that high levels of spindle misorientation are not tolerated and that the oblique divisions observed cannot promote proper differentiation of the epidermis. Previous data suggested that low levels of spindle misorientation were not detrimental to epidermal development (<a href=\"#bib36\">Williams et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, there appears to be a critical threshold at which a decrease in functionally asymmetric divisions impairs development."

The NuMA\u0394MTBD mouse line therefore serves as an invaluable tool that allows us to specifically address the role of spindle orientation in a tissue context. Previously, it has not been possible to specifically perturb spindle orientation during postnatal hair morphogenesis. The hair follicle is a highly organized epidermal appendage that undergoes cycles of growth, regression and rest throughout an animal\u2019s lifetime. The growth phase, called anagen, is responsible for producing the fully differentiated hair shaft. Three proliferative compartments of the hair follicle, the bulge stem cells, the outer root sheath (ORS) and the transit-amplifying matrix cells, are responsible for generating the cell types that make up the mature hair follicle."

Using previously generated mice in which NuMA-GFP is expressed under the control of the keratin 14 promoter (<a href=\"#bib21\">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</a>), we could rescue NuMA expression in the bulge and ORS (in Krt14-Cre;NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice), resulting in mice with a matrix-specific MTBD deletion that we will refer to as 'matrix\u0394MTBD' (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Krt14-NuMA-GFP expression was sufficient to fully rescue the neonatal lethality caused by embryonic loss of NuMA\u2019s MTBD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

In fact, BMP signaling is one of the earliest detectable steps in the differentiation of these lineages. We therefore analyzed BMP activation status to determine whether spindle orientation was required for BMP activity. Analysis of BMP activity using anti-pSMAD1/5 antibodies revealed a loss of signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6S,T</a>). These data are consistent with BMP signaling acting downstream of these asymmetric divisions. Examination of older mice revealed additional phenotypic similarities with mice in which BMP signaling was blocked, including cyst formation and aberrant spatial localization of follicular proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Although matrix-derived cells in the mutant mice lacked markers for IRS and hair shaft, they appeared to be non-proliferative, as judged by lack of BrdU incorporation (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). One of the simplest models suggests that BMP inhibitors in the dermal papilla locally impede BMP signaling in matrix cells, while more distant cells undergo active signaling. Our data demonstrate that a spindle orientation-dependent event is also required to activate BMP signaling, which is therefore not simply driven by compartmentalization."

While it is likely that the direct interactions provided by the NuMA-TIP region contribute to the specific binding of NuMA to MT tips, we cannot rule out that additional proteins are required to increase NuMA\u2019s MT tip-binding affinity. The properties of NuMA-TIP are distinct from many tip-binding proteins. Most notably, NuMA-TIP remains associated with stalled and or depolymerizing MTs. To date, there are very few proteins known to exhibit MT depolymerization-tracking behavior (either directly or indirectly). The few known examples are kinetochore proteins of different species, including the Dam1 complex, CENP-E, CENP-F, and the Ndc-80 complex. Of these, only Dam1 has been shown to follow depolymerizing MTs in vivo, while the others can do this in vitro, yet remain at the kinetochore-MT interface in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Westermann et al., 2006</a>). Depolymerizing kinesins have also been observed to localize to both plus and minus ends of MTs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Desai et al., 1999</a>)."

A simple model in which all forces during spindle orientation are generated by dynein-dependent pulling on astral MTs is still formally possible, with NuMA acting simply to provide MT stabilization, thus making astral MTs better substrates for dynein-directed forces. While a viable possibility, this is not consistent with local stabilization of MTs inhibiting spindle movements (<a href=\"#bib19\">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, NuMA\u2019s unique MT-binding qualities revealed in this study could allow it to interact with depolymerizing MTs and harness their energy to promote spindle rotation, thus collaborating with dynein pulling forces to robustly orient the spindle. This latter idea is similar to kinetochores harnessing MT depolymerization for chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib18\">McIntosh et al., 2010</a>). Both the association of MT dynamics with force generation observed during spindle positioning (<a href=\"#bib16\">Labbe et al., 2003</a>), as well as work showing the ability of depolymerizing MTs to generate force (<a href=\"#bib18\">McIntosh et al., 2010</a>) are consistent with this second possibility. This is not without precedent, as positioning of the budding yeast spindle relies on regulated depolymerization at the cell cortex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gupta et al., 2006</a>). If and how depolymerization activity is coordinated with dynein/dynactin will require further investigation. It is also possible that both stabilization and tracking depolymerizing MTs are important activities of NuMA that are used at distinct sites/times. For example, NuMA has been shown to collect at the minus ends of severed MTs in the mitotic spindle where it may act to stabilize the free ends (<a href=\"#bib7\">Elting et al., 2014</a>)."

Consistent with previous studies, loss of spindle orientation in the developing epidermis resulted in embryonic lethality that is likely due to epidermal differentiation defects. These data raise the question of whether the early embryonic lethality observed in the full mouse NuMA MTBD knockout was due to mitotic defects, defects in spindle positioning or a combination of these effects (<a href=\"#bib25\">Silk et al. 2009</a>). While the phenotype that resulted from the epidermal-specific loss of NuMA\u2019s MTBD in this study was less severe than that seen upon shRNA depletion of either LGN or NuMA, there are two plausible explanations to reconcile this discrepancy. First, the gene ablations in the previous study were initiated prior to epidermal stratification, whereas our knockout occured during the process of stratification. Second, loss of full-length NuMA or LGN resulted in a drastic conversion of ACDs (perpendicular spindles) to SCDs (parallel), while loss of NuMA\u2019s MTBD resulted in a conversion of ACDs to randomized division orientations."

We have taken advantage of this by being the first to demonstrate an essential requirement for spindle orientation in hair follicle morphogenesis. While prior reports have presented correlative data to suggest that spindle orientation contributes to hair follicle morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Niessen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Rompolas et al., 2012</a>), we have quantitated division orientations within the rapidly proliferating matrix compartment and demonstrated the importance of spindle orientation in these cells. Similar to the interfollicular epidermis in the embryo, divisions can be either parallel or perpendicular to the underlying basement membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The percentage of matrix cell perpendicular divisions decreased in the mutant and resulted in differentiation defects in matrix-derived lineages. One of the earliest known steps of differentiation along these pathways is BMP activation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andl et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Kobielak et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kulessa et al., 2000</a>), and loss of BMP signaling resulted in phenotypes similar to loss of spindle orientation. In both cases, IRS and hair shaft markers are decreased or absent. The matrix-derived cells in the mutant mice described here as well as the BMPRIA mutant are non-proliferative, suggesting that they may be segregated from pro-proliferative signals from the basement membrane and/or dermal papilla. Surprisingly, in the absence of proper spindle orientation, the activation of BMP signaling does not occur. While the compartmentalized activation of BMP could have been due solely to the presence of BMP inhibitors in the DP preventing signaling in adjacent matrix cells, our data demonstrate that a spindle orientation-dependent step is required for cells to become responsive to BMP signaling. Whether this acts directly on the BMP signaling pathway or lies upstream of it is not currently known. Understanding the molecular basis of this requirement is a clear future goal to understand how differentiation and morphogenesis are controlled. In summary, we reveal that a reiterative use of spindle orientation machinery generates very distinct structures (stratified interfollicular epithelium versus hair follicles) within the same tissue."

The protein was expressed in bacteria and purified over Nickel-agarose (Qiagen). Tubulin (Cytoskeleton) was pre-cleared by centrifugation at 90000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0<i>g</i> for 10 min and then induced to polymerize by addition of 5% glycerol and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1\u2009hr. Assembled MTs were diluted to 1 mg/ml tubulin, and then added to purified 6XHis-GFP-NuMA-TIP. The 6XHis-GFP-NuMA-TIP was also precleared, but aggregates still precipitated out in the buffer conditions used. We used concentrations of GFP-NuMA-TIP ranging from 300 nM down to 30 nM, but the actual concentrations in solution might be lower due to the aggregation of some of the protein. After 2 min, 1 \u03bcM nocodazole was added to promote MT depolymerization. After 1 min, reactions were fixed with 10 volumes of 1% glutaraldehyde in BRB80 for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, and then further diluted with PBS. Fixed mixtures were spun onto poly-L-lysine coated coverslips at 25,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0<i>g</i> for 30 min in a swinging bucket rotor. Coverslips were then fixed and stained for \u03b2-tubulin (Sigma)."

The authors shows the requirement of MT binding by NuMA in spindle orientation: NuMA's MT binding domain (NuMA-TIP) binds to \"curled MT end\" (characteristic to depolymerizing phase) as opposed to growing MT end. The authors convincingly show that recruitment of dynein to the cortex by NuMA is not sufficient for spindle orientation, and instead the correct spindle orientation requires NuMA's MT binding. NuMA mutant that specifically lacks MT binding domain results in spindle orientation defect without compromising any other aspects of spindle (morphology or assembly), providing a unique opportunity to study the role of spindle orientation during development. The authors examined the phenotype of such mutants in the context of epidermis and hair follicle development. Their results clearly demonstrate the critical importance of spindle orientation during development."

Thus, the new contributions are a more detailed characterization of NuMA's MT binding activity, the demonstration that this activity is not required for localization of NuMA or Dynein, and the demonstration that this activity is required for spindle orientation, both in vitro and in vivo. On the one hand, it could be argued that the lack of significant mechanistic insight reduces the appeal of the work to non-specialists, however it is also true that our understanding of NuMA's role in spindle orientation has been slow in coming.

Their data, therefore, demonstrate that cortical dynein can induce forces on spindles, however, they do not show that this is sufficient for robust orientation of the mitotic spindle.

In addition, the phenotypes seen are unlikely to be secondary to inflammatory effects as these do not occur embryonically.

This is in contrast to suprabasal proliferation (another sign of defective differentiation), which was present at both e16.5 and e18.5."

This is likely due to either basement membrane attachment or pro-proliferative cues in the local environment.

If cells in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicle matrix are skewed toward parallel and oblique divisions from the basement membrane, shouldn't the authors see an accumulation of cells in these basal compartments? This is not apparent in any of the data presented. Furthermore, if there is not an increase in basal cell density in these compartments then how do these cells become suprabasal? Additionally, if excess basal cells are able to become suprabasal, then how do they achieve this? Is this a cell autonomous process?</i>"

We found that there was a 6% increase in density (102+/-2 cells/mm in the control and 108+/-3 cells/mm in the mutant). This result did not reach statistical significance and we have therefore not included it in the text. We should note that knockdown of LGN in vivo caused almost all spindles to be oriented parallel to the basement membrane resulting in symmetric divisions (Williams et al., Nature 2011) and this resulted in only a 17% increase in basal cell density. As that mutation was both more severe and was induced earlier than ours, it is not surprising that a more dramatic effect was not seen. While we do not have data to directly address this, we feel it is likely that cells are lost from the basal layer either through an active delamination or through extrusion. However, this appears insufficient for proper differentiation."
