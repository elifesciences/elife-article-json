The nature of the RNAs that trigger MDA5 activation in infected cells remains unclear. Here, we purify and characterise LGP2/RNA complexes from cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus detected by MDA5 and LGP2 but not RIG-I. We show that those complexes contain RNA that is highly enriched for MDA5-stimulatory activity and for a specific sequence corresponding to the L region of the EMCV antisense RNA. Synthesis of this sequence by in vitro transcription is sufficient to generate an MDA5 stimulatory RNA. Conversely, genomic deletion of the L region in EMCV generates viruses that are less potent at stimulating MDA5-dependent IFN production. Thus, the L region antisense RNA of EMCV is a key determinant of innate immunity to the virus and represents an RNA that activates MDA5 in virally-infected cells."

The nature of the RNAs that trigger MDA5 activation in infected cells remains unclear. Here, we purify and characterise LGP2/RNA complexes from cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus detected by MDA5 and LGP2 but not RIG-I. We show that those complexes contain RNA that is highly enriched for MDA5-stimulatory activity and for a specific sequence corresponding to the L region of the EMCV antisense RNA. Synthesis of this sequence by in vitro transcription is sufficient to generate an MDA5 stimulatory RNA. Conversely, genomic deletion of the L region in EMCV generates viruses that are less potent at stimulating MDA5-dependent IFN production. Thus, the L region antisense RNA of EMCV is a key determinant of innate immunity to the virus and represents an RNA that activates MDA5 in virally-infected cells."

                        "text": "Viral infection in mammals triggers a rapid innate immune response involving the production of antiviral proteins and proinflammatory mediators, prominent among which are the type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2; hereafter, IFN) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Takaoka and Yanai, 2006</a>). IFNs are secreted cytokines that act on all nucleated cells to induce the transcription of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes, whose products collectively limit virus replication and spread (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haller et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schoggins and Rice, 2011</a>). IFN gene transcription is triggered by the activation of pattern recognition receptors that detect viral invasion. These receptors include members of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family (<a href=\"#bib12\">Goubau et al., 2013</a>), a sub-group of DExD/H-box helicases that surveys the cytosol for the presence of atypical RNAs associated with viral infection. The RLR family comprises three members: RIG-I (retinoic acid-induced gene I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), and LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2). Binding of agonistic RNA by RIG-I or MDA5 triggers a signalling cascade that leads to the activation of transcription factors, including several of the IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), which translocate into the nucleus to induce expression of IFN and other genes. LGP2 lacks a signalling domain and cannot act in the same manner. Rather, LGP2 is thought to potentiate MDA5-dependent IFN induction although the exact mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib32\">Satoh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bruns et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Childs et al., 2013</a>)."

RIG-I is non-redundant for detection of influenza or Sendai virus but dispensable for responses to picornaviruses whereas the opposite is the case for MDA5 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kato et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>). The basis for these differences stems from the ability of RIG-I and MDA5 to recognize different RNA patterns. RIG-I binds to and is activated by base-paired RNA containing a 5\u2032 triphosphate extremity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hornung et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pichlmair et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Schlee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schmidt et al., 2009</a>) as found in influenza and Sendai virus genomes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baum et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Weber et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, MDA5 recognizes RNA independently of 5\u2032 phosphates and can be activated in cells by transfection of synthetic poly I:C or the double-stranded (ds) RNA genome segments of reovirus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kato et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>). Based on such observations, it has been concluded that MDA5 detects long dsRNA generated during virus infection. However, natural MDA5 agonists derived from infected cells remain poorly characterised. Some studies have suggested that they might correspond to high molecular weight RNA complexes containing double and single-stranded (ss) regions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pichlmair et al., 2009</a>). Other reports have proposed that relevant MDA5 agonists are specific viral replication intermediates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Triantafilou et al., 2012</a>). Finally, it has been suggested that MDA5 might also be activated by RNA products of RNAseL cleavage (<a href=\"#bib24\">Malathi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Luthra et al., 2011</a>) or by mRNA bearing unmethylated cap structures (<a href=\"#bib43\">Z\u00fcst et al., 2011</a>). Altogether, these studies provide a glimpse into the possible nature of MDA5 agonists in virally-infected cells but fall short of identifying them with precision."

In this study, we use an analogous approach to investigate the nature of MDA5 agonists in cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of the <i>Cardiovirus</i> genus of picornaviruses. Picornaviruses are single-stranded positive-strand (sense) RNA viruses that replicate in infected cells via a negative-strand (antisense) intermediate. We purify RNA directly from complexes obtained by immunoprecipitation of LGP2 and show that this method enriches for MDA5 stimulatory RNA corresponding to a portion of the EMCV antisense RNA. Deletion of the region encoding this antisense RNA generates viruses that produce less stimulatory RNA and are less potent at inducing IFN in infected cells or mice. Conversely, in vitro synthesis of the same sequence generates an MDA5 agonistic RNA. Thus, a discrete region of the EMCV negative-strand RNA acts as a physiologically-relevant MDA5 agonist in infected cells."

We infected <i>Ifih1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> (MDA5-deficient), <i>Ifih1</i><sup><i>\u2212/+</i></sup> (MDA5-sufficient), <i>Dhx58</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> (LGP2-deficient) or <i>Dhx58</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> (LGP2-sufficient) MEFs and assessed the induction of IFN-\u03b2 and the interferon-stimulated protein IFIT-1. The upregulation of <i>Ifit1</i> or <i>Ifnb1</i> mRNA was greatly impaired in MDA5- or LGP2-deficient MEFs infected with EMCV (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The same cells responded normally to RIG-I-dependent viruses such as IAV and to known RIG-I agonists such as in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). To begin to define the MDA5/LGP2 agonist, we isolated the EMCV genome from purified EMCV particles and transfected it into reporter cells together with a plasmid encoding a luciferase gene under the control of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. As reporter cells, we used an easily transfectable subclone of HEK293 cells that expresses all RLRs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and can respond, albeit weakly, to MDA5 agonists (data not shown; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Because transfection of positive-stranded viral RNA can lead to viral replication (even though EMCV replicates in HEK293 cells only poorly), we performed the IFN reporter assay in the presence of ribavirin, an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis. As seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, EMCV genomes did not stimulate the IFN-\u03b2 reporter, in contrast to the genomes of IAV, which directly activate RIG-I (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baum et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Weber et al., 2013</a>). To determine whether viral replication generates stimulatory RNA, we extracted total RNA from HeLa cells that had been infected with EMCV in the presence or absence of ribavirin. RNA isolated from cells in which EMCV viral replication had been permitted to take its course (DMSO control) potently induced the IFN-\u03b2 reporter upon transfection into HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast, RNA extracted from HeLa cells treated with ribavirin was non-stimulatory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Treatment of the reporter HEK293 cells themselves with ribavirin did not affect the response (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>), which indicates that the stimulatory RNA is preformed in EMCV-infected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the response in the HEK293 reporter cells was dependent on MDA5 as demonstrated using RNA interference-mediated MDA5 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Altogether these data indicate that MDA5 and LGP2 activation results exclusively from RNA generated during active EMCV replication, as recently suggested (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Triantafilou et al., 2012</a>)."

To characterise the \u2018strandedness\u2019 of the IFN stimulatory RNA generated upon EMCV replication, we extracted total RNA from non-infected or either IAV or EMCV-infected HeLa cells and separated it into ds and ssRNA fractions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2012</a>). As expected (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pichlmair et al., 2006</a>), the ssRNA but not the long dsRNA fraction extracted from cells infected with IAV, stimulated the IFN reporter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). In contrast, both ds and ssRNA fractions from cells infected with EMCV triggered the IFN-\u03b2 reporter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Similarly, treatment of total RNA from EMCV-infected cells with RNase A or RNase III, which digest unpaired or base-paired RNA, respectively, strongly reduced stimulatory activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In contrast, removal of 5\u2032 phosphates by digestion with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) or 5\u2032 polyphophatase (PP) did not impact stimulatory activity although it abrogated that of IVT control RNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Altogether these data indicate that MDA5/LGP2 stimulatory RNA accumulates in EMCV-infected cells during virus replication and contains both ssRNA and dsRNA features, as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pichlmair et al., 2009</a>)."

We immunoprecipitated (IP) LGP2 from EMCV-infected HeLa cells transiently expressing a FLAG-tagged LGP2 protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), extracted RNA from the precipitates and analysed its stimulatory activity in reporter cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Notably, RNA associated with the LGP2 precipitates, but not with control (ctrl) precipitates, stimulated the IFN-\u03b2 luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells and induced expression of the IFNB1 gene in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Moreover, when compared to input material, stimulatory activity was significantly enriched in the LGP2-immunoprecipitate and was selectively depleted from the unbound fraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). We additionally transfected the LGP2-associated RNA into MEFs and confirmed its ability to stimulate IFN production by ELISA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Importantly, activity was lost in LGP2- or MDA5-deficient MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating that the LGP2-associated RNA isolated from immunoprecipitates is a pure MDA5/LGP2 agonist. Consistent with this notion, its IFN stimulatory capacity was unaffected by treatment with CIP, which inactivates most RIG-I agonists, or Terminator (Term), which digests RNA with 5\u2032 monophosphates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Furthermore, digestion with RNaseT1 and RNaseIII completely abolished stimulatory potential (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), again suggesting the presence of unpaired and base-paired RNA regions as previously observed with total RNA from EMCV-infected cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Finally, we incubated purified RNA from EMCV-infected HeLa cells together with recombinant FLAG-tagged LGP2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). FLAG immunoprecipitation allowed enrichment for stimulatory activity when compared to a control IP, demonstrating that stimulatory RNA can associate with LGP2 in vitro in the absence of additional proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Altogether these results indicate that LGP2 selectively associates with a pool of MDA5 agonists in EMCV-infected cells and that LGP2 IP is a suitable approach to enrich for such agonists."

We pooled RNA extracted from multiple independent control or LGP2 IPs and carried out Illumina sequencing in duplicate (\u2018Material and methods\u2019). Approximately, 30 million reads of 60 nts in length were obtained from each sequencing sample and were mapped to the human and the EMCV genomes. The total number of reads mapping to EMCV represented around 30% in LGP2 IP samples vs only 4% and 6% in ctrl IP and input, respectively (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1 and 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which indicated that the RNA in the LGP2 IP is specifically enriched for EMCV-derived sequences. To allow better comparison across samples, the number of reads from LGP2 IP, ctrl IP and input samples was first normalised to the total number of reads (displayed as reads/million) and then aligned to the EMCV genome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Surprisingly, the distribution of sequences in the LGP2 IP sample was not uniform but displayed a number of discrete peaks concentrated in the 5\u2032 region of the EMCV genome. In particular, one peak from position 735 nts to 905 nts on the antisense RNA was strongly enriched (25,000 reads/million) over input and ctrl IP samples (non detectable and 60 reads/million, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

We infected HeLa cells, extracted RNA and subjected it to RT-PCR analysis. Using specific primers (shown as arrows in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), we confirmed the loss of the L region in the mutant viruses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left panel). Because all three viruses are attenuated due to the absence of the L protein, a known antagonist of IFN induction (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hato et al., 2007</a>), we also amplified the Vp1 region to verify that similar levels of EMCV RNA were present in all samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right panel). We then assessed the IFN stimulatory potential of these samples using the IFN-\u03b2 reporter assay. In all cases, RNA extracted from HeLa cells infected with EMCV \u0394L<sub>ac</sub>, \u0394L<sub>zn</sub> or \u0394L was slightly less stimulatory than RNA extracted from cells infected with wild-type (WT) EMCV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). More importantly, only a low amount of stimulatory RNA was recovered from LGP2 IPs following infection with the mutant viruses in contrast to infection with WT EMCV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results are consistent with the earlier indications that the major species of stimulatory RNA associating with LGP2 in EMCV-infected cells derives from the L antisense region."

We used dendritic cells grown from mouse bone marrow (BM-DCs), which produce vast amounts of IFNs in response to virus infection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Diebold et al., 2003</a>). To allow efficient replication of the L protein-deficient viral strains, BM-DCs were derived from IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor-deficient mice (IFNAR1 knockout [KO]). To monitor EMCV detection and the activation of the downstream RLRs signalling pathway, we assessed the induction of both Ifit1 and Ifnb1, which are direct transcriptional targets of IRF-3 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grandvaux et al., 2002</a>). Upon infection with WT EMCV, induction of <i>Ifit1</i> and <i>Ifnb1</i> was limited (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). It was markedly greater in response to infection with EMCV Zn<sub>C19AC22A</sub>, which encodes the non-functional mutant L protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), consistent with the fact that the L protein inhibits IFN induction (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hato et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, infection with EMCV\u0394L lacking both L protein and EMCV L region RNA induced lower levels of <i>Ifnb1</i> or <i>Ifit1</i> than infection with EMCV Zn<sub>C19AC22A</sub> at two different multiplicities of infection (MOI) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). EMCV \u0394L and EMCV Zn<sub>C19AC22A</sub> replicated to similar levels, indicating that any differences in stimulation by these viruses are not caused by variations in viral RNA levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Similar results were obtained when the mutations were introduced into the EMCV mengo strain background (data not shown). These data show that the L region RNA of EMCV is important for RLR stimulation and viral restriction in infected cells and that this is independent on its ability to encode a functional L protein."

Notably, the induction of both Ifit1 and Ifnb1 in response to EMCV L<sub>FMDV</sub> was comparable to that induced by EMCV\u0394L (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) and replication of the two strains was indistinguishable. These data suggest that the EMCV L AS RNA sequence rather than the position of the L region in the EMCV genome is the key determinant in innate stimulation. To further address this issue, we introduced the EMCV L antisense RNA sequence into the influenza virus NS segment, a known RIG-I agonist (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</a>). However, as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>, the resulting chimeric NS RNA remained dependent on RIG-I and not MDA5 for its stimulatory activity.

For example, some of the RNA species extracted from infected cells may not have access to MDA5 during infection or may be produced in quantities or at times that are irrelevant for innate immune recognition. One way to identify those RNAs most likely to be relevant agonists in infected cells is to isolate them directly from RLR complexes present in those cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baum and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</a>). In this study, we describe a method to isolate relevant MDA5 agonists from cells infected with EMCV by immunoprecipitation of LGP2/RNA complexes. We show that this method simultaneously enriches for MDA5 stimulatory activity and for a discrete species of antisense RNA mapping to the EMCV L region. Notably, we establish a causal connection between the two events by showing that deletion of the L region from the virus genome abrogates the association of stimulatory RNA with LGP2 in infected cells and reduces the innate stimulatory capacity of the virus, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that in vitro synthesis of L region antisense RNA is sufficient to generate an MDA5 agonist. Our results demonstrate that the antisense L region of EMCV associates with LGP2 and is a key determinant of MDA5 stimulation. Curiously, this determinant is derived from the same region that encodes a protein product that suppresses IFN induction. The fact that deletion of this region in EMCV reduces viral stimulatory activity is therefore counterintuitive and strengthens the notion that it is a physiologically-relevant major determinant of innate immunity to the virus."

                        "text": "The finding that pulldown of LGP2 allows isolation of MDA5 stimulatory RNA is in agreement with the fact that both RLRs are required for IFN production upon EMCV infection (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and with previous reports describing LGP2 as a positive regulator of MDA5 signalling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Venkataraman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Satoh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bruns et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Childs et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, despite numerous attempts and experimental permutations, we have never been able to isolate stimulatory RNA directly from MDA5 pulldowns (data not shown). One explanation may be that LGP2 possesses higher avidity for RNA than MDA5 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bruns et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Childs et al., 2013</a>) and is therefore more prone to retain bound agonist during cell lysis and precipitation. Another possibility relates to the fact that MDA5 forms filaments along RNA upon activation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Peisley et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berke and Modis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wu et al., 2012</a>) and that such structures\u2014when formed in infected cells\u2014may be difficult to isolate. These considerations raise the question of whether LGP2 precipitation selects relevant MDA5 agonists. For example, given that LGP2 can bind to stimulatory RNAs in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), is it possible that the complexes that we precipitate result from post-lysis \u2018mopping-up\u2019 of stimulatory RNA that would never in the intact cell have come into contact with MDA5? We believe this is unlikely based on the fact that the functional relevance of the L region identified in the LGP2 pulldowns could be validated in the context of infection using mutant viruses. Furthermore, we find that LGP2 pulldown both enriches for MDA5 agonists and depletes them from input material. Therefore, it appears that the universe of LGP2-bound RNAs largely overlaps with that of MDA5 agonists in EMCV-infected cells. Although we do not exclude the possibility that there are MDA5 agonists that are not captured by LGP2 pulldown (see below), our findings suggest a model where LGP2 pre-selects RNAs for MDA5 activation prior to the formation of MDA5 filaments. Whether the two proteins form a physical complex remains to be established\u2014it is possible that LGP2 acts upstream of MDA5 to \u2018handover\u2019 agonistic RNA and that interaction with MDA5, if any, may be indirect or transient."

We were not able to identify specific enrichment for any human sequences (data not shown), a finding that does not support a dominant role for RNAseL cleaved self RNA in MDA5 activation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Malathi et al., 2007</a>). This is in agreement with another recent publication that also failed to detect a significant role for RNaseL activity in EMCV-dependent IFN induction (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2012</a>). Instead, the sequencing data, confirmed by strand-specific RT-PCR analysis, identified a different species of small RNA that was highly enriched in LGP2 pulldowns. This is a fragment of 171 nucleotides that corresponds to the antisense RNA in the L region of the genome. Its short length and failure to be accompanied by the complementary strand are at odds with the notion that MDA5 is activated by long dsRNA (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kato et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>). However, recent data indicate that MDA5 can form filaments along short dsRNA of around 100 nucleotides in length (<a href=\"#bib27\">Peisley et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, the fact that LGP2-associated RNA appears to be single-stranded is in agreement with the observation that the stimulatory activity of the LGP2-associated RNA is sensitive to RNases that degrade ssRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, this LGP2-associated RNA is also sensitive to dsRNase treatment, which suggests the presence of base-paired regions important for MDA5/LGP2 recognition. Consistent with that notion, heat denaturation destroyed its activity (data not shown). In silico analysis reveals the potential of the L antisense RNA to form hairpins (data not shown), and such secondary and tertiary structure features may help to efficiently trigger MDA5 activation. Interestingly, by in vitro transcription of a sequence corresponding to the L antisense region we have succeeded in creating de novo an RNA that triggers MDA5 activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). What endows this RNA with MDA5 agonistic activity and whether the in vitro transcribed version fully corresponds to that naturally formed in EMCV-infected cells will require further investigation."

However, Northern blots of RNA from EMCV-infected cells screened with an L AS sequence probe reveal many fragments smaller than the EMCV genome ranging between 200 and 2000 nucleotides (data not shown). Moreover, a previous study has reported the generation of a short subgenomic RNA fragment derived from the degradation of the non-polyadenylated genome of flaviviruses by the exonuclease XRN1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Funk et al., 2010</a>). It is possible that a similar mechanism could generate an L antisense RNA fragment. Alternatively, stress granule formation, known to interfere with picornavirus replication (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borghese and Michiels, 2011</a>), could potentially lead to degradation of viral RNA and generate the L region antisense RNA agonist.

Negative-strand RNA from the RF then serves as the template to produce new progeny viral genomes through a replicative intermediate (RI) consisting of many positively-stranded progeny RNA genomes in the process of being synthesised and still partially hybridised to the full-length antisense RNA template. A recent study showed that negative-strand RNA synthesis is absolutely required for IFN induction during infection of mengovirus, a strain of EMCV (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2012</a>). Our results that a small RNA derived from the negative-strand RNA of EMCV associates with LGP2 and activates MDA5 is in line with that report. However, it has also been shown that both the RF and RI forms can activate MDA5 upon transfection (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Triantafilou et al., 2012</a>). It is conceivable that RF and RI forms could be processed by RNases within the cell following transfection or infection, releasing the L antisense fragment that associates with LGP2. Alternatively, it is possible that the L region antisense fragment enriched in our IP is only one of several agonists generated upon EMCV replication and that the RF and RI forms constitute a different set of agonists that do not strongly associate with LGP2 and have therefore been missed in our approach. This hypothesis is consistent with our data, which show that EMCV\u0394L viruses still possess the ability to induce low levels of IFN and IFIT-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>) and generate stimulatory RNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Such data suggest the existence of at least one additional stimulatory RNA species beside the L region antisense fragment and help explain why EMCV\u0394L is an attenuated strain: the additional stimulatory RNA means that it cannot fully evade innate immune detection while the lack of the L protein means that it cannot suppress the consequences of detection. Although it remains to be established whether this putative additional stimulatory RNA species corresponds to the RF/RI (or even acts via MDA5\u2014<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), these observations suggest the need to determine to what extent different innate immune stimuli dominate at different stages of infection."

After ribosomal RNA removal, the RNA was tested for its ability to activate the IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter. The RNA was then prepared for Illumina sequencing using an optimised version of the original Directional mRNA-Seq Library Prep protocol (Pre-Release Protocol Rev.A). The original protocol was optimised from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA input to a total input of up to 173 ng.

The authors use total RNA of EMCV-infected HeLa cells as a source for natural MDA5 ligands, from which they purify RNA based on affinity for the RIG-I like receptor LGP2. The authors find that RNA bound to LGP2 is enriched for MDA5-dependent stimulatory activity. Using next-generation sequencing, the authors observe an enrichment of viral sequences in the precipitated RNA, and in particular of antisense-transcripts from the EMCV L-region. By employing deletion mutants for this region, as well as point mutants, they attribute the majority of MDA5-activity generated in EMCV-infected cells to the L-region antisense RNA. Of note, this feature is clearly independent of the L-Protein encoded therein."

To do this, we have coexpressed FLAG-tagged LGP2 together with HA-tagged MDA5 in HeLa cells but, oddly, we lose MDA5 detection when the cells are infected with EMCV (data not shown). We do not know the reason for this phenomenon but attribute it to the capacity of MDA5 to form insoluble filaments upon activation that are lost from the lysate during preclearing. We have attempted to circumvent the issue by using lysate from uninfected cells that has been spiked with RNA from EMCV infected Vero cells prior to MDA5 or LGP2 immunoprecipitation but this has failed to reveal any co-precipitation (data not shown). Because these experiments are negative they remain inconclusive and, therefore, we have not included them in the paper. Thus, we do not at present have proof that LGP2/MDA5/RNA form a tripartite complex and, consequently, have amended the term \u201ccomplex\u201d throughout the text. It is in fact possible that LGP2 acts upstream of MDA5 to remodel agonistic RNA or that its interaction with MDA5 is very transient and unlikely to be captured by biochemical means. We now refer to these possibilities in the revised Discussion. We thank the reviewers for allowing us to clarify the issue."
