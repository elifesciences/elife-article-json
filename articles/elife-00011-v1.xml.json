Based on the transcription feedback loops important for circadian timekeeping, it is commonly assumed that this mRNA cycling reflects widespread transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we directly measured the circadian dynamics of mouse liver transcription using Nascent-Seq (genome-wide sequencing of nascent RNA). Although many genes are rhythmically transcribed, many rhythmic mRNAs manifest poor transcriptional rhythms, indicating a prominent contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to circadian mRNA expression. This analysis of rhythmic transcription also showed that the rhythmic DNA binding profile of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 does not determine the transcriptional phase of most target genes. This likely reflects gene-specific collaborations of CLK:BMAL1 with other transcription factors. These insights from Nascent-Seq indicate that it should have broad applicability to many other gene expression regulatory issues."

Based on the transcription feedback loops important for circadian timekeeping, it is commonly assumed that this mRNA cycling reflects widespread transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we directly measured the circadian dynamics of mouse liver transcription using Nascent-Seq (genome-wide sequencing of nascent RNA). Although many genes are rhythmically transcribed, many rhythmic mRNAs manifest poor transcriptional rhythms, indicating a prominent contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to circadian mRNA expression. This analysis of rhythmic transcription also showed that the rhythmic DNA binding profile of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 does not determine the transcriptional phase of most target genes. This likely reflects gene-specific collaborations of CLK:BMAL1 with other transcription factors. These insights from Nascent-Seq indicate that it should have broad applicability to many other gene expression regulatory issues."

These loops are controlled by two particular proteins, which comprise the transcription factor complex called BMAL1:CLK. Transcription factors cause particular sequences of bases in the DNA of cells to be transcribed into messenger RNA, thus starting the process by which target genes are expressed as proteins. In the case of BMAL1:CLK, these proteins are then modified, which inhibits any further transcription of the target genes. A reversal of these modifications is then followed by the synthesis of new proteins, which allows a new cycle of the transcription process to begin."

More recently, however, it was suggested that other processes, such as splicing and translation, might also contribute to rhythmic changes in the amount of mRNA associated with particular genes. Such post-transcriptional processes are known to have a role in other areas of cell biology, including aspects of the circadian system, but until very recently this had not been studied in detail for all genes."

They compared this with the amount of liver mRNA expressed at six time points of the day. Although the authors found that many genes exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression in the mouse liver, about 70% of them did not show comparable transcriptional rhythms. Post-transcriptional regulation must, therefore, have a major role in the circadian system of mice and, presumably, other mammals."

The PERs and CRYs are expressed, post-translationally modified, feedback to inhibit their own transcription and are then rhythmically degraded to lead to a new round of BMAL1:CLK or BMAL1:NPAS2 -mediated transcription (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib19\">Ko and Takahashi, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dardente and Cermakian, 2007</a>). This temporal regulation of clock gene transcription cycles with a period of about 24 hr and probably underlies much of circadian biology."

                        "text": "Over the past decade, clock gene transcriptional regulation has been described in many species and tissues, where it drives the rhythmic expression of a large fraction of the mRNA population (up to 10\u201315% of all mRNAs in a single mammalian tissue; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vollmers et al., 2009</a>). Rhythmic mRNA expression has mostly been characterized by analyzing temporal changes of steady-state mRNA levels, using techniques such as microarrays (e.g., <a href=\"#bib27\">McDonald and Rosbash, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Panda et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Storch et al., 2002</a>) and more recently high-throughput sequencing (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hughes et al., 2012</a>). It is generally assumed that these rhythms in mRNA expression directly result from temporal changes in transcription. There are, however, a few reports indicating that post-transcriptional regulation contributes to rhythmic mRNA expression of several genes, including core clock genes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib21\">Kojima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Staiger and Green, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Staiger and Koster, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), but this has never been studied in detail at the genome-wide level. Circadian post-transcriptional regulation may impact rhythmic mRNA expression at many different levels, such as mRNA splicing, stability and translation. For example, post-transcriptional events rhythmically regulate the mRNA half-life of the mammalian clock genes <i>Per2</i> and <i>Cry1</i> and the <i>Drosophila</i> clock gene <i>per</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">So and Rosbash, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Woo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Woo et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, several RNA-binding proteins such as LARK, hnRNP I, hnRNP P, hnRNP Q or the circadian deadenylase NOCTURNIN have been shown to regulate circadian gene expression and/or circadian behavior (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib21\">Kojima et al., 2011</a>). These different modes of post-transcriptional regulation are not restricted to circadian biology (<a href=\"#bib16\">Keene, 2007</a>) and have been shown in other systems to regulate cellular mRNA levels independent of transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Giege et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cheadle et al., 2005</a>)."

                        "text": "To address the genome-wide contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation to mammalian mRNA rhythms, we used Nascent-Seq (high-throughput sequencing of nascent RNA; <a href=\"#bib5\">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Khodor et al., 2011</a>) to assay global rhythmic transcription in mouse liver. We performed a parallel analysis of rhythmic mRNA expression with RNA-Seq and compared the two sequencing datasets. Although many genes are rhythmically transcribed in the mouse liver (\u223c15% of all detected genes), only 42% of these rhythmically transcribed genes show mRNA oscillations. More importantly, about 70% of the genes that exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression do not show transcriptional rhythms, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in defining the rhythmic mRNA landscape. To assess the contribution of the core molecular clock to genome-wide transcriptional rhythms, we also examined how rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding directly affects the transcription of its target genes. Although maximal binding occurs at an apparently uniform phase, the peak transcriptional phases of CLK:BMAL1 target genes are heterogeneous, which indicates a disconnect between CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and its transcriptional output. The data taken together reveal novel regulatory features of rhythmic gene expression and highlight Nascent-Seq as an important genome-wide assay for the study of gene expression."

To this end, nascent RNA was extracted from purified nuclei using the high salt/urea/detergent buffer originally described by <a href=\"#bib47\">Wuarin and Schibler (1994)</a>. A very similar sequencing strategy was recently applied by Smale, Black and colleagues to macrophage nascent RNA (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bhatt et al., 2012</a>).

Intronic Nascent-Seq reads are also more abundant in mouse compared to <i>Drosophila</i> (76% vs 45%), reflecting longer intron size and less efficient mouse co-transcriptional splicing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Khodor et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Khodor et al., 2011</a>). Many genes exhibit a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 gradient in the Nascent-Seq dataset, presumably reflecting nascent RNAs of different lengths attached to elongating Pol II (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition, Nascent-Seq signals frequently extend past the polyadenylation site, reflecting RNA not yet cleaved by the cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and/or RNA molecules still associated with Pol II after cleavage but prior to degradation by the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exoribonuclease <i>Xrn2</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

Because these genes are associated with short or long mRNA half-lives, respectively, we compared the Nascent-Seq to RNA-Seq ratios of genes with their published mRNA half-lives (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sharova et al., 2009</a>).

The dramatic, genome-wide disconnect between the phases of rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and rhythmic target gene transcription suggests that other transcription factors and/or mechanisms collaborate with CLK:BMAL1 binding and are critical to determine the phase of clock gene transcription.

Briefly, a peak located between the transcription start site and the transcription start end of a gene was assigned to that gene, regardless of the ChIP-Seq peak position. The other peaks, referred as intergenic, were assigned to the gene with the closest transcription start site. Confirmation of this computational gene assignment was then confirmed by manual inspection for the 211 CLK:BMAL1 peaks.

Your manuscript therefore addresses an important problem in circadian biology: what is the correlation between transcription and the mRNA levels measured by high-throughput techniques? In various organisms and tissues the cycling transcripts have been identified, however, the link between these stable mRNA measures, transcriptional activity, and post-transcriptional regulation has not been addressed on a global scale. The reviewers agreed that the principles behind the experiments are generally sound, that the manuscript is well written, and that with a few exceptions the experimental protocols and analysis methods are clear. This paper provides several key advancements in the field and provides a solid foundation upon which to build a better understanding of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and the contribution of post-transcriptional mechanisms to clock regulated gene expression."
