This expansion is thought to primarily reflect differences in proliferation <i>versus</i> differentiation of neural progenitors during cortical development. Here, we have searched for such differences by analysing cerebral organoids from human and chimpanzees using immunohistofluorescence, live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the cytoarchitecture, cell type composition, and neurogenic gene expression programs of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar. Notably, however, live imaging of apical progenitor mitosis uncovered a lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase in humans compared to chimpanzees that is specific to proliferating progenitors and not observed in non-neural cells. Consistent with this, the small set of genes more highly expressed in human apical progenitors points to increased proliferative capacity, and the proportion of neurogenic basal progenitors is lower in humans. These subtle differences in cortical progenitors between humans and chimpanzees may have consequences for human neocortex evolution."

This expansion is thought to primarily reflect differences in proliferation <i>versus</i> differentiation of neural progenitors during cortical development. Here, we have searched for such differences by analysing cerebral organoids from human and chimpanzees using immunohistofluorescence, live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the cytoarchitecture, cell type composition, and neurogenic gene expression programs of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar. Notably, however, live imaging of apical progenitor mitosis uncovered a lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase in humans compared to chimpanzees that is specific to proliferating progenitors and not observed in non-neural cells. Consistent with this, the small set of genes more highly expressed in human apical progenitors points to increased proliferative capacity, and the proportion of neurogenic basal progenitors is lower in humans. These subtle differences in cortical progenitors between humans and chimpanzees may have consequences for human neocortex evolution."

Metaphase is the part of the division process when the cell makes sure that structures called chromosomes, which carry the cell\u2019s DNA, can be separated and distributed equally between the two daughter cells. Mora-Berm\u00fadez et al. also found that progenitor cells more likely to become neurons sooner had a shorter metaphase than progenitor cells more likely to remain proliferating as stem cells for longer.

The orientation of the spindle relative to the apical-basal axis of cell polarity\u00a0in mitotic apical radial glia, the major cortical neural stem cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">G\u00f6tz and Huttner, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</a>), can determine whether their division is symmetric or asymmetric, and whether it is proliferative or neurogenic, with regard to their progeny (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mora-Bermudez and Huttner, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mora-Bermudez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shitamukai and Matsuzaki, 2012</a>).

Human cerebral organoids form a variety of tissues that resemble specific brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, ventral forebrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, hippocampus, and retina. Moreover, their cerebral cortex-like regions exhibit distinct germinal zones, that is, a VZ containing APs and an SVZ containing BPs, as well as basal-most neuronal layers. Cerebral organoid APs include apical radial glia-like NSPCs that contact a ventricle-like lumen, express radial glia marker genes, undergo interkinetic nuclear migration, and divide at the apical surface, similar to their in vivo counterparts, and cerebral organoid BPs comprise both basal radial glia-like and basal intermediate progenitor-like NSPCs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lancaster et al., 2013</a>). Finally, we have previously shown by single-cell RNA sequencing that the gene expression programs controlling neocortex development in human cerebral organoids are remarkably similar to those in the developing fetal tissue (<a href=\"#bib4\">Camp et al., 2015</a>). Together, these findings suggest that cerebral organoids constitute a valid system to explore potential differences in NSPC proliferation <i>versus</i> differentiation between humans and chimpanzees (<a href=\"#bib39\">Otani et al., 2016</a>), in particular with regard to spindle orientation in mitotic APs."

While most NSPC characteristics are found to be similar, we show that the prometaphase-metaphase in mitotic APs is longer in humans than in chimpanzees, indicating that a\u00a0fundamental difference exists\u00a0in the regulation of mitosis during neocortex development between the two species. Our data also provide a resource for further studies on human and chimpanzee differences in cortical development, and demonstrate the usability of cerebral organoids as a means to be able to\u00a0perform such studies."

These chimpanzee cerebral organoids formed complex tissue structures that resembled the developing primate brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> right), as reported previously for human cerebral organoids (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lancaster et al., 2013</a>). Similar to human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids ([<a href=\"#bib4\">Camp et al., 2015</a>], <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> right), within the chimpanzee organoids grown for 52 days (D52), we observed cortex-like regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> right) with PAX6-positive APs (such as radial glia) residing predominantly in the apical-most zone facing a ventricular lumen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> left), similar to the ventricular zone (VZ) of developing primate neocortex at an early-mid stage of neurogenesis. Consistent with this, cells immunoreactive for the deep-layer neuron marker CTIP2 were observed in the basal region of the developing cortical wall (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> left), corresponding to an early cortical plate. TBR2 (also known as EOMES) positive BPs (presumably mostly basal intermediate progenitors) were concentrated in a zone between the PAX6+ progenitors and the CTIP2+ neurons, corresponding to the subventricular zone (SVZ). In the context of the time-lapse live imaging of apical mitoses described below, we observed apically directed nuclear migration prior to, and basally directed nuclear migration after, mitosis, consistent with the existence of interkinetic nuclear migration. Our results suggest that chimpanzee cerebral organoids recapitulate important\u00a0aspects of fetal chimpanzee brain development and allow comparisons with cerebral cortex development in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex."

Notably, whereas no significant differences were observed at D28, at D52-D54, the proportion of PAX6+TBR2+ NSPCs in the chimpanzee organoids was nearly twice that in the human organoids, and the proportion of PAX6+TBR2\u2013 NSPCs was correspondingly lower, whereas no significant difference between human and chimpanzee was observed for PAX6\u2013TBR2+ NSPCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

We then used a Bayesian approach to identify differentially expressed genes by comparing cerebral organoid APs and neurons between species (ignoring BPs due to the low number of BPs identified). We identified 297 and 279 genes that were more highly expressed in human APs and neurons, respectively, and 283 and 314 genes that were more highly expressed in chimpanzee APs and neurons, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>). In addition to the between-species comparisons, we identified genes differentially expressed between human or chimpanzee APs and neurons to identify cell-type specific genes (for human: 1328 AP-specific, 1132 neuron-specific; for chimpanzee: 1501 AP-specific, 1166 neuron-specific). The vast majority (94%) of genes that are AP-specific and neuron-specific in humans are not differential between human and chimpanzee (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of the differentially expressed genes between species, we identified 93 genes that are strongly upregulated in human organoid APs and 72 genes upregulated in human organoid neurons. Gene ontology enrichments suggest that the proteins encoded by some of these genes are integral to cell membranes and involved in intercellular signalling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>), for example integrin beta 8 (ITGB8) in APs and insulin receptor (INSR) in human neurons. This upregulation of ITGB8 specific to human APs and INSR specific to human neurons is also observed in comparisons between human and mouse (<a href=\"#bib9\">Florio et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

Notably, a similar proportion of AP- and neuron-specific genes were gained on the chimpanzee and human branch subsequent to their separation, suggesting that our analysis did not have a strong human bias. About 12% of these genes specific to AP or neurons in both human and chimpanzee were not specific to these cell types in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib9\">Florio et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that they may be involved in developmental processes specific to the primate cerebral cortex."

We did not observe signs of strong perturbation during live image acquisition in either system, such as mitotic arrest (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C,E</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) or lack of nuclear movements and cell death. Chromosome dynamics and spindle orientation of APs, as revealed by the orientation of the metaphase plate, were similar in human developing neocortex and human organoids, both before anaphase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D,G</a>) and during anaphase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D,H,I</a>), when cell cleavage initiates.

As deduced from the orientation of the chromosome plates, most APs in both human and chimpanzee divided with a cleavage orientation largely perpendicular to the apical, ventricular surface, showing deviations of fewer than 30\u00b0 from a perfect orthogonal cleavage. Oblique and near-horizontal orientations were also observed, but at a much lower abundance and at similar frequencies in chimpanzee and human organoids (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013J</a>).

We next compared human APs in G2-M with human iPSCs (TkDA3-4) and an endothelial cell line (HUVEC; both single-cell RNA-seq data sets in GSE81252) to understand the specificity of G2-M regulation in APs. We found that nearly all genes upregulated in human APs in G2-M compared with human APs in G1 were also upregulated during G2-M in iPSCs and endothelial cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Therefore, the expression level of these genes is unlikely to contribute to the specificity of mitotic control of human APs in G2-M. However, we identified many genes that were highly expressed throughout the human AP cell cycle and were specific to APs. Genes with the highest specificity score encoded canonical cerebral cortex patterning transcription factors such as PAX6, ID4, and GLI3, as well as proteins involved in cell adhesion and ECM signalling (CDH4, EFNB1/2, COL4A2).

This extends a very\u00a0recent study (<a href=\"#bib39\">Otani et al., 2016</a>) and establishes cerebral organoids as a valid system to compare human and chimpanzee NSPC behaviour. Using this system, we have shown that human and chimpanzee APs differ in that prometaphase-metaphase is longer in humans than in chimpanzees. This difference was also observed between human and orangutan and reflects a greater extent of prometaphase-metaphase lengthening that occurs as human APs are generated during cerebral organoid development from IPSCs. There are two intriguing implications as to the biological significance of this prometaphase-metaphase lengthening in human APs."

The longer prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs would therefore be consistent with a greater tendency for proliferative than neurogenic divisions.

Specifically, the proportion of PAX6+TBR2\u2013 NSPCs, located in the VZ and thus constituting proliferating APs, decreased in both human and chimpanzee cerebral organoids, but the value reached in human organoids was slightly higher than that in chimpanzee organoids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Conversely, the proportion of PAX6+TBR2+ NSPCs, located in the basal VZ and SVZ and constituting BPs with neurogenic potential, showed a greater increase in chimpanzee than human cerebral organoids. In sum, two independent lines of evidence, the detailed analysis of AP mitosis phase lengths and the determination of the proportions of the various NSPC types, support the concept that a longer neurogenic period (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lewitus et al., 2014</a>), which in turn implies a longer phase of NSPC proliferation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Otani et al., 2016</a>), contributes to the greater expansion of the neocortex in humans than the great apes."

The longer duration of prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs, in particular of the metaphase plate stage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), may therefore\u00a0reflect some difference between the two species with regard to the preparation for chromosome segregation."

This may be due to spindle orientation variability between individual APs being greater than potential inter-species differences. This suggests that, in the cell types and stages analysed, spindle orientation may not play a key role in human vs. chimpanzee neurogenesis. Alternatively, this may reflect the fact that differences in proliferative <i>versus</i> neurogenic AP divisions can occur without a change in spindle orientation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Konno et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kosodo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mora-Bermudez and Huttner, 2015</a>). In this context, differences between human and chimpanzee NSPCs of relevance for neocortex expansion are likely to be small. Consistent with this\u00a0view, our single-cell transcriptome analyses revealed only few differences between human and chimpanzee, and the differences in the proportions of organoid NSPC populations were in the range of a few percentage points. Furthermore, the ~5\u2009min longer prometaphase-metaphase in human than chimpanzee APs constituted only a fraction of the total duration of their mitosis. These small differences\u00a0nevertheless provide a set of clues as to which NSPC features may underlie the differential extent of neocortex expansion in humans versus apes, and are consistent with a scenario in which the accumulation of such small differences during evolution may have resulted in the distinct chimpanzee and human neocortices."

Briefly, blood was collected from a chimpanzee and an orangutan, both housed at the Leipzig Zoo, and leukocytes were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation, which were then used for reprogramming to iPSCs. DNA sequencing revealed no chromosome aberrations, and RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry confirmed pluripotent gene and protein expression signatures.

Human endothelial cells. (HUVECs, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were maintained in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Single cell transcriptome analysis confirmed the identity of human and chimpanzee iPSCs and human endothelial cells, and showed no contamination with other cell lines. B-cell lines were generated from blood obtained from three human (A144, A156, A158) and three chimpanzee (Dorien, Jahaga, Ulla) individuals. Withdrawal and processing of blood samples was performed according to approved protocols, and was performed for chimpanzee during necessary veterinary interventions. Lymphocytes were isolated from blood using a Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Immortalization was performed by adding Epstein Barr virus (EBV) supernatant to the lymphocytes and further cultivation of the cells until colonies of immortalized B-lymphocytes were established (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tosato and Cohen, 2007</a>). B-cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS, 1% Glutamax and 2% penicillin/streptomycin.

After cell type assignment, SCDE (Single Cell Differential Expression) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kharchenko et al., 2014</a>), a Bayesian approach for finding differentially expressed genes accounting for noise inherent to single-cell data, was used to compare the orthologous cell type between human and chimpanzee. AP or neuronal specificity was defined as one standard deviation from the mean of z-scores from SCDE of APs and Neurons (Z.x). A more stringent threshold of twice the standard deviation of the z-score was used to define differential expression between human and chimpanzee (Z.y). For the differential gene expression analysis during mitotic phases, we aimed to identify relatively homogeneous clusters of human organoid APs, chimpanzee organoid APs, endothelial cells (ECs), or iPSCs in G2M or G1 phases. We hierarchically clustered cells (Pearson correlation) using expression of genes that correlated with PC1 from PCA on human fetal cortex progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Camp et al., 2015</a>) and which are able to distinguish between cells in G2M and G1 phases. We selected the clusters with high or no expression and assigned them as G2/M or G1, respectively, and ignored the intermediate cells for SCDE. For the organoid APs, this assignment was consistent with an independent assignment using the method published by (<a href=\"#bib48\">Scialdone et al., 2015</a>)."

Prophase: the beginning of mitotic chromosome condensation; prometaphase\u00a0+ metaphase: the beginning of chromosome congression and alignment; anaphase: the beginning of chromosome segregation toward the mitotic poles of the dividing cell; telophase: the beginning of chromosome decondensation after maximal chromosome condensation in late anaphase and until a level indistinguishable from interphase was achieved. The total duration of mitosis was the sum of these phases. We note that our measurements of mitotic phases are limited by the use of chromosomes as markers. Nevertheless, the use of a single fluorescence channel allowed a very high time resolution (~1.1\u2009min) for close monitoring of key chromosomal dynamics to delimit mitotic phases. Towards distinguishing between prometaphase and metaphase, we subdivided prometaphase\u00a0+ metaphase into 'prometaphase', defined here as the time in which chromosomes are congressing and aligning toward the formation of a metaphase plate, and 'metaphase', defined here as the time after every chromosome has been incorporated into a tight metaphase plate at the equatorial plane of the cell, and until anaphase onset."

To address this technologically very challenging question, the authors use state of the art approaches including brain organoid cultures and single cell RNAseq. In a very remarkable methodological tour-de-force, the authors develop brain organoids from human, chimpanzee and orangutan iPSCs, and go on to perform high resolution live imaging of individual progenitor cells. The authors find that same classes of neural stem progenitor cells in humans and chimps are nearly identical at the transcriptome level, and also in their behavior in the cell cycle. A consistent difference identified by the authors is a lengthening of 5 min of metaphase during cell division. The study is timely and addresses a very important question. The reviewers, however, identified a number of technical and conceptual issues that will require the authors' attention."

As the cell cycle differences were detected in the VZ (in AP) which is not the major proliferative region in the human and in chimpanzee cortex this finding may not necessarily provide sufficient explanation to the difference between the human and chimpanzee brains. If this is the main goal of this manuscript, it may be more informative to put more emphasis on the human and chimpanzee PAX6 TBR2 NSPCs / PAX6 TBR2- NSPCs, which were not analyzed due to their low numbers. Alternatively, it may be advisable to analyze the changes at the level of protein expression in the AP during metaphase. In case such a study is beyond the scope of the current paper, the manuscript may be modified emphasizing the validity of the organoid system to study the conservation and diversification of cortical development in different species, the technical advances conducted and how they can assist in approaching such a complex and difficult study."

In the figure legend, n=5 at day 28 whereas n=17 at D52-54, Does 'n' represent different organoid sections or different sections from same organoid? The difference in the number of Pax6 Tbr2 cells between chimpanzee and human is not evident in the immunostaining images in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. The author should provide a better view of the image marking some cells with co-localization of Tbr2 and Pax6.

In a very remarkable methodological tour-de-force, the authors develop brain organoids from human, chimpanzee and orangutan iPSCs, and go on to perform high resolution live imaging of individual progenitor cells. The authors find that same classes of neural stem progenitor cells in humans and chimps are nearly identical at the transcriptome level, and also in their behavior in the cell cycle. A consistent difference identified by the authors is a lengthening of 5 min of metaphase during cell division. The study is timely and addresses a very important question.

If this is the main goal of this manuscript, it may be more informative to put more emphasis on the human and chimpanzee PAX6 TBR2 NSPCs / PAX6 TBR2- NSPCs, which were not analyzed due to their low numbers. Alternatively, it may be advisable to analyze the changes at the level of protein expression in the AP during metaphase.

Yet, differences in cell cycle parameters between human and chimpanzee apical progenitors (APs), especially at the relatively early stages of cortical development examined in the present study, could impact the extent of basal progenitor (BP) generation and hence SVZ formation. As shown in the <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, we have now determined cell cycle parameters for human and chimpanzee PAX6 TBR2\u2013 APs using cumulative EdU labeling, and find a \u22483\u2009hr difference in total cell cycle length between human and chimpanzee D52-54 organoid APs (human 46.5\u2009h, chimpanzee 43.8\u2009h). Interestingly, this difference is essentially accounted for by a longer S-phase of human APs (17.5\u2009hr vs. 12.8\u2009h), which has previously been shown to be a hallmark of proliferative (as opposed to neurogenic) AP divisions (Arai et al. 2011). The difference between human and chimpanzee APs with regard to the progression of mitosis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) is in line with the longer S-phase finding, as the longer metaphase plate stage may similarly impact the mode of AP division and thus the fate of the AP progeny. These differences in cell cycle and mitosis parameters between human and chimpanzee APs are consistent with the anticipated differences in cortical development between the two species, as is now discussed in greater detail in the revised manuscript (Discussion, last paragraph)."

Thus, the cortical regions compared between the two species were all positive for the deep-layer neuron marker Ctip2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) and negative for the upper-layer neuron marker Satb2 at D52-D54, and they were all Ctip2-negative at D28, indicating that the human and chimpanzee cerebral organoids were at a comparable stage in their development at these two time points.

Instead it likely reflects the relative composition of cells and patterned regions of those particular organoids, and our limited sampling of cells per organoid. The organoid protocol that we used (Lancaster et al. 2014) generates heterogeneous batches of organoids, where each organoid might have different brain regions. All organoids analyzed in this study contained one or more stratified cortical-like regions surrounding a ventricle. These cortical-like regions are often patterned as dorsal telencephalon (FOXG1 and OTX2-), however we have observed cortical regions that express ventral telencephalon or hindbrain markers (Camp, Badsha et al. 2015). For the 62d organoid, we observed one relatively large cortical-like region, which we microdissected and used for the scRNA-seq analysis. Based on the clustering pattern and marker gene expression, we concluded that cells from this 62d organoid were from a hindbrain-like region.

Rather, the longer S-phase of human APs (17.5\u2009hr vs. 12.8\u2009hr for the chimpanzee) is likely to be relevant, as this has previously been shown to be a hallmark of proliferative (as opposed to neurogenic) AP divisions (Arai et al. 2011)."

We used these genes to hierarchically cluster human organoid APs, chimpanzee organoid APs, endothelial cells, or iPSCs. This generally gave two clear groups of cells that either expressed the genes highly or had low expression of these genes. There were additional sub-clusters of cells that partially expressed the genes. We selected the clusters with high or no/low expression and assigned them as G2/M or G1, respectively, and ignored the intermediate cells. This assignment was consistent with an unbiased assignment using the method published by (Scialdone et al. 2015). The cells that we see as intermediate or transiting cells were distributed between G2/M, S, and G1-phase, whereas the clusters we used in our analysis showed a clear assignment as G2/M or G1. For our differential expression analysis, we wanted to compare two groups of transcriptionally relatively homogeneous cells in G2/M and G1.

The prometaphase-metaphase lengthening that we observed is a natural difference among three hominids and one rodent species, whereas Pilaz et al. generate a prolongation within one rodent species using drugs and genetic perturbations.

This possibility is indeed underscored by the recent work of Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez et al. (Nat Comm 2016) and also by work from the Matsuzaki lab that has shown that a perfectly vertical AP cleavage plane can give rise to either AP or BP daughter cells. Therefore, the reviewer is entirely correct in suggesting that factors other than cleavage plane orientation also influence AP daughter cell fate. In fact, in line with the reviewer's suggestion, our observation that there are no significant differences in spindle orientation between human and chimp made us analyze other aspects of AP division, which led to the finding of the metaphase lengthening.

Traditionally, it has been convenient to classify cells into discrete types based on behavior, morphology and/or a small combination of marker genes in order to describe observations and make comparisons. To perform differential gene expression analysis using the Bayesian approach developed by Karchenko et al., which accounts for many of the assumptions inherent to single-cell transcriptome data, cell type classification is required. Therefore, we attempt to connect single cell transcriptome data with traditionally described cell types. In general, we do observe a continuum of transcriptome states across all cells, however we also find accumulations of cells that are similar with respect to the expression of groups of genes and steep transitions from such group of cells to other cells. These cells likely represent a cellular state that is relatively more stable than the apparent intermediates. The genes similarly expressed within such a cell group generally correlate well with previously described cell type marker genes and we therefore think we have the resolution to discretely classify APs, BPs, and neurons. Within each of these more stable cell states (=\u201dcell types\u201d), the continuity is less steep and we don\u2019t have the resolution to determine if there is additional heterogeneity other than that related to cell cycle. There are of course some cells that are in between the previous and next state on the continuum. These intermediate cells are relatively less abundant but we force them into a discrete cell type. For example, if ~51% of a cell\u2019s transcriptome resembles that of other BPs, and 49% of its transcriptome appears to be neuronal, then we assign this cell BP. Since these cells are relatively rare and present in both human and chimpanzee, we do not think that we introduce a bias into the differential gene expression analysis by including these cells."
