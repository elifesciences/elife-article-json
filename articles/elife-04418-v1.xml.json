All previous work on the initial step of the targeting reaction, when SRP binds to RNCs, used stalled and non-translating RNCs. This meant that an important dimension of the co-translational process remained unstudied. We apply single-molecule fluorescence measurements to observe directly and in real-time <i>E. coli</i> SRP binding to actively translating RNCs. We show at physiologically relevant SRP concentrations that SRP-RNC association and dissociation rates depend on nascent chain length and the exposure of a functional signal sequence outside the ribosome. Our results resolve a long-standing question: how can a limited, sub-stoichiometric pool of cellular SRP effectively distinguish RNCs displaying a signal sequence from those that are not? The answer is strikingly simple: as originally proposed, SRP only stably engages translating RNCs exposing a functional signal sequence."

All previous work on the initial step of the targeting reaction, when SRP binds to RNCs, used stalled and non-translating RNCs. This meant that an important dimension of the co-translational process remained unstudied. We apply single-molecule fluorescence measurements to observe directly and in real-time <i>E. coli</i> SRP binding to actively translating RNCs. We show at physiologically relevant SRP concentrations that SRP-RNC association and dissociation rates depend on nascent chain length and the exposure of a functional signal sequence outside the ribosome. Our results resolve a long-standing question: how can a limited, sub-stoichiometric pool of cellular SRP effectively distinguish RNCs displaying a signal sequence from those that are not? The answer is strikingly simple: as originally proposed, SRP only stably engages translating RNCs exposing a functional signal sequence."

The distance between the two fluorescent molecules was then tracked over time.

At the beginning of the targeting reaction, SRP binds to a ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC). If the RNC displays a signal sequence, RNC-bound SRP binds the SRP receptor at the target membrane (the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes, or the inner membrane in prokaryotes). The membrane-localized RNC is then transferred to the translocon, a protein translocation channel through which the nascent chain passes across, or into, the target membrane."

The <i>E. coli</i> SRP, which is used in these studies, can efficiently replace mammalian SRP in <i>in vitro</i> targeting reactions, demonstrating that it retains the core targeting functionality (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernstein et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Powers and Walter, 1997</a>)."

Equilibrium measurements of SRP binding affinities to RNCs stalled with nascent chains up to 35 amino acids in length indicated very tight binding (\u223c1\u2013100 nM binding constants) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>). An estimate based on ribosome profiling of the \u223c2000 most expressed proteins in <i>E. coli</i> indicates that at any given moment \u223c10% of RNCs have a nascent chain less than 35 amino acids long (<a href=\"#bib18\">Oh et al., 2011</a>). Considering that the SRP concentration in <i>E. coli</i> is \u223c400 nM (100-fold less than the ribosomal concentration) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jensen and Pedersen, 1994</a>), such tight binding affinities would result in 75\u2013100% of the SRP to be bound to these RNCs that are not exposing a signal sequence, and the majority of which (\u223c95%) never will (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>). SRP binding to these RNCs would thus result in a large unproductive sink on the targeting reaction. Kinetic studies attempted to resolve this issue and concluded that, regardless of nascent chain length, SRP arrives at RNCs very quickly (arrival rates on the order of 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> sec<sup>\u22121</sup>) and that nascent chain length mostly affects dissociation rates (although different studies have determined a wide range of dissociation rates: \u223c10\u20130.01 s<sup>\u22121</sup> for RNCs with no nascent chain and \u223c0.1 to 2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> for RNCs with an exposed signal sequence) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Noriega et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Saraogi et al., 2014</a>). The models that emerged had SRP non-specifically, and quickly arriving to RNCs as soon they begin translating and remaining bound until a nascent chain without a signal sequence becomes long enough to emerge from the ribosomal peptide tunnel and sterically displace SRP. Alternatively, the possibility of an additional factor (such as the co-translational chaperone trigger factor) was proposed to bind the RNC and displace SRP (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bornemann et al., 2014</a>). In either model, a large pool of SRP would be unproductively bound for a significant amount of time until displaced."

This approach was technically necessary to create homogenous RNC populations, but lacked the key temporal dimension, provided by active translation by RNCs. Multiple parameters are dynamically changing during active translation: (i) ribosome conformations, which cycle through pre- and post-elongation states, (ii) nascent chain composition, which changes with each new amino acid added, (iii) and length and folding state of the chain outside the ribosomal peptide tunnel. These factors all could affect how SRP interacts with, and subsequently targets, the translating RNCs. Here we developed a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay that allowed us to observe SRP binding to actively translating RNCs at physiologically relevant SRP concentrations. We show that both association and dissociation rates of SRP binding are sensitive to active RNC translation, with rapid and stable SRP binding to RNCs only upon exposure of a signal sequence outside the ribosomal peptide tunnel."

To this end, we labeled the 50S ribosome subunit with the FRET donor dye Cy3B at a unique cysteine on ribosomal protein L29 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Noriega et al., 2014</a>) and, analogously, SRP with the FRET acceptor dye Cy5 at a unique cysteine in the NG domain of Ffh (<a href=\"#bib28\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Shen et al., 2012</a>). According to all structurally characterized SRP-RNC conformations, these dye positions have inter-dye distances within \u223c40 and 50 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Halic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Schaffitzel et al., 2006</a>), allowing for detectable FRET between SRP and the ribosome given that the Forster radius of the dyes is \u223c65 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Uphoff et al., 2010</a>). To observe SRP binding at relevant concentrations, we performed smFRET experiments using zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs), in which fluorescence measurements are taken from reactions occurring within small metallic apertures (\u223c150 nm in diameter) that are patterned onto a glass substrate (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2014a</a>). ZMWs limit background fluorescence from labeled reaction components in solution, which allowed us to measure SRP-RNC binding at 100 nM Cy5-labeled SRP, which is very close to the physiological 400 nM SRP concentration in bacterial cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jensen and Pedersen, 1994</a>)."

The mRNA contained a single phenylalanine codon followed by three clusters of three sequential phenylalanine codons as chain length markers at positions 5, 25\u201327, 55\u201357, and 85\u201387 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, cWT for \u2018calibration WT\u2019). After replacing unlabeled phenylalanine tRNA (tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>) in the translation mix with Cy3.5-labeled tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> and monitoring Cy3.5 fluorescence, we observed pulses in fluorescence intensity when phenylalanine was incorporated into the nascent chain (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Tsai et al., 2014</a>).

Traditional analyses of binding rates, previously deduced from binding reactions using static, stalled RNCs, demonstrated that SRP-RNC binding kinetics are sensitive to nascent chain lengths but yielded conflicting results when describing SRP occupancy (<a href=\"#bib23\">Siegel and Walter, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Noriega et al., 2014</a>).

However, the conclusions contrast with those of previous work on stalled ribosomes, which suggested that SRP can bind prominently to RNCs with nascent chains as short as 20 amino acids containing a signal sequence still occluded within the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>).

When no signal sequence is exposed on RNCs (&gt;3.5 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, for the experiments performed at 750 nM EF-G), we observed only negligible SRP occupancy. After translation advances far enough to have a signal sequence exposed on an RNC, the SRP association rates become at least 50-fold faster (\u223c1.8 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, for the experiments performed at 750 nM EF-G)."

Our system is based on a FRET signal between dyes on the ribosome and SRP, limiting detection to interactions in which the inter-dye distance is less than \u223c95 \u00c5 (which would yield an expected E<sub>FRET</sub> of \u223c0.1). Additionally, our experiments have a 100 ms temporal resolution, and no binding would be detected, even if there was a FRET signal, if binding events had residence times much shorter than 100 ms. Given that the known SRP-RNC structures predict inter-dye distances of less than 50 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Halic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Schaffitzel et al., 2006</a>), and the shortest reported average residence time for an SRP-RNC binding event is \u223c70\u2013100 ms (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>), we are confident that we would detect binding events that are conformationally similar to the known SRP-RNC complexes. However, it is possible that there are intermediates in the binding reaction (including shot-lived, unproductive diffusional collision events) that we would not detect due to distance and temporal resolution limitations. Such intermediates could be encounter complexes previously observed to form with \u223c10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> association rates, regardless of nascent chain length (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Saraogi et al., 2014</a>).

This variability indicates that individual stalled RNCs may exist in numerous different conformational states, many of which are likely to be inactive and perhaps off-pathway, despite each displaying the same length nascent chain. These data argue that quantitative results obtained with purified and stalled RNCs may be less physiologically relevant than results obtained with similarly purified but actively translating RNCs, which, by the very nature of the assay, represent functional states."

These studies used stalled RNCs in crude cell extracts, suggesting that perhaps factors absent in our assays and/or differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems might influence early SRP-RNC interactions and affect signal sequence discrimination. The tools presented here are an important step towards quantitatively testing such a possibility with actively translating ribosomes.

This RNC construct has been shown to bind SRP robustly under single-molecule conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Noriega et al., 2014</a>). When the dye-labeled SRP and RNCs were incubated together to allow SRP-RNC complex formation, smFRET was observed with 0.2\u20130.32 efficiency (E<sub>FRET</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, left panel). To calibrate these E<sub>FRET</sub> values, we performed the same experiment using total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM), which does not quench the Cy5 signal as the aluminum walls of the apertures in the ZMW set-up do (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2014a</a>). The calibration revealed that the observed signal corresponded to a corrected value of 0.33\u20130.5 E<sub>FRET</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, right panel). This is lower than the expected E<sub>FRET</sub> of \u223c0.85 predicted from molecular modeling onto cryo-EM structures of SRP bound to RNCs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Halic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Schaffitzel et al., 2006</a>). However, these are relatively low resolution structures (9.6\u201316 \u00c5), and our previous work has shown that SRP can take on a variety of conformations on the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib17\">Noriega et al., 2014</a>), consistent with the observed bimodality in the E<sub>FRET</sub> distributions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The E<sub>FRET</sub> signals are too close to each other to be clearly resolved, so we did not pursue conformational distinctions further in this study. We also compared individual RNCs based on the arrival and residence times of SRP binding events. To do this we immobilized PICs on a truncated mRNA encoding the first 55 amino acids of lepB. We then delivered our single molecule translation mix (as described in the section below) and allowed RNCs to translate for 20 min at room temperature, which based on our active translation experiments, is enough time to ensure full translation of the mRNA. We then delivered 100 nM of Cy5 labeled SRP in to the stalled RNCs and visualized SRP-RNC binding events. This assay allowed us to determine that stalled RNCs, despite being homogeneously stalled with a 55 amino acid nascent chain, show as much as 1\u20133 orders of magnitude differences in the median and variance of SRP arrival and residence times (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This broad variance among individual RNCs suggests that simply stalling RNCs induces a variety of different RNC conformations that affect SRP-binding, many of which may be physiologically irrelevant because the RNCs are not actively translating."

Other standard blockers such as PEG, poly-L-lysine, aprotinin, kappa-, and beta-Casein had no effect on non-specific SRP-ZMW interactions.

Quoting from one referee: \u201cFor many years stalled ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) have been used to obtain \u201csnapshots\u201d of various co-translational phenomena. Because translation is a highly dynamic process, however, it has never been clear that interactions between static RNCs and targeting factors, chaperones, and other nascent chain binding proteins are physiologically significant. In the present study Noriega et al. overcome this problem by using an elegant and very innovative single molecule FRET approach to examine the binding of E. coli SRP to actively translating ribosomes. They show convincingly that SRP binds to RNCs only when a signal peptide is exposed, and thereby provide the most definitive evidence to date in support of a model that was proposed over 30 years ago. They describe an important and very impressive technical advance that will doubtless be of very broad interest.\u201d"

Quoting from one of the referees: \u201cThe authors attribute the differences between their results and those with stalled RNCs to the fact the latter are not translating. There may be other reasons in addition to or instead of this. For example, stalling translation with a hydrophobic TMD exposed to bulk aqueous solvent in a PURE translation system may well result in aggregation, sticking to whatever is available, and other non-physiologic consequences. This seems far more likely to cause the observed heterogeneity and artifacts than the fact that ribosomes are stalled. I therefore think the comparison between the translating ribosomes with smFRET and stalled RNCs prepared by different methods and deposited into the ZMWs afterwards is flawed. The appropriate comparison would be to use truncated mRNA for 55-mer that is translated in the ZMW (exactly as the real-time experiment), then add the SRP after the translation. This would more directly compare stalled versus translating.\u201d Given that a major conclusion put forth relates to this comparison, the proposed experiment would seem worthwhile and well within the reagents and tools available to the authors."

The discrepancy is due to some of the mentioned arrivals being an artifact of inaccurate assignment of tRNA events in some of the traces. While our controls show that assignments are mostly accurate there is always the possibility that we miss one of the F-tRNA events. This results in some calibrations yielding too- early estimates of SRP binding. In the case of the arrival analysis we decided to include traces with 2, 3 and 4 tRNA events because, even though it leads to a small loss of accuracy, it allowed us to get a large number of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd events to analyze and compare. To verify that inaccuracy in tRNA assignment is indeed responsible for the discrepancy, we analyzed first event arrivals in traces with 4 tRNA events (and thus less likely to have a missed tRNA event) and found that only 2% happen before 40 amino acids were translated."

On the contrary, their main accomplishment has been to prove the prevailing, but inadequately tested, view. It has always seemed logical that SRP binds tightly to RNCs after a signal peptide is exposed because it has a high affinity for signal peptides, and a good deal of biochemical and structural evidence (none of which is cited) is consistent with this idea. A couple of recent studies that have attempted to determine SRP-RNC binding constants have certainly generated some controversy and perhaps illustrate the pitfalls of using static RNCs, but I wouldn't call this a \u201cparadox\u201d. Because there has been some inconsistency in the literature a more definitive approach has been needed, and that's exactly what the authors have delivered. I strongly recommend that they modify the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion to emphasize that they have proven a long-standing model and, perhaps even more importantly, developed a new method of great general utility, rather than focus on a few puzzling recent results</i>."

The paradox, (or \u2018question\u2019 as we now call it) addressed by our paper is: \u201chow can a limited, sub-stoichiometric pool of cellular SRP effectively distinguish RNCs displaying a signal sequence from those that are not?\u201d We think that framing the paper in this way is appropriate since we cite 5 high-profile papers spanning the last 6 years that argue that SRP is somehow distinguishing RNCs while still binding to those that aren\u2019t actually exposing a signal sequence.

Generally speaking, binding typically proceeds along a pathway involving the collision of the binding partners, the formation of a non-specific encounter complex, the formation of one or more binding intermediates, and the formation of the final complex. This is an important consideration because the authors state that \u201cthe kinetic parameter most responsible for signal sequence discrimination is a highly variable SRP- RNC association rate\u201d, but there is no attempt to rationalize this observation within the context of a typical binding pathway. At minimum, one would expect SRP to collide and form non-specific encounter complexes with all RNCs, regardless of whether they contain an exposed signal sequence or not. It is only after the formation of such a non-specific encounter complex that, presumably through the formation of subsequent binding intermediates or lack thereof, SRP would be able to discriminate between RNCs that are carrying an exposed signal sequence and those that are not. In the case of RNCs that do not contain an exposed signal sequence, one would expect that SRP presumably fails to proceed along the pathway to formation of the final complex and instead dissociates rapidly from one or more binding intermediates along the pathway, intermediates whose average lifetimes are too short relative to the 100 msec/frame time resolution of the smFRET measurements to be easily observed. I suspect, however, that if the time resolution of the smFRET measurements were higher, the authors would be able to observe such binding intermediates. Indeed, the observation that the residence times of SRP on RNCs containing exposed signal sequences between 40-50 amino acids and 60-70 amino acids are two-fold shorter than that on RNCs containing exposed signal sequences between 50-60 amino acids imply that binding intermediates with average lifetimes shorter than that of the final complex are indeed populated. Similarly, instances of SRP binding to RNCs containing nascent chains that do not contain a signal sequence, which I infer can be observed, albeit rarely, from the statement that \u201cSRP binding events were virtually absent upon translation of the cMT lepB mRNA\u201d, also imply that such binding intermediates do form. Discussion of the results within this framework will likely have implications for previous studies in which variability in the rate of SRP dissociation from the RNC was found to be the kinetic parameter most responsible for signal sequence discrimination as well as for more recent studies that suggest important roles for more sophisticated mechanisms (e.g., induced fit, kinetic proofreading, editing, etc.), many of which necessarily involve the formation of one or more binding intermediates. In any case, I think the authors should use a slightly more sophisticated framework to describe the binding pathway and use this framework to interpret and discuss their results</i>."

Our discussion glossed over SRP first forming non-specific encounter complexes with RNCs (regardless of nascent chain length), which then proceed through binding intermediates, thus allowing for discrimination of RNCs displaying a signal sequence. We have adapted our discussion by including the step of SRP discriminating RNCs via intermediates that we might not be detecting. Such intermediates might be what other groups have observed arriving and forming on RNCs with arrival rates that are insensitive to nascent chain length."

This overemphasis on the use of physiological SRP concentrations seems unnecessary and gives the misleading impression that smFRET experiments cannot be informatively performed at SRP concentrations greater than or lesser than physiological. Arrival and residence times, as well as changes in arrival and residence times, can be measured at any SRP concentration, physiological or otherwise, at which individual binding events can be detected. The SRP concentration at which the smFRET experiments are performed is relevant only in that, at higher SRP concentrations, arrival times are faster such that the number of individual binding events that are observed is larger. In other words, smFRET experiments performed at SRP concentrations greater than or lesser than physiological would be just as informative as those reported here at physiological SRP concentrations, so long as individual binding events can be observed at those SRP concentrations. In fact, smFRET experiments performed at SRP concentrations greater than physiological might even be desired in some instances (e.g., in experiments in which a functional signal sequence is not exposed) in that it would increase the probability that binding intermediates with average lifetimes on the order of or slightly shorter than the time resolution of the smFRET experiments could be observed.

We do believe that in this specific context, where the association rates proved to be variable and slower than expected, it was necessary to have SRP concentrations high enough so that the interactions could be detected, but not so high that they could be dismissed as maybe not happening <i>in vivo</i>. Additionally, the ability to reach such a physiologically relevant concentration is an important benefit of the method we present because other single molecule approaches, such as TIRFM, cannot achieve such a concentration and would have missed the binding events. We have therefore kept the emphasis on the benefits of studying this particular process at physiologically relevant concentrations."

Quoting from one of the referees: \u201cThe authors attribute the differences between their results and those with stalled RNCs to the fact the latter are not translating. There may be other reasons in addition to or instead of this. For example, stalling translation with a hydrophobic TMD exposed to bulk aqueous solvent in a PURE translation system may well result in aggregation, sticking to whatever is available, and other non-physiologic consequences. This seems far more likely to cause the observed heterogeneity and artifacts than the fact that ribosomes are stalled. I therefore think the comparison between the translating ribosomes with smFRET and stalled RNCs prepared by different methods and deposited into the ZMWs afterwards is flawed. The appropriate comparison would be to use truncated mRNA for 55-mer that is translated in the ZMW (exactly as the real-time experiment), then add the SRP after the translation. This would more directly compare stalled versus translating.\u201d Given that a major conclusion put forth relates to this comparison, the proposed experiment would seem worthwhile and well within the reagents and tools available to the authors</i>."
