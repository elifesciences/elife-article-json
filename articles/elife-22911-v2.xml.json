However, whether mitotic spindle in cells can be aligned by magnetic field has not been experimentally proved. In particular, the biological effects of SMF of above 20 T (Tesla) have never been reported. Here we found that in both CNE-2Z and RPE1 human cells spindle orients in 27 T SMF. The direction of spindle alignment depended on the extent to which chromosomes were aligned to form a planar metaphase plate. Our results show that the magnetic torque acts on both microtubules and chromosomes, and the preferred direction of spindle alignment relative to the field depends more on chromosome alignment than microtubules. In addition, spindle morphology was also perturbed by 27 T SMF. This is the first reported study that investigated the cellular responses to ultra-high magnetic field of above 20 T. Our study not only found that ultra-high magnetic field can change the orientation and morphology of mitotic spindles, but also provided a tool to probe the role of spindle orientation and perturbation in developmental and cancer biology."

However, whether mitotic spindle in cells can be aligned by magnetic field has not been experimentally proved. In particular, the biological effects of SMF of above 20 T (Tesla) have never been reported. Here we found that in both CNE-2Z and RPE1 human cells spindle orients in 27 T SMF. The direction of spindle alignment depended on the extent to which chromosomes were aligned to form a planar metaphase plate. Our results show that the magnetic torque acts on both microtubules and chromosomes, and the preferred direction of spindle alignment relative to the field depends more on chromosome alignment than microtubules. In addition, spindle morphology was also perturbed by 27 T SMF. This is the first reported study that investigated the cellular responses to ultra-high magnetic field of above 20 T. Our study not only found that ultra-high magnetic field can change the orientation and morphology of mitotic spindles, but also provided a tool to probe the role of spindle orientation and perturbation in developmental and cancer biology."

The maximum magnetic field strength tested (27 Tesla \u2013 or around 10 times the highest field strengths produced by standard hospital MRI scanners) did not kill the cells after four hours of exposure, but the orientation of the spindles inside the cells did change. In addition, the 27 Tesla magnetic field caused spindles that were perpendicular to the direction of the field to widen. At an intermediate field strength (9 Tesla \u2013 a magnetic field strength that has been used in some experimental MRI scanners), the orientation of the spindle only changed after three days of continuous exposure to the magnetic field. Lower field strengths (such as those currently used in hospital MRI scanners) did not alter the orientation of the spindle even after seven days of exposure."

Spindle orientation is central to cell fate determination and tissue architecture, and mounting evidences show that astral microtubules, multiple cortical proteins and their interactions with plasma membrane are all critical to achieve correct orientation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Toyoshima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Lu and Johnston, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bergstralh and St Johnston, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2014</a>). Tissues may have additional control mechanisms to minimize spindle orientation errors, such as apoptosis in the wing disc (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bergstralh and St Johnston, 2014</a>). The connection between spindle orientation and tumorigenesis has also been an active field in recent years (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gonzalez, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Knoblich, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Pease and Tirnauer, 2011</a>)."

SMFs can align large biological objects that have diamagnetic anisotropy, such as microtubule polymers and nucleic acid chains, as well as some types of cells and organisms (<a href=\"#bib16\">Maret and Dransfeld, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Torbet and Ronzi\u00e8re, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Higashi et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Emura et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Takeuchi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Teodori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Stern-Straeter et al., 2011</a>). The degree of alignment with the externally applied magnetic field is proportional to the product of the molecular magnetic susceptibility and the magnetic field strength. For proteins, the diamagnetic anisotropy is mainly due to the alpha helix, beta sheet and aromatic rings (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chabre, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Worcester, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Pauling, 1979</a>). Even individual peptide bonds, which have weak diamagnetic anisotropy can contribute when linked together in a fixed and organized orientation in alpha helix or beta sheet. Most proteins have very weak diamagnetic anisotropy, but their response to a magnetic field can be amplified by ordered polymerization, as in microtubules, where the additive diamagnetic anisotropy can be significant. The DNA chain is another example of a biopolymer with relatively large diamagnetic anisotropy (<a href=\"#bib15\">Maret et al., 1975</a>), mainly due to its stacked aromatic bases. Theoretical predictions suggested that mitotic chromosome arms, where DNA is highly compacted, might generate electromagnetic fields along the chromosome arm direction (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao and Zhan, 2012</a>) and, less speculatively, that chromosomes should be fully aligned by SMFs of around 1.4 T (<a href=\"#bib17\">Maret, 1990</a>)."

                        "text": "Mitotic spindles comprise both microtubules and chromosomes, but most studies of their potential response to magnetic fields have focused on microtubules. Multiple studies have shown that purified microtubules can be aligned by moderate and high SMFs and the alignment effect increases significantly with magnetic field strength (<a href=\"#bib37\">Vassilev et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bras et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Glade and Tabony, 2005</a>). This is due to the diamagnetic anisotropy of tubulin and microtubules (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bras et al., 2014</a>). In addition, tubulin assembly in vitro was disordered by a 10\u2013100 nT hypogeomagnetic field (natural geomagnetic field is usually around 50000 nT/0.5 Gauss) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). However, whether SMF can change the mitotic spindle orientation in a cell has never been reported. Denegre et al found that 16.7 T large gradient SMFs can affect the division orientation of Xenopus eggs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Denegre et al., 1998</a>). They proposed that SMF may affect the orientation of astral microtubules and/or spindles, which was theoretically proved later by Valles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Valles, 2002</a>), but no experimental evidence has been provided so far to prove this hypothesis. Although the importance of aster microtubules in spindle orientation determination in some types of cells is well known (<a href=\"#bib20\">Palmer et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Shaw et al., 1997</a>), the metaphase spindles still can orient themselves parallel to the substrate in the absence of aster microtubules in both Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and human cervical cancer HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lazaro-Dieguez et al., 2015</a>). In addition, the spindle orientation is controlled by multiple signaling proteins, microtubules and associated proteins, as well as actin and associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib33\">Toyoshima and Nishida, 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Woolner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Thaiparambil et al., 2012</a>). Although a few reports in recent years showed that the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton in interphase cells could be affected by 7\u201317 T ultra-high SMFs in some cell types (<a href=\"#bib35\">Valiron et al., 2005</a>), information about the mitotic spindle was not provided. Therefore, the theoretical prediction of the SMF effect on spindle orientation in cells has not been experimentally tested."

To accommodate cells in the ultra-high field magnet we constructed a custom cell incubation system using two sample holders that could fit inside the new 32 mm bore ultra-high field magnets in the Chinese High Magnetic Field Laboratory (CHMFL, China). This platform provides accurate temperature and gas control for animal and human cells as well as some small model animals."

However, the spindle orientation after strong SMF exposure had never been experimentally investigated. Using immunofluorescence analysis of cells fixed immediately after they were taken out of the magnet, we found that mitotic spindle orientation was perturbed by 27 T SMF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In sham incubated or control cells, the mitotic spindle axis is usually parallel to the tissue culture plate or coverslip (\u2018lateral\u2019) while the 27 T magnetic field increased the percentage of spindles that were not parallel to the coverslip (\u2018non-lateral\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). We separately measured metaphase spindles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>) as well as prometaphase and metaphase spindles together (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and both results showed that non-lateral spindles were increased by 27 T SMF. We also examined lower magnetic field intensities for their effect on spindle orientation. The 0.05 T and 1 T SMFs were provided by permanent magnets placed in regular incubators (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We found that 4 hr of exposure does not increase the non-lateral spindles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>) as 27 T SMF. We also tested 9 T SMF provided by a superconducting magnet (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>) and found that 4 hr of 9 T exposure does not increase the non-lateral spindles either (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). However, although exposure for a prolonged time of 3 days to 0.05 T or 1 T SMFs still had no effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 3</a>), 9 T SMF treatment for 3 days could perturb spindle orientation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 4</a>). In contrast, 0.05 T and 1 T SMFs had no effect on spindle orientation even after 7 days of exposure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 5</a>). Therefore the effect of SMF on spindle orientation was field intensity-dependent and time-dependent. Ultra-high SMF of 27 T could change spindle orientation in 4 hr but 9 T SMF need 3 days to show effects."

As a start to distinguish these effects, we aligned coverslips in the same axis as the magnetic field direction, so the field should only change orientation in the plane of the coverslip (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). We also added another non-transformed human retinal pigment epithelial cell line RPE1 to the experiment to see whether the effects we observed are cell specific (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Synchronization was also used to enrich mitotic cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We grouped the spindles into three different groups based on their orientation relative to the field direction: parallel to the magnetic field, normal to the magnetic field and other (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Interestingly, spindle orientation was different in prometaphase cells vs. metaphase cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In the 27 T SMF treated group, prometaphase cells tended to orient with their spindle long axis in parallel with the field direction, while metaphase cells tended to orient with the spindle long axis normal to the field direction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Synchronized and unsynchronized cells responded similarly (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) so we combined data from both synchronized and unsynchronized cells for statistical analysis. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>) and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> (<a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>), 27 T SMF had similar orientation effects on CNE-2Z and RPE1 spindles. <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> shows the Cosinus of spindle angle. The main difference between cells in prometaphase and metaphase is the organization of chromosomes, which are distributed in prometaphase and tightly aligned in metaphase. We suspect this difference accounts for the differential response to magnetic fields."

In this drug, many mitotic cells exhibited highly disorganized chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Then we measured the spindle length, chromosome distribution, metaphase plate width (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) as well as the angle between spindle long axis and the magnetic field/gravity direction in Adobe Photoshop. After quantifying four independent coverslips for both CNE-2Z and RPE1 cells, we found that the chromosome distribution in spindles seemed to affect the angle between spindle long axis and the magnetic field/gravity direction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The preferred spindle orientation relative to the field differed between cells that have well aligned chromosomes and misaligned chromosomes, and that this difference was significant (p&lt;0.01 in RPE1 cells and p&lt;0.05 in CNE-2Z cells) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, <a href=\"#SD12-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 3</a>). This indicates that chromosomes play a major role in spindle orientation in response to SMFs. Spindles with misaligned chromosomes tend to align with the spindle long axis in parallel with the field direction while spindles with well aligned chromosomes tend to align their metaphase plate in parallel with the field direction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Not surprisingly, lower magnetic fields of 1 T or 9 T treatment for 4 hr did not affect the spindle orientation (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

When the field is oriented normal to the substrate, magnetic torques on both microtubules and chromatin may combine to re-orient spindles away from the surface plane, opposing torques on astral microtubules that promote the normal orientation. Application of the magnetic field parallel to the coverslip allowed us to discriminate torques on chromatin vs. microtubules, and in this case it appears that torques on well aligned chromatin dominated, aligning spindles preferentially with their microtubules normal to the field, and their metaphase plate parallel to the field (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). Our result is opposite to that proposed by Denegre et al, who studied Xenopus egg cleavage in 16.7 T high magnetic fields and theoretically proposed that the orientation of spindle in magnetic field is a result of the balance between aster microtubules and spindle microtubules (<a href=\"#bib5\">Denegre et al., 1998</a>). They did not directly image spindles, but we note opposite results in the two systems might depend on huge size-scaling differences between the two systems we used. The cleavage plane in Xenopus eggs is oriented by huge microtubule asters with almost mm dimensions, while the amount of chromatin is the same as a mitotic cell. In contrast, the ratio of chromatin to microtubules is much larger in human somatic cells. Theoretical calculation predicted that the highly compacted mitotic chromosomes could be fully aligned by magnetic fields at around 1.4 T (<a href=\"#bib17\">Maret, 1990</a>). Therefore the metaphase plate composed of chromosomes likely dominated the SMF-induced orientation in normal-sized somatic cells."

The torque of a substance is equal to the product of magnetic field intensity and the magnetic susceptibility of the object, in which the susceptibility could also be field-dependent and can be Taylor expanded. This means that the torque could be parabolically proportional to the magnetic field strength. Thus, a high field has much more severe impact than a low field as far as field-induced alignment is concerned, and the relationship is not linear. Although there are various potential concerns for the safety issue of the high magnetic fields, the known biological effects of high fields of above 10 T are limited. There are only a few studies that have investigated the animal or human cells at\u00a0\u226510 T. Nakahara et al and Zhao et al showed that 10 T or 13 T SMFs did not have obvious effects on the human-hamster hybrid (<i>A</i>L) cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or human primary skin fibroblasts (AG1522) cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nakahara et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>); Denegre et al found that 16.7 T large gradient SMFs can affect the division of Xenopus eggs, which is presumed to act through astral microtubules and spindles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Denegre et al., 1998</a>); the Shang group found that 12-16-12T large gradient SMFs can affect microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (MACF1) expression and its association with cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib23\">Qian et al., 2009</a>) as well as osteoblast ultrastructure and cell viability by disrupting collagen I or Febronectin/\u03b1\u03b21 integrin in human osteoblast-like cell lines (<a href=\"#bib24\">Qian et al., 2013</a>); Valiron et al used 17 T, the highest SMF strength applied on cells so far and they did not observe strong cell killing effects (<a href=\"#bib35\">Valiron et al., 2005</a>). Instead, they found that the cytoskeleton of interphase mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3 cells and human cervical cancer HeLa cells can be affected by 17 T SMF. Here we found that 27 T SMF does not have an immediate cell killing effects on human CNE-2Z and RPE1 cells but it changes the mitotic spindle orientation and morphology."

The spindles align with their long axis vertical to the field direction and their metaphase plate parallel to the field direction are different from our prediction. We thought the microtubules within the spindle would align with the magnetic field direction so that the spindle would also align with the field. However, it has been shown that the mitotic chromosomes have electromagnetic properties (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao and Zhan, 2012</a>). Although the chromosomes alignment in the magnetic field has not been experimentally shown, calculation predicted that the chromosomes could be fully aligned with the magnetic field as long as the field is above 1.4 T (<a href=\"#bib17\">Maret, 1990</a>). Based on theoretical calculation, Valles also proposed that the direction of mitotic spindle alignment in the magnetic field depends on how the diamagnetic anisotropies of its individual components, including microtubules and chromosomes, align within it (<a href=\"#bib36\">Valles, 2002</a>). Denegre et al\u2019s results about Xenopus egg division shows that the cleavage plane, which is perpendicular to the spindle long axis, tend to parallel with the magnetic field direction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Denegre et al., 1998</a>). Xenopus eggs have very different long astral microtubules, which composed a large portion of the whole cell. In contrast, the cells used in our study as well as most human somatic cells have much less astral microtubules and much bigger spindle microtubules compared to Xenopus eggs. Since both astral and spindle microtubules, as well as chromosomes respond to magnetic field, their relative contribution will be critical to determine the final outcome in a given cell type."

Here we examined the mitotic spindles in 27 T ultra-high SMF treated human CNE-2Z and RPE1 cells and found that the spindle orientation is indeed affected and the direction is dependent on the chromosome alignment. This provides a powerful tool to study spindle orientation related questions in developmental biology, such as cell fate, tissue architecture, and cancer biology."

The device consists of two coaxial non-magnetic stainless steel tubes. The outer diameter of the outer tube (OT) is 30 mm and the inner diameter of the inner tube (IT) is 22.4 mm. To investigate the biological effect of the magnetic field provided by The WM4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we designed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and constructed a set of biological sample incubation system (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), with accurate temperature, gas and humidity control. A non-magnetic stainless steel tube with 10 mm outer diameter was used as a shaft and was inserted into the inner space of the IT. We have used a rubber O-ring to hold the shaft and sealed the inner space of the IT. A sample house and a Teflon concentricity spacer were fixed on the shaft. The concentricity spacer was used to make sure that the shaft and the sample house are coaxial with the IT. Because the shaft was held by the rubber O-ring, it can be moved on axial easily to adjust the position of the sample house in the WM. A PT100 near the samples was used as a temperature sensor and connected to a temperature display to monitor the temperature of the samples. The temperature of the samples can be controlled by thermal conduction from the temperature controlled water, which flow through the space between the IT and OT. By adjusting the temperature of the water, the temperature of the samples can be controlled precisely. To adjust the atmosphere of the sample house, the air with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with temperature and humidity control was introduced by the shaft."

We then collected many low magnification images to provide reliable statistics. RPE1 and CNE-2Z cells were plated onto the pre-cut coverslips 24 hr prior to the assay. Cells were then treated with RO-3306 (10 \u03bcM) for 21 hr to arrest cells at late G2 phase. After washing with warm PBS for three times, cells were subsequently treated with MG-132 (20 \u03bcM) or CENP-E inhibitor (GSK923295, 1 \u03bcM) for another 6 hr to arrest cells in metaphase or to produce misaligned chromosomes. Magnetic field was applied during the last 4 hr."

What would help this part would be to relate the strength of the field to expected values of the torque exert based on estimation of DNA / MTs diamagnetism, needed to rotate the spindle. In addition, the dosage test of SMF strength is only performed for cells plated perpendicular to the SMF, and not using the assay in which the coverslip is parallel to the magnetic field, which is a much better measure of the studied effect. This should not be difficult to perform and should be added to the manuscript."

Microtubules have been shown to align in vitro under magnetic fields, but this is the first time that spindle orientation under magnetic fields is studied. The authors mainly find that spindles orient perpendicular to the applied magnetic field, which is attributed to the chromosomes aligning parallel to the magnetic field, although the evidence for that is a bit unclear from <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> (which is difficult to interpret and seems to suggest there is no change between wham and 27 T conditions). This evidence is consistent with the fact that perpendicularly aligned spindles have a slightly increased width as compared to parallel aligned spindles (obtained when chromosomes are misaligned). In summary, the aligning torque acting on chromosomes is larger than in spindles, resulting in the perpendicular alignment of spindles with respect to the magnetic field orientation. This also suggests that the chromosome-spindle interactions are strong enough to rotate the whole spindle. It would be interesting to know how these results change in larger spindles where the chromosome-spindle microtubule connections may be indirect. The ability of turning spindles is potentially interesting when used to investigate cleavage positioning during development."

What would help this part would be to relate the strength of the field to expected values of the torque exert based on estimation of DNA / MTs diamagnetism, needed to rotate the spindle. In addition, the dosage test of SMF strength is only performed for cells plated perpendicular to the SMF, and not using the assay in which the coverslip is parallel to the magnetic field, which is a much better measure of the studied effect. This should not be difficult to perform and should be added to the manuscript.</i>"

Since the magnetic torque depends on the magnetic field intensity and the magnetic susceptibility of the object so that it was not surprising to see multiple studies showing that the magnetic field strength is the key factor that determines the bioeffects of SMFs. For example, in 1993, Higashi et al. showed that 1 T SMF had only detectable alignment effect on erythrocytes while 4 T high SMF induced almost 100% alignment (Higashi et al. 1993). In 2011, Zhao et al. found that 8.5 T SMF could decrease the ATP level in AL cells but 1 T or 4 T SMFs could not (<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/bem.20617/abstract\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/bem.20617/abstract</a>. DOI: 10.1002/bem.20617). The torque of a substance is equal to the product of magnetic field intensity and the magnetic susceptibility of the object, in which the susceptibility could also be field-dependent and can be Taylor expanded. This means that the torque could be parabolically proportional to the magnetic field strength. Thus, a high field has much more severe impact than a lower field and this relationship is not linear. We have added this information to the discussion part of the revised manuscript."

Valles et al. predicted that \u201cit seems reasonable to presume that fields in excess of 10 T can align the MS\u201d, which contains mainly microtubule and chromosomes. However, in their calculation, the contribution of chromosomes was not included, which is vertical to the spindle long axis so that they add an \u201cantagonizing\u201d effect. This alone indicates that it would require more than 10 T to rotate the spindle structure. Furthermore, based on the calculation in Maret G\u2019s paper, 1.4 T SMF could align the mitotic chromosome (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0921452690900778\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0921452690900778</a>). When the chromosomes are combined with spindle microtubules, the final orientation of the whole spindle in the SMF will be determined by the balance between microtubules and the chromosomes. In addition, the whole spindle is also restricted inside the cell by aster microtubules as well as other surrounding factors, which make it even harder to rotate the spindle. Therefore it is not too surprising that the spindle orientation in cells need such a high SMF."
