                    "text": "The small molecule EMD 57033 has been shown to stimulate the actomyosin ATPase activity and contractility of myofilaments. Here, we show that EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain. EMD 57033-binding protects myosin against heat stress and thermal denaturation. In the presence of EMD 57033, ATP hydrolysis, coupling between actin and nucleotide binding sites, and actin affinity in the presence of ATP are increased more than 10-fold. Addition of EMD 57033 to heat-inactivated \u03b2-cardiac myosin is followed by refolding and reactivation of ATPase and motile activities. In heat-stressed cardiomyocytes expression of the stress-marker atrial natriuretic peptide is suppressed by EMD 57033. Thus, EMD 57033 displays a much wider spectrum of activities than those previously associated with small, drug-like compounds. Allosteric effectors that mediate refolding and enhance enzymatic function have the potential to improve the treatment of heart failure, myopathies, and protein misfolding diseases."

Here, we show that EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain. EMD 57033-binding protects myosin against heat stress and thermal denaturation. In the presence of EMD 57033, ATP hydrolysis, coupling between actin and nucleotide binding sites, and actin affinity in the presence of ATP are increased more than 10-fold. Addition of EMD 57033 to heat-inactivated \u03b2-cardiac myosin is followed by refolding and reactivation of ATPase and motile activities. In heat-stressed cardiomyocytes expression of the stress-marker atrial natriuretic peptide is suppressed by EMD 57033. Thus, EMD 57033 displays a much wider spectrum of activities than those previously associated with small, drug-like compounds. Allosteric effectors that mediate refolding and enhance enzymatic function have the potential to improve the treatment of heart failure, myopathies, and protein misfolding diseases."

To retain the conformational flexibility required for their catalytic function, most of these enzymes are only marginally thermodynamically stable. Their \u2018native state\u2019 corresponds to an ensemble of conformers sharing closely related three-dimensional structures (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bartlett and Radford, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Hartl et al., 2011</a>). External stress brought about by changes in pH, temperature, ionic strength, and the composition and concentration of small-molecule ligands affects the transition to the denatured state. The denatured state is characterized by the loss of enzymatic activity and can be described as an ensemble of states with high conformational entropy (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anfinsen and Scheraga, 1975</a>). Denatured enzyme molecules are more likely to be affected by adsorption, aggregation, precipitation, and proteolysis. At the cellular level, their aggregation with one another or with properly functioning proteins leads to deleterious consequences. Their accumulation can interfere with proteasome function, disrupt normal cellular processes by binding critical cell-signaling and cell-trafficking molecules, and trigger signals that result in cell death (<a href=\"#bib5\">Tyedmers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Willis and Patterson, 2013</a>). The resulting proteotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of proteinopathies such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, various forms of amyloidosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Elaborate cellular systems for the maintenance of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) have evolved to prevent the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein aggregates. These comprise approximately 200 general and specialized chaperone components and 600 ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy system components that support protein folding, refolding of stress-denatured enzymes, disaggregation, and proteolytic degradation of irreversibly misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Nalepa et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Tyedmers et al., 2010</a>)."

In addition to their role as molecular motors driving the stiffening and contraction of muscles, they contribute to a wide range of functions. In the case of myosin, the negative consequences of misfolding are amplified by the formation of roadblock-like, strongly-bound complexes with their actin filament tracks. Aberrant myosin activity and proteostasis contribute to hereditary skeletal myopathies, cardiomyopathies, and various disorders of the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib10\">Oldfors, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Walsh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Getty and Pearce, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Getty et al., 2011</a>). In the course of investigations to identify small-molecule ligands that stabilize myosin against thermal denaturation, we identified the thiadiazinone derivative EMD 57033 as a potent mediator of myosin folding. EMD 57033 is the positive optical isomer of the racemate EMD 53998. The negative isomer, EMD 57439, acts as a potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gambassi et al., 1993</a>). EMD 57033 displays only minimal phosphodiesterase III inhibitory effects and has been described to act both as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitizer and activator of the actomyosin interaction (<a href=\"#bib13\">Beier et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ferroni et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gambassi et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Solaro et al., 1993</a>). Studies with EMD 57033 performed in dogs, with heart failure induced through long-term tachycardia pacing, show potent positive inotropic effects, reduced oxygen cost of contraction, and enhanced diastolic chamber performance (<a href=\"#bib15\">Senzaki et al., 2000</a>). It has been postulated that the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitization is closely linked to EMD 57033-induced changes in myosin cross-bridge kinetics that interfere with normal troponin\u2013tropomyosin regulation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Solaro et al., 1993</a>). Here, we provide evidence indicating that EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain near the base of the lever arm. In addition to increasing motility, force production, and thermal stability of native myosin, binding of EMD 57033 to heat-inactivated myosin induces refolding and reactivation of ATPase activity and motility. Our findings demonstrate that small molecules such as EMD 57033 can stabilize, enhance the activity of and correct stress-associated misfolding of globular enzymes. Pharmacological chaperones with the activity profile of EMD 57033 open the door to a new class of therapeutic drugs and the production of commercially viable biosensors, as described in the \u2018Discussion\u2019."

Direct binding of EMD 57033 to the motor domain was observed for <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> (<i>Dd</i>) myosin-2 and myosin-5 motor domain constructs but not for <i>Dd</i> myosin-1B, <i>Dd</i> myosin-1C, <i>Dd</i> myosin-1D, and <i>Dd</i> myosin-1E motor domain constructs. Myosin constructs that bind EMD 57033 display increased basal and actin-activated ATPase activity in the presence of the compound. The most potent interaction was observed with \u03b2-cardiac myosin with half-maximal activation (AC<sub>50</sub>) observed at 7.0 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5M EMD 57033 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Neither binding nor activation was observed for the (\u2212)-enantiomer EMD 57439 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The consequences of EMD 57033 binding on the turnover of ATP by actin-activated \u03b2-cardiac myosin were followed in single-turnover experiments. Using the extrinsic fluorescence probe 2\u2019-/3\u2019-O-(N\u2019-methylanthraniloyl)-ATP (mantATP) instead of ATP as substrate, we observed signal changes that can be attributed to three phases. The initial fast rise of fluorescence reflects the binding of the ATP analogue to the myosin active site, the following plateau phase monitors the duration of the hydrolysis reaction, and the third phase, corresponding to a decrease in fluorescence signal intensity, monitors the rate of product release. In the presence of EMD 57033, we observed an approximately twofold net increase in the rate of ATP turnover (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

The observed deviation results from incomplete folding, the presence of impurities, and the stress-induced partial loss of function during purification and storage. In the case of myosin, the amplitude of the fast rise in fluorescence intensity that follows binding of mantATP can be used to estimate the fraction of functional protein by active site titration (<a href=\"#bib16\">Tsiavaliaris et al., 2002</a>). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> shows the results of active site titrations for four typical preparations of \u03b2-cardiac myosin and a <i>Dd</i> myosin-2 motor domain construct. Dependent on the type of myosin, purification conditions, and length of storage, the fraction of active myosin heads varies between 32% and 92%. The fraction of active sites increased to 87\u201398% for the same enzyme preparations following the addition of EMD 57033. The increase in the number of binding-competent active sites is followed by a correlated increase in myosin ATPase activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). In addition to the apparent conversion of inactive to catalytically competent myosin, ATPase activities measured in the presence of EMD 57033 correlate with the total number of myosin heads rather than the initial number of active myosin heads. Moreover, the measured ATPase activities exceed the values expected for a 100% active population of myosin heads by 30\u201350% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

In addition, the fraction of moving filaments increased from &lt;75% to &gt;95%. To examine whether EMD 57033 affects force production by \u03b2-cardiac myosin as well, we performed frictional loading experiments (<a href=\"#bib17\">Greenberg and Moore, 2010</a>). In initial experiments, we determined the minimal concentration of \u03b1-actinin molecules that generate sufficient load to stall the movement of actin filaments for a given surface density of myosin heads. In the presence of EMD 57033, the \u03b1-actinin concentration required to stall filament movement increased from 8 \u00b5g/ml to \u226512 \u00b5g/ml (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Next, we generated in vitro motility flow cells with actin filaments held at stall force. The addition of 25 \u03bcM EMD 57033 to these flow cells restarts filament movement. The time-dependence of the recovery of motile activity is best fit by a hyperbola.

The binding site of EMD 57033 in the human \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor domain was further defined by molecular docking experiments in combination with direct binding studies using myosin motor domain constructs with alterations in the predicted binding region. Initial blind docking to homology models of the \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor domain in the post-rigor state indicated preferred binding of the drug to a region near the small N-terminal, SH3-like \u03b2barrel subdomain. Important contacts are predicted to involve the SH3-like subdomain (residues 34\u201372) and two \u03b1-helices (residues 20\u201328 and 98\u2013111). The mode of binding and the orientation of EMD 57033 in this pocket were further analyzed using a flexible, targeted docking procedure. Rearrangements in the side chains of residues Arg29 and Lys34 are predicted to bring these two amino acids into the close vicinity of polar groups in EMD 57033. The identified binding pocket exhibits a Y shape, supporting two slightly different clusters of binding poses of EMD 57033 with predicted binding free energies in the range of \u221211 to \u221212 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>. The sets of binding poses differ mainly in the orientation of the dimethylated catechol group, occupying either of the two possible branches of the Y, while the thiadiazinone moiety appears little affected and resides in the root of the Y shaped cavity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Potential residues involved in the binding of the thiadiazinone and tetrahydroquinoline moieties of the compound include Arg23, Asp85, Lys86, Asp107, Arg108, and Ser111. The dimethylated catechol moiety is mainly bound by residues Lys34, Lys48, and Gln79, and thus, interacts with the SH3-like \u03b2-barrel. The contribution of residues from the SH3-like \u03b2-barrel to EMD 57033 binding is in good agreement with our observation that all class-1 myosins tested, which lack this subdomain, fail to bind EMD 57033 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To verify that the SH3-like \u03b2-barrel is necessary to mediate EMD 57033 binding, we performed direct binding, ATPase, and in vitro motility assays with <i>Dd</i> myosin-2 \u0394SH3, a recombinant motor domain construct that lacks this subdomain (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fujita-Becker et al., 2006</a>). We observed neither binding of EMD 57033 to <i>Dd</i> myosin-2 \u0394SH3 nor EMD 57033-induced activation of the constructs chemomechanical activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Further studies using point mutations that eliminate key residues predicted to interact with EMD 57033 are needed to confirm the binding site."

                                "text": "To gain a better understanding of its mechanism of action, we examined the effect of EMD 57033-binding on the kinetic activity of the myosin motor. The effect of EMD 57033 on individual steps of the ATPase cycle of \u03b2-cardiac myosin was analyzed with the help of transient kinetic measurements and evaluated according to the model shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, Scheme 1. Upon addition of 25 \u00b5M EMD 57033 to \u03b2-cardiac myosin, we observed a 1.6-fold increase in k<sub>cat</sub>, the maximum rate of ATP turnover, and a 10-fold decrease in K<sub>M(actin)</sub>, the F-actin concentration necessary for half-maximal activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The extent to which coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites is improved in the presence of EMD 57033 is indicated by the resulting 16-fold increase in the apparent second-order rate constant (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M(actin)</sub>) for the actin-activated ATPase activity (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Fast mixing of excess ATP with \u03b2-cardiac myosin results in an increase of the protein\u2019s intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The kinetic model predicts the double exponential \u2018behavior\u2019 of the observed transients to be associated with two discrete processes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The fast process corresponds to the binding of ATP to the active site. The rate of the slow process saturates at ATP concentrations above 100 \u00b5M and can be attributed to the ATP hydrolysis step (<a href=\"#bib19\">Deacon et al., 2012</a>). Accordingly, EMD 57033 triggers a 3.4-fold increase in the second order rate constant for ATP binding (<i>K</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><i>k</i><sub><i>+2</i></sub>), a 3.8-fold increase in the rate of the subsequent conformational change (<i>k</i><sub><i>+2</i></sub>), and a 12.9-fold increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis (<i>k</i><sub><i>+3</i></sub> <i>+ k</i><sub><i>\u22123</i></sub>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Phosphate release is the rate-limiting step of the \u03b2-cardiac myosin actin-activated ATPase cycle. It can be monitored by the fluorescence increase that is associated with the much faster binding of phosphate to the A197C mutant of <i>Escherichia coli</i> phosphate binding protein, labeled at Cys197 with the thiol reactive coumarin dye MDCC (<a href=\"#bib20\">Brune et al., 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The observed transients in the absence and presence of EMD 57033 were best fitted by single exponential functions. The resulting values for <b>k</b><sub><b>+4</b></sub> indicate a 1.7-fold increase in the presence of the small compound. The subsequent ADP-release step (<i>k</i><sub><i>\u2212D</i></sub>, <b>k</b><sub><b>\u2212AD</b></sub>) appears unaffected by EMD 57033-binding (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

The T<sub>m</sub> measured for the <i>Dd</i> myosin-2 motor domain corresponds to 45.6 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C in the absence of nucleotide and 52.7 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C in the presence of 400 \u00b5M Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP\u2022BeF<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ponomarev et al., 2000</a>).

The fraction of myosin that is able to bind mantATP drops to below 32% when the temperature is raised to 49\u00b0C for more than 5 min. Incubation for 10 min at 51\u00b0C removes the myosin completely and irreversibly from the soluble fraction. Preincubation of the myosin with 25 \u03bcM EMD 57033 before exposure to heat-stress prevents precipitation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, insert). Moreover, based on the amplitude of the rise in mantATP fluorescence, the competence of \u03b2-cardiac myosin to bind nucleotide is preserved to more than 91% after 5-min incubation at 49\u00b0C and to approximately 82% after 10-min incubation at 49\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The apparent large reduction in the rate of mantATP binding and the extended plateau phase suggest that the observed transients report a rate-limiting step in the refolding of the \u03b2-cardiac myosin motor rather than the rate of nucleotide binding (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> for comparison). This view is supported by experiments that monitor the recovery of basal activity over a 2 hr period (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To obtain more detailed information about the kinetics of the EMD 57033-mediated refolding reaction, we performed three sets of experiments recording the time and concentration dependence of EMD 57033-mediated increases in the fraction of myosin molecules that are able to undergo nucleotide induced conformational changes, hydrolyze ATP, and produce movement in the in vitro motility assay."

EMD 57033 binds to an allosteric pocket in the myosin motor domain. The site appears to be close to the site where cardiac myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil is predicted to bind (<a href=\"#bib25\">Malik et al., 2011</a>). The greater isoform specificity of omecamtiv mecarbil and preliminary results with other compounds suggest that it is feasible to identify compounds with improved properties for the treatment of aberrant myosin motor activity that are derived from thiadiazinone derivatives and unrelated scaffolds. The efficacy of the resulting drugs may be further enhanced by combining them with drugs that increase the abundance and activity of cellular chaperones (<a href=\"#bib4\">Willis and Patterson, 2013</a>). The actin-affinity of cardiac \u03b2-myosin and the coupling efficiency between motor domain and actin filament are increased in the presence of saturating concentrations of EMD 57033. The selective shortening of the lifetime of weakly bound states and the associated increase in the fraction of strongly bound motor domains explain the leftwards shift of the force\u2013pCa relation and the reduced oxygen cost of contractility observed in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Solaro et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kraft and Brenner, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Senzaki et al., 2000</a>).

The resulting proteotoxicity is frequently of equal or greater importance for the clinical expression of the associated disease states as the direct, mutation-induced loss in enzymatic activity. Misfolded proteins including mutation-induced misfolded myosins are known to play a central role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. The role of misfolded proteins in the development of numerous other disorders such as type-2 diabetes and heart failure has become evident in recent years (<a href=\"#bib4\">Willis and Patterson, 2013</a>). Moreover, cardiac dysfunction is a frequent complication associated with elevated body temperature due to fever or hyperthermia (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marijon et al., 2012</a>). It is well known that pathophysiologic alterations of the heart are associated with a decrease in \u03b1-MHC and an increase in \u03b2-MHC expression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mercadier et al., 1983</a>). This is normally associated with an increase in ANP (<a href=\"#bib23\">Aggeli et al., 2002</a>). In fact, ANP levels in the myocardium are greatly augmented in patients with congestive heart failure and animal models of ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ogawa et al., 1995</a>). Such changes are indicative of re-expression of a fetal gene expression program, as it is induced by the \u03b1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hilfiker-Kleiner et al., 2006</a>). Physiological stress such as exercise induces a shift towards \u03b1-cardiac MHC (<a href=\"#bib31\">Allen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Baldwin and Haddad, 2001</a>). EMD 57033 induces hypertrophic growth under normothermic conditions that involves a reduction in \u03b2-MHC without affecting \u03b1-cardiac MHC and thereby changes in the transcriptional regulation that are clearly distinct from phenylephrine-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hilfiker-Kleiner et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, EMD 57033 appears to promote a more physiological type of hypertrophy. This notion is further supported by the observation that ANP expression is not induced in the presence of EMD 57033. In addition, the observed reduction of ANP expression in heat-treated cardiomyocytes suggests that EMD 57033-mediates a reduction in cellular stress responses by stabilizing and refolding denatured MHC proteins."

Prior to molecular docking, the protein models were subjected to geometry optimization using MacroModel (MacroModel, version 9.9; Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2011) and the OPLS2005 force field. Blind and local docking of EMD 57033 was carried out using Autodock4 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Morris et al., 1998</a>), employing the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm. The ligand was prepared and energy-minimized using MacroModel (MacroModel, version 9.9; Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2011) and the OPLS2005 force field, as well as AutodockTools (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sanner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Morris et al., 2009</a>). During flexible docking, the side chains of Arg29 and Lys34 were allowed full conformational flexibility.

While one can quibble with a few of the experiments or their description in this paper, collectively the data provide compelling evidence for the hypothesis that EMD 57033 is a pharmacologic chaperone that stabilizes, enhances the activity of, and corrects stress-associated misfolding of a subset of members of the myosin family comprising a SH3-like Beta barrel domain. I am not aware of another pharmacologic chaperone that can mediate refolding and gain of enhanced function from a denatured protein like EMD 57033 can with myosin."
