Mutation of a highly conserved \u2018gating charge\u2019 residue in the S4 helix (R1H) confers a resting-state H<sup>+</sup> \u2018shuttle\u2019 conductance (G<sub>SH</sub>) in VGCs and Ci VSP, and we now report that R1H is sufficient to reconstitute G<sub>SH</sub> in Hv1 without abrogating G<sub>AQ</sub>. Second-site mutations in S3 (D185A/H) and S4 (N4R) experimentally separate G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> gating, which report thermodynamically distinct initial and final steps, respectively, in the Hv1 activation pathway. The effects of Hv1 mutations on G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> are used to constrain the positions of key side chains in resting- and activated-state VS model structures, providing new insights into the structural basis of VS activation and H<sup>+</sup> transfer mechanisms in Hv1."

Mutation of a highly conserved \u2018gating charge\u2019 residue in the S4 helix (R1H) confers a resting-state H<sup>+</sup> \u2018shuttle\u2019 conductance (G<sub>SH</sub>) in VGCs and Ci VSP, and we now report that R1H is sufficient to reconstitute G<sub>SH</sub> in Hv1 without abrogating G<sub>AQ</sub>. Second-site mutations in S3 (D185A/H) and S4 (N4R) experimentally separate G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> gating, which report thermodynamically distinct initial and final steps, respectively, in the Hv1 activation pathway. The effects of Hv1 mutations on G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> are used to constrain the positions of key side chains in resting- and activated-state VS model structures, providing new insights into the structural basis of VS activation and H<sup>+</sup> transfer mechanisms in Hv1."

Hv1 lacks a separate effector domain, and instead mediates a depolarization-activated H<sup>+</sup>-selective \u2018aqueous\u2019 conductance (G<sub>AQ</sub>) that is intrinsic to the VS domain (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ramsey et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sasaki et al., 2006</a>).

Congruous with the X-ray structure of an Hv1-based chimeric protein (mHv1cc; pdb: 3WKV), Hv1 homology models generally agree that F<sup>2.50</sup> (F150) is appropriately located to participate in the formation of a hydrophobic barrier within the central crevice (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wood et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chamberlin et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kulleperuma et al., 2013</a>). Mutation of an acidic residue in S1 (D<sup>1.51</sup>/D112) that is selectively conserved in Hv1 and VSPs causes large positive shifts in the G<sub>AQ</sub>-V relation and compromises H<sup>+</sup> selectivity (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Musset et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Berger and Isacoff, 2011</a>), consistent with its predicted location near F<sup>2.50</sup>/F150 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wood et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chamberlin et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kulleperuma et al., 2013</a>). Ionization of D<sup>1.51</sup>/D112 was suggested to be necessary for H<sup>+</sup> transfer via G<sub>AQ</sub>, but the necessity of an anion at this position to maintain exquisite H<sup>+</sup> selectivity suggests that the side chain is likely to remain ionized when G<sub>AQ</sub> is open (<a href=\"#bib47\">Musset et al., 2011</a>). The permeability of D<sup>1.51</sup>/D112 mutants, including D112H and D112K, to solution anions (Cl<sup>-</sup>, MeSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and possibly OH<sup>-</sup>) strongly argues that the VS central crevice is well-hydrated in the Hv1 activated-state conformation, consistent with the hypothesis that H<sup>+</sup> conduction occurs in a water wire and does not require explicit ionization of protein side chains (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>)."

Computational approaches that explicitly define the proton hold promise for elucidating H<sup>+</sup> transfer mechanism(s), but their sensitivity to subtle geometric differences in various models reinforces the need for rigorous experimental testing of candidate model structures in advance of their implementation for calculating electronic structure. Experimental approaches that can be used to map the locations of functionally important residue side chains with high spatial resolution are therefore needed. Although G<sub>AQ</sub> measurement is a potentially powerful tool for exploring structure-function relationships in Hv1, the absence of G<sub>AQ</sub> in most VS domain proteins limits its more widespread implementation. Furthermore, experimental validation of electrically silent resting-state VS domain conformations, which may serve as useful controls for theoretical studies, is problematic."

The effects of second-site mutations in the background of R1H impose tight spatial constraints on the positions of key residue side chains. We present new resting-state Hv1 VS domain model structures that are distinct from previous models and fully consistent with available experimental data."

Our results are similar, but not identical, to Shaker R1H (<a href=\"#bib72\">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</a>). For example, the time courses of G<sub>SH</sub> opening and closing in Hv1 R1H-N4R (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) are evidently faster than Shaker and <i>Ci</i> VSP R1H mutants (<a href=\"#bib72\">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Villalba-Galea et al., 2013</a>), possibly indicating that G<sub>SH</sub> gating in Hv1 does not require substantial conformational rearrangement of the protein backbone. In contrast, the time course of G<sub>AQ</sub>-mediated I<sub>STEP</sub> and I<sub>TAIL</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2A</a>) are comparatively slow, suggesting that activation and deactivation gating requires more extensive protein conformational rearrangements. G<sub>SH</sub> gating and G<sub>AQ</sub> block by N4R are likely to involve rapid local changes in the orientation of side chains that lie in or near the focused electrical field, and G<sub>SH</sub> gating phenomenologically resembles pore block by a permeant ion. G<sub>\u03a9</sub> gating in R1A/C/S mutant Shaker channels is similarly attributed to block by the protein-associated side chains of S4 Arg residues, which permeate the \u2018gating pore\u2019 during VS activation. Consistent with the small apparent gating valence (0.5\u20130.7 <i>e</i><sub>0</sub>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) estimated from Boltzmann fits, local reorientation of the imidazole side chain in the introduced His at R1 could account for the voltage dependence of G<sub>SH</sub> gating."

To circumvent this limitation, we reasoned that an analysis of the first derivatives of G<sub>STEP</sub>-V relations (<i>d</i>G<sub>STEP</sub>/<i>d</i>V) could be a useful alternative approach. First, we simulated ideal G<sub>STEP</sub>-V relations using a Boltzmann function (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,C</a>). As expected, a plot of <i>d</i>G<sub>STEP</sub>/<i>d</i>V vs. the applied potential (<i>d</i>G<sub>STEP</sub>/<i>d</i>V-V) yields a bell-shaped distribution (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B,D</a>). Fitting the data to a Gaussian function allows us to estimate the voltage at which the curve peaks (V<sub>PEAK</sub>). Fitted V<sub>PEAK</sub> values are correlated to V<sub>0.5</sub> in simulated G<sub>SH</sub> and G<sub>AQ</sub> Boltzmann distributions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>).

In Hv1 E, D174/D<sup>3.50</sup> interacts primarily with R2/R<sup>4.50</sup>, rather than R1H (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), which is consistent with our observation that the G<sub>AQ</sub>-V relation is slightly shifted toward negative potentials. The Coulombic interaction between R1/R<sup>4.47</sup> and D174/D<sup>3.50</sup>appears to\u00a0help to stabilize a G<sub>AQ</sub>-closed, VS resting-state conformation. R1/R<sup>4.47</sup> also forms a salt bridge with D112/D<sup>1.51</sup> in Hv1 D (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), but\u00a0experimental data show that\u00a0the main effect of D112 mutations is to shift the G<sub>AQ</sub>-V relation toward positive potentials, suggesting that D112 plays a more important role in activated-state stabilization than resting-state stabilization (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with this interpretation, we find that although\u00a0D112 makes a stable electrostatic interaction with a protonated nitrogen atom of the R1H imidazole ring in Hv1 E, R1H only moderately shifts the G<sub>AQ</sub>-V relation (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Later we explore\u00a0possible activated-state interactions between D112 and R3/R<sup>4.53</sup> (Figure 6A).\u00a0Although Coulombic interactions involving D112\u00a0are reorganized in Hv1 E compared to Hv1 D (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>), distances between C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms of selected atoms (D112/D<sup>1.51</sup>, F150/F<sup>2.50</sup>, D185/D<sup>3.61</sup> and R1/R205/R<sup>4.47</sup>) are nonetheless similar (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure\u00a05\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>), illustrating that the VS domain architecture is similarly stable in Hv1 D and Hv1 E models."

In Hv1 FL, D185/D<sup>3.61</sup> is close enough to engage in a Coulombic interaction with R1 and appears to be solvent-accessible (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4F</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), but in mHv1cc, hydrophobic side chains fill the extracellular vestibule and the D<sup>3.61</sup>/D181 carboxylate is tightly packed between non-polar side chains, including F178/F<sup>3.58</sup>, L184/L<sup>3.64</sup>, L197/L<sup>4.43</sup> and L200/L<sup>4.46</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s4\">4A</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4F</a>), and evidently inaccessible to solvent (<a href=\"#bib75\">Takeshita et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with experimental data showing that D185 mutations do not alter G<sub>SH</sub> gating, we observe that D185 is located at the extracellular end of S3 in a solvent-accessible location that is distant from R1 in Hv1 D (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s4\">4F</a>)."

We show here\u00a0that introduction of the N214R (N4R) mutation into Hv1 B does not alter the\u00a0overall structure or stability of the VS domain, and D185/D<sup>3.61</sup> remains close enough to R3 to participate in a stable Coulombic interaction with R3/R<sup>4.53</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As observed previously in Hv1 B (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>), R3/R<sup>4.53</sup> makes a bidentate interaction with D112/D<sup>1.51</sup>and D185/D<sup>3.61</sup>\u00a0in Hv1 B N4R (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, N4R addition allows D112/D<sup>1.51</sup> to form a new salt bridge with N4R (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that may help stabilize the G<sub>AQ</sub>-open conformation; this arrangement is in good agreement with experimental effects of N4R and N4K mutations, which markedly slow the timecourse of I<sub>TAIL</sub> decay (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>). Although we have not explicitly tested this hypothesis using computational approaches, the N4R side chain appears to be appropriately positioned to sense changes in the electrical field that is thought to be focused near F150/F<sup>2.50</sup> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahern and Horn, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</a>). Rapid movement of a cationic N4R terminal amine within the electrical field is consistent with the experimental observation that outward currents carried by G<sub>AQ</sub> exhibit rapid voltage-dependent block/unblock in Hv1 R1H-N4R (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Consistent with a generally accepted model of VS activation (<a href=\"#bib80\">Vargas et al., 2012</a>), we find that the main difference between our experimentally-constrained activated- and resting-state Hv1 VS domain model structures is the position of S4 relative to the S1-S3 bundle, which appears to form a relatively immobile scaffold (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 2A\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). To estimate the amplitude of S4 displacement in resting- vs. activated-state VS domain X-ray and model structures, we measured distances between equivalent atoms after performing structure-based alignments. Comparing C<sub>\u03b1</sub>-C<sub>\u03b1</sub> distances between R1 side chains in Hv1 D or Hv1 E and Hv1 B indicates that the S4 backbone is displaced ~15\u2009\u00c5; somewhat smaller distances (11\u00a0\u00c5\u201313\u2009\u00c5) are measured when Hv1 D is compared to other activated-state structures (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s4\">4</a>). Most of the calculated difference in R1-R1 C<sub>\u03b1</sub> distance is observed in the vertical (<i>z</i>, i.e., membrane normal) axis, but differences in helical tilt and twist are also observed (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6s4\">4</a>). In summary, our comparisons of VS domain structures suggest that the S4 helix is likely to undergo an ~11\u201315\u2009\u00c5 vertical translation during activation of the Hv1 VS domain."

Our results are consistent with previous reports describing G<sub>SH</sub> in other VS domain R1H mutants (<a href=\"#bib72\">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Struyk and Cannon, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Villalba-Galea et al., 2013</a>) but contrast with a previous study in Hv1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kulleperuma et al., 2013</a>). One possible explanation for the discrepancy is that G<sub>SH</sub> is difficult to measure when mutant Hv1 channel expression levels are low, as in the previous study (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kulleperuma et al., 2013</a>), whereas the inducible expression system used here drives the high expression that is evidently necessary to reproducibly measure G<sub>SH</sub>. Importantly, we show that second-site mutations (N4R and D185A or D185H) experimentally separate the G<sub>SH</sub>-V and G<sub>AQ</sub>-V relations, allowing us to simultaneously monitor thermodynamically distinct gating transitions in Hv1. Our experimental approach may therefore be generally useful for probing structure-function relationships in VS domain-containing proteins."

G<sub>SH</sub> in Shaker R1H is also H<sup>+</sup>-selective (<a href=\"#bib72\">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</a>), and the sensitivity of inward resting-state current amplitude to changes in pH<sub>O</sub> indicates that G<sub>SH</sub> in Hv1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), <i>Ci</i> VSP (<a href=\"#bib82\">Villalba-Galea et al., 2013</a>) and Shaker (<a href=\"#bib72\">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</a>) R1H mutants are likely to utilize a shared mechanism. A simple explanation for the available data is that R1H mutations primarily affect side chain pK<sub>a</sub>, allowing channel-like proton shuttling in the resting state without substantially affecting protein structure or VS activation mechanism. R1 mutation to other side chains (i.e., R1A/C/Q/S) confers a resting-state \u2018omega\u2019 conductance (G<sub>\u03a9</sub>) that is permeable to small monovalent cations (Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>) and thus distinct from G<sub>SH</sub> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gosselin-Badaroudine et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Tombola et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Capes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gamal El-Din et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sokolov et al., 2005</a>).

Further studies are also needed to determine whether Hv1 R2H or R3H mutant proteins mediate carrier-like (G<sub>CA</sub>) conducting states similar to those reported in Shaker (<a href=\"#bib71\">Starace and Bezanilla, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Starace et al., 1997</a>). We conclude that G<sub>AQ</sub>, G<sub>SH</sub>, G<sub>\u03a9</sub> and G<sub>CA</sub> reflect distinct types of \u2018gating pore\u2019 conductances (G<sub>GP</sub>), and that each exhibits characteristic gating and ion permeation properties which can be experimentally exploited to interrogate resting-state structure-function relationships."

Hv1 B model construction was published previously (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ramsey et al., 2010</a>). Briefly, homologous sequences were obtained for the target sequences and structures from UniRef100 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bairoch et al., 2005</a>) using non-iterative BLAST (e-value &lt; 10). The two proteins were aligned using MAFFT (<a href=\"#bib32\">Katoh et al., 2002</a>) based on the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix (<a href=\"#bib27\">Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992</a>). Next, a structural profile (i.e. Position-Specific Substitution Matrices - PSSMs) was calculated for the structure and a sequence profile for the target sequence was created. The structural profile was then aligned against the sequence profile using FUGUE (<a href=\"#bib67\">Shi et al., 2001</a>). The resulting structure-sequence alignment was manually adjusted to ensure conservation of key residues, then used as input for MODELLER (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sali and Blundell, 1993</a>) to generate ten models per alignment.

Ionizable residues were predicted to be in the default states at pH 7 based on standard pK<sub>a</sub> values for each residue. We adopted lipid parameters as used previously (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berger et al., 1997</a>). Prior to the production run, a 1 ns equilibration run was performed during which all of the heavy (i.e., not H<sup>+</sup>) protein atoms were harmonically restrained with an isotropic force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>\u22121</sup> nm<sup>\u22121</sup>. Restrained MD runs were performed at 300K for each protein-bilayer system. Finally, all positional restraints were removed and 20 ns duration production run simulations were performed for each system. MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 3.3 (<a href=\"#bib79\">Van Der Spoel et al., 2005</a>), implementing the GROMOS96 force field (<a href=\"http://www.gromos.net\">http://www.gromos.net</a>). Lipid parameters were based on GROMOS96, supplemented with additional bond, angle and dihedral terms (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berger et al., 1997</a>). All energy minimization procedures used &lt; 1000 steps of the\u00a0steepest descent method in order to relax any steric conflicts generated during system setup. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method, with a 12\u2009\u00c5 cutoff for the real space calculation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sagui et al., 2004</a>). A cut-off of 12\u2009\u00c5 was used for the van der Waals interactions. The simulations were performed at constant temperature, pressure and number of particles. The temperature of the protein, lipid and solvent (waters and ions) were separately coupled using the Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat (<a href=\"#bib53\">Popov and Knyazev, 2014</a>) at 310\u00b0K, with a coupling constant, \u03c4<sub>T</sub> = 0.1 ps.

The LINCS algorithm (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hess, 2008</a>) was used throughout to constrain bond lengths. The time step for integration in both simulations was 2 fs.

WT and mutant resting- and activated-state models were subsequently imbedded in a POPC membrane and solvated with a 150\u2009mM KCl solution and energy-minimized in order to remove any unfavorable contacts. After energy minimization POPC lipid tails were allowed to equilibrate around the protein for 0.5 ns, after which the system was simulated according the NPT ensemble with harmonic constraints (5 kcal/mol\u00b7\u00c5) applied to the alpha carbons for 1.5 ns. Once the system reached equilibrium, as judged by protein RMSD, stable system volume, and converged energy terms, Hv1-POPC systems were then simulated for 10 ns with the NPT ensemble at 300K. All energy minimizations were carried out in 5000 steps using conjugate gradient and line search algorithms.

Long range electrostatic interactions were calculated using a\u00a0PME method with a 12\u2009\u00c5 cutoff distance.

The authors have done all the right experiments to understand the R1H mutant, the experimental data appear to have been very thoughtfully collected and analyzed, and are of very high quality. The significance of the proton shuttle is that it positions the R1 position of S4 down near the charge transfer Phe in S2 where one could readily imagine protons hopping between external and internal solutions. The authors also create new models for the resting and activated states of Hv1, and these are compared with structures and models of Hv1 and other proteins containing S1-S4 domains. Overall we think the work is appropriate for <i>eLife</i>, but the text and computational components will require careful revision."

Our experience indicates that software packages such as Modeller afford the investigator tremendous latitude at the model-building stage, and potentially important features of candidate model structures are subject to bias resulting from both the selection of different technical parameters and investigator ignorance or preference. We are encouraged by the observations that the models presented here are both stable in an MD environment (and thus energetically feasible) and are evidently superior to models built by other groups in that they are uniquely consistent with experimental data. We feel that atomic models which are validated by directed experiments offer more information content than less rigorously-tested models and X-ray structures determined from proteins subjected to biochemical torture, reconstitution, and crystallization under non-physiological conditions. We are hopeful that our sustained effort to successfully merge experimental and computational approaches will yield a deeper understanding of the structural basis of VS activation and H<sup>+</sup> permeation mechanisms in Hv1."

Indeed, most of the points of concern raised below are statements that are based on experimental observations, not model structures. However, to allay the concerns of the Reviewers, we added Figures showing central crevice water occupancy in Hv1 D and Hv1 E resting-state models during MD simulations.

Without water, the mechanism by which H<sup>+</sup> would manage to cross the thickness of the membrane is difficult to conceive. We showed previously (Ramsey et al., 2010) that ionizable residues throughout Hv1 are dispensable for H<sup>+</sup> conduction, so the possibility that a latent proton wire exists somewhere in the protein and is selectively enabled by R1H seems remote. Another possibility is that protons somehow tunnel through the protein, but we have no way to directly test this hypothesis using conventional experimental approaches. Given that a number of other studies (including Krepkiy et al., 2012) show or imply that VS domains contain substantially hydrated crevices, we infer water is necessary for H<sup>+</sup> shuttling and that this is the simplest explanation for the experimental data."
