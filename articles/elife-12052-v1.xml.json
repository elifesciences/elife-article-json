                    "text": "Adolescents are especially prone to drug addiction, but the underlying biological basis of their increased vulnerability remains unknown. We reveal that translational control by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) accounts for adolescent hypersensitivity to cocaine. In adolescent (but not adult) mice, a low dose of cocaine reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), potentiated synaptic inputs to VTA dopaminergic neurons, and induced drug-reinforced behavior. Like adolescents, adult mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control were more susceptible to cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation and behavior. Conversely, like adults, adolescent mice with increased p-eIF2\u03b1 became more resistant to cocaine's effects. Accordingly, metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD)\u2014whose disruption is postulated to increase vulnerability to drug addiction\u2014was impaired in both adolescent mice and adult mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 mediated translation. Thus, during addiction, cocaine hijacks translational control by p-eIF2\u03b1, initiating synaptic potentiation and addiction-related behaviors. These insights may hold promise for new treatments for addiction."

                    "text": "Adolescents are especially prone to drug addiction, but the underlying biological basis of their increased vulnerability remains unknown. We reveal that translational control by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) accounts for adolescent hypersensitivity to cocaine. In adolescent (but not adult) mice, a low dose of cocaine reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), potentiated synaptic inputs to VTA dopaminergic neurons, and induced drug-reinforced behavior. Like adolescents, adult mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control were more susceptible to cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation and behavior. Conversely, like adults, adolescent mice with increased p-eIF2\u03b1 became more resistant to cocaine's effects. Accordingly, metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD)\u2014whose disruption is postulated to increase vulnerability to drug addiction\u2014was impaired in both adolescent mice and adult mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 mediated translation. Thus, during addiction, cocaine hijacks translational control by p-eIF2\u03b1, initiating synaptic potentiation and addiction-related behaviors. These insights may hold promise for new treatments for addiction."

Since adolescents have a greater capacity than adults to make new proteins, Huang et al. hypothesized that changes in synaptic strength might occur more easily in the brain of adolescents, explaining why they are more likely to become addicted to drugs than adults."

Although some molecular and cellular adaptations associated with drug use have been identified (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bowers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>), the biological basis of heightened vulnerability to substance abuse during adolescence remains elusive. Converging evidence supports the notion that addictive drugs hijack the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying long-term changes in synaptic strength in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system (including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key brain reward area implicated in the development of addiction (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kauer, 2004</a>)) in a way that reinforces drug-seeking behavior (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bowers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kauer and Malenka, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hyman et al., 2006</a>). Addiction has both initiation and maintenance phases (<a href=\"#bib27\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wise and Koob, 2014</a>). Here we focus on the molecular mechanisms underpinning the initial neuronal circuit adaptations caused by addictive drugs because they represent important targets for therapeutic interventions (<a href=\"#bib27\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>) and are thought to contribute to the development of drug addiction (<a href=\"#bib27\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kauer and Malenka, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kalivas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lammel et al., 2014</a>). For instance, drugs of abuse (including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, ethanol, and morphine) <i>all</i> induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons that lasts for several days after exposure (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bowers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lammel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Saal et al., 2003</a>). This LTP, resulting from the insertion of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the postsynaptic membrane, is measured by recording glutamatergic synaptic currents (EPSCs) at positive holding potentials, and is manifested as an increase in the AMPAR/<i>N</i>-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ratio (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD), resulting from the removal of postsynaptic AMPARs, blocks cocaine-induced LTP in VTA DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bellone and L\u00fcscher, 2006</a>). Thus, it has been postulated that impaired mGluR-LTD increases vulnerability to drugs of abuse (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bellone and L\u00fcscher, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">L\u00fcscher and Huber, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Loweth et al., 2013</a>)."

In addition, protein synthesis is also required for cocaine-induced behaviors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sorg and Ulibarri, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kuo et al., 2007</a>). Protein synthesis encompasses three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation is the rate limiting step and a major target for translational control (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buffington et al., 2014</a>). There are two main mechanisms by which translation initiation is controlled. The first is by regulation of the eIF4F complex <i>via</i> the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The second mechanism is by regulating ternary complex formation <i>via</i> phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 blocks general translation, but also results in translational up-regulation of a small subset of select mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5\u2019 untranslated region (5\u2019UTR) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buffington et al., 2014</a>)."

We used the peak amplitudes (at +40 mV) of the AMPAR and NMDAR-mediated components of the EPSCs (isolated as described (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>) and Methods) to calculate the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, an index of the efficacy of synaptic transmission mediated by AMPARs. In adolescent ) mice, a relatively low dose of cocaine (5 mg/kg i.p.) elicited LTP, manifested by an increase in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Strikingly, we found that enhanced LTP in the VTA was mirrored in the behavior of adolescent mice: low doses of cocaine (5\u00a0mg/kg) elicited CPP only in adolescents, but not in adult mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>).

To this end, we measured the activity of key signaling pathways impinging on translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buffington et al., 2014</a>). We found that a low dose of cocaine (5 mg/kg) reduced the amount of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) only in VTA slices from adolescent mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2b</a>).

Importantly, a signle injection of cocaine failed to alter p-eIF2\u03b1 levels in the nucleus accumbens (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), another brain region involved in addiction (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kalivas and Volkow, 2011</a>). Moreover, the lack of effect on other translational signaling pathways in adolescent VTA neurons by the same low dose of cocaine (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d\u2013f</a>) highlights the selective involvement of p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control during the period of heightened adolescent vulnerability to cocaine addiction.

To test this idea, we injected a low dose of cocaine (5\u00a0mg/kg) into adult wild-type (WT) <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/S</sup></i> mice and <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> heterozygous knock-in mice (where a single phosphorylation site at serine 51 is replaced by alanine) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Scheuner et al., 2001</a>). In <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mutant mice, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the VTA (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As predicted, a low dose of cocaine (5\u00a0mg/kg) induced LTP in VTA DA neurons from <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mutant mice but not in VTA DA neurons from WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). In addition, application of a low concentration of cocaine (1 \u03bcM) in vitro was sufficient to induce LTP in VTA DA neurons from <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mutant mice, but not in those from adult WT controls (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with the LTP results, low doses of cocaine (5\u00a0mg/kg) induced CPP only in <i>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup></i> mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Hence, like adolescent mice, adult mice with reduced p-eIF2\u03b1 are more susceptible to cocaine-evoked LTP (both in vivo and in vitro) and drug-induced behavior."

Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 inhibits general protein synthesis rates by binding to and inhibiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B that is required for eIF2 activation. We therefore used a recently-discovered small molecule inhibitor ISRIB (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sidrauski et al., 2013</a>), which potently blocks p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational effects by promoting eIF2B activity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sekine et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sidrauski et al., 2015</a>). Adult WT mice injected with ISRIB (2.5 mg/kg) and a low dose of cocaine (5\u00a0mg/kg) showed both LTP in VTA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) and drug-induced CPP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Note that neither cocaine nor ISRIB alone triggered LTP or CPP in adult WT mice (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results support the notion that reduced p-eIF2\u03b1\u2013mediated translational control renders adult mice more susceptible to the synaptic and behavioral effects of cocaine."

Changes in gene expression in key reward areas have been shown to play a critical role in drug-induced changes in synaptic potentiation and reward-related behavior (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hyman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Robison and Nestler, 2011</a>). Until now, most of the research in this area has focused on how transcriptional control (<i>via</i> key transcription factors, such as \u25b3FosB and CREB) or epigenetic mechanisms (<i>via</i> histone acetylation and methylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs) contribute to addiction-related behavior (<a href=\"#bib33\">Robison and Nestler, 2011</a>). Our focus on translational control was based on several key observations. Compared to the brains of adolescent mice\u2014which are more vulnerable to drugs of abuse\u2014protein synthesis is reduced in the brains of adult mice (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vargas and Castaneda, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hovda et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sun et al., 1995</a>). Furthermore, translational control of gene expression is the ultimate step in the functional output of gene expression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>) and neurons could regulate protein synthesis without altering mRNA synthesis or transport, allowing for local control of protein synthesis at synapses (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holt and Schuman, 2013</a>). Moreover, protein synthesis is required for cocaine-evoked LTP in VTA DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Argilli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yuan et al., 2013</a>), as well as cocaine-induced behavior (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sorg and Ulibarri, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kuo et al., 2007</a>)."

In adolescent, but not in adult mice, a low dose of cocaine selectively lowers eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in the VTA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013b</a>), thereby eliciting LTP and drug-induced behavior. It is noteworthy that we could not detect a significant difference in the baseline phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 between adolescent and adult mice (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). While the precise mechanism by which drugs of abuse lower phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in the VTA is currently under investigation, we hypothesize that drugs of abuse either inhibit the activity and/or expression of one of the eIF2\u03b1 kinases or stimulate the activity of eIF2\u03b1 phosphatases to lower p-eIF2\u03b1 levels in the VTA. We suspect that adolescents are more prone to either (or both) of these processes. Genetic reduction of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation or pharmacologically blunting its effects with ISRIB in adult mice enhances susceptibility to cocaine, mimicking the increased vulnerability of adolescent animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). By contrast, a local increase in p-eIF2\u03b1 in the VTA blocked cocaine-evoked LTP and cocaine-induced behavior in adolescent mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These effects converge on p-eIF2\u03b1\u2013mediated translation of OPHN1, which is selectively synthesized in neurons under conditions where eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated (<a href=\"#bib9\">Di Prisco et al., 2014</a>) and leads to endocytic down-regulation of post-synaptic AMPARs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nadif\u00a0Kasri et al., 2011</a>).

Cocaine induces LTP at VTA DA synapses by inserting new AMPARs into the postsynaptic membrane (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ungless et al., 2001</a>). This process is reversed either by pharmacological or synaptic induction of mGluR-LTD in VTA by removing AMPARs from the post-synaptic DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bellone and L\u00fcscher, 2006</a>). Conversely, reduced mGluR-LTD in the midbrain is postulated to enhance vulnerability to drug addiction (<a href=\"#bib26\">L\u00fcscher and Huber, 2010</a>). Our data provide the first compelling mechanistic evidence that p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control of OPHN1 synthesis is a key mechanism underlying the reversal of cocaine-evoked LTP by mGluR-LTD. Thus, our findings provide a unifying model that explains how the two opposing forms of plasticity (cocaine-induced LTP and mGluR-LTD) are regulated by a single translational control mechanism."

These drug-induced persistent changes on excitatory afferents onto dopamine neurons in the VTA are particularly relevant since they may represent the cellular processes driving the progression from recreational use to chronic drug seeking (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). In addition, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation may also be required for subsequent synaptic adaptation in other mesolimbic reward areas, such as the NAc, in response to chronic exposure to cocaine or after withdrawal."

It is therefore significant that drugs of abuse that act on distinct receptors (cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine and ethanol), and induce LTP (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bowers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">L\u00fcscher and Malenka, 2011</a>) in VTA DA neurons, all reduce p-eIF2\u03b1 in the\u00a0VTA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Taken together with our findings that reduced p-eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational control increases the susceptibility of adolescent mice to cocaine, these observations raise an intriguing possibility that polymorphisms in the eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway could be associated with drug use in humans. Indeed, in an accompanying paper (<a href=\"#bib31\">Placzek et al., 2016</a>), we provide evidence that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation also controls adolescent hypersensitivity to nicotine-evoked synaptic potentiation and identify a polymorphism in the promoter of the <i>Eif2s1</i> gene (encoding eIF2\u03b1) that is associated with changes in reward-related activity in human smokers, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thus, since eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is reduced by a variety of addictive drugs, agents that selectively alter eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation-mediated translational control in key reward areas in the brain could be useful for the treatment of a broad range of addictive behaviors."

Importantly, the authors go well beyond implicating eIF2\u03b1-dependent translation, and go on to identify a likely target (OPHN1), the cellular mechanisms involved (in vivo and slice synaptic plasticity studies of LTP/LTD), the key brain region involved (VTA) and compelling behavioral data with a number of impressive rescuing experiments that turn the cocaine susceptibility from adults to adolescents and vice versa. This is by far one of the very best papers I have read this year, and the implications of these results are considerable, since the findings seem to apply to not only cocaine but also to other abused substances (methamphetamine, nicotine, and ethanol). Impressively, in a companion paper the authors report evidence (allelic variability) that this mechanism may be at play in human populations."

In general, the manuscript attempts to demonstrate Eif2a's role in addiction, but makes a stronger case for its role in gating acute drug-induced VTA DA plasticity. This manuscript has bits of important data, but needs more experiments in order to become a seamless, outstanding story."

If the authors wish to argue that low abundance of p-eIF2\u03b1 is a permissive factor for induction of cocaine plasticity, and that this is a critical factor in the lower threshold for cocaine plasticity in adolescents, this seems like a critical experiment."

Are baseline levels of OPHN1 lower in adolescent compared to adult mice? If one overexpresses OPHN1 in adolescent VTA DA neurons, would you get effective mGluR-LTD and block the ability of low dose cocaine to induce LTP/CPP?"

Therefore, there must be some additional unspecified mechanism that allows low dose cocaine to decrease levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 in adolescents but not adults."

In the absence of data for the above two bullet points (showing that there are preexisting lower levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 / OPHN1 in adolescent mice), it would seem that this additional unspecified factor is what renders adolescents more vulnerable to cocaine plasticity, not translational control by p-eIF2\u03b1."
