                    "text": "Transcriptional feedback loops are key to circadian clock function in many organisms. Current models of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> circadian network consist of several coupled feedback loops composed almost exclusively of transcriptional repressors. Indeed, a central regulatory mechanism is the repression of evening-phased clock genes via the binding of morning-phased Myb-like repressors to evening element (EE) promoter motifs. We now demonstrate that a related Myb-like protein, REVEILLE8 (RVE8), is a direct transcriptional activator of EE-containing clock and output genes. Loss of RVE8 and its close homologs causes a delay and reduction in levels of evening-phased clock gene transcripts and significant lengthening of clock pace. Our data suggest a substantially revised model of the circadian oscillator, with a clock-regulated activator essential both for clock progression and control of clock outputs. Further, our work suggests that the plant clock consists of a highly interconnected, complex regulatory network rather than of coupled morning and evening feedback loops."

Current models of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> circadian network consist of several coupled feedback loops composed almost exclusively of transcriptional repressors. Indeed, a central regulatory mechanism is the repression of evening-phased clock genes via the binding of morning-phased Myb-like repressors to evening element (EE) promoter motifs. We now demonstrate that a related Myb-like protein, REVEILLE8 (RVE8), is a direct transcriptional activator of EE-containing clock and output genes. Loss of RVE8 and its close homologs causes a delay and reduction in levels of evening-phased clock gene transcripts and significant lengthening of clock pace. Our data suggest a substantially revised model of the circadian oscillator, with a clock-regulated activator essential both for clock progression and control of clock outputs. Further, our work suggests that the plant clock consists of a highly interconnected, complex regulatory network rather than of coupled morning and evening feedback loops."

In particular, they focused on a protein called RVE8 that is most strongly expressed in the afternoon and, based on previous research, is thought to activate the transcription of genes. Using genetically modified plants in which the gene for RVE8 can be turned on and off, they found that this protein led to increases in the expression of some genes, and reductions in the expression of others."

By contrast, morning-expressed genes were likely to be suppressed by RVE8 via an indirect mechanism that involved other proteins that had previously been activated by RVE8. The expression of RVE8 itself is regulated by other clock genes and also by an undefined post-transcriptional process. Therefore rather than consisting of a morning feedback loop coupled to an evening feedback loop, with both loops being based on repressors, the plant clock is instead better viewed as a highly connected network of activators and repressors. Further research is clearly necessary to understand this unexpected complexity in the circadian clock of Arabidopsis."

Although specific components are not widely conserved, eukaryotic clocks are composed of interlocking negative transcriptional feedback loops (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harmer, 2009</a>). In Arabidopsis, the first-identified clock genes function in a double negative feedback loop, with two morning-phased Myb-like transcription factors, CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), repressing expression of an evening-phased pseudo-response regulator, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1 or PRR1), which in turn represses expression of <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schaffer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang and Tobin, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Strayer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alabadi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gendron et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pokhilko et al., 2012</a>). CCA1 and LHY also promote the expression of <i>PRR7</i> and <i>9</i>, two day-phased genes, and are in turn repressed by these PRRs and their homolog PRR5, forming another negative feedback circuit (<a href=\"#bib14\">Farre et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nakamichi et al., 2010</a>). Finally, TOC1, GIGANTEA (GI), and the evening complex components including LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX), EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) and 4 (ELF4), act in double negative feedback loops with CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fowler et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dixon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Helfer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nusinow et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pokhilko et al., 2012</a>).

Most evening-phased central clock genes (including <i>TOC1</i>, <i>PRR5</i>, <i>GI</i>, <i>LUX</i> and <i>ELF4</i>) contain the EE in their promoter regions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Covington et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Harmer, 2009</a>) and the two morning-phased components, CCA1 and LHY, bind directly to the EE to repress evening-phased clock gene expression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabadi et al., 2001</a>). The EE was first identified by its overrepresentation in the promoters of evening-phased genes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harmer et al., 2000</a>) and is sufficient to confer evening-phased expression on a reporter gene (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harmer and Kay, 2005</a>). In addition to these two morning-phased transcriptional repressors that act via the EE, two pieces of evidence suggest that there is also a transcriptional activator(s) present in the afternoon that regulates the EE. First, if only repressors bind to the EE, loss of protein binding to the EE should result in constitutively high expression of EE-regulated genes; however, mutation of the EE causes decreased expression of an EE-regulated reporter gene (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harmer and Kay, 2005</a>). Second, an afternoon/evening-phased activity that specifically binds the EE is present in plant extracts and persists in <i>cca1 lhy</i> mutants, consistent with the existence of a clock-regulated, afternoon-phased activator of the EE (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harmer and Kay, 2005</a>). A clock-regulated activator of the EE might help to explain why evening-phased clock genes are expressed with a circadian rhythm in <i>cca1 lhy</i> plants rather than being arrhythmic (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mizoguchi et al., 2002</a>)."

RVE8 has been shown to bind to the EE in vitro and in planta, and its protein levels display a circadian rhythm that peaks in the afternoon (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rawat et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, <i>rve8</i> loss of function mutations cause a long circadian period (<a href=\"#bib12\">Farinas and Mas, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rawat et al., 2011</a>) which is opposite to the phenotypes of <i>cca1</i> or <i>lhy</i> loss of function mutants (<a href=\"#bib18\">Green and Tobin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mizoguchi et al., 2002</a>). However, despite its ability to bind to the EE in the <i>TOC1</i> and <i>PRR5</i> promoters in planta, loss of RVE8 function does not significantly affect the transcript levels of these evening genes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Farinas and Mas, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rawat et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hsu and Harmer, 2012</a>), perhaps due to genetic redundancy or complex feedback regulation within the clock system. Here, we used an inducible RVE8 line and genome-wide expression profiling to identify hundreds of clock-regulated genes controlled by RVE8. Experiments with an inhibitor of translation revealed that most evening-phased clock genes are directly induced by RVE8. Consistent with RVE8 acting via the EE regulatory motif, we found that genes induced by RVE8 are enriched for the EE in their promoter regions. Furthermore, plants mutant for <i>RVE8</i> and its two closest homologs, <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i>, have lost the afternoon-phased EE-binding activity. Finally, <i>rve4 rve6 rve8</i> triple mutants display an extremely long circadian period, with delayed and reduced expression of evening-phased clock genes. Together, these data suggest a considerably revised model of the plant clock, with an indispensable role for activators of transcription within the circadian regulatory network. Our work shows that rather than consisting of discrete, interlocked feedback loops, the plant circadian oscillator is more accurately described as a highly interconnected complex network."

Genes regulated by RVE8 both in the presence or absence of CHX would be considered direct targets while those only regulated by RVE8 in the absence of CHX would be considered indirect targets. CHX treatment increased the accumulation of transcripts regulated by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carter et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arciga-Reyes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kurihara et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that CHX treatment reduced or blocked translation as expected (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Consistent with a role for RVE8 in activation of evening genes via direct binding to the EE, all of the EE-containing, evening-phased central clock and output genes examined are robustly induced by RVE8 even in the presence of CHX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>). In contrast, the RVE8-mediated repression of expression of all tested morning genes is reduced or abolished in the presence of CHX (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013G</a>), suggesting that RVE8 represses these genes indirectly. In the case of <i>PRR9</i>, induction of RVE8 in the presence of CHX actually causes increased expression levels rather than the decrease seen in the absence of CHX (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). RVE8-mediated activation of <i>PRR9</i> is likely masked in the absence of CHX by the concomitant induction of strong repressors of <i>PRR9</i> expression such as <i>TOC1</i> and <i>LUX</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Helfer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gendron et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a>) and is only revealed when the translation of these repressors is blocked.

This may be due to partial genetic redundancy, since there are four other close RVE8 homologs (RVE3, 4, 5, and 6) in the Arabidopsis genome (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rawat et al., 2009</a>) and all of these proteins were found to bind to the EE (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gong et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rawat et al., 2011</a>). To investigate whether RVE8 homologs play a partially redundant role with RVE8 in the circadian clock, we identified plants mutant for the two closest RVE8 homologs, <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>) and examined clock function in single and higher order mutants. The pace of the clock in <i>rve4-1</i> and <i>rve6-1</i> single mutants is not significantly different from wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, combining loss-of-function <i>RVE4</i> or <i>RVE6</i> alleles with <i>rve8-1</i> makes the period length much longer than <i>rve8-1</i> alone, while the <i>rve4 rve6 rve8</i> triple mutant has a period approximately 4 hr longer than wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These data suggest that <i>RVE4</i>, <i>6</i> and <i>8</i> play a partially redundant role in speeding up the pace of the clock.

As expected, extracts from wild-type plants have an afternoon-phased EE binding activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Remarkably, this cycling EE-binding activity is abolished in the triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Given that we have previously found that RVE4, RVE6 and RVE8 can all be affinity purified from plant extracts using EE sequences (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rawat et al., 2011</a>), this strongly suggests that RVE4, 6 and 8 comprise a clock-regulated, evening-phased EE-binding activity."

In contrast, in these same samples, an approximately 3-hr phase delay is observed for trough levels of <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> in the mutant relative to controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K,L</a>). Similarly, at the third subjective morning (around ZT48), <i>PRR5</i> and <i>TOC1</i> trough levels display an approximately 9-hr phase delay in the triple mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,J</a>) while an approximately 6-hr phase delay is observed in the peak expression levels for <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> at that time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>).

Notably, the obvious change in the <i>TOC1</i> waveform is lost when these same data are plotted at 3-hr resolution (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5N,M</a>). Our data show that loss of multiple RVEs has an immediate effect on expression of evening genes and a delayed effect on morning genes, further supporting the main role of RVE8 as an activator of evening genes.

In support of a largely indirect role for RVE8 in repression of gene expression, inhibition of translation reduced or eliminated decreases in gene expression upon RVE8 induction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013G</a>).

This delay in RVE8 target gene transcript accumulation relative to RVE8 protein might be explained by antagonistic regulation of target genes by RVE8 and the cycling repressors CCA1 and LHY.

How these RVE8 targets are distinct from the rest of the EE-containing CCGs remains unclear. The clock may fine-tune expression of EE-containing genes through the action of multiple clock-controlled promoter motifs, generating the wide range of phases seen across all EE-containing genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). For example, it has been reported that a combination of morning-, day-, and night-phased DNA elements generates the day-phased expression of <i>Cry1</i> in mammalian cells.

This possibility is supported by the further lengthening in circadian period seen in higher order mutants combining <i>rve4</i> or <i>rve6</i> with <i>rve8</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting these factors play partially redundant roles in speeding up the pace of the clock.

The long period in <i>rve4 rve6 rve8</i> mutants might in principle be due either to a decrease in peak levels or a delay in onset of expression of evening genes. However, consideration of the phenotypes of plants mutant for various evening-phased clock genes makes us favor the latter possibility. <i>toc1</i> and <i>prr5</i> mutants have short-period phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Strayer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yamamoto et al., 2003</a>); loss of <i>GI</i> causes a short period in most conditions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mizoguchi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Martin-Tryon et al., 2007</a>); and <i>lux</i> and <i>elf4</i> mutants are arrhythmic (<a href=\"#bib10\">Doyle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Onai and Ishiura, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hazen et al., 2005b</a>). Therefore, reduced expression of any of these EE-containing evening genes is unlikely to cause the long period phenotype displayed by <i>rve4 rve6 rve8</i>. On the other hand, the delayed phase of expression of clock genes can first be observed in evening-phased genes and only later in morning-phased genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This suggests that the long period seen in <i>rve4 rve6 rve8</i> is mainly caused by delayed expression of evening genes, which then indirectly causes a delayed phase of expression of morning genes. In support of this idea, in <i>RVE8</i>-overexpressing plants (which have a short-period phenotype), the peak phase of expression of <i>TOC1</i> is clearly advanced soon after plants are released into free-run whereas phase advances are not seen for the morning-phased genes <i>CCA1</i> and <i>LHY</i> until much later (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rawat et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, delays in the phase of post-transcriptional processes have previously been suggested to contribute to long-period phenotypes in animals (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rothenfluh et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Syed et al., 2011</a>)."

Even though they have distinct biochemical functions, with CCA1 and LHY serving as repressors and RVE8 as an activator of EE-containing genes, both CCA1/LHY and RVE8 are responsible for shaping the circadian pattern of expression of evening-phased genes.

The quality of the isolated total RNA was determined by NanoDrop ND 1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Samples with both a 260 nm:280 nm ratio and a 260 nm:230 nm ratio between 2 and 2.3 were processed further. The RNA-seq libraries were prepared using a customized Illumina-based strand-specific multiplex library construction protocol modified from <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al. (2011)</a>. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from 8 \u00b5g of total RNA using Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Kit (Invitrogen) and fragmented to \u223c200 nucleotide pieces. After the first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using random primers, the second strand cDNA was synthesized using a special dNTP mix in which dTTP is replaced by dUTP. Following end-repair (Y9140-LC-L; Enzymatics, Beverly, MA) and addition of a dA to the 3\u2032 end, both ends of cDNA were ligated with Y-shaped adaptors containing an index unique to each library. The second strand cDNA was then digested using Uracil DNA glycosylase (Enzymatics). Primers partially complementary to the adaptor sequences were used to amplify the libraries for 12 PCR cycles using High-Fidelity Polymerase (Phusion, Ipswich, MA). The libraries were further size-selected using a 1:1 volume of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea CA). The size and quality of resulting libraries were examined using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The 12 libraries were then quantified by qPCR and equally pooled for 2 lanes of single end 50 bp sequencing in HiSeq 2000 machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

A custom perl script was then used to remove Illumina adapter sequences from the resulting reads. The reads were then separated by their custom barcode sequences (de-multiplexing) using Fastx_barcode_splitter (included in the FASTX toolkit) allowing up to one mismatch per barcode. 16 to 22 million reads per libraries were obtained and aligned against the Arabidopsis cDNA representative_gene_model (TAIR 10) using BWA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>) and Samtools (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2009</a>).

Fixed regions of 1500 bp upstream of the translational start site (corresponding to both strands) of RVE8-regulated genes were used for computation of significance compared to all the genes in the genome. Significance is the negative logarithm of expectation. Significance greater than zero is statistically meaningful; the larger the significance value, the higher its statistical significance. Coverage indicates the percentage of genes that have at least one occurrence of the motif in question. The fractions of genes containing the top-scoring motifs among the evening-phased (CT 8 to CT 14) and morning-phased (CT 20 to CT 2) RVE8 targets were compared to the fractions found in all of the clock-regulated genes in the corresponding phase group. Fisher's exact test was performed in R to examine if the presence of these motifs in RVE8 targets is enriched compared to their presence in the evening- and morning-phased genes."

Specifically, we demonstrated that these RVEs are primarily (and perhaps exclusively) activators of gene expression. Further, our findings suggest that it is better to view the plant clock as a highly interconnected complex network rather than consisting of coupled morning and evening transcriptional feedback loops."
