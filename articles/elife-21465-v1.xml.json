Here, we show that the chlamydial deubiquitinating enzyme (Cdu) 1 localizes in the inclusion membrane and faces the cytosol with the active deubiquitinating enzyme domain. The structure of this domain revealed high similarity to mammalian deubiquitinases with a unique \u03b1-helix close to the substrate-binding pocket. We identified the apoptosis regulator Mcl-1 as a target that interacts with Cdu1 and is stabilized by deubiquitination at the chlamydial inclusion. A chlamydial transposon insertion mutant in the Cdu1-encoding gene exhibited increased Mcl-1 and inclusion ubiquitination and reduced Mcl-1 stabilization. Additionally, inactivation of Cdu1 led to increased sensitivity of <i>C. trachomatis</i> for IFN\u03b3 and impaired infection in mice. Thus, the chlamydial inclusion serves as an enriched site for a deubiquitinating activity exerting a function in selective stabilization of host proteins and protection from host defense."

Here, we show that the chlamydial deubiquitinating enzyme (Cdu) 1 localizes in the inclusion membrane and faces the cytosol with the active deubiquitinating enzyme domain. The structure of this domain revealed high similarity to mammalian deubiquitinases with a unique \u03b1-helix close to the substrate-binding pocket. We identified the apoptosis regulator Mcl-1 as a target that interacts with Cdu1 and is stabilized by deubiquitination at the chlamydial inclusion. A chlamydial transposon insertion mutant in the Cdu1-encoding gene exhibited increased Mcl-1 and inclusion ubiquitination and reduced Mcl-1 stabilization. Additionally, inactivation of Cdu1 led to increased sensitivity of <i>C. trachomatis</i> for IFN\u03b3 and impaired infection in mice. Thus, the chlamydial inclusion serves as an enriched site for a deubiquitinating activity exerting a function in selective stabilization of host proteins and protection from host defense."

Once the EB entered the cell, it differentiates into the metabolic active reticulate body (RB) and replicates inside a vacuole, the so-called chlamydial inclusion. To complete the developmental cycle, the RBs re-differentiate into the infectious EBs, which are released by host cell lysis or extrusion. During replication, the bacteria secrete several effector proteins through type two- (T2SS) or three-secretion systems (T3SS) to intrude in cellular processes for their benefit (<a href=\"#bib43\">Subtil et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Valdivia, 2008</a>). Proteins secreted via the T3SS may reside in the inclusion membrane (so-called Inc proteins) or other cellular compartments. Inc proteins in general interact with numerous different host proteins thereby orchestrating processes like vesicular trafficking and signaling cascades essential for inclusion formation and bacterial replication (<a href=\"#bib11\">Elwell et al., 2016</a>). Due to the full dependence on the host cell for replication, <i>Chlamydia</i> established strategies to prevent apoptosis to sustain their favored environment (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sharma and Rudel, 2009</a>). During bacterial entry into the host cell, the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT survival signaling pathways are activated that in turn mediate the transcriptional up-regulation and stabilization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rajalingam et al., 2008</a>). In <i>C. trachomatis</i>-mediated apoptosis resistance in human cells, Mcl-1 is crucial because depletion of Mcl-1 sensitizes infected cells to cell death (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rajalingam et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">R\u00f6del et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "Many cellular processes, including apoptosis, are orchestrated by the regulated stabilization and destabilization of proteins. For example, in order to induce apoptosis, various members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family have to be degraded to alter the ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. A major pathway for regulating protein stability is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) that recognizes proteins modified with ubiquitin, an evolutionary conserved protein. Attachment of ubiquitin is catalyzed by a highly conserved enzymatic cascade in which the E3 ligase mediates substrate specificity. The most prominent K48-linked poly-ubiquitination is a signal for proteasomal degradation, whereas other forms of ubiquitination alter protein function or localization (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vucic et al., 2011</a>). Ubiquitination is a strictly regulated but reversible process catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which can be categorized in five classes and are either cysteine proteases or metalloproteases (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nijman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ha and Kim, 2008</a>)."

Generally, the anti-apoptotic feature of Mcl-1 is based on its abundance in the cell and its degradation is an important step in the switch from survival to apoptosis. Here, the ubiquitin ligases MULE and the SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup> complex as well as the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X mainly control the protein turnover of Mcl-1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ding et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Inuzuka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schwickart et al., 2010</a>).

Many pathogens encode for effectors hijacking cellular components of the UPS or that possess ubiquitin ligase or deubiquitinase activity to interfere with ubiquitination or deubiquitination processes of cellular proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Edelmann and Kessler, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ribet and Cossart, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Furtado et al., 2013</a>). The chlamydial effector proteins ChlaDUB1 (CTL0247) and ChlaDUB2 (CTL0246), in the following termed Cdu1 and Cdu2, were demonstrated to have in vitro deubiquitinating and deneddylating activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Misaghi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pruneda et al., 2016</a>). One of the Cdu1 targets was suggested to be I\u03baB\u03b1, which may prevent NF\u03baB signaling and immune response to ensure survival inside the host cell (<a href=\"#bib22\">Le Negrate et al., 2008</a>)."

Interestingly, the Cdu1 mutant was severely affected in its development upon IFN\u03b3 challenge in vitro and survival in mouse genital infections."

Mcl-1 protein levels strongly increase upon 16 hr post infection (hpi) and remain high until the end of the chlamydial developmental cycle. Augmented Mcl-1 levels are the result of increased protein expression initially triggered by the Raf/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rajalingam et al., 2008</a>). However, preventing Mcl-1 de novo protein synthesis by treatment of the cells with cycloheximide (CHX) or decreasing MCL1 gene transcription by blocking MEK/ERK signaling with the inhibitor UO126 revealed extended stabilization of Mcl-1 in infected cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>).

                                "text": "To investigate the mechanisms of Mcl-1 stabilization during <i>Chlamydia</i> infection, protein ubiquitination patterns were examined during <i>C. trachomatis</i> infection. HeLa cells were infected with <i>C. trachomatis</i> at a MOI of 1 and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added 20 hpi to avoid degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. One hour later, an apoptosis stimulus was given using TNF\u03b1/CHX and the cell lysate or precipitated Mcl-1 was analyzed for ubiquitination by immunoblotting. Compared to non-stimulated control cells, a mild increase in ubiquitination as a result of apoptosis signaling was detected after TNF\u03b1/CHX treatment in uninfected, but not in infected cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and C</a>). Interestingly, Mcl-1 ubiquitination was reduced in infected cells independently of the TNF\u03b1/CHX treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Reduced ubiquitination protects Mcl-1 from proteasomal degradation and may lead to Mcl-1 accumulation, as previously observed (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rajalingam et al., 2008</a>). Since even the mild increase in Mcl-1 levels causes protection from apoptosis induction (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), this stabilized Mcl-1 will interfere with apoptosis induction in infected cells. The anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1 depends on its interaction with pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to block apoptosis induction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2006</a>). Bim is known to interact with Mcl-1 and both could be co-immunoprecipitated from cells infected with <i>C. trachomatis</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) suggesting that Mcl-1 is active in sequestering Bim in infected cells. Many cancer cells have increased levels of Mcl-1 protein due to the misregulation of cellular UPS factors like MULE, USP9X and components of the SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup> complex (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schwickart et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Inuzuka et al., 2011</a>) which promotes apoptosis resistance (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Cooper, 2007</a>). However, all these ubiquitin-modifying proteins were present at similar levels in control and <i>C. trachomatis</i>-infected HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E</a>). The ubiquitin ligase activity of SCF E3 ligase complexes can be altered by neddylation of the Cullin subunit, but no difference in the protein level of Cullin 1 or its modification by Nedd8 was observed in <i>C. trachomatis</i>-infected cells compared to uninfected control cells."

The crystal structure of Ulp1 in complex with the ubiquitin like protein SMT3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) reveals the direction in which the C-terminal glycine of SMT3 approaches the active site cysteine. This path seems to be conserved between the two enzymes. Remarkably, however, a small loop between \u03b2-strands 1 and 2 (shown in yellow) in Ulp1 contrasts with the much bigger \u03b1-helix D in Cdu1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) in between the equivalent \u03b2-strands of both structures. The same phenomenon can also be observed when comparing Cdu1 with the human SENP8 protein in complex with a Nedd8 aldehyde (<a href=\"#bib32\">Reverter et al., 2005</a>), with whom Cdu1 shares 11% identity within 208 amino acids. Although larger than in Ulp1, the loop between \u03b2-strands 1 and 2 fails to adopt the helical architecture observed in Cdu1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In contrast to this difference, the residues within the active site are highly conserved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>), further supporting the notion that Cdu1 forms a complex with ubiquitin in a similar way as observed between SENP8 and Nedd8 or Ulp1 and SMT3, respectively. The additional \u03b1-helix D in Cdu1, a feature not observed in the other structures, however, may play a regulatory role in substrate binding or recognition. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the analysis of Pruneda et al. where deletion of this region (residues 250 to 272) prevented Cdu1 from binding ubiquitin/Nedd8 suicide probes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pruneda et al., 2016</a>). Importantly, an insertion of identical length as observed in Cdu1 seems to be present in the Cdu1 proteins encoded by the genomes of <i>C. suis, C. muridarum, C. psittaci, C. gallinaceai</i> and Cdu2 from <i>C. trachomatis</i> suggesting that it is a conserved feature across the chlamydial deubiquitinases (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

A rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against recombinant Cdu1 detected Cdu1 inside the inclusion 24 hpi co-localizing with bacterial particles. Major amounts of Cdu1 were also detected at the surface of the inclusion co-localizing with the inclusion membrane protein IncA, where it might be anchored by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). However, Cdu1 could not be detected in the host cell cytoplasm as it had been described before (<a href=\"#bib22\">Le Negrate et al., 2008</a>). To obtain further proof for a localization of Cdu1 around the inclusion, recombinant <i>Chlamydia</i> were generated which express a FLAG-tagged version of Cdu1 that could be detected by an anti-FLAG antibody. Since Cdu1 is subjected to a tight transcriptional regulation during the chlamydial developmental cycle, the expression of the recombinant gene under the control of the original <i>cdu1</i> promoter was established. In a first approach, the plasmid pAH1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) was designed, which cannot replicate in <i>Chlamydia</i> but can integrate in part into the genome by homologous recombination. The expected arrangement of the <i>cdu1</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) including the FLAG-tag at the C-terminus after recombination in the transformed new <i>Chlamydia</i> strain (<i>Ctr</i> Cdu1-FLAG) was verified by PCR and sequencing, as well as by Southern hybridization (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). <i>Ctr</i> Cdu1-FLAG expressed only the FLAG-tagged version of Cdu1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), which was secreted to the surface of the inclusion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The accessibility of the C-terminal catalytic domain of Cdu1 to the host cell cytosol was demonstrated by antibody transfection experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Recombinant expression of Cdu1 in <i>Chlamydia</i> did not change its infectivity, as assessed by the efficiency and the duration of the developmental cycle, nor was the inhibition of host cell apoptosis affected (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>). In addition, the kinetics of Cdu1-FLAG expression and localization during the developmental cycle was not altered confirming the expression of the recombinant protein under the native promoter (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">4</a>). Moreover, transcriptomics analysis of <i>C. trachomatis</i>-infected cells revealed that the insertion of the selection cassette at the <i>cdu1</i> locus should not affect the downstream gene <i>cdu2</i> since it is controlled by its own promoter (<a href=\"#bib5\">Albrecht et al., 2010</a>)."

HEK-293T cells were transfected with Cdu1-FLAG or an inactive mutated form of the enzyme that carried an amino acid exchange of the catalytically active cysteine 345 to alanine (Cdu1(C345A)). Overexpression of Cdu1-FLAG led to a specific stabilization of Mcl-1 since Bcl-2, another anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and several <span class=\"underline\">i</span>nhibitor of <span class=\"underline\">a</span>poptosis <span class=\"underline\">p</span>roteins (IAPs) were not affected by Cdu1-FLAG overexpression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Overexpression of the mutant Cdu1(C345A) could not stabilize Mcl-1 to the same extent as the wild-type enzyme (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>), suggesting that chlamydial Cdu1 alone is able to stabilize Mcl-1, very likely by deubiquitination. To confirm Mcl-1 deubiquitination by Cdu1 expression, Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated by its myc-tag under denaturing conditions from HEK-293T cells expressing HA-ubiquitin, myc-Mcl-1 and Cdu1-FLAG, Cdu1(C345A)-FLAG or empty vector control. The degree of poly-ubiquitination was higher if Mcl-1 was precipitated from cells co-transfected with the empty vector or inactive Cdu1(C345A)-FLAG compared to cells co-expressing Cdu1-FLAG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, left panel). The final proof that Cdu1 directly deubiquitinates Mcl-1 was provided in an in vitro deubiquitination assay. Purified recombinant Mcl-1 was poly-ubiquitinated in vitro and was subsequently used as substrate for purified recombinant Cdu1, its mutant Cdu1(C345A) or the unrelated deubiquitinase UCH-L3. Cdu1, but not the control enzyme UCH-L3 strongly deubiquitinated Mcl-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Deubiquitination of Mcl-1 was dependent on its enzymatic activity, since neither the Cdu1(C345A) mutant nor the wild-type enzyme blocked with the universal cysteine protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) deubiquitinated Mcl-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Furthermore, poly-ubiquitinated proteins were isolated by TUBE\u00a0pull down and incubated with Cdu1 or the control DUB USP28. Cdu1 specifically deubiquitinated Mcl-1 but not the control protein p53 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This in vitro deubiquitination assays confirms that Mcl-1 is a substrate of Cdu1. It has already been demonstrated in vitro that Cdu1 is a deubiquitinase and deneddylase (<a href=\"#bib25\">Misaghi et al., 2006</a>). Mcl-1 is primarily K48-ubiquitinated to target it to proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mojsa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). We were able to show that Cdu1 cleaves K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains as it was recently described (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pruneda et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) supporting Mcl-1 being a substrate of Cdu1."

In another approach, transposon mutagenesis using a <i>Himar1</i> transposon system was established in <i>C. trachomatis</i>. One of the resulting mutant strains (<i>Ctr cdu1</i>::Tn <i>bla</i>), termed <i>Ctr</i> Tn-<i>cdu1,</i> had a transposon inserted in the active site of Cdu1, resulting in a truncated version with 297 amino acids and an apparent molecular weight of 33 kDa (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). To confirm the transposon insertion site and discover any other potential genetic differences that may contribute the phenotypes observed between <i>C. trachomatis</i> parental and Tn<i>-cdu1</i> mutant clones, genomic sequencing and analysis was performed. Comparison of the parental clone to the reference LGV 434/Bu genome revealed two mutations. One mutation (base 946,499) was in the coding region for CTL0818 (helicase) that resulted in an amino acid substitution (N1115H). The other was in CTL0817 (<i>brnQ</i>) and also resulted in a substitution (R275H). Interestingly, the reads for these mutations indicated a mixed population with 37% (CTL0818) and 65% (CTL0817) matching the reference strain sequence. Comparison of the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> genome to the parental clone verified that the transposon is located as indicated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and introduces a Y298* non-sense mutation in <i>cdu1</i>. Both sites in CTL0818 and CTL0817 that have mixed sequence in the parental strain, uniformly matched the reference strain; however, two new mutations were incurred in the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> strain. One mutation (base 929,586) occurred in the intergenic region between two diverging genes (CTL0805; <i>hisS</i> and CTL0806; <i>uhpC</i>) and a missense mutation (base 11,738) was found in the gene encoding for RecC (CTL0008) and results in an amino acid substitution (S638Y). Taken together, this analysis reveals that the genomes of the parent and Tn-<i>cdu1</i> strain are almost identical with the exception of the transposon insertions. While there are two distinct mutations in the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> clone relative to the parent clone, the only modification to a coding region was in RecC (S638Y). These data support that the phenotypes observed of the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> insertional mutant clone are almost definitively due to the functional disruption of the Cdu1 deubiquitinase."

However, the Mcl-1 level did not decrease to the level detected in uninfected control cells highlighting that <i>Chlamydia</i> established multiple mechanisms to induce Mcl-1 accumulation in the cell.

However, Mcl-1 still shows reduced ubiquitination in comparison to the uninfected control, which could be a result of the sequestration of Mcl-1 to the inclusion (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>). It is unclear if Mcl-1 is actively recruited to the inclusion or if it is accumulating by interaction with Cdu1. However, it would be expected that Mcl-1 present at the inclusion surface is more ubiquitinated in the mutant than in the wild-type. Indeed, immunofluorescence staining for ubiquitin or K48-linked ubiquitin and Mcl-1 in <i>Ctr</i> Tn-<i>cdu1</i>-infected cells shows that ubiquitin is accumulating around the inclusion in part co-localizing with Mcl-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>).

Maintenance of increased Mcl-1 levels in the mid and late phases of infection, however, required in addition stabilization of the protein. We show here that Mcl-1 stabilization is a result of reduced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation induced by the chlamydial Cdu1 that is independent of the known major host UPS factors regulating Mcl-1 stability."

The structural similarity between Cdu1, Ulp1 and SENP8 with respect to the position of the catalytic triad suggests that Cdu1 should bind ubiquitin and Nedd8 in a similar way as observed for the Ulp1-SMT3 and SENP8-Nedd8 complexes. A major structural difference, however, is the additional \u03b1-helix D in Cdu1, which is not present in the other enzymes, and its proximity to the Ub/Nedd8 C-terminus. We speculate that this helix could act like a \u2018lid\u2019 that plays a role in substrate binding and/or recognition and assumes a different orientation when the substrate is bound."

Although it was not possible to detect secreted Cdu1 in the cytosol, it cannot be excluded that a minor fraction of Cdu1 that escaped detection in the here described approaches is also present in the cytosol of infected host cells, as has previously been described (<a href=\"#bib22\">Le Negrate et al., 2008</a>). Nevertheless, the localization of a major fraction of Cdu1 in the inclusion membrane of cells infected with wild-type and to a lesser extend with <i>Ctr</i> Tn-<i>cdu1</i> coincides with the high enrichment of Mcl-1 in the immediate vicinity of the Cdu1-containing compartment. Enrichment of high amounts of Mcl-1 around the inclusion may result from protein stabilization by Cdu1 in this defined area. However, Mcl-1 may also be actively recruited to the inclusion since the interaction of Cdu1 with endogenous Mcl-1 was shown in living cells. Additionally, the purified recombinant proteins bound to each other in in vitro binding assays suggesting that they interact directly and no additional host factors are required for their interaction outside the inclusion. Since previous work on the cellular Mcl-1 deubiquitinase USP9X demonstrated that deubiquitinase and target do not have to reside in the same cellular compartment (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schwickart et al., 2010</a>) it can be speculated, that inclusion-associated Cdu1 constantly increases the pool of cytosolic Mcl-1 and thereby also the amount of effective anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 at the mitochondria. Our co-localization analysis using SIM clearly demonstrated reduced ubiquitinated Mcl-1 at the inclusion surface of wild-type <i>Chlamydia</i> compared to inclusions of the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> mutant strain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

While the systems for genetic manipulation have been in development recently, this mouse challenge study presented herein is among the only animal challenge study that has been performed with genetically manipulated <i>Chlamydia</i> strains. Moreover, the genetic disruption resulted in a substantial and significant effect on infection with over a log-fold decrease in bacterial burden. While it is unknown what specific aspect of infection is affected by this genetic disruption, a polar effect of the transposon insertion on genes downstream of the Cdu1 coding gene is unlikely, since <i>cdu2</i> (Cdu2) is directly downstream of <i>cdu1</i> and has been shown to have its own transcriptional start site (<a href=\"#bib5\">Albrecht et al., 2010</a>). Further, Cdu2 does not appear to play a role with Mcl-1 function since it failed to interact with Mcl-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and G</a>) and Mcl-1 still localizes to the inclusion in the <i>cdu1</i> allelic replacement strain (<i>Ctr</i> Cdu1-FLAG). Therefore, the loss of Mcl-1 interaction with the chlamydial inclusion and functional effect due to higher ubiquination levels is likely maintained during mammalian infection by the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> mutant strain. It is important to appreciate that these observations support that <i>Chlamydia</i>-directed deubiquitination activities appear to have a substantial effect on mammalian infection."

Sequencing reads were then de-multiplexed and analyzed on the Geneious software suite (version 9.1.7; <a href=\"https://www.geneious.com\">https://www.geneious.com</a>; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010519\">SCR_010519</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kearse et al., 2012</a>). A draft genome was generated for parental, Tn-IGR and Tn-<i>cdu1</i> samples and compared to determine genetic differences. After de-multiplexing, each sample had just over 3 million raw reads. The genomes had 98.9 percentage of base pairs covered by more reads than the 10 minimum thresholds. The reads percentages cap out at 98.9 due to repeat regions in the duplicate rRNA loci and variable repeats in the tarp gene. These regions have reads that map to only one copy of the repeat, leading to low coverage in the other repeat, making up 1.1% of the genome. The number of repeats in the tarp gene do not appear to be any different between the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> mutant, Tn-IGR and the parental sample. Reference-guided assembly to <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> 434/Bu (NCBI NC 010287.1) was performed on parental <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA. Subsequently, the <i>C. trachomatis</i> Tn-<i>cdu1</i> draft and Tn-IGR draft were generated using the parental sequence as the reference sequence. Alignment files were generated between the <i>C. trachomatis</i> parental, Tn-IGR and the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> mutant drafts. Plasmid sequences for parental, Tn-IGR and Tn-<i>cdu1</i> were assembled using the <i>C. trachomatis</i> F-6068 plasmid (CP015307) as a reference. All alignments were performed in Geneious (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010519\">SCR_010519</a>) using global alignment tool with free end gaps and a cost matrix of 65% similarity. Mutations that accumulated through the study were annotated and verified using read sequencing data. Mouse fibroblast (L929) DNA contamination was mitigated using the reference-guided assembly techniques. To prevent bias, the transposon insertion site was analyzed both with the reference-guided mapping of the genomes and separately through a reference-guided assembly of the raw reads to the transposon sequence. The read quality and depth of coverage of the transposon assembly was proportional to that of the Tn-<i>cdu1</i> and Tn-IGR mutant genomes supporting clonal samples. An assembly of the WT reads to the transposon was performed as a control and no reads were found containing transposon sequence. Genomes for <i>C. trachomatis</i> LGV 434/Bu parental (CP019385), Tn-<i>cdu1</i> (CP019386), and Tn-IGR (CP019387) were deposited in GenBank."

The premise of the work is that Cdu1 localizes to the surface of the pathogenic vacuole (inclusions) where it recruits the anti-apoptotic factor Mcl1 and stabilizes it by de-ubiquitination, and that this activity contributes to the strong anti-apoptotic state that has been ascribed to cells infected with this pathogen. The mechanism is novel and the premise is appealing. In fact, much of the in vitro binding and deUb activity shown is robust and consistent with what others have reported for ChlaDub, which the authors renamed Cdu1 in this study."

However, these experiment were performed under overexpression of Cdu1 in the absence of potential regulation by the bacteria. Therefore, we see a strong MCl-1 accumulation and a clear difference between cells expressing either wildtype of mutated Cdu1 enzyme. On the other hand, Chlamydia use several mechanisms to ensure intracellular survival until the developmental cycle is completed. Among them, Chlamydia activate pro-survival signaling pathways which can also result in increased expression of the <i>MCl-1</i> gene. It is very likely, that if one pathways contributing to high MCl-1 levels is blocked, for instance Cdu1 dependent stabilization, Chlamydia are able to compensate via other pathways.

Working with cells infected for 30 h is quite challenging and proper analysis of MCl-1 recruitment to the inclusion by immunofluorescence staining is almost impossible. Therefore, we chose the time point of 24 to 26 hpi for all performed experiments to be able to compare the results of the different experiments."

In addition, HeLa cells infected with Ctr pTet/Cdu1-FLAG and induced for Cdu1 overexpression by addition of AHT were fixed 24 hpi and stained for MCl-1, cHSP60 and DAPI.
