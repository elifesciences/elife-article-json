                    "text": "GPIHBP1 is a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of capillary endothelial cells that binds lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within the interstitial space and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. The LPL\u2022GPIHBP1 complex is responsible for margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along capillaries and their lipolytic processing. The current work conceptualizes a model for the GPIHBP1\u2022LPL interaction based on biophysical measurements with hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and zero-length cross-linking. According to this model, GPIHBP1 comprises two functionally distinct domains: (1) an intrinsically disordered acidic N-terminal domain; and (2) a folded C-terminal domain that tethers GPIHBP1 to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. We demonstrate that these domains serve different roles in regulating the kinetics of LPL binding. Importantly, the acidic domain stabilizes LPL catalytic activity by mitigating the global unfolding of LPL's catalytic domain. This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding intravascular lipolysis and GPIHBP1 and LPL mutations causing familial chylomicronemia."

                    "text": "GPIHBP1 is a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of capillary endothelial cells that binds lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within the interstitial space and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. The LPL\u2022GPIHBP1 complex is responsible for margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along capillaries and their lipolytic processing. The current work conceptualizes a model for the GPIHBP1\u2022LPL interaction based on biophysical measurements with hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and zero-length cross-linking. According to this model, GPIHBP1 comprises two functionally distinct domains: (1) an intrinsically disordered acidic N-terminal domain; and (2) a folded C-terminal domain that tethers GPIHBP1 to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. We demonstrate that these domains serve different roles in regulating the kinetics of LPL binding. Importantly, the acidic domain stabilizes LPL catalytic activity by mitigating the global unfolding of LPL's catalytic domain. This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding intravascular lipolysis and GPIHBP1 and LPL mutations causing familial chylomicronemia."

This releases nutrients that can be used by vital tissues \u2013 mainly the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues. LPL is produced by muscle and adipose tissue, but it is quickly swept up by a protein called GPIHBP1 and shuttled to its site of action inside the blood vessels."

This revealed that the opposite end of the molecule \u2013 called the carboxyl-terminal domain \u2013 is primarily responsible for binding LPL and anchoring it inside blood vessels. Once LPL is bound to GPIHBP1, the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 helps to stabilize LPL. If GPIHBP1\u2019s acidic domain is missing then LPL is more susceptible to losing its structure, rendering it incapable of breaking down the lipids in the blood."

LPL-mediated processing of TRLs occurs along the capillary lumen, and LPL is readily released from the surface of capillaries with polyanionic compounds such as heparin. LPL contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) for catalysis and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is essential for lipid binding. LPL is active as a head-to-tail homodimer, and several lines of evidence suggest that the CTD of one LPL monomer delivers triglyceride substrates to the NTD of the partner monomer (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kobayashi et al., 2002</a>). In the presence of certain LPL mutations (e.g., mutations in the catalytic triad or mutations that prevent LPL dimerization), the processing of TRLs is markedly impaired, leading to severe hypertriglyceridemia (familial chylomicronemia) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brahm and Hegele, 2015</a>)."

These uncertainties have been addressed by the discovery of a novel LPL binding protein of capillary endothelial cells, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein\u2013binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1). GPIHBP1 binds LPL within the interstitial spaces and transports LPL across endothelial cells to its site of action in the capillary lumen (<a href=\"#bib1\">Beigneux et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Davies et al., 2010</a>).

The hallmark of this protein family is a three-finger\u2013fold with a defined disulfide pairing motif involving eight highly conserved cysteines (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ploug, 2003</a>). Members of the LU domain family are widespread in the animal kingdom and occur as secreted proteins (e.g. SLURP1), integral membrane proteins (TGF\u03b2 receptors), and glycolipid-anchored proteins (e.g. CD59, GPIHBP1, C4.4A, uPAR). During evolution, the LU domain has evolved to serve many different purposes in mammals: GPIHBP1 transports LPL; CD59 inhibits complement activation; TGF\u03b2 receptors are involved in cytokine signaling; TEX101 regulates fertility; and uPAR focuses plasminogen activation on cell surfaces. Although detailed structure\u2013function relationships have been elucidated for a few mammalian LU domain proteins (e.g. TGF\u03b2 receptors, CD59, uPAR), progress in understanding the biochemistry and biophysics of protein interactions for the majority of LU domain proteins, including GPIHBP1, has lagged behind, largely because of the need for highly purified recombinant protein preparations."

First, GPIHBP1 function is tightly linked to human disease as a variety of loss-of-function mutations in GPIHBP1 have been encountered in humans with familial chylomicronemia (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beigneux et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buonuomo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Olivecrona et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Plengpanich et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rios et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Surendran et al., 2012</a>). The majority of these disease-causing mutations impair the folding of the LU domain, leading to multimerized and dysfunctional GPIHBP1 molecules on the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beigneux et al., 2015</a>). In a comprehensive screening of GPIHBP1 mutants, one mutant (GPIHBP1<sup>W89S</sup>) was found to have markedly impaired LPL binding despite being monomeric, suggesting that it retained the\u00a0native folding of its LU domain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beigneux et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beigneux et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, several mutations in the CTD of LPL (e.g. C418Y, first identified in a patient with chylomicronemia) have no effect on catalysis but abolish the ability of LPL to bind to GPIHBP1 (and thus prevent LPL transport across endothelial cells) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Henderson et al., 1996</a>).

In the case of GPIHBP1, the N-terminal extension is highly enriched in acidic residues, with 21 of 26 consecutive amino acids in human GPIHBP1 being aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Early studies in cell culture suggested that GPIHBP1\u2019s acidic domain is important for GPIHBP1\u2022LPL interactions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gin et al., 2008</a>), but a detailed study of the functional impact of the acidic domain on LPL function has been lacking.

Our studies show: (1) that the kinetics of LPL\u2022GPIHBP1 interactions are controlled by both the LU domain and the acidic domain of GPIHBP1; and (2) that the acidic domain is intrinsically disordered and is responsible for stabilizing the catalytic activity of LPL by inhibiting the inherent instability and subsequent unfolding of LPL\u2019s catalytic domain."

However, this protein proved to be prone to an internal cleavage after Arg<sup>38</sup> during enterokinase-mediated removal of the uPAR tag. This unexpected cleavage event markedly reduced the yields of purified GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup>. Alignments of multiple primate GPIHBP1 sequences revealed that Arg<sup>38</sup> is not conserved during evolution. In GPIHBP1 from <i>Nomascus leucogenys,</i> which is 94% identical to human GPIHBP1, the residue corresponding to Arg<sup>38</sup> is Gly<sup>38</sup>. Based on these homology considerations, we therefore expressed and purified a modified protein in which Arg<sup>38</sup> was replaced with Gly; this construct yielded high levels of pure GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131/R38G</sup> along with moderate amounts of a truncated GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131/R38G</sup>. That truncated protein was the result of an additional cleavage after Arg<sup>33</sup>. Both GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> and GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131</sup> (lacking the acidic domain) were purified to homogeneity by cation-exchange chromatography (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The anomalous partitioning of GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> during size-exclusion chromatography is most likely a consequence of a large Stokes radius caused by the presence of an intrinsically disordered N-terminal peptide (see next section). Consistent with this assumption, GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131</sup>, which lacks the acidic domain, eluted with the expected hydrodynamic volume for a globular protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Unlike other members of this protein family, GPIHBP1 contains an N-terminal domain with 21 acidic amino acids (Glu, Asp). We propose that the first 30\u201335\u2009N-terminal residues in GPIHBP1 have a very high propensity for being an intrinsically disordered region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The disordered nature of the acidic domain is supported by: (1) the atypically large hydrodynamic volume of GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> compared with GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>); (2) its susceptibility to limited proteolysis after Arg<sup>33</sup> or Arg<sup>38</sup>; and (3) by the highly dynamic nature of the acidic domain as judged by extremely rapid hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange rates. In hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies, we observed 100% deuterium uptake in this domain even after the shortest exposure time (10 s) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and 1E</a>), which is consistent with the predicted deuterium uptake for a disordered GPIHBP1<sup>1\u201333</sup> peptide (87% after 1 s and 100% after 10 s). In the same experiment, HDX profiles of peptides within the LU domain followed the secondary structure prediction. The deuterium uptake in the isolated LU domain in GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131</sup> is indistinguishable from that of full-length GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which implies that the acidic N-terminal region has little or no effect on the structure of GPIHBP1\u2019s LU domain."

In particular, we observed markedly reduced deuterium uptake within strands D and E of GPIHBP1 when it formed a complex with LPL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This shift in the dynamics likely reflects a transition to a state with increased secondary structure and/or a direct engagement in a ligand-binding interface. The fact that the HDX-MS analysis of GPIHBP1 identified \u03b2-strand D as a candidate binding interface for LPL was not entirely unexpected given that a previous mutagenesis study had shown that individual alanine replacements of Thr<sup>85</sup>, Ser<sup>87</sup>, or Trp<sup>89</sup> in \u03b2-strand D impaired LPL binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beigneux et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, two missense mutations involving \u03b2-strand D have been associated with chylomicronemia in humans (i.e. Ser<sup>87</sup>\u2192Pro [<a href=\"#bib8\">Buonuomo et al., 2015</a>] and Thr<sup>88</sup>\u2192Arg [<a href=\"#bib53\">Surendran et al., 2012</a>]). Mutating residues within strand E of GPIHBP1 had little impact on LPL binding (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beigneux et al., 2011</a>). The reduced deuterium uptake that we recorded for strand E in the presence of LPL probably relates to a higher propensity for \u03b2-sheet formation in the setting of the GPIHBP1\u2022LPL complex. Strand E is one of the most versatile structures in LU proteins; it can adopt a random coil (snake venom \u03b1-neurotoxins), a \u03b2-strand (uPAR domains I and II), or an \u03b1-helix (CD59, Prod1, and uPAR domain III) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kriegbaum et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, the deuterium uptake in the intrinsically disordered N-terminal acidic domain did not change with LPL binding. That finding suggests that the acidic domain either does not participate in the binding interaction or more likely is involved in very transient binding events with LPL (interactions that do not lead to the formation of stable hydrogen bonds)."

To minimize possible confounding effects from the inherent instability of unoccupied LPL, we only included deuterium uptake values for 10 and 100 s for the three different states of LPL. Comparing these states, we identified residues 402\u2013419 in the CTD of LPL as the most likely interaction site for the LU domain of GPIHBP1 (shown in blue in the butterfly plot in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This assignment is based on the fact that GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup>, but not GPIHBP1<sup>1\u201333</sup>, attenuates the deuterium uptake in this particular region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Two missense mutations in or close to this segment (C418Y and E421K) were identified in patients with chylomicronemia (<a href=\"#bib27\">Henderson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Henderson et al., 1996</a>), and follow-up studies showed that both mutations impaired GPIHBP1 binding (<a href=\"#bib55\">Voss et al., 2011</a>). It is possible that additional regions in the CTD of LPL are involved in GPIHBP1 binding but escaped detection in our HDX-MS experiments due to the lower level of sequence coverage for the CTD (69%) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The impact of the acidic domain peptide (GPIHBP1<sup>1\u201333</sup>) on LPL deuterium uptake was less pronounced than with intact GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and 2B</a>), consistent with a more dynamic interaction (i.e.\u00a0a shorter residence time of the peptide on LPL). Notwithstanding the more transient interaction, we did nevertheless observe that GPIHBP1<sup>1\u201333</sup> reduced deuterium uptake in LPL peptides spanning residues 279\u2013293 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which is localized in the domain interface between the NTD and CTD of LPL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). It is noteworthy that this region contains one of the heparin-binding sites in LPL enriched in basic residues (Arg<sup>281</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, Arg<sup>284</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hata et al., 1993</a>) and therefore represents a potential binding partner for GPIHBP1\u2019s acidic domain."

The robustness of the assay is apparent by the repeat analyses of 250 nM GPIHBP1 at the end of each multi-cycle segment (blue curves in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and 3C</a>). In parallel, we analyzed the ability of soluble GPIHBP1 to bind to a CTD carrying a single amino acid substitution (C418Y).

When the LPL CTD<sup>C418Y</sup> was captured on immobilized mAb 5D2 (85 RU ~ 5 fmols/mm<sup>2</sup>), it lacked the ability to bind GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> or GPIHBPB1<sup>34\u2013131</sup>, even at concentrations as high as 1 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

For these studies, we incubated 5 \u00b5M LPL<sub>2</sub> at 25\u00b0C for various times and then traced changes in the solvent exposure of backbone amide hydrogens with a 10-s pulse labeling in D<sub>2</sub>O. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, we observed a pronounced global unfolding of the catalytic domain in LPL as reflected by the appearance of a bimodal signature in the isotope envelopes from the majority of peptic peptides derived from this domain (colored red in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This finding implies that the NTD of LPL most likely enters a pre-molten globule-like state with little maintenance of secondary structure. The disordering of the catalytic triad is evident by the bimodal isotope envelope for the peptide 131\u2013165, which encompasses active site residues Ser<sup>134</sup> and Asp<sup>158</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and 6B</a>). Of note, we also observed a time-dependent loss in both the triolein hydrolase and esterase activities of 2 \u00b5M LPL<sub>2</sub> with experimental conditions comparable to those for the HDX-MS studies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Unexpectedly, the time course for the inactivation of LPL catalytic activity appeared to be approximately twice as fast as the unfolding of the catalytic NTD documented by HDX-MS. With prolonged incubations, we did observe a more complete unfolding of the NTD by HDX-MS (74% unfolded after 180\u2009min and 90% after 240\u2009min). Of note, no changes were observed in the deuterium uptake of the CTD in LPL during the same time frame (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), consistent with a greater stability of that domain (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gin et al., 2012</a>)."

This model was initially suggested by the observation that full-length GPIHBP1 (GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup>) exhibits an unexpectedly large hydrodynamic volume (as judged by its elution profile in size-exclusion chromatography [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>]), whereas a truncated GPIHBP1 lacking the acidic domain (GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131</sup>) elutes at the expected position for a folded globular protein. The atypical elution profile for the full-length GPIHBP1 is indicative of a large Stokes radius and is one of the hallmarks of intrinsically disordered proteins (<a href=\"#bib54\">Uversky, 2012</a>). Further evidence for the disordered nature of the acidic domain is provided by its highly dynamic state as measured by HDX-MS. Our model offers potential insights into the interplay between GPIHBP1 and LPL during LPL mobilization and TRL processing in vivo. In GPIHBP1-deficient mice, the LPL in tissues is mislocalized to the interstitial spaces and never reaches the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells. It is noteworthy that the LPL in GPIHBP1-deficient mice remains sequestered in the interstitial space, presumably bound to negatively-charged heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davies et al., 2010</a>). This interaction is thought to be driven by electrostatic interactions and is characterized by fast kinetic rate constants (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lookene et al., 1996</a>), presumably creating a dynamic reservoir of LPL within the interstitial spaces. In wild-type mice, newly secreted LPL likely binds to the same HSPGs but then moves to GPIHBP1 on capillary endothelial cells. We propose that the intrinsically disordered and markedly acidic N-terminal extension of GPIHBP1 plays an important role in mobilizing HSPG-bound LPL within the interstitial spaces through long-ranged electrostatic interactions, thereby driving LPL into association with endothelial cells. This model for LPL mobilization by GPIHBP1 is consistent with the kinetic rate constants that we determined for GPIHBP1\u2022LPL interactions, which are 10-fold faster for intact GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> than for GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131</sup> lacking the acidic domain."

This encounter complex then guides the maturation of the interaction, facilitating a tighter binding interface between GPIHBP1\u2019s LU domain and residues 402\u2013419 in LPL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

Second, there is ample evidence for the involvement of additional CTD sequences\u2014apart from positively charged residues\u2014in the binding of LPL to the LU-domain in GPIHBP1. For example, two missense mutations in LPL (C418Y and E421K), first identified in patients with chylomicronemia, have no effect on heparin binding but abolish binding to GPIHBP1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Henderson et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Henderson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Voss et al., 2011</a>).

This conclusion was based on SPR studies in which GPIHBP1 (from the medium of transfected CHO cells) had been captured onto chips coated with the anti-GPIHBP1\u2013specific mAb 11A12. To obtain reliable fits for the LPL-binding profiles recorded by SPR and reduce nonspecific binding of LPL, these authors performed their analyses at 4\u00b0C and in the presence of 0.4\u20130.6 M NaCl. In the current study, the SPR data were obtained under more physiologic conditions (20\u00b0C in 0.15 M NaCl), and the binding profiles fit well to a simple 1:1 interaction model (i.e. GPIHBP1+LPL<sub>2</sub>\u21c6 GPIHBP1\u2022LPL<sub>2</sub>). A likely explanation for the discrepancy between the two studies is the different designs of the SPR studies. The current study measured the binding of purified, monomeric GPIHBP1 in solution to purified LPL that had been captured by mAb 5D2 thereby avoiding the inherent difficulties in having LPL as a soluble analyte. The earlier study measured the interaction between LPL in solution to mouse GPIHBP1 (from the medium of transfected CHO cells) that had been captured on mAb 11A12. We now know the GPIHBP1 secreted from transfected CHO-cells contains significant amounts of dimers and multimers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beigneux et al., 2015</a>), a factor that would further complicate the interpretation of these SPR data."

The involvement of this 'interdomain interface' of LPL in binding GPIHBP1<sup>1\u201333</sup> was bolstered by zero-length cross\u2013linking studies. The interaction between LPL Lys<sup>298</sup> (in close spatial proximity to peptide 279\u2013290) and GPIHBP1\u2019s acidic domain was covalently trapped by EDC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The fact that the acidic domain interacts with the domain interface of LPL in the setting of a mature GPIHBP1\u2022LPL complex likely carries functional implications. Indeed, the stabilization of the catalytic domain of LPL by GPIHBP1<sup>1\u2013131</sup> was primarily mediated by GPIHBP1<sup>1\u201333</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We suspect that the stabilization of LPL\u2019s 'interdomain interface' by GPIHBP1\u2019s acidic domain serves to limit protein dissociation/unfolding of the partner monomers of an LPL homodimer. Genetic evidence provides circumstantial support for the importance of a properly assembled interdomain interface for LPL activity. Certain homozygous missense mutations that are associated with reduced LPL activity and chylomicronemia [LPL<sup>E410V</sup>, LPL<sup>G409R</sup>, and LPL<sup>S259R</sup> in humans; LPL<sup>G412R</sup> in cats) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Foubert et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ginzinger et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kassner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Previato et al., 1994</a>)] are located at the interdomain interface in close spatial proximity to the proposed binding site in LPL<sup>279\u2013290</sup> for GPIHBP1<sup>1\u201333</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). All mutations alter the electrostatics of the interface. In future studies, it will also be very interesting to investigate if the accelerated inactivation of LPL by ANGPTL4 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sukonina et al., 2006</a>) involves this interdomain region and the extent to which GPIHBP1 protects LPL from ANGTPL4-mediated inactivation."

The authors use results of these studies in conjunction with homology modeling to propose a two-domain model for GPIHBP1 and its interaction with LPL. The model is further informed by studies of mutant proteins associated with hyperchylomicronemia. The authors propose that GPIHBP1 is comprised of a disordered acidic N terminal domain connected to a prototypical LU domain that mediates glycolipid anchoring to the plasma membrane. Both domains of GPIHBP1 are found to influence interactions with LPL, with the N-terminal interaction domain suggested to stabilize the catalytic domain of LPL and reduce loss of enzymatic activity upon warming to 20 degrees C. The authors interpret their findings with respect to the requirement of GPIHBP1 to move LPL from its site of secretion to the capillary lumen where it carries out lipolysis of triglyceride rich lipoproteins."

For this reason, we spent considerable time and effort (before performing any measurements) to optimize the SPR assay conditions so as to avoid confounding effects from the SPR matrix. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that an additional approach involving equilibrium binding kinetics would be useful to validate/substantiate our SPR data. One technology that we previously considered for such studies was microscale thermophoresis (MST). MST is a solution-based micro-method that allows a high degree of freedom in choosing the optimal buffer conditions. In new experiments, we labeled GPIHBP1 with 1.3 Alexa-647 fluorophores per GPIHBP1 molecule. We used a neutral pH during labeling chemistry to favor the modification of the \u03b1-amino group of the N-terminal acidic domain, and we made sure that the labeled protein remained monomeric. Using the MST approach, we measured a K<sub>D</sub> of 5.7 nM for GPIHBP<sup>1\u2013131/R38G</sup> and 147 nM for GPIHBP1<sup>34\u2013131/R38G</sup> for equilibrium LPL\u2013GPIHBP1 binding. These data are entirely consistent with the findings and the conclusions drawn from the SPR analyses\u2014although the absolute values differ slightly. In the revised manuscript, we have described the new data in the Results section (subsection \u201cKinetic rate constants for the interaction between GPIHBP1 and LPL\u201d, last paragraph), added a new Figure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and expanded the Methods section accordingly (subsection \u201cEquilibrium binding constants of the GPIHBP1\u2022LPL interaction by microscale thermophoresis\u201d)."
