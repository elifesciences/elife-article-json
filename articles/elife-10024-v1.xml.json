Here we present an NIR-stimulable optogenetic platform (termed \"Opto-CRAC\") that selectively and remotely controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive gene expression to regulate the function of non-excitable cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. When coupled to upconversion nanoparticles, the optogenetic operation window is shifted from the visible range to NIR wavelengths to enable wireless photoactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling and optogenetic modulation of immunoinflammatory responses. In a mouse model of melanoma by using ovalbumin as surrogate tumor antigen, Opto-CRAC has been shown to act as a genetically-encoded \"photoactivatable adjuvant\" to improve antigen-specific immune responses to specifically destruct tumor cells. Our study represents a solid step forward towards the goal of achieving remote control of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated activities with tailored function."
