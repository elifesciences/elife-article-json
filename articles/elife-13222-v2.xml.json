It has been understood that <i>bcd</i> RNA is sequestered at the anterior pole during oogenesis, is not translated until fertilization, and produces a protein gradient that functions in the syncytial blastoderm after 9\u201310 nuclear divisions. However, technical issues limited the sensitivity of analysis of pre-syncytial blastoderm embryos and precluded studies of oocytes after stage 13. We developed methods to analyze stage 14 oocytes and pre-syncytial blastoderm embryos, and found that stage 14 oocytes make Bcd protein, that <i>bcd</i> RNA and Bcd protein distribute in matching concentration gradients in the interior of nuclear cycle 2\u20136 embryos, and that Bcd regulation of target gene expression is apparent at nuclear cycle 7, two cycles prior to syncytial blastoderm.

One protein that is crucial for this process in fruit fly embryos is Bicoid. Thirty years ago, scientists discovered that Bicoid protein is concentrated at the head end of the embryo and gradually decreases in amount towards the rear end. This concentration gradient of Bicoid protein organizes the embryo body and regulates the expression of many genes, thus directing the cells to develop different identities."

It was thought that in the unfertilized egg, the mRNA molecules that will be translated to produce Bicoid proteins are stored in an inactive state in the region of the egg that later develops into the embryo\u2019s head. In the embryo, the mRNA molecules were believed to remain in the head region while being translated, with the newly formed proteins then gradually spreading from this site to create the Bicoid gradient. It was also thought that no Bicoid proteins are stored in the unfertilized egg. However, no known methods were sensitive enough to investigate these assumptions."

Furthermore, the Bicoid gradient forms when the embryo has fewer than 32 nuclei, much earlier in development than previously thought. The Bicoid protein also does not appear to spread passively towards the rear of the embryo, but is transported in a more orchestrated manner."

One, the early nuclear divisions are so rapid (9.6\u2009min) that productive gene expression has been deemed impossible. Two, molecular analyses of transcriptional activity have almost universally failed to detect RNA synthesis at pre-syncytial blastoderm stages, even as the sensitivity of the detection methods has increased.

Drosophila embryos are heavily populated with yolk and glycogen granules that impede histological studies, and have few obvious morphological features that can be evaluated for dependence on genotype. In addition, the idea that rapidly dividing nuclei are incapable of expression has no experimental basis because the capacity for transcription and translation at early nuclear cycles has not been analyzed. It is possible therefore that the normal transcriptional processes are sufficient for transcription units that are small (approximately 70% of transcripts made by nc10-12\u2009embryos lack introns; <a href=\"#bib6\">De Renzis et al., 2007</a>), or it may be that yet unexplored mechanisms produce and use transcripts more rapidly at early stages."

To do so, we needed to develop methods that overcome the technical impediments that have limited analysis of the early stages. For instance, because Drosophila fertilization cannot be made synchronous and because females hold their embryos for variable periods prior to laying, an embryo of any particular stage must be identified histologically and individually, and methods must be used that are sensitive enough to detect expression from a small number of active genes in the small number of nuclei. Although molecular detection methods have improved, antibody staining and in situ hybridization have been ineffective due to the large number of yolk and glycogen granules that reduce signal to noise and sensitivity. By using sensitive methods that we modified for studies of the early embryo, we found that the processes that generate the Bcd protein gradient are more complex and operate earlier than had been appreciated, and that the function of the Bcd gradient begins prior to formation of the syncytial blastoderm."

Both nuclear dot and cytoplasmic fluorescence was higher at nc11\u2009relative to nc9, and was also higher in embryos produced by mothers with six <i>bcd</i> genes. The panel with a high magnification view of a nc9\u2009pro-metaphase nucleus shows that both dots in this nucleus appear to be at visible chromosome arms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Nuclei in embryos that have one <i>Kr</i> gene had only one dot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These observations suggest that the in situ hybridization method detected nascent transcripts that were chromosome-associated, as well as mature transcripts in the cytoplasm. The increase in dot brightness during the nuclear cycle suggests that the in situ hybridization signal is proportional to the quantity (number and length) of transcripts, and although the longer nuclear cycle at nc11\u2009relative to nc9\u2009may account for the increased signal at the later cycle, the signal increase observed in embryos with additional Bcd dosage was not expected."

Chromosomes in nuclei at the cortex of syncytial blastoderm embryos are organized and polarized such that the centromeric regions congregate apically and the telomeres congregate basally (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marshall et al., 1996</a>). Chromosome organization in nuclei at earlier, pre-syncytial blastoderm stages has not been examined previously. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>\u2009characterizes nuclear and background dots in nc7\u2009and nc8\u2009embryos with respect to proximity to the embryo cortex. Nuclei at nc7\u2009and nc8\u2009are approximately 34\u2009\u03bcm and 22\u2009\u03bcm, respectively, from the embryo surface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3\u2009C,D</a>). Comparison of fluorescence levels of these dots in successive confocal optical sections revealed that whereas the dots in nuclei were in the basal sections, dots not in nuclei (and attributed operationally to background) were apical. Because the <i>Kr</i> gene is at the tip of 2R (polytene band 60F5), this result suggests that nuclei are polarized prior to their arrival at the cortex and it is consistent with the conclusion that the nuclear dots mark sites of <i>Kr</i> transcription."

We developed a method for antibody staining of early embryos that has high signal-to-noise sensitivity (see Materials and methods), and used it to monitor Bcd in the pre-cellular stages. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>\u2009shows dorsal views of nc4-14\u2009embryos that were either from normal mothers (WT), or that were from mothers that were mutant for <i>exuperentia (exu</i>) or <i>staufen (stau</i>). Function of the <i>exu</i> and <i>stau</i> genes during oogenesis is essential to localize <i>bcd</i> mRNA at the anterior pole and for the Bcd gradient in syncytial blastoderm embryos (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib23\">Kugler and Lasko, 2009</a>). The Bcd protein gradient detected by this method in WT and mutant embryos at syncytial blastoderm stages was consistent with previous reports. It extended to approximately 60% embryo length in WT nc12\u2009embryos. In the syncytial blastoderm stages of embryos from mutant mothers, the gradient extended more posteriorly and the apparent levels of Bcd protein were higher than WT, especially at late nc14\u2009when Bcd protein was low in WT. Although the Bcd protein levels appeared to be higher in the mutant embryos, Q-PCR analysis showed that the levels of <i>bcd</i> RNA was similar in the WT and mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The late persistence of Bcd protein was particularly pronounced in embryos that lacked maternal <i>stau. Kr</i> expression in <i>exu</i> and <i>stau</i> embryos was robust but misplaced, and was broader than the normal in nc13\u2009and nc14\u2009<i>stau</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The medial plume was increased in the nc4\u2009embryo, and more so in the nc6\u2009embryo. Nuclei in these embryos were in the interior and enveloped by the medial plume and had multiple fluorescent puncta. The nuclei appeared to concentrate Bcd protein, with higher levels of fluorescence in the more anterior nuclei. Fluorescence was apparent only in the most anterior nuclei of nc4\u2009embryos but could be detected in a concentration gradient that encompasses all of the nuclei in nc6\u2009embryos. Analysis of composite projection images and optical sections showed the Bcd protein detected by the antibody was mostly in the interior regions and increased in amount and extended more posteriorly from nc2-nc6. Although no medial plume was observed in nc4\u2009and nc6\u2009embryos that were from <i>exu</i> mothers, staining by the anti-Bcd antibody was apparent and fluorescent punctae were visible in nuclei of the nc6\u2009mutant embryo.

Although Bcd protein was detected in unfertilized eggs, the assumption was made that stage 14\u2009oocytes have anterior-localized RNA but no Bcd protein, and that the protein in unfertilized eggs was produced in conjunction with egg activation and egg laying. However, because there have not been suitable methods for fixation and preparation, previous studies of stage 14\u2009oocytes have been limited to in situ hybridization analysis of ovarian sections (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frigerio et al., 1986</a>). In contrast to younger oocytes, stage 14\u2009oocytes have vitelline membrane and chorion layers that reduce permeability, but they are sensitive to hypochlorite and organic solvent treatments that are resisted by the fully formed vitelline membrane and chorion layers of subsequent stages. We sought methods to examine <i>bcd</i> RNA and protein in stage 14\u2009oocytes because our analysis revealed that significant levels of Bcd protein are present in early nc1\u2009embryos and unfertilized eggs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

This concavity does not fully resolve into a blunt nose cone until mid nc1. In situ hybridization also detected <i>bcd</i> RNA in a band that follows the anterior concavity of stage 14\u2009oocytes. This RNA distribution was similar to the Bcd protein except that in contrast to the protein, it was detected at stage 12 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and 13 (not shown) and all periods of stage 14. These results show that the translation block that inhibits Bcd protein production is relieved prior to fertilization and egg activation, and shows that Bcd protein is produced and is present precisely at the site where <i>bcd</i> RNA is sequestered."

Whereas the centromeric regions of the chromosomes coalesce to form a chromocenter that is at the most apical aspect of the nuclei, the telomeres congregate basally (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marshall et al., 1996</a>). Our in situ hybridization experiments located nascent transcripts at the <i>Kr</i> gene, which is situated just proximal to the telomere of chromosome 2R, and analysis of serial optical sections revealed that the nascent transcripts are at the basal regions of nc7\u2009and nc8\u2009nuclei (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These nuclei are approximately 34\u2009\u03bcm and 22\u2009\u03bcm, respectively, from the embryo surface, indicating that nuclei in the interior of the embryo are organized and polarized with respect to the cortex. The idea that internal chromosome organization is related to gene expression (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marshall et al., 1996</a>) is consistent with our finding that these nuclei are transcriptionally active. Nuclear divisions in the pre-syncytial blastoderm embryo are precisely synchronized even as the nuclei move to collectively occupy larger volumes of the embryo at later nuclear cycles, and the choreography they follow as they move to the cortex is highly reproducible. Our finding that nuclei are oriented prior to their arrival at the cortex indicates that their apical-basal polarity is not a consequence of short-range interactions with the cortex, and suggests that a global system of structural organization and regulation exists in the early embryo."

Previous studies reported that Bcd protein was absent from stage 13\u2009oocytes but present in embryos and unfertilized eggs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Driever and Nusslein-Volhard, 1988b</a>). Although stage 14\u2009oocytes were not examined, the assumption that Bcd protein is also absent from stage 14\u2009oocytes was the basis for the current model that translation of Bcd protein begins at egg activation. Our finding that Bcd protein is made in late stage oocytes prior to activation and fertilization (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) revises this model, but does not fundamentally change it. The distribution of Bcd protein in stage 14c and 14d oocytes is consistent with the idea that Bcd protein is made by mRNA that was localized to the anterior end. Its production in the oocyte raises the question whether Bcd protein is made only in the oocyte and not in the embryo, but this seems unlikely because the level of staining by \u03b1-Bcd antibody increased during the pre-cellular cycles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

One is based on the observation that both <i>bcd</i> mRNA and Bcd protein distribute in concentration gradients at syncytial blastoderm stages (nc9-14), and because of the spatial relationship between these distributions, it posits that the Bcd protein gradient is a direct consequence of the location of <i>bcd</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fahmy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Spirov et al., 2009</a>). This model does not require or invoke a role for protein diffusion, but proposes instead that a process of directed and regulated transport produces a concentration gradient of <i>bcd</i> mRNA that precedes and generates the Bcd protein gradient. The second model also involves a gradient of <i>bcd</i> RNA, but because the <i>bcd</i> RNA was not observed to extend as far posteriorly as Bcd protein, it proposes a major role for Bcd protein diffusion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Little et al., 2011</a>). Although our studies of pre-syncytial blastoderm stages do not address the RNA and protein distributions at the later syncytial blastoderm stages, they are likely to be relevant to them."

Although these distributions were constantly changing, the approximate match between the RNA and protein patterns remained constant. The RNA and protein were tightly concentrated at the anterior end of stage 14\u2009oocytes, broader in nc1\u2009embryos, and formed a graded internal plume that extended the farthest toward the posterior in nc3-4\u2009embryos. The plume had complex geometries that were not radially symmetric, but after nc6-7, the internal plume was no longer visible and most of the <i>bcd</i> RNA and protein was near or at the cortex. The cortical distributions were radially symmetric. The mechanisms that generate these distributions are not known, but because the patterns of <i>bcd</i> RNA and protein are so similar, we suggest that the mechanisms are probably related. Although these mechanisms cannot be deduced from the geometries of the distributions, the complex and well-defined shapes and the rapidity with which the distributions form and change would seem to be incompatible with passive diffusion."

We assume that the <i>bcd</i> RNA and Bcd protein of the early, first gradient contribute to the second, and therefore call this a two-step model. This model contrasts with the models that have been proposed previously in which the dispersion of protein (and RNA) from the anterior pole is continuous during both the pre-syncytial blastoderm and syncytial blastoderm stages (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Although the two-step model is presumably generated by motor-driven directed movement, the high yolk content of the embryo cytoplasm has impeded analysis of its cytoskeletal elements.

We also detected a concentration gradient of nuclear Bcd protein at the nc6\u2009stage, when the embryo has just 32\u2009nuclei that are deep in the interior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and observed that the both the internal and cortical Bcd gradients as well as both internal and cortical <i>Kr</i> expression were abnormal in <i>exu</i> and <i>stau</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2009and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results show that Bcd regulates <i>Kr</i> in nuclei that are far from the cortex, and importantly, that the internal plume of Bcd protein is a functional distribution. These findings therefore establish that it is the pre-syncytial blastoderm, internal Bcd gradient that regulates gap gene expression and organizes the embryo\u2019s anterior/posterior axis. Although these findings do not imply what the role of the subsequent cortical Bcd gradient in the syncytial blastoderm stages Bcd gradient might be, it is most likely that the cortical gradient derives from the earlier distribution and therefore that it reflects the outputs of the pre-syncytial blastoderm, internal gradient."

The generation of the Bcd concentration gradients in the pre-cellular embryo would appear to have little in common with the gradients that form by cytoneme-mediated dispersion across fields of cells, but we pose the question whether they do.

The formation of the bicoid protein gradient by the regulated translation of maternally localized <i>bcd</i> mRNA represents a key aspect of this process, one that has become the textbook example of a \"morphogen gradient.\" However, the mechanisms which shape the gradient remain imperfectly understood and competing models have been put forward. The consensus opinion among the reviewers is that the work presented here adds to our understanding of <i>Drosophila</i> embryo patterning and Bcd gradient formation."

                    "text": "Several important findings are reported. (1) The gap gene <i>Kr</i> is expressed as nascent transcripts by nuclear cycle 7 and 8 (nc7 and 8) at the proper location (2) in nuclei that are already polarized (as these transcripts are associated with chromosome arms and located basally; <i>Kr</i> is located at the telomere), i.e., prior to their arrival at the cortex. (3) Bcd protein is visible in a concentration gradient already at nc2 to nc6, which depends also at early presyncytial blastoderm stages on the presence of maternal Stau and Exu proteins. (4) At these early presyncytial blastoderm stages, the Bcd protein gradient extends posteriorly in what the authors call a medial plume rather than at the cortex as at later stages. This proves that the process of gradient formation must be more complex than previously thought. (5) The distribution of <i>bcd</i> RNA is very similar to that of Bcd protein also at these early cleavage stages (nc2 \u2013 nc6), with the medial plume reaching its maximum intensity at nc4. (6) The authors detected Bcd protein already at nc1 and (7), most astonishingly, in stage 14c and 14d oocytes, again coincident with the anterior location of <i>bcd</i> RNA in oocytes. (8) In contrast to <i>bcd</i> RNA, which was evident in oocytes at earlier stages, Bcd protein was not detected before stage 14c. This demonstrates that the translational block of <i>bcd</i> mRNA is relieved prior to fertilization and that Bcd protein is present precisely where <i>bcd</i> mRNA is sequestered."

This gradient is followed by a cortical gradient, consistent with a model previously proposed (Spirov et al., 2009). This latter model and the model proposed by the authors are consistent with the gradient being formed by the <i>bcd</i> mRNA that, by translation, produces the Bcd protein gradient although the authors are more conservative. The most important conclusion is that mechanisms of morphogen gradient formation in general are not dependent on passive diffusion, overthrowing a tenet maintained over many decades, but \"appear to involve dispersion along cytoskeletal cables.\""
