However, it remains unclear how this process evolved during the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms. To address this question, we investigated transcriptional dynamics in the ichthyosporean <i>Creolimax fragrantissima</i>, a relative of animals that undergoes coenocytic development. We find that <i>Creolimax</i> utilizes dynamic regulation of alternative splicing, long inter-genic non-coding RNAs and co-regulated gene modules associated with animal multicellularity in a cell-type specific manner. Moreover, our study suggests that the different cell types of the three closest animal relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates) are the product of lineage-specific innovations. Additionally, a proteomic survey of the secretome reveals adaptations to a fungal-like lifestyle. In summary, the diversity of cell types among protistan relatives of animals and their complex genome regulation demonstrates that the last unicellular ancestor of animals was already capable of elaborate specification of cell types."

However, it remains unclear how this process evolved during the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms. To address this question, we investigated transcriptional dynamics in the ichthyosporean <i>Creolimax fragrantissima</i>, a relative of animals that undergoes coenocytic development. We find that <i>Creolimax</i> utilizes dynamic regulation of alternative splicing, long inter-genic non-coding RNAs and co-regulated gene modules associated with animal multicellularity in a cell-type specific manner. Moreover, our study suggests that the different cell types of the three closest animal relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates) are the product of lineage-specific innovations. Additionally, a proteomic survey of the secretome reveals adaptations to a fungal-like lifestyle. In summary, the diversity of cell types among protistan relatives of animals and their complex genome regulation demonstrates that the last unicellular ancestor of animals was already capable of elaborate specification of cell types."

As the development of complex multicellularity is dependent upon differential genome regulation, the evolutionary onset of animal multicellularity must likewise have involved the appearance of differential genome regulatory capacities leading to distinct cell types. Many of the genes involved in the control of animal development and cell type identity, including signaling pathways and transcription factors (TFs), pre-date animal origins (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Suga et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Richter and King, 2013</a>). As these genes are known to be present in the genomes of the protistan relatives of animals, the unicellular holozoans (<a href=\"#bib46\">King et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Suga et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fairclough et al., 2013</a>), the evolution of complex multicellularity, with cell\u00a0type-specific transcriptional programs, must have involved changes in gene regulation. Therefore, a key step in understanding the evolution of multicellularity will be to infer the regulatory complexity of the last common ancestor of all living animals."

Three distinct developmental modes that lead to transient simple multicellular forms have been described in the protistan relatives of animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Suga and Ruiz-Trillo, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dayel et al., 2011</a>). Colonial clonal development has been shown to involve differential regulation of a few multicellularity-related genes in the choanoflagellate <i>Salpingoeca rosetta</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fairclough et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, the filasterean amoeba <i>Capsaspora owczarzaki</i> exhibits up-regulation of adhesion-related genes in its aggregative stage (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2013</a>). To date, however, there has been no molecular characterization of coenocytic development, a third and completely distinct mode of development observed in the ichthyosporeans. Ichthyosporeans are the earliest branching holozoan lineage (<a href=\"#bib96\">Torruella et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Paps et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Torruella et al., 2015</a>), and coenocytic development is a shared feature within the group (<a href=\"#bib30\">Glockling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Mendoza et al., 2002</a>). This developmental mode comprises a growth stage in which nuclei divide synchronously within a common cytoplasm before undergoing cellularization, followed by release of motile ameboid zoospores (<a href=\"#bib91\">Suga and Ruiz-Trillo, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Marshall et al., 2008</a>). These stages have distinct physiological and structural characteristics, the amoeboid stage is mono-nucleated, non-diving, and motile (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), while the multinucleate stage has a cell wall, a big central vacuole, and does not move (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Despite being quite distinct from canonic animal development, coenocytic development and multinucleate cell types are found in some animal lineages, such as in Drosophila syncytial blastoderm (<a href=\"#bib91\">Suga and Ruiz-Trillo, 2013</a>). Thus, in order to infer ancestral regulatory complexity by comparison of premetazoan developmental modes, it will be essential to obtain a detailed molecular characterization of ichthyosporean coenocytic development."

To address whether that is the case for the multinucleate stage in <i>Creolimax</i>, we compared the stage-specific expression level of all the TFs encoded in the genome. Contrary to our expectation, the comparison revealed that TF expression is higher in the amoeboid stage (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Among the 127 putative TFs found in the genome, only 5 are significantly up-regulated in the multinucleate stage. These five genes have DNA binding domains with ambiguous TF activity and include genes containing Myb_DNA-binding and cold-shock domains (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In the amoeboid stage, we found significant up-regulation of 11 TFs, including T-box, Runx and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis TFs, and TF classes that have important roles in animal development (<a href=\"#bib81\">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2011</a>). Altogether, these data indicate that, unlike in animal development, the multinucleate stage of <i>Creolimax</i> is not characterized by a tight regulation of adhesive, signaling, and TF activities."

To evaluate the extent to which alternative splicing expands transcriptome complexity in the intron-rich genome of <i>Creolimax</i> (6.5 introns per gene), we undertook a comprehensive analysis of intron retention and exon skipping (ES) events, and quantified their inclusion levels using previously developed pipelines (<a href=\"#bib9\">Braunschweig et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>) (see Material and methods). We observed 3927 intron-retention events that affected 2172 genes. In contrast, we found only 211 genes affected by ES. Despite having a two-fold higher intron density and longer introns compared to <i>Capsaspora</i>, both holozoan species show comparable alternative splicing profiles that are highly dominated by intron retention (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2013</a>). This provides further support for the hypothesis that ES-dominated alternative splicing is a unique feature of animal transcriptomes (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mcguire et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Irimia and Roy, 2014</a>)."

We found 865 introns with differential retention between stages (differential percent intron retention (\u0394PIR) &gt;15), the majority of which were more retained in the amoeboid stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays confirmed differential retention for all 10 tested introns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Despite these marked differences in intron retention between stages, the size distribution of retained introns was similar in both stages, and comparable to that of constitutively spliced introns (PIR&lt;2% in all samples) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). GO enrichment analysis of genes with amoeboid-specific intron retention revealed enrichment in spindle pole formation and other mitosis-related activities (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), supporting an active role of IR in down-regulating these functions in this stage. Indeed, consistent with recent reports in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Braunschweig et al., 2014</a>), genes with amoeboid-specific intron retention showed significantly lower steady-state mRNA levels compared to the multinucleate stage (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; p&lt;0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test; the converse was true for genes with multinucleate-specific intron retention). Therefore, intron retention is a conserved mechanism for reducing transcript levels in pathway-specific genes from unicellular holozoans to vertebrates."

To characterize the repertoire of long non-coding RNAs in <i>Creolimax</i>, we assembled a de novo transcriptome from the RNA-seq data. We filtered out transcripts shorter than 200 bp and mapped the rest to the genome. We then applied a pipeline to identify putative non-coding RNAs, including searches for coding potential, homology, untranslated region (UTR) mis-annotation, and low expression (see Material and methods). Restricting our search to transcripts that did not overlap with protein-coding genes, known as long-intergenic RNAs (lincRNAs ), we identified 692 putative lincRNA loci in <i>Creolimax</i>. In comparison to protein-coding transcripts, lincRNAs in <i>Creolimax</i> were shorter in length, harbored fewer exons, had longer exons, and had a lower GC content (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, overall transcription levels of lincRNAs were significantly lower than those of protein-coding genes (p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Interestingly, all those characteristics have been reported for animal lincRNAs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hezroni et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Pauli et al., 2012</a>; Gaiti et al., 2015)."

In <i>Creolimax</i>, the only significantly enriched GOs of lincRNA closest neighboring genes were metabolic activities (p&lt;0.01). However, when we analyzed the vicinity of all the TFs, we found that 23.6% had at least one neighboring lincRNA, a significant enrichment compared to the rest of the genome (14.5%, p=0.0007, Fisher\u2019s exact test). Next, we searched for putative homologs of the lincRNAs in the transcriptomes of closely related species and other unicellular holozoans, but we did not retrieve any positive hits. This pattern of rapid evolutionary sequence turnover of lincRNAs has also been described for animals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gaiti et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kapusta and Feschotte, 2014</a>), where homology detection based on sequence similarity is restricted to short evolutionary distances."

The human cell types with a higher positive correlation with the multinucleate stage were those with high proliferation rates, including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and transformed cell lines (293T, HeLA, K562) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Similar patterns were obtained using PCA on the normalized steady-state transcriptional levels from both species. PC1 explained most of the variability due to species-specific transcriptomic profiles, whereas PC2 distinguished between highly proliferative cell types and the rest in both species (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Consistent with this observation, GO enrichment analysis of the top 125 genes that most contributed to PC2 showed highly significant enrichment for genes involved in genome replication and proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These results suggest that a signal from the evolutionarily conserved machinery for cell proliferation in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harashima et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cross et al., 2011</a>) can be detected from direct expression pattern comparisons between the multinucleate stage of <i>Creolimax</i> and highly proliferative human cell types."

The core components of the integrin adhesome have been identified in <i>Capsaspora</i> (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, these components are significantly up-regulated in the aggregative stage (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, most integrin adhesome components have been lost in choanoflagellates (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sebe-Pedros et al., 2010</a>). In the case of <i>Creolimax</i>, we found a nearly complete repertoire of the integrin adhesome components (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), and most of them are significantly up-regulated in the amoeboid stage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To test whether the integrin adhesome components constitute a co-regulated gene module in the three unicellular holozoans (ichthyosporeans, filastereans, and choanoflagellates), we calculated the transcriptional Pearson correlation coefficients between all of the genes encoding the integrin adhesome for each species (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). In the case of <i>Creolimax</i>, we observed a remarkable co-regulation among all of the components. The only exception is the Src tyrosine kinase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), suggesting that tyrosine kinase signaling is not connected to the integrin signaling pathway in <i>Creolimax</i>, consistent with the absence of a focal adhesion kinase in the ichthyosporean lineage (<a href=\"#bib26\">Suga et al., 2014</a>). In the filasterean <i>Capsaspora</i>, we identified a more complex pattern of co-regulation, grouped in two submodules that are associated with specific paralogs of both <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i> integrins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This complex pattern of co-regulation could be affected by the number of <i>Capsaspora</i>\u2019s samples, higher than those analysed in <i>Creolimax</i>. In contrast, we did not detect any co-regulation among the few conserved integrin adhesome components in the choanoflagellate <i>Salpingoeca</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), suggesting that gene loss in the choanoflagellate lineage was accompanied by dismantling of this ancient co-regulatory module."

Although shedding of integrins has been observed during the inflammatory response in animals (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gomez et al., 2012</a>), the functional implications of integrin shedding in <i>Creolimax</i> remain elusive."

In contrast, an in-depth search for candidate ECM-related proteins and diffusible ligands based on Pfam domains (using known animal domains as EGF, DSL, or laminins) retrieved no positive hits. Thus, the proteolytic activity of the <i>Creolimax</i> secretome does not seem to be related to modifying the endogenous ECM, but possibly to the adaptation to a specialized osmotrophic feeding mode."

Trypsins are usually found in multiple copies in animal genomes, and they have important roles in the digestive system as serine proteases and also as ECM remodellers. To further complement these observations, we profiled a wide range of eukaryotes and found independent expansions of trypsins in other osmotrophic lineages (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Among these, two fungal species (<i>Coemansia reversa</i> and <i>Conidiolobus coronatus</i>) and an oomycete (<i>Saprolegnia parasitica</i>) are also animal-dwelling parasites, thus sharing a similar lifestyle to the known ichthyosporeans. Phylogenetic analyses of <i>Creolimax</i> trypsins (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) revealed that most are the product of rapid lineage-specific gene duplications, a common source of molecular adaptation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kondrashov, 2012</a>). Moreover, we found very distinct patterns of transcript and protein abundance (measured by the number of unique peptides identified) across the trypsin paralogs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), suggesting a rapid process of functional diversification. Thus, trypsins seem to be a recurrently used effector gene family in osmotrophic eukaryotes, and have evolved rapidly in <i>Creolimax</i>."

We therefore investigated LGT in <i>Creolimax</i> by building automatic taxon-rich phylogenies. Manual inspection of these trees yielded a list of 163 genes that confidently branched within bacterial clades, supporting bacterial origins. Of these, 35 (21.5%) were found only in <i>Creolimax</i> among all eukaryotes sampled, 50 (30.7%) were shared with the close relative <i>Sphaeroforma arctica</i>, and 71 (43.6%) were shared with other ichthyosporeans (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although most LGT genes (102 out of 163) were intron-less, the vast majority (143, 87.7%) showed transcriptional support from our polyA-selected RNA-seq, minimizing the possibility of bacterial contaminations. LGT from bacteria accounts for 1.8% of the total proteome, which is slightly higher than in other eukaryotic genomes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alsmark et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, we found 6 genes acquired by LGT in the in vivo secretome and 18 more in the in silico secretome (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, similar to other eukaryotic lineages (<a href=\"#bib74\">Richards et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Richards et al., 2011</a>), ichthyosporeans have enriched their osmotrophy-related gene complement through prokaryotic LGT."

CotH proteins were first described as being fundamental for spore coat formation in the bacteria <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Naclerio et al., 1996</a>), but they have recently been characterized as critical factors for host invasion in the fungus <i>Rhizopus oryzae</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gebremariam et al., 2014</a>). Our phylogenetic reconstruction of CotH family evolution revealed that the presence of CotH homologs in <i>R. oryzae</i> and other fungi (only belonging to the class mucorales) originated from an LGT event that was independent of those found in ichthyosporeans (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, both lineages have expanded their CotH family members after LGT acquisition. Moreover, CotH genes were also found in other eukaryotic and archaeal lineages, suggesting a complex history of interdomain LGT similar to that recently described for other gene families (<a href=\"#bib26\">Funkhouser-Jones et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chou et al., 2014</a>). Active gene duplication and domain shuffling characterized the evolutionary history of CotH in the ichthyosporea, where we could observe variable transcriptional levels and peptides among distinct paralogs, as well as the acquisition of an N-terminal LTD domain (PF00932) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Active transcription and secretion of <i>Creolimax</i> CotH genes in axenic culture conditions underscore their putative role in host invasion and highlight the importance of LGT in effector gene acquisition across different osmotrophic lineages."

These regulatory layers include complex mechanisms that also play a role in animal development and cellular differentiation. In <i>Creolimax</i>, differential genome regulation is not only limited to the transcriptional control of protein coding genes, but also includes cell-stage specific alternative splicing and lincRNA expression. Despite some global similarities to animal regulation, we observed significant differences in how these regulatory layers are deployed in <i>Creolimax</i> and animals. For example, the population of lincRNAs that we described in <i>Creolimax</i> does not show a major enrichment near developmental genes nor a highly specific cell\u00a0type-dependent expression, both hallmarks of metazoan lincRNAs (<a href=\"#bib94\">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gaiti et al., 2015</a>). The differential processing of the intron-rich genes during alternative splicing in <i>Creolimax</i> is dominated by IR and not ES. Although this is similar to most other eukaryotic groups including sponges (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fernandez-Valverde et al., 2015</a>), it contrasts with alternative splicing in more complex animals, which predominantly involves ES (<a href=\"#bib83\">Seb\u00e9-Pedr\u00f3s et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mcguire et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, while alternative splicing in <i>Creolimax</i> is likely to contribute to the regulation of gene expression, it does not provide a greater expansion of the proteome by generating multiple protein isoforms from individual genes as in animals (<a href=\"#bib26\">Irimia and Roy, 2014</a>)."

This is the case for most differentially expressed TFs, signaling pathways, and adhesion molecules, which are characteristically associated with animal development and multicellularity. In fact, our results indicate that the transcriptional profile of the multinucleate stage of <i>Creolimax</i> is more similar to those of highly proliferative cell types in humans, despite the obvious differences in cell morphology and cell division strategy (cell divison vs. coenocytic nuclear division). Thus, we consider that the multinucleate stage of <i>Creolimax</i> can be regarded as a highly specialized proliferative cell type. This cell type can be considered to function in a manner analogous to stem cells, with the undifferentiated nuclei dividing in the multinucleate cell before differentiation into amoeboid cells closes the lifecycle. This would suggest that separation of functions as crucial as self-renewal and differentiation can occur in a unicellular context in a temporal manner, which pre-dates the exclusive ability of multicellular organisms to engulf both functionally distinct cell types within a single entity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arendt, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hemmrich et al., 2012</a>). Drastic differences in cell structure, morphology, function, and molecular signatures found between stages in protistan relatives of animals indicate that cell stages can be considered cell types according to established definition (57 and see author\u2019s response section for an in-depth discussion on this topic)."

For example, we show that <i>Creolimax</i> has undergone secondary adaptation to a specialized osmotrophic feeding mode, shaping its secretome and genome through both gene duplication and acquisition of bacterial genes by LGT. These observations highlight the uniqueness of the different holozoan lineages, each representing derived specializations from an ancestral state. However, these specializations of unicellular holozoans are achieved through a largely common genetic toolkit shared with animals, including several signaling pathways, TFs and adhesion molecules (<a href=\"#bib76\">Richter and King, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Suga et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, many of the components of this toolkit are assembled in co-regulated gene modules preserved since the common ancestor of all holozoans, suggesting that recurrent recruitment of full co-regulated gene programs underlies the evolution of lineage-specific cell types and developmental modes (<a href=\"#bib66\">Newman, 2012</a>). Additional complementary insights on the evolution of developmental modes will be provided by studying the immediate out-group of the Holozoa and Holomycota (fungi + Discicristoidea) (<a href=\"#bib97\">Torruella et al., 2015</a>). The Holomycota show a wide variety of developmental modes, ranging from aggregative fruiting body formation to several modes of coenocytic development (<a href=\"#bib86\">Stajich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brown et al., 2009</a>)."

A widely accepted hypothesis states that the origin of animals involved a clonally dividing organism, similar to choanoflagellate colonies, that subsequently evolved specialized cellular differentiation (<a href=\"#bib45\">King, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Nielsen, 2008</a>). A competing hypothesis, however, suggests that pre-existing cell types and their associated molecular mechanisms were integrated in the spatiotemporal developmental dynamics of the last common ancestor of all animals (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mikhailov et al., 2009</a>). Our data suggests a third mixed model, in which the capacity to build differentiated cell types and transient multicellular entities was not a rare feature in pre-metazoan evolution. Nevertheless, the rise of animal multicellularity is not directly homologous to any ancestral developmental mode, and it may be seen as another derived specialization involving the integration of ancestral molecular modules and their associated cell behaviors into one single multicellular entity. Consequently, our results reveal the importance of obtaining complementary data from multiple lineages before significant insights can be gained into the organism that took the first steps on the road towards complex animal multicellularity."

To obtain biological replicates for the RNA extraction, three independent cell lines were isolated from distinct colonies grown on a marine agar plate (marine agar Difco 2216). Those initial isolates were then grown in liquid medium (marine broth Difco 2216). After one pass, new 1/10 subcultures (10 ml) were initiated and grown statically for 5 days in 25 ml flasks.

These 50 ml flasks were then grown for 48 hr with gentle agitation (150 rpm), allowing the mature coenocytes to form clumps. Then, the 50 ml flasks were filtered using a 5.0 \u03bcm Isopore membrane filter (Millipore ) and collected into a 50 ml Falcon tube . As only amoebas pass through the 5 \u03bcm filter step, filtered cells were then immediately pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rcf for 3 min and harvested to get the RNA from the amoeboid stage.

To avoid lineage-specific protein-coding genes, we performed an additional TBLASTX search against six frame translations of the de novo assembled transcriptomes of several closely related species (<i>S. arctica, Ichthyophonus hoferi, Pirum gemmata, Amoebidium parasiticum, Abeoforma whisleri, Corallochytrium limacisporum, C. owczarzaki, S. rosetta, Monosiga brevicollis</i>) and the protein coding genes of <i>Creolimax</i>, filtering out the positive hits (e-value &lt; e-3).

Additionally, we used the coding potential calculator (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kong et al., 2007</a>) to discard all those transcripts with putative coding potential (coding potential score &lt; \u22120.5). With the final list of transcripts, we selected those that did not overlap with gene+UTRs annotations or were close to uncertain assembly regions (multi-N stretches). For all those transcripts that were in a head-to-tail orientation regarding protein-coding genes, we manually inspected those that had an intergenic distance shorter than 1000 bp to the nearby gene to filter out misannotated UTRs. Additionally, we discarded transcripts overlapping repetitive regions of the genome. Finally, we collapsed all the remaining transcripts into single loci and quantified their expression level using Cuffcompare and Cufflinks (<a href=\"#bib94\">Trapnell et al., 2013</a>).

Instead of using PFAM, we gathered close orthologs of all the proteins in the genome by performing a BLASTP search against the NCBI non-redundant database plus the 108 eukaryotic genomes. Only those proteins that retrieved lower e-values for bacterial/archaeal hits were selected for downstream analysis. Those proteins were then separately searched using BLASTP against all bacteria in nr, all Archaea in nr, and the 108 eukaryotic proteomes. We selected those sequences that had at least 25 hits with an e-value under e-10, selecting a maximum of 50 proteins for bacteria, and 25 for archaea and eukaryotes. We got rid of redundancy using CD-HIT (<a href=\"#bib54\">Li and Godzik, 2006</a>) by filtering for 0.95 identity and then performed alignment, trimming, and phylogeny as described in the general pipeline above. The resulting trees were analyzed manually, taking LGT positives when <i>Creolimax</i> (and other ichthyosporean) sequences branched within bacterial clades with nodal bootstrap supports over 70%. Finally, we manually checked that the resulting LGT genes were found in distinct parts of the genome and not in genomic singletons. For those LGT candidates without introns and not found in any other ichthyosporean (therefore, <i>Creolimax</i> specific) we further checked if they were located in scaffolds with other genes containing introns. To further discard bacterial contaminations, the neighboring genes to LGT candidates were blasted against NCBI nr to verify their eukaryotic origins. When the immediate neighbor did not retrieve any hit, the following gene was searched."

The extensive suite of analyses incorporated into this manuscript could have led the authors to simply produce a catalog of observations; however, by focusing the interpretation of the results on biological inferences, the manuscript strays minimally. An example is provided by the range of analyses presented ranging from differences in expression levels, lincRNAs, and alternative splicing between the amoeboid and multinucleate stages, to detection of coregulation of various biological pathways, to analyzing the secretome."

It appears that the multinucleate stage shows higher expression of genes for cell proliferation, which are in turn enriched for intron retention in the amoeboid stage, confirming that the multinucleate stage has highly proliferative nuclei (since it was already known that these cells are diving cells). The authors should provide more information on how the GO categories and PFAM domains were assigned to larger groupings (grey circles in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In metazoan biology, different cell types have different biological functions that go beyond the capacity to divide or not (e.g., intestinal stem cells and hematopoetic stem cells have different epigenomic landscapes that facilitate the different functions of these cells, yet both cells are able to divide and though both cells will show differential expression of genes when they are quiescent vs. proliferating, those phases are considered to be just different stages of the same cell type). The statement in the second paragraph of the Discussion is not supported by these data \u2013 <i>C. frangrantissima</i> cells clearly go through a proliferative stage, but these functions are not \"segregated\" because the amoeboid and proliferative cells don't exist in one entity, they are separated temporally."

The authors' focus on thinking of these stages as \"types\" leads to some overstatements and reconsidering these statements in view of the biological functions would be more meaningful, e.g., the title of the section \"Evidence of species-specific cell type evolution in Holozoa\".

This section is rather brief, and could be made more valuable to the readers if we could learn some more details of the efficiency/correctness of their pipeline. For example, given that PASA can easily miss a gene if its transcripts do not align perfectly on the genome, how big was the fraction of Trinity transcripts which could be aligned to the genome but were rejected by PASA? How were the Augustus models verified not only during the training phase, but also the final gene models? It would be recommended to at least manually compare a sub-set of Augustus models with transcripts from Trinity, or computationally compare of e.g. intron-exon boundaries and UTRs predicted by Augustus with those in Trinity dataset."

The authors have now provided a table with p-values and GO categories that the differentially expressed genes were assigned to. This is very helpful, but I still am not sure how the authors came up with the \"more inclusive functions\". For example, GO:0060026 (name: convergent extension) does not have \"actin cytoskeleton\" as a parent category in the GO database. Of the thousands of human genes that fall in this GO:0060026, some are <i>sfrp</i> and <i>wnt</i>, which by no means have molecular functions directly related to actin cytoskeleton. So how was this GO term placed under the grey cloud of \"actin cytoskeleton\"? Are these classifications based on subjective decisions made by the authors? If so, I think that this should be made clear in the Methods section. Furthermore, I think this undercuts this point of this analysis \u2013 GO assignments and PFAM annotations provide unbiased ways of looking at large genomic datasets. If the authors then make subjective decisions on the inclusive categories, then they may be introducing bias. The authors also gave the example of the gene of the integrin adhesome that did not obtain the correct GO terms, which the authors corrected manually. However, they could do this for a set of genes they are very familiar with, but what about the many other genes that they are not as familiar with? This manual curation is certainly valuable when studying a specific set of genes, but, in analyzing large datasets, where an unbiased method is supposed to give you biological insight, this seems arbitrary."

Also, though they have edited the second paragraph of the Discussion, I think a more in depth discussion of cell-types vs. cell-stages, that explores the ideas in the authors\u2019 rebuttal, would greatly enhance the manuscript."

It appears that the multinucleate stage shows higher expression of genes for cell proliferation, which are in turn enriched for intron retention in the amoeboid stage, confirming that the multinucleate stage has highly proliferative nuclei (since it was already known that these cells are diving cells). The authors should provide more information on how the GO categories and PFAM domains were assigned to larger groupings (grey circles in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In that software the edges between the nodes are the genes shared by the enriched GOs, therefore clusters of connected GOs belong to a similar set of genes. From those clusters of GOs we obtained a more inclusive function by assessing which genes and functions were more redundant. For example, in the case of Protein Kinase activity or GTPase function, many GOs were associated to those more inclusive functions. Some unconnected nodes were grouped in the inclusive categories by similarity of the function. As a case example, Focal Adhesion GO appears unconnected to the rest of GOs related to the Integrin pathway. This is because one gene of the Integrin Adhesome did not retrieve the integrin GOs in the Blast2GO search, but it had a Focal Adhesion GO in the annotation step. Both GOs should share the same genes. It should be noted that Blast2GO performance in distant non-model organisms such as <i>Creolimax</i> has some limits of detection if compared to its performance in a species with close relatives sequenced and annotated in the databases (e.g. vertebrates or insects). Thus, we preferred to group the resulting GOs in inclusive categories rather than curating the GOs for each gene manually.

By definition, any cell type has special physiological or structural characteristics. The aim of comparative study of cell type characteristics is to elucidate the evolutionary diversification of cell types (cell typogenesis) by detecting the similarities and differences between them. Physiological and structural characteristics will be reflected by cell type-specific gene expression at some point, and therefore comparisons can be based on differential expression profiling data\u201d. In this case we observe two completely different cell types, not only restricted to their ability to proliferate. The multinucleate stage is not only a coenocyte (many nuclei sharing a single cytoplasm) but also has a thick cell wall reminiscent of those of fungi and has unique ultra-structural features (see Marshall et al., 2008, Protist). Moreover it has different biological functions to the amoeboid stage, not only division but also encystation, as multinucleate cells are able to stop growing under non-favourable circumstances. On the other hand, the amoeba stage lacks a cell wall, it is mono-nucleated and has a dispersal function."

Moreover, the closely related species from the Sphaeroforma genus, do not have this amoeboid stage (see Marshall and Berbee, 2013, Protist).

If we take the millions of years of divergence as a measure of relatedness, Ichthyosporeans and animals seem distantly related. But if we look at the whole array of known cellular life or eukaryotic diversity (more than 100 different lineages \u2013 see del Campo et al. Trends Ecol Evol, 29(5), 252\u2013259), it is clear that only filastereans and choanoflagellates appear closer to the animal group than ichthyosporeans. Therefore, we think that \u201cclose relative\u201d of animals is a valid term under the macro-evolutionary perspective used in this manuscript. Moreover, the major genomic similarities found between all the extant holozoan groups and stark differences with their sister group, the Holomycota, points towards this \u201cclose\u201d relatedness from a genomic level, which is the main topic of this manuscript (how lineages with similar genomic complements achieve different forms and developmental modes). Nevertheless, we now accommodate the reviewer\u2019s suggestions and we have deleted \u201cclose\u201d from all the sentences where \u201cclose relative\u201d appeared, including the title of the manuscript. As an exception, in the Abstract we now refer to the \u201cthe three closest animal relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates)\u201d, which truly reflects the phylogenetic position of this groups, as there is no other know group branching closer to animals than those three."

This phylogeny is depicted according to the latest and more comprehensive phylogenetic analysis designed to unravel Opisthokont relationships (Shalchian-Tabrizi et al., 2008, Plos ONE; Torruella et al., 2012, Molecular Biology and Evolution and Torruella et al., 2015, Current Biology)."

Depending on the method, the parameters, the evolutionary models and the backbone of the phylogeny used to calculate those estimates, results keep changing and giving very disparate ages. Given that this manuscript\u2019s focus does not include molecular clocks and there is not a consensus and \u201caccurate\u201d divergence time for the splitting of every holozoan group, we think including this information is detrimental to the manuscript, as it would attract criticism and controversy for a topic out of its focus. We have nonetheless mentioned this point in the figure legend and provide a reference to the review article mentioned above. It reads \u201cDivergence times of the lineages shown in this figure range between 700 Mya (considered the latest estimates of animal origins) and 1200 Mya (earliest estimates of Opisthokont origins) (Li and Godzik, 2006)\u201d."
