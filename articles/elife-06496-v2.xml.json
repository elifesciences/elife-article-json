                    "text": "Heterochromatic domains are enriched with repressive histone marks, including histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, written by lysine methyltransferases (KMTs). The pre-replication complex protein, origin recognition complex-associated (ORCA/LRWD1), preferentially localizes to heterochromatic regions in post-replicated cells. Its role in heterochromatin organization remained elusive. ORCA recognizes methylated H3K9 marks and interacts with repressive KMTs, including G9a/GLP and Suv39H1 in a chromatin context-dependent manner. Single-molecule pull-down assays demonstrate that ORCA-ORC (Origin Recognition Complex) and multiple H3K9 KMTs exist in a single complex and that ORCA stabilizes H3K9 KMT complex. Cells lacking ORCA show alterations in chromatin architecture, with significantly reduced H3K9 di- and tri-methylation at specific chromatin sites. Changes in heterochromatin structure due to loss of ORCA affect replication timing, preferentially at the late-replicating regions. We demonstrate that ORCA acts as a scaffold for the establishment of H3K9 KMT complex and its association and activity at specific chromatin sites is crucial for the organization of heterochromatin structure."

The pre-replication complex protein, origin recognition complex-associated (ORCA/LRWD1), preferentially localizes to heterochromatic regions in post-replicated cells. Its role in heterochromatin organization remained elusive. ORCA recognizes methylated H3K9 marks and interacts with repressive KMTs, including G9a/GLP and Suv39H1 in a chromatin context-dependent manner. Single-molecule pull-down assays demonstrate that ORCA-ORC (Origin Recognition Complex) and multiple H3K9 KMTs exist in a single complex and that ORCA stabilizes H3K9 KMT complex. Cells lacking ORCA show alterations in chromatin architecture, with significantly reduced H3K9 di- and tri-methylation at specific chromatin sites. Changes in heterochromatin structure due to loss of ORCA affect replication timing, preferentially at the late-replicating regions. We demonstrate that ORCA acts as a scaffold for the establishment of H3K9 KMT complex and its association and activity at specific chromatin sites is crucial for the organization of heterochromatin structure."

These experiments showed that several KMT enzymes can bind to a single ORCA protein at the same time.

We and others have demonstrated that ORCA and ORC associate with centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shen et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomic approach, ORCA-ORC complex has been shown to bind the repressive histone lysine methylation marks, specifically H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>) that are known to be enriched at heterochromatic sites. ORCA contains a WD domain, a structure known to interact with nucleosomes/histones (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wysocka et al., 2005</a>). We have previously demonstrated that the WD domain of ORCA is crucial for its binding to heterochromatin. Furthermore, ORCA is critical for stabilizing ORC binding to chromatin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shen et al., 2010</a>). ORC, a hetero-hexameric complex, in addition to serving as the landing pad for the assembly of pre-replicative complex at the origins of DNA replication, participates in sister chromatid cohesion, heterochromatin organization, and chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bell et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shimada et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sasaki and Gilbert, 2007</a>). In metazoans, ORC also facilitates the association of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to the H3K9me3-containing pericentric heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pak et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Prasanth et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2010</a>). Thus, it is obvious that ORC-ORCA complex associates with heterochromatin, but the mechanism underlying the recruitment of this multiprotein complex to the condensed chromatin and the functional relevance of such association has remained elusive for decades."

Methylation of H3K9 is an abundant and stable modification and is an important regulator of heterochromatin formation, gene silencing, and DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Martin and Zhang, 2005</a>). The methyl modifications on H3K9 exist in distinct mono-, di-, and tri-methyl states (H3K9me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3, respectively), with each responsible for governing distinct cellular functions. In general, H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 are associated with gene expression/repression at euchromatic regions, whereas the H3K9me3, enriched at pericentric heterochromatin, is required for heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing (<a href=\"#bib28\">Martin and Zhang, 2005</a>). The major KMTs catalyzing these modifications are G9a and GLP, responsible for H3K9me2 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tachibana et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rice et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</a>); SETDB1, which establishes H3K9 di- and tri-methylation in euchromatin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schultz et al., 2002</a>) and Suv39H1/H2 that establishes H3K9me3 from mono- or di-methylated H3K9 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rea et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Peters et al., 2003</a>). While the idea of G9a and Suv39H1 acting in distinct, primarily in non-overlapping chromatin contexts held sway for a long time, this concept has been recently challenged by the discovery of a complex consisting of multiple H3K9 KMTs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>). The multimeric complex contains all four H3K9 KMTs G9a, GLP, Suv39H1, and SETDB1 and is recruited to both pericentromeric heterochromatin and promoter of a set of G9a-repressed genes where it aids in gene repression by maintaining H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, destabilizing even one of these KMTs resulted in the disintegration of the multimeric complex and loss of the enzymatic activity of this complex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>). How this multimeric KMTs complex is recruited to specific chromatin sites remained to be determined. In the broader context, the functional significance of the crosstalk between chromatin modifying and replication machineries has remained largely unexplored."

Furthermore, ORCA is required for the formation and/or maintenance of the H3K9 KMT complex. Our results indicate that ORCA is required for the integrity of global chromatin architecture. In the absence of ORCA, human cells show alterations in the binding and activity of KMTs at sites enriched for these factors with concomitant reduction in H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks. Finally, we observe that the cells lacking ORCA display abnormal heterochromatin organization and alteration in the replication timing, specifically at the late-replicating regions. We propose that ORCA is a scaffold protein that is required for the establishment as well as maintenance of heterochromatin."

We observed robust interaction of endogenous ORCA with endogenous G9a and Suv39H1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Aa,Ab</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1Aa,Ab</a>). 1.31% of total G9a was found to be in a complex with ORCA. Quantitation was based on the amount of G9a immunoprecipitated with ORCA (based on 100% efficiency of ORCA IP, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (n = 7). Similarly, 1.44% of total Suv39H1 was in a complex with ORCA (n = 4). Note that only about 0.2% of the endogenous H3K9 KMTs co-purified with Suv39H1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using T7-tagged ORCA and Flag-tagged H3K9 KMTs revealed interaction of ORCA with G9a, GLP, and Suv39H1, all enzymes involved in the establishment of heterochromatin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ba,Bb</a>). In addition, we carried out IP from cell lines stably expressing Flag-tagged-G9a or GLP. IP from nuclear extracts using Flag antibody to determine the association of endogenous ORCA with the KMTs. ORCA along with Orc2 and MCMs was found to interact with the KMTs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Furthermore, transcriptional activation using doxycycline (DOX) causes the decondensation of the locus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Janicki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Shen et al., 2010</a>).

The WD domain of ORCA was able to recruit CFP-G9a (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ca,Cb</a>) corroborating our IP results (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1Aa</a>). Interestingly, when CFP-LacI-ORCA was co-transfected with YFP-G9a mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1Ba</a>), not only did the mutant YFP-G9a-1-618, which lacks the ankyrin repeats, show significantly reduced interaction but also YFP-G9a-1-965, which has an intact ankyrin repeat but lacks the SET domain, showed significantly reduced association with the locus (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1Ba,Bb</a>). We next addressed if the interaction of ORCA with G9a at heterochromatic regions required the catalytic domain of G9a in addition to its ankyrin repeats. YFP-LacI-G9a triple fusion protein was found to be enzymatically active as is evident by the accumulation of H3K9me2 at the CLTon locus upon the tethering of G9a full-length construct (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Tethering of YFP-LacI-G9a-\u0394SET or YFP-LacI-G9a-H1166K (a point mutant, which abolishes the catalytic ability of G9a) to the locus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Da</a>) failed to recruit CFP-ORCA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Da,Db</a>). However, co-IP experiments demonstrated that T7-ORCA could interact with GFP-G9a-\u0394SET (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). These data suggest that while the ankyrin repeat of G9a is sufficient for the association with ORCA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ba</a>), the interaction of ORCA and G9a at the heterochromatin also requires the methylating ability of G9a. Similarly, the interaction between ORCA and Suv39H1 requires the SET catalytic domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Bb</a>)."

ORCA-tethered decondensed locus, in addition to G9a, also failed to recruit HP1\u03b1, but contained Cdk9, a component of the pTEFB kinase complex, which is part of the transcription elongation complex (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) Two components of the ORC, Orc2, and Orc3 that require each other for their stability associate with one another at both the condensed and the open chromatin (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). These results indicate that while ORCA can interact directly with G9a and Suv39H1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ea,Eb</a>), the interactions could be dependent on or regulated by chromatin within the cells. In a cellular milieu, the fraction of ORCA directly interacting with G9a or Suv39H1, independent of chromatin, is likely to be a very small pool, and therefore, too weak to be detected at the CLTon locus."

This method is extremely sensitive and is a tour de force to examine protein complexes and also to accurately calculate the stoichiometry of proteins within the complexes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shen et al., 2012</a>). This approach obviates the need for ensemble experiments that require IPs with large quantities of cell lysates. Our initial estimates predicted that three grams of Flag-HA-Suv39H1-expressing Hela-S3 cell pellet, which is \u223c3 billion cells, is required for a single glycerol gradient sedimentation to obtain other H3K9 KMT signals detectable by Western blotting (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>). However, a relatively higher sensitivity can be achieved by the SiMPull approach by using only a million cells. We first measured the stoichiometry of ORCA bound ORC and H3K9 KMTs, respectively. We used cells co-expressing T7-ORCA and YFP-ORC1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ba\u2013Bd</a>) or T7-ORCA and YFP-KMTs to perform SiMPull (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ca\u2013Dd</a>). ORCA complexes containing YFP-ORC1 or YFP-KMTs were visualized as isolated fluorescent spots by single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bb,Cb,Db</a>). Pulldown by a control antibody (anti-HA) showed very low non-specific level of fluorescence, thereby demonstrating the high specificity of SiMPull assay. Individual fluorescence spots showed single- or multi-step decreases in fluorescence intensity corresponding to photobleaching of individual YFP molecules in a single complex (a representative schematic of the photobleaching analysis is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Aa</a>). After photobleaching analysis of many co-immunoprecipitated YFP-ORC1, YFP-G9a, and YFP-Suv39H1, we found that primarily one molecule each of ORC1, G9a, and Suv39H1 interacts with a single molecule of ORCA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bd,Cd,Dd</a>). In addition, we also observed that in a small population, ORCA associates with two molecules of G9a (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Cd,Ce</a>), suggesting that the ORCA-interacting-G9a may also be present as a homodimer."

                                "text": "Next, we investigated whether ORCA bound to KMTs also contains ORC by performing SiMPull using biotin-conjugated anti-T7 antibody with cells co-transfected with YFP-ORC1, mCherry-G9a, and T7-ORCA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ea</a>). To mimic endogenous expression levels of these proteins, we first systematically titrated the levels of plasmid transfected to obtain an expression of the candidate protein that is similar to endogenous levels (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1Aa</a>). Based on this analysis, we transfected 2 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells with 100 ng of each plasmid and then carried out SiMPull (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1Aa</a>, lane3). Complexes of T7-ORCA that contain YFP-Orc1 were detected in the green imaging channel and those containing mCherry-G9a were detected in the red imaging channel (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Eb,Ec</a>). After overlaying the two channels, 39 \u00b1 5% of YFP-ORC1 molecules colocalized with mCherry-G9a, indicating that all three proteins, ORC, ORCA, and G9a are found in a substantial fraction of single complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ec</a>). SimPull from cells that were transfected with higher concentration of plasmid showed similar extent of co-localization (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1Ab,Ac</a>). The results are consistent with our earlier study showing that ORCA is protected from ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis when bound to ORC and as a result is always associated with ORC (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shen and Prasanth, 2012</a>). Next, we tested whether multiple H3K9 KMTs exist in a single complex with ORCA using triple transfections of T7-ORCA, YFP-Suv39H1, and mCherry-G9a in U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Fa,Fc</a>, plasmid titrations: <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1Ba</a>, lane3 used for the experiment). Interestingly, we could observe \u223c55 \u00b1 7% of YFP-Suv39H1 colocalized with mCherry-G9a, (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Fc</a>). Similar results were obtained with higher concentration of plasmid transfection: (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1Bb,Bc</a>), suggesting the existence of a significant amount of ORCA-G9a-Suv39H1 complex. The true degree of cohabitation may be even higher because the fluorescent proteins may not all mature into active chromophores. This leads to dark molecules and appearance of either only green or only red spots even though both the KMTs are present in a complex. In addition, unequal expression of the transfected KMTs or the presence of endogenous KMTs in the complexes may also lead to a reduction in cohabitation detected by SiMPull. Finally, only a subset of G9a and Suv39H1 may exist as a single complex with ORCA (similar to reported data [<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>]). Elucidation of three different proteins in a single complex is one of the promised capabilities of SiMPull (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jain et al., 2011</a>), and the data we present here constitute one of the first demonstrations of such a capability."

Suv39H1 showed a decrease at these loci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Fa,Fb</a>), indicating that the loading of Suv39H1 to these regions is reduced upon ORCA depletion.

To address this, the association between the components of the KMT megacomplex, namely G9a and Suv39H1, was evaluated in cells that were treated with control or ORCA siRNAs. Flag-G9a and HA-Suv39H1 were expressed, and HA IP was carried out in control and ORCA-depleted (ORCA KD) cells. ORCA KD showed close to 50% reduction of Suv39H1 that co-immunoprecipitated with G9a (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Aa,Ab</a>). This observation suggested that the stability of the KMT complex requires ORCA. We used SiMPull to obtain an accurate quantitative estimate of the reduction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Ba\u2013Bc</a>). YFP-Suv39H1 and mCherry-G9a were expressed in cells depleted of ORCA. GFP pull-down was carried out, and the number of mCherry-G9a molecules associated with Suv39H1 was calculated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Bb,Bc</a>). ORCA KD led to \u223c50% reduction in the complexes containing YFP-Suv39H1 and mCherry-G9a (note, 24 \u00b1 3% mCherry-G9a pulled down by YFP-Suv39H1 in control vs 15 \u00b1 1% in ORCA knock-down cells; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Bc</a>).

                                "text": "In general, chromatin at the nuclear periphery is significantly enriched with H3K9me2, whereas H3K9me3 is preferentially enriched around nucleolus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yokochi et al., 2009</a>). Typically, both of these regions replicate late during S-phase indicating that in general repressive histone marks-containing differentially condensed chromatin influences replication timing and chromatin positioning (<a href=\"#bib20\">Julienne et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we investigated whether the changes in H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 deposition in specific chromatin regions, upon ORCA depletion, also influences their replication timing. We depleted ORCA in U2OS cells and then synchronized the cells so as to analyze the spatio-temporal regulation of replication during S-phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Samples were collected at 4, 8, 12 hr post release from aphidicolin arrest with BrdU pulse-labeling prior to sample collection. This was followed by immunofluorescence to score for cells in early, mid, and late S-phase of cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). At 8 hr and 12 hr time points post-aphidicolin release, ORCA depletion caused dramatic reduction in cells showing late replication patterns (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). BrdU (Bromodeoxyuridine)-PI flow cytometry results showed a significant reduction in BrdU incorporation in ORCA-depleted cells without significant changes in the early S-phase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). To determine if the changes in late replication pattern are a reflection of changes in the heterochromatin organization, we examined the replication timing of regions that showed a reduction in H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 upon ORCA KD. Initial analysis of the available repli-seq data set from various human cell lines in UCSC Genome Browser and ENCODE consortium revealed that the replication timing of large domains remains the same across cell lines. We, therefore, compared the H3K9me3 ChIP-seq data set to the HeLa repli-seq data set (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). HeLa-S3 G1b and HeLa-S3 S1 are deep sequencing data sets for late G1 and early S replicating regions in HeLa-S3 cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>). The chromosomal regions that are replicating at these two stages are shown in black (early) and late (gray) along the length of the chromosome (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

To investigate these possibilities, we conducted BrdU ChIP in control and ORCA-depleted U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1Ca\u2013Cc</a>). We depleted ORCA and arrested the cells using aphidicolin. The cells were then released into S-phase, pulse-labeled with BrdU, and analyzed by BrdU ChIP at different time points post-release (0, 4, 8, and 12 hr). The replication timing of various loci that showed significant reduction in H3K9me2 and me3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1Ca</a>) was assessed by quantitative PCR. We observed changes in replication timing of these loci (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1Cb,Cc</a> shows two representative loci CELSR3 and FAM20A) upon loss of ORCA. For example, in control cells a significant population of CELSR3 locus replicates in late S (12 hr post release) as evident by the BrdU ChIP signal at 12 hr. Upon ORCA KD, there is a significant increase in the population of the locus replicating during early S (4-hr time point) and a concomitant reduction in BrdU ChIP signal at mid and late S (8 and 12 hr time points) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1Cb</a>). The replication timing of C-FOS, a region that serves as a control showing no changes in H3K9me2 and me3 upon loss of ORCA, remains unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1Ca</a>), suggesting that the replication timing changes observed in ORCA-depleted cells may not be because of the direct role of ORCA/ORC in establishing the pre-replicative complex."

Depletion of a protein within a short, specific time window by RNA interference is challenging because even if the mRNA levels are dramatically reduced, the protein levels could persist for significantly longer times. This necessitates the use of a strategy that utilizes post-translation degradation process for reducing proteins levels efficiently. To achieve this, we utilized a commercially available Proteotuner kit (Clonetech). Briefly, an siRNA resistant version of T7-ORCA (T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV: non-targetable version) was tagged with a destruction signal or DD (destabilization domain) tag, a destabilization domain of the FKBP protein (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; [<a href=\"#bib2\">Banaszynski et al., 2006</a>]). This signal is recognized by the proteosomal machinery and results in the rapid degradation of the exogenous ORCA. In the presence of a ligand, Shield1, the DD tag is masked by the binding of Shield1, thereby preventing the degradation of the exogenous ORCA protein."

We observed a decrease in cells showing mid- and late- patterns of DNA replication and a concomitant increase in cells showing early patterns (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8Eb</a>), similar to our previous observations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In cells lacking ORCA, a large number of cells showing mid-replication patterns showed BrdU staining preferentially at perinucleolar regions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8Ea</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, we observed that H3K9me3 and HP1\u03b1 were mislocalized and formed perinucleolar rings in cells lacking ORCA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8Fa,Fb</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Such localization was reminiscent of HP1\u03b1 localization in Orc1- and Orc5-depleted cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, both control and ORCA-depleted cells progressed through S-phase at comparable rates (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) indicating that the observed defects in HP1\u03b1 localization and BrdU incorporation upon loss of ORCA are due to defects in heterochromatin and not due to indirect effects of defects in S-phase progression. Based on the results, we propose that the observed defects in heterochromatin organization in ORCA-depleted post-G1 cells are independent of its known functions in preRC assembly."

The ORCA-ORC complex associates with heterochromatin, including telomeric and centromeric regions, even after replication has been accomplished suggesting that ORCA-ORC complex may play key roles in heterochromatin organization in addition to its role in pre-RC. The WD-repeat-containing domain (also found in ORCA) mediates interaction of proteins with nucleosomes/histones (<a href=\"#bib49\">Suganuma et al., 2008</a>). For example, WDR5, a component of the MLL/SET1 KMT complex, binds to H3K4me2 using WD repeats (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ruthenburg et al., 2006</a>). Similarly, HIRA, a WD-repeat-containing protein, binds to core histones and controls transcription (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lorain et al., 1998</a>). Here, we demonstrate that ORCA associates with multiple H3K9 KMTs, binds to methylated H3K9, and regulates both the organization and replication of repressed chromatin marked with H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. Recently, a H3K9 KMTs multimeric complex has been identified that has been shown to be recruited to major satellite repeats and a subset of promoters of G9a-repressed genes and a functional cooperation of these enzymes is crucial for the regulation of G9a target genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsch et al., 2010</a>). We demonstrate that ORCA-ORC associates with the H3K9 KMT-containing complex and in the absence of ORCA, this complex disintegrates. The loss of the enzymatic activity of this complex causes changes in the H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 profile in human cells. Based on this, we propose that ORCA is a scaffold protein that stabilizes the H3K9 KMT complex."

Ankyrin repeats of G9a also contain methyl-lysine binding modules and can therefore generate as well as read the same epigenetic mark (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 2008</a>). We have observed that the SET domain of G9a and its catalytic activity is essential for the binding of ORCA to heterochromatin, suggesting that the chromatin modifications initiated by the KMT provide docking sites for ORCA. These in turn may facilitate the recruitment of accessory factors that stabilize the interaction and help the propagation of heterochromatin. We propose that ORCA recognizes repressive histone marks, binds to KMTs that in turn facilitate the propagation of the histone mark. The newly established marks then become docking sites for ORCA and the whole process is repeated and this results in the spreading of heterochromatin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>)."

It is well established that H3K9 tri-methylation is a prerequisite for the subsequent H4K20 tri-methylation at the pericentric heterochromatin and this in turn sets the chromatin for binding of other key heterochromatin proteins including HP1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lachner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fischle et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stewart et al., 2005</a>). It is interesting to note that ORCA also interacts with Suv420H1 and H2, enzymes that catalyze H4K20 di- and tri-methylation, respectively (data not shown). It has been previously reported that Suv420H2 is a structural component of the heterochromatin and is required for chromatin compaction as well as cohesin recruitment (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hahn et al., 2013</a>). Recently, Reinberg and co-workers have proposed that the H4K20 me1/2/3 is also crucial for the regulation and timing of replication origin firing and that ORCA and Orc1 directly recognize these chromatin sites (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beck et al., 2012</a>). We are currently addressing the functional relevance of ORCA and Suv420H1/2 interaction in heterochromatin organization and replication progression."

                        "text": "Work from Jenuwein and co-workers have pointed to the idea that Prdm3 and Prdm16, H3K9 mono-methyltransferases, are also required for mammalian heterochromatin formation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pinheiro et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, mono-methylation of H3 at K9 catalyzed by SETDB1 has been shown to be a favored substrate for Suv39h for K9 tri-methylation, which can then establish heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib27\">Loyola et al., 2009</a>). The mechanism by which the Suv39h or H3K9me3 is targeted to pericentromere has been a long-standing question. It is generally assumed that HP1 is a key regulator of heterochromatin organization that is required for establishment and maintenance of this compacted form of chromatin. Spreading of the heterochromatin is thought to involve a mechanism where HP1 dimerizes, interacts with Suv39h1/2, and also recruits de novo DNA methyltransferase activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almouzni and Probst, 2011</a>). The fact that HP1 associates with heterochromatin in a transient manner has suggested that other perhaps constitutively bound factors contribute to the organization of heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheutin et al., 2003</a>). In addition, recent work has demonstrated that pericentric heterochromatin can be generated independent of Suv39h-HP1 binding (<a href=\"#bib29\">Muramatsu et al., 2013</a>). A transcription factor-based mechanism has also recently been suggested as an intrinsic mechanism for the formation of heterochromatin in mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</a>). Based on our results, we propose that in human cells, ORCA facilitates the recruitment, accumulation, and also the propagation of the heterochromatin by a self-sustaining loop mechanism, whereby ORCA binds to specific chromatin marks, associates with Suv39H1, that in turn propagates more H3K9me3 marks, generating more docking sites for ORCA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

However, it remains to be determined if the loss of chromatin-bound ORC in ORCA-depleted cells occurs at specific origins or at heterochromatic sites or both. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that ORCA binds to H3K9-methylated chromatin and facilitates the recruitment of KMTs as well as other components of ORC and MCMs to these sites. It is possible that the regulation of these epigenetic modifications by ORCA may provide identity to repressed chromatin and this in turn is crucial for proper replication. This idea is supported by our observation that ORCA associates with repressive KMTs only in a heterochromatic environment. It is known that G9a mediates di-methylation of H3K9 at late-replicating chromatin and this occurs predominantly at the nuclear periphery. H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 are enriched at the late-replicating facultative or constitutive heterochromatin, respectively (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wu et al., 2005</a>). The reduction of these marks upon loss of ORCA leads to changes in the replication timing only of these regions as indicated by the significant decrease in late-replication patterns upon ORCA KD. This is very similar to previous reports that show that loss of Rif1 causes reduction in mid-replication patterns and global changes in replication timing primarily due to Rif1's role in organizing chromatin loops (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cornacchia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yamazaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kumar and Cheok, 2014</a>). ORCA could be functioning in a similar fashion as an organizer of heterochromatin, and therefore, in cells lacking ORCA replication timing is altered. Furthermore, using the proteoTuner system, we demonstrate that the role of ORCA in chromatin organization is independent of its role in preRC assembly."

We carried out HA immunoprecipitation in HeLa cells stably expressing Flag-HA-GLP and Flag-HA-G9a stable by retroviral transduction. First, nuclear extract was made using an equivalent of 20 g of dry cell pellet, which approximately corresponds to 3 billion cells. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.6, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl) with the volume of hypotonic buffer being equal to the packed volume of cells. The suspension was then dounced 20 times using tight pestle followed by adding one third the packed volume of sucrose buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 15 mM KCl, 60 mM NaCl, 0.34 M Sucrose, 0.15 mM Spermine, 0.5 mM Spermidine). Then, centrifugation was carried out (9000 rpm, 7 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclei were resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaCl). This was followed by adding high salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 900 mM NaCl) dropwise while vortexing to make the final salt concentration 300 mM. After incubation on ice for 30 min, one third the volume of sucrose buffer was added followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, 10 min, 4\u00b0C. The supernatant is the nuclear soluble fraction. The pellet (chromatin bound fraction) was resuspended in sucrose buffer and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentration 1 mM) was added. The sample was then preheated for 1 min at 37\u00b0C and MNase was added to a final concentration of 0.0025 U/\u03bcl. The sample was then incubated for exactly 12 min at 37\u00b0C followed by placing the tubes on ice. 0.5 M EDTA was added at a final concentration of approximately 3.6 \u03bcM. The samples were then sonicated (Bioruptor, high amplitude 5cycles: each cycle 1 min ON, 1 min OFF). Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added, and the samples (nuclear soluble and chromatin bound fractions) were ultracentifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube. Tagged-H3K9 HMTs complexes were then purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody immobilized on agarose beads (cat# A2220, Sigma). After elution with the FLAG peptide (Ansynth, The Netherlands), the bound complexes containing nucleosomes were further affinity purified on anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose (cat# A2095, Sigma) and eluted with the HA peptide (Ansynth, The Netherlands).

The error bars represent standard deviation of the mean values from 20 imaging areas. Number of fluorescence photobleaching steps was determined for each YFP-tagged molecule and accumulated to obtain the stoichiometry of the complex. Colocalization percentage between YFP and mCherry was calculated as the number of coaligned molecules of one fluorescent molecule with respect to the fluorescent molecules found in lower density on the surface. This was needed since the number of YFP and mCherry tagged proteins was not pulled down to the same extent due to their independent interaction with ORCA. Colocalization criterion was set at 2 pixels, which correspond to a diffraction limited spot (\u223c300 nm) for our TIRF setup. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean values obtained from three independent experiments. For pulled down experiments performed using H3K9 peptides, the expression level of YFP-WT ORCA and YFP-mutant-ORCA was compared in the beginning by performing a direct pulldown by anti-GFP. The peptides pulldown was then performed at appropriate lysate dilution such that protein expression was same for WT (Wild type) and mutant ORCA."

Five to fifteen nanograms of ChIP DNA or un-enriched whole cell extract (Input) were prepared for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000. Libraries were constructed with the Truseq DNA sample prep kit V2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modifications: 10 ng of ChIP DNA were used as input material. DNA fragments were blunt-ended, 3\u2032-end A-tailed and ligated to indexed TruSeq adaptors. The adaptors were diluted in a ratio of 1:20 to adjust for the input amount of DNA. Indexed adaptors allow for sequencing of multiple samples on the same lane (multiplexing). The adaptor-ligated ChIP DNAs were individually size selected on a 2% agarose gel (Ex-Gel, Life Technologies, CA) to obtain the ligated fragments 300\u2013800 bp in length. Size-selected DNAs were amplified by PCR to selectively enrich for those fragments that have adapters on both ends. Amplification was carried out for 15 cycles with the Kapa HiFi polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) to reduce the likeliness of multiple identical reads due to preferential amplification. The final libraries were quantitated by qPCR on an ABI 7900, to allow for accurate quantitation and maximization of number of clusters in the flowcell. Final amplified libraries were also run on Agilent bioanalyzer DNA 7500 LabChips (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to determine the average fragment size and to confirm the presence of DNA of the expected size range."

Given the strong S phase reduction from ORCA depletion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and in the authors' 2010 paper), the changes in replication of loci queried at a given time point may appear different just because there's overall fewer origins firing. The details of the replication timing analysis are also missing from the methods; how were the signals normalized, and what exactly are the BrdU-ChIP plots showing? Some of the key points about ORCA scaffolding come only from experiments in which the proteins of interest are overproduced. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> is one of those, and all of the SiMPull assays are done with transient transfections of fluorescent fusion constructs. Given that this is their first use of SiMPull colocalization to claim that three proteins are in a complex together, and that this is one of their major findings, a second method should be added as corroboration (e.g. FRET, ip-/re-IP, etc.)."

All the replication timing data is from cells that have a serious S phase defect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), and reviewers agreed that even though the authors have done a considerable amount of work on this aspect, they were not convinced that the conclusions were substantiated by the data. Do cells depleted of ORC to the same extent as the ORCA depletion have the same sort of replication timing phenotype?

It may be that the direct interactions are very weak since the authors needed to use western blotting to detect them. If so, then the interactions may in fact be chromatin dependent in cells rather than just chromatin-influenced; the use of EtBr in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> doesn't sway me on this since those are all co-IPs from overproduced proteins. The interactions with purified proteins show that they proteins can interact directly, but <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> suggests that in cells any direct interaction is too weak to detect.

For example, upon loss of Pax3 or Pax9, there is a temporary decrease in H3K9me3 at heterochromatin from which the cell recovers in a couple of generations. As a result, only a marginal reduction of H3K9me3 is observed at mouse major satellites after extended knockdown of these transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</a>). While that is the case with knockdown of Pax3 and Pax9 individually, the results are very dramatic upon knocking down of Pax3 and Pax6 together, indicating cooperativity."

Upon ORCA depletion, most of the affected H3K9me3 peaks resided in late replicating domains.
