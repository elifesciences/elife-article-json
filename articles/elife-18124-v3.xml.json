                    "text": "The cross-talk between dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cell polarity and migration. Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5\u03b2 and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules."

Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5\u03b2 and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules."

Integrin-based adhesions (focal adhesions, FAs) are large macromolecular assemblies, in which the cytoplasmic tails of integrins are connected to the actin cytoskeleton. One of the major components of FAs is talin, a ~2500 amino acid dimeric protein, which plays a key role in adhesion formation by activating integrins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anthis et al., 2009</a>), coupling them to cytoskeletal actin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atherton et al., 2015</a>), regulating adhesion dynamics and recruiting different structural and signaling molecules (<a href=\"#bib13\">Calderwood et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gardel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wehrle-Haller, 2012</a>)."

A number of proteins have been implicated in microtubule attachment and stabilization in the vicinity of FAs. Among them are the microtubule plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) CLASP1/2 and the spectraplakin MACF1/ACF7, which are targeted to microtubule tips by EB1, and a homologue of EB1, EB2, which binds to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Drabek et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Honnappa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kodama et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</a>). The interaction of CLASPs with the cell cortex depends on the phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-interacting protein LL5\u03b2, to which CLASPs bind directly, and is partly regulated by PI-3 kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>). Other components of the same cortical assembly are the scaffolding proteins liprin-\u03b11 and \u03b21, a coiled-coil adaptor ELKS/ERC1, and the kinesin-4 KIF21A (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>). Both liprins and ELKS are best known for their role in organizing presynaptic secretory sites (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hida and Ohtsuka, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Spangler and Hoogenraad, 2007</a>); in agreement with this function, ELKS is required for efficient constitutive exocytosis in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grigoriev et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2011</a>). LL5\u03b2, liprins and ELKS form micrometer-sized cortical patch-like structures, which will be termed here cortical microtubule stabilization complexes, or CMSCs. The CMSCs are strongly enriched at the leading cell edges, where they localize in close proximity of FAs but do not overlap with them ([<a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>], reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib5\">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</a>]). They represent a subclass of the previously defined plasma membrane-associated platforms (PMAPs) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</a>), which have overlapping components such as liprins, but may not be necessarily involved in microtubule regulation, as is the case for liprin-ELKS complexes in neurons, where they are part of cytomatrix at the active zone (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gundelfinger and Fejtova, 2012</a>)."

In migrating keratinocytes, LL5\u03b2 and CLASPs accumulate around FAs and promote their disassembly by targeting the exocytosis of matrix metalloproteases to FA vicinity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stehbens et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, liprin-\u03b11, LL5\u03b1/\u03b2 and ELKS localize to protrusions of human breast cancer cells and are required for efficient cell migration and FA turnover (<a href=\"#bib4\">Astro et al., 2014</a>). In polarized epithelial cells, LL5\u03b2 and CLASPs are found in the proximity of the basal membrane, and this localization is controlled by the integrin activation state (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hotta et al., 2010</a>). CLASP and LL5-mediated anchoring of MTs to the basal cortex also plays a role during chicken embryonic development, where it prevents the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epiblast cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nakaya et al., 2013</a>). LL5\u03b2, CLASPs and ELKS were also shown to concentrate at podosomes, actin-rich structures, which can remodel the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib49\">Proszynski and Sanes, 2013</a>). Interestingly, LL5\u03b2-containing podosome-like structures are also formed at neuromuscular junctions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kishi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Proszynski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Proszynski and Sanes, 2013</a>), and the complexes of LL5\u03b2 and CLASPs were shown to capture microtubule plus ends and promote delivery of acetylcholine receptors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Basu et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schmidt et al., 2012</a>)."

The association of KANK1 with FAs depends on the KN domain, a conserved 30 amino acid polypeptide sequence present in the N-termini of all KANK proteins. Biochemical and structural analysis showed that the KN domain interacts with the R7 region of the talin rod. Perturbation of this interaction both from the KANK1 and the talin1 side prevented the accumulation of CMSC complexes around focal adhesions and affected microtubule organization around FAs. We propose that KANK1 molecules, recruited by talin to the outer rims of FA, serve as 'seeds' for organizing other CMSC components in the\u00a0FA vicinity through multivalent interactions between these components. This leads to co-organization of two distinct cortical assemblies, FAs and CMSCs, responsible for the attachment of actin and microtubules, respectively, and ensures effective cross-talk between the two types of cytoskeletal elements."

We confirmed these results both in HeLa cells and the HaCaT immortal keratinocyte cell line, in which CMSC components CLASPs and LL5\u03b2 were previously shown to strongly cluster around FAs and regulate their turnover during cell migration (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stehbens et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Inhibition of myosin-II with blebbistatin, which reduces tension on the actin fibers and affects the activation state of FA molecules, such as integrins and talin (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parsons et al., 2010</a>), caused not only FA disassembly but also a strong reduction in clustering of CMSC components at the cell periphery (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), as described previously (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stehbens et al., 2014</a>). To investigate this effect in more detail, we partially inhibited contractility using a Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) inhibitor, Y-27632 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Oakes et al., 2012</a>). In these conditions, the number of FAs was not affected although their size was reduced (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>). This treatment was sufficient to diminish CMSC clustering at the cell edge (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,F</a>). Interestingly, at the same time we observed a very significant increase in the overlap of KANK1 with FA adhesion markers (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,G</a>). Live imaging of KANK1 together with the FA marker paxillin showed a gradual redistribution of KANK1 into the areas occupied by FAs upon ROCK1 inhibitor-induced attenuation of contractility (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

                                "text": "To identify the domains of KANK1 required for cortical localization, we performed deletion mapping. KANK1 comprises an N-terminal KANK family-specific domain of unknown function, the KN domain (residues 30\u201368) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kakinuma et al., 2009</a>), a coiled coil region, the N-terminal part of which interacts with liprin-\u03b21, and a C-terminal ankyrin repeat domain, which binds to KIF21A (<a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>), while the rest of the protein is predicted to be unstructured (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Surprisingly, the KN domain alone strongly and specifically accumulated within FAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A similar localization was also seen with a somewhat larger N-terminal fragment of KANK1, Nter, as well as the Nter-CC1 deletion mutant, which contained the first, liprin-\u03b21-binding coiled coil region of KANK1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). However, an even larger N-terminal part of KANK1, encompassing the whole coiled coil domain (Nter-CC) showed a pronounced enrichment at the FA rim (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The KANK1 deletion mutant missing only the C-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (\u25b3ANKR) was completely excluded from FAs but accumulated in their immediate vicinity, similar to the full-length KANK1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). A tight ring-like localization at the outer rim of FAs was also observed with a KANK1 mutant, which completely missed the coiled coil region but contained the ankyrin repeat domain (\u25b3CC), while the mutant which missed just the KN domain showed no accumulation around FAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To test whether the exclusion of larger KANK1 fragments from the FA core was simply due to the protein size, we fused GFP-tagged KN domain to the bacterial protein \u03b2-D-galactosidase (LacZ), but found that this fusion accumulated inside and not around FAs (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Since GFP-KN-LacZ and GFP-KANK1-\u25b3ANKRD have a similar size (1336 and 1400 amino acids, respectively), but one accumulates inside FAs, while the other is excluded to their periphery, this result suggests that features other than the mere protein size determine the specific localization of KANK1 to the FA rim. We conclude that the KN domain of KANK1 has an\u00a0affinity for FAs, but the presence of additional KANK1 sequences prevents the accumulation of the protein inside FAs and instead leads to the accumulation of KANK1 at the FA periphery."

In addition to the already known binding partners of KANK1, such as KIF21A, liprins and LL5\u03b2, we identified talin1 among the strongest hits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Talin2 was also detected in a pull down with the KANK1\u2009N-terminus though not with the full-length protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The interaction between KANK1 and talin1 was confirmed by Western blotting, and subsequent deletion mapping showed that the talin1-binding region of KANK1 encompasses the KN domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D</a>), while liprin-\u03b21 binds to the N-terminal part of the coiled coil domain, as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>)."

The LD-motifs in RIAM (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goult et al., 2013</a>), DLC1 and Paxillin (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</a>) have recently been identified as talin-binding sites that all interact with talin via a helix addition mechanism. Alignment of the KN domain of KANK with the LD-motif of DLC1, RIAM and Paxillin (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</a>) revealed that the hydrophobic residues that mediate interaction with talin are present in the KN domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

This R8 domain serves as a binding hub for numerous proteins including vinculin, synemin and actin (<a href=\"#bib13\">Calderwood et al., 2013</a>). R8 also contains a prototypic recognition site for LD-motif proteins, including DLC1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), Paxillin and RIAM (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</a>). Based on the presence of the LD-binding site, we anticipated that KANK1 would also interact with R8. However, deletion mapping revealed that KANK1 in fact binds to the talin1 rod domain R7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), suggesting that KANK1 interacts with a novel binding site on talin1."

The addition of the KANK1(30\u201360) peptide resulted in large spectral changes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), most of which were in the slow exchange regime on the NMR timescale indicative of a tight interaction. In agreement with the pull down data, the signals that shifted in slow exchange upon the addition of KANK1(30\u201360) mapped largely onto the R7 domain with only small progressive shift changes evident on R8. To validate R7 as the major KANK1-binding site on talin, we repeated the NMR experiments using the individual domains, R8 (residues 1461\u20131580) and R7 (residues 1359\u20131659 \u03941454\u20131586). Addition of KANK1(30\u201360) induced small chemical shift changes on the R8 domain indicative of a weak interaction (most likely due to the\u00a0interaction of LD with the LD-recognition box on R8). However, the addition of a 0.5 molar ratio of KANK1(30\u201360) to R7 induced large spectral changes with many of the peaks displaying two locations, corresponding to the free peak position and the bound peak position. This is indicative of slow-exchange and confirms a high affinity interaction between R7 and KANK1. The KN peptide is the first identified ligand for the R7 domain."

To map these chemical shift changes onto the structure of R7-R8, it was first necessary to complete the backbone chemical shift assignments of the R7 domain. This was achieved using conventional triple resonance experiments as described previously (<a href=\"#bib7\">Banno et al., 2012</a>), using <sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N labeled R7. The chemical shift changes mapped predominantly onto one face of R7, comprised of helices 2 and 5 of the 5-helix bundle (talin rod helices 29 and 36), as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>."

In the DLC1:talin R8 complex the DLC1 peptide adopts a helical conformation that packs against two helices on the side of the helical bundle. It is becoming increasingly clear that other LD-motif proteins bind to talin through a similar interaction mode (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</a>). The surface of \u03b12 and \u03b15 on R7 forms a hydrophobic groove that the KANK1 helix docks into. A striking feature of this KANK1 binding surface is that the two helices are held apart by the conserved aromatic residues, W1630 at the end of \u03b15 and Y1389 at the end of \u03b12 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a>). W1630 and Y1389 thus essentially serve as molecular rulers, separating helices \u03b12 and \u03b15 by ~8\u00c5 (compared with ~5\u20136\u00c5 for the other bundles in R7-R8). The spacing between the two helices is enhanced further as the residues on the inner helical faces, S1400, G1404, S1411 on \u03b12 and S1637 and S1641 on \u03b15, have small side chains which have the effect of creating two conserved pockets midway along the hydrophobic groove of the KANK1-binding site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

The structure of R7 revealed a potential LD-recognition box with the positive charges, K1401 and R1652 positioned on either side to engage either one, or both, of the aspartic residues. Using the docking program HADDOCK (<a href=\"#bib60\">van Zundert et al., 2016</a>), we sought to generate a structural model of the KANK1/R7 complex, using the chemical shift mapping on R7 and a model of KANK1(30\u201360) as a helix (created by threading the KANK1 sequence onto the DLC1 LD-motif helix). This analysis indicated that the KANK-LD helix can indeed pack against the sides of \u03b12 and \u03b15 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, all of the models, irrespective of which way the KANK1 helix ran along the surface, positioned the bulky aromatic residue, Y48 in KANK1, in the hydrophobic pocket created by G1404. This raised the possibility that mutation of G1404 to a bulky hydrophobic residue might block KANK1 binding by preventing Y48 engagement. We also noticed that S1641, one of the small residues that create the pocket, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ratnikov et al., 2005</a>) and might have a regulatory function in the KANK1-talin1 interaction."

On the KANK1 side, we mutated the LDLD motif to AAAA, (the KANK1-4A mutant), while on the talin1 side, we generated a series of R7 mutants. These included G1404L, in which a bulky hydrophobic residue was introduced instead of glycine to occlude the hydrophobic pocket in R7, S1641E, a phosphomimetic mutant aimed to test the role of talin phosphorylation in regulating KANK1 binding, and W1630A, a substitution that would remove one of the molecular rulers holding \u03b12 and \u03b15 helices apart at a fixed distance. These mutants were introduced into talin1 R7-R8 and the structural integrity of the mutated proteins confirmed using NMR (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The relative binding affinities were measured using an in vitro fluorescence polarization assay. In this assay, the KANK1(30\u201360) peptide is fluorescently labeled with BODIPY and titrated with an increasing concentration of talin R7-R8, and the binding between the two polypeptides results in an increase in the fluorescence polarization signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The KANK1-4A mutant abolished binding to talin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>). The S1641E mutant had only a small effect on binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), suggesting that either talin1 phosphorylation does not play a major role in modulating the interaction with KANK1 or that the S-E mutation is not a good phosphomimetic, possibly because phosphorylation might also affect helix formation integrity, an effect not mimicked by a single aspartate residue. However, strikingly, both the W1630A and the G1404L mutants abolished binding of KANK1 to talin R7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), confirming the validity of our model. Finally, we also tested whether the KN-R7 interaction is conserved in talin2 and KANK2, and found that this was indeed the case (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We conclude that the conserved KN domain of KANKs is a talin-binding site."

As could be expected based on the binding experiments with purified protein fragments, the 4A mutation reduced the interaction of the full-length KANK1 with talin1 in a pull-down assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). An even stronger reduction was observed when KANK-\u25b3CC or the KN alone were tested (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Rescue experiments were performed using GFP-KANK1, resistant for the used siRNAs due to several silent mutations (<a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>), or its 4A mutant. We also included in this analysis a KANK1 mutant lacking the liprin-\u03b21-binding coiled coil domain (the \u25b3CC deletion mutant, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and the 4A-version of the KANK1-\u25b3CC deletion mutant. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM)-based live imaging showed that, consistent with our previous results, the GFP-tagged wild type KANK1 strongly accumulated in cortical patches that were tightly clustered around FAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). The KANK1-\u25b3CC mutant, which lacked the liprin-\u03b21-binding site but contained an intact KN motif, showed highly specific ring-like accumulations at the rims of FAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In contrast, KANK1-4A was not clustered anymore around FAs but was dispersed over the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). The KANK1-\u25b3CC-4A mutant, lacking both the liprin-\u03b21 and the talin-binding sites, and the KN-4A mutant were completely diffuse (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>)."

The depletion of the two talin proteins resulted in a dramatic loss of FAs and cell detachment from coverslips (data not shown), in agreement with the well-established essential role of talin1 in FA formation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Calderwood et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">del Rio et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yao et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, in this experiment only cells expressing GFP-talin1 displayed normal attachment and spreading (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The\u00a0GFP-talin1-G1404L mutant could fully support cell attachment and spreading, although the cell area was slightly increased compared to cells rescued with the wild type GFP-talin1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>). The number and size of focal adhesions were not significantly different between the cells rescued with the wild type talin1 or its G1404L mutant (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>), indicating that the mutant is functional in supporting FA formation. Strikingly, while in cells expressing the wild-type talin1, KANK1 was prominently clustered around FAs, it was dispersed over the plasma membrane in cells expressing talin1-G1404L (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that perturbing the KANK1-talin interaction, including the use of a single point mutation in the ~2500 amino acid long talin1 protein, which does not interfere with the talin function in FA formation, abrogates KANK1 association with FAs."

The localization of GFP-KANK1 and its mutants relative to FAs labeled with endogenous markers was very similar to that described above based on live imaging experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Co-depletion of KANK1 and KANK2 abolished clustering of CMSC components, such as LL5\u03b2 and KIF21A at the cell edge (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Wild type GFP-KANK1 could rescue cortical clustering of these proteins in KANK1 and KANK2-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). However, this was not the case for the KANK1-4A mutant, the KANK1-\u25b3CC mutant or the KANK1 version bearing both mutations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Importantly, the dispersed puncta of the KANK1-4A mutant still colocalized with LL5\u03b2, as the binding to liprin-\u03b21 was intact in this mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), while the FA-associated rings of KANK1-\u25b3CC, the mutant deficient in liprin-\u03b21 binding, showed a mutually exclusive localization with LL5\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, KIF21A, which binds to the ankyrin repeat domain of KANK1, could still colocalize with KANK1-\u25b3CC at FA rims (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The overall accumulation of KIF21A at the cell periphery was, however, reduced, in line with the strongly reduced KANK1 peripheral clusters observed with the KANK1-\u25b3CC mutant. The diffuse localization of the KANK1-4A-\u25b3CC mutant led to the strongly dispersed distribution of the CMSC markers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Furthermore, only the full-length wild type KANK1, but neither the 4A nor \u25b3CC mutant could support efficient accumulation of CLASP2 at the peripheral cell cortex in KANK1 and KANK2-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>), in line with the fact that cortical recruitment of CLASPs depends on LL5\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>)."

These data indicate that in addition to binding to talin1, the localization of CMSC clusters depends on the KANK1-liprin-\u03b21 connection. This notion is supported by the observation that the overexpressed coiled coil region of KANK1 (CC1), which can compete for liprin-\u03b21 binding but cannot interact with talin1, acted as a very potent dominant negative, which suppressed accumulation of LL5\u03b2 at the cell periphery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>). We conclude that the core CMSC protein LL5\u03b2 as well as the microtubule-binding CMSC components KIF21A and CLASP2 depend on the KANK1 interaction with both talin1 and liprin-\u03b21 for their efficient clustering in the vicinity of focal adhesions at the cell periphery."

Due to their stereotypic round shape, HeLa cells represent a particularly convenient model for studying the impact of CMSCs on the distribution and dynamics of microtubule plus ends (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>). In this cell line, microtubules grow rapidly in the central parts of the cell, while at the cell margin, where CMSCs cluster in the vicinity of peripheral FAs, microtubule plus ends are tethered to the cortex and display persistent but slow growth due to the combined action of several types of microtubule regulators, including CLASPs, spectraplakins and KIF21A (<a href=\"#bib15\">Drabek et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>). This type of regulation prevents microtubule overgrowth at the cell edge and results in an orderly arrangement of microtubule plus ends perpendicular to the cell margin (<a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In cells with perturbed CMSCs, microtubule plus ends at the cell periphery become disorganized: the velocity of their growth at the cell margin increases, and their orientation becomes parallel instead of being perpendicular to the cell edge (<a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

In the KANK1/2 depleted cells expressing KANK1 mutants, the velocity of microtubule growth in central cell regions was not affected, but the growth rate at the cell periphery increased, and microtubules were growing at oblique angles to the cell margin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013E</a>). The increase of the microtubule growth rate observed with the GFP-KANK1-\u0394CC mutant was less strong than with the two 4A mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013E</a>). This can be explained by the fact that GFP-KANK1-\u0394CC was strongly clustered at FA rims (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and, through its ankyrin repeat domain, could still recruit some KIF21A, a potent microtubule polymerization inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>)."

This function is likely to be conserved in the animal kingdom, as the KANK orthologue in <i>C. elegans</i>, Vab-19, in conjunction with integrins, plays important roles in a dynamic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion developmental process (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>). The exact impact of KANK1-talin binding likely depends on the specific system, as the loss of KANK proteins was shown to reduce motility of HeLa cells and podocytes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2011</a>), but promote insulin-dependent cell migration in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kakinuma et al., 2008</a>)."

One possibility, suggested by our deletion analysis of KANK1, is that while the KN peptide alone can penetrate into FAs, larger KN-containing protein fragments are sterically excluded from the dense actin-containing core of the FA. However, our experiment with the KN-LacZ fusion did not support this simple idea, indicating that the underlying mechanism is likely to be more complex and might involve specific disordered or ordered domains and additional partners of KANK1, or other regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, we found that reducing contractility with a ROCK1 inhibitor caused an increase in overlap of KANK1 with FA markers, suggesting that the interaction between KANK1 and talin might be mechanosensitive. An exciting possibility is that full length KANK1 can efficiently interact only with talin molecules at the periphery of focal adhesions because they are not fully incorporated into the focal adhesion structure and are thus less stretched. The KANK1 binding site on talin R7 overlaps with the high affinity actin binding site in talin (which spans R4-R8) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atherton et al., 2015</a>) and it is possible that different conformational populations of talin exist within adhesions and link to different cytoskeletal components."

Previous work on CMSC complexes showed that they are formed through an intricate network of interactions. The 'core' components of these complexes, which can be recruited to the plasma membrane independently of each other, are LL5\u03b2 (and in some cells, its homologue LL5\u03b1), liprins and KANKs (of which KANK1 seems to predominate in HeLa cells) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hotta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The clustering of CMSC components is mutually dependent and relies on homo- and heterodimerization of liprins \u03b11 and \u03b21, the association between KANK1 and liprin-\u03b21, the scaffolding protein ELKS, which binds to both LL5\u03b2 and liprin-\u03b11, and possibly additional interactions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>), while the microtubule-binding proteins, such as CLASPs and KIF21A, seem to associate as a second 'layer' with the membrane-bound CMSC-assemblies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The CMSC 'patches' can remain relatively stable for tens of minutes, while their individual components are dynamic and exchange with different, characteristic turnover rates (<a href=\"#bib59\">van der Vaart et al., 2013</a>)."

The formation of such structures, which can be compared to liquid droplets, can be triggered by local concentration of CMSC components. It is tempting to speculate that by concentrating KANK1 at the FA rims, talin1 helps to 'nucleate' CMSC assembly, which can then propagate to form large structures surrounding FAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Additional membrane-bound cues, such as the presence of PIP3, to which LL5\u03b2 can bind (<a href=\"#bib46\">Paranavitane et al., 2003</a>), can further promote CMSC coalescence by increasing concentration of CMSC players in specific areas of the plasma membrane. This model helps to explain why the CMSC accumulation at the cell periphery is reduced but not abolished when PI3 kinase is inhibited (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lansbergen et al., 2006</a>), and why the clustering of all CMSC components is mutually dependent. Most importantly, this model accounts for the mysterious ability of the two large and spatially distinct macromolecular assemblies, FAs and CMSCs, to form in close proximity of each other."

For RP-nanoLC-MS/MS, samples were resuspended in 10% formic acid (FA) / 5% DMSO and was analyzed using a Proxeon Easy-nLC100 (Thermo Scientific) connected to an Orbitrap Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. Samples were first trapped (Dr Maisch Reprosil C18, 3 \u03bcm, 2 cm \u00d7 100\u2009\u03bcm) before being separated on an analytical column (Agilent Zorbax 1.8\u2009\u03bcm SB-C18, 40 cm \u00d7 50\u2009\u03bcm), using a gradient of 180\u2009min at a column flow of 150 nl min<sup>-1</sup>. Trapping was performed at 8\u2009\u03bcL/min for 10\u2009min in solvent A (0.1\u2009M acetic acid in water) and the gradient was as follows 15- 40% solvent B (0.1\u2009M acetic acid in acetonitrile) in 151\u2009min, 40\u2013100% in 3\u2009min, 100% solvent B for 2\u2009min, and 100% solvent A for 13\u2009min. Nanospray was performed at 1.7 kV using a fused silica capillary that was pulled in-house and coated with gold (o.d. 360\u2009\u03bcm; i.d. 20\u2009\u03bcm; tip i.d. 10\u2009\u03bcm). The mass spectrometers were used in a data-dependent mode, which automatically switched between MS and MS/MS. Full scan MS spectra from m/z 350 \u2013 1500 were acquired at a resolution of 35.000 at m/z 400 after the accumulation to a target value of 3E6. Up to 20 most intense precursor ions were selected for fragmentation. HCD fragmentation was performed at normalized collision energy of 25% after the accumulation to a target value of 5E4. MS2 was acquired at a resolution of 17,500 and dynamic exclusion was enabled. For data analysis, raw files were processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (version 1.4.1.14, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Database search was performed using the swiss-prot human database (version 29th of January 2015) and Mascot (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science, UK) as the search engine. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modification. Trypsin was specified as enzyme and up to two miss cleavages were allowed. Data filtering was performed using a\u00a0percolator (<a href=\"#bib34\">K\u00e4ll et al., 2007</a>), resulting in 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Additional filter was ion score &gt;20."

KANK1 and 2 are able to bind to both talin at focal adhesions as well as liprins and KIF21A in CMSC's. In the absence of this bridging interaction, CMSCs do not form around focal adhesions. Important strengths of this work include the rational design of point mutants that disrupted talin-KANK interactions and the careful analysis of localizations in backgrounds in which either talins or KANKs were depleted. Functionally, disrupting the association between talin and KANK results in CMSC disruption, which perturbs microtubule growth speeds and organization at the cell cortex. Thought provoking models for the assembly of CMSCs around focal adhesions are presented in the Discussion. Overall, all 3 reviewers felt that this is a very well executed manuscript that provides substantial new insight into how focal adhesions locally control microtubule dynamics."

As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C-H</a> and Supplemental Video S1, we found that this treatment induced a reduction in focal adhesion size, as expected. Interestingly this treatment led to an increased the penetration of KANK1 into focal adhesions and thus enhanced the colocalization between KANK1 and focal adhesion markers; subsequently, gradual dispersion of KANK1 clusters was observed. These data strongly suggest that the interaction between KANK1 and talin is mechanosensitive and can be regulated by tension at focal adhesions. These data are incorporated into the Results."

We found no significant differences between focal adhesion sizes in these two conditions, although cell spreading was mildly increased in cells transfected with the G1404L mutant (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D-G</a> and the Results of the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cTalin1-KANK1 interaction controls cortical organization of CMSC components\u201c). We note that the HeLa cells used here migrate extremely slowly. As a result, they have a highly symmetric shape and represent an excellent model to study microtubule organization and dynamics but are not a good model for investigation of focal adhesion remodeling during cell migration. To address the 2 consequences of disrupting KANK1-talin interaction on focal adhesion turnover, one would therefore need to move to another cell system, such as, for example, 3T3 fibroblasts or HaCaT keratinocytes, in which the cortical microtubule stabilization complexes strongly associate with focal adhesions at the leading cell edge (Lansbergen et al., 2006 Dev Cell, Stehbens et al., 2014 Nat Cell Biol). Unfortunately, these cell models are difficult to transfect, and thus establishment of multiple stable cell lines will be needed to properly address the impact of perturbation of KANK1-talin binding on cell migration and focal adhesion turnover. Such experiments would require at least several months to perform, and, in our opinion, go beyond the scope of the current paper but should constitute a separate study."
