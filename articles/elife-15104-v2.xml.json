                    "text": "The association between pregnancy and altered cutaneous pigmentation has been documented for over two millennia, suggesting that sex hormones play a role in regulating epidermal melanocyte (MC) homeostasis. Here we show that physiologic estrogen (17\u03b2-estradiol) and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis. This is intriguing given that we also show that normal primary human MCs lack classical estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR). Utilizing both genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we establish that sex steroid effects on human pigment synthesis are mediated by the membrane-bound, steroid hormone receptors G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), and progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7). Activity of these receptors was activated or inhibited by synthetic estrogen or progesterone analogs that do not bind to ER or PR. As safe and effective treatment options for skin pigmentation disorders are limited, these specific GPER and PAQR7 ligands may represent a novel class of therapeutics."

Here we show that physiologic estrogen (17\u03b2-estradiol) and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis. This is intriguing given that we also show that normal primary human MCs lack classical estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR). Utilizing both genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we establish that sex steroid effects on human pigment synthesis are mediated by the membrane-bound, steroid hormone receptors G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), and progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7). Activity of these receptors was activated or inhibited by synthetic estrogen or progesterone analogs that do not bind to ER or PR. As safe and effective treatment options for skin pigmentation disorders are limited, these specific GPER and PAQR7 ligands may represent a novel class of therapeutics."

The British physician Daniel Turner, in his 1714 <i>De Morbis Cutaneis</i> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Turner, 1726</a>), references Hippocrates (460\u2013370 B.C.E.), \u201cThere is a spot on the face\u2026more peculiar, according to our great master <i>Hippoc.,</i> to Big Belly\u2019d women, and recon\u2019d as one of the Signs of Conception.\u201d Modern physicians recognize this common pregnancy-associated hyperpigmentation as melasma (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sheth and Pandya, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nicolaidou and Katsambas, 2014</a>). Hippocrates also thought that the pigment was predictive of the sex of the fetus: <i>Quae utero gerentes, maculum in facie veluti ex solis adustione habent, eae faemellas plerumque gestant</i>. Translated to English: <i>pregnant women who have a mark on the face as though stained by the sun, quite often give birth to girls</i>. While Turner noted this association with fetal sex to be 'fallible', Hippocrates was remarkably astute in linking the pigment increases to the tanning response to DNA-damaging solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. While early physicians attributed the pigment changes to \u201cRetention of the menstrual Flux\u201d (<a href=\"#bib54\">Turner and Cutaneis, 1726</a>), the molecular mechanisms through which pregnancy-associated hormonal changes modulate skin color have remained elusive for over 2,000 years."

                        "text": "Melanocytes in the basal epidermis control skin pigmentation through synthesis of melanin, a complex process thought to be primarily regulated by alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). The \u03b1MSH peptide is secreted centrally by the anterior pituitary gland, and locally by keratinocytes in response to UV damage (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cui et al., 2007</a>). \u03b1MSH binding to the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), activates adenylate cyclase, and increases cAMP. This secondary messenger activates a cascade of downstream transcriptional events leading to expression of genes required for melanin synthesis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rodr\u00edguez and Setaluri, 2014</a>). Exogenous broadly-acting adenylate cyclase activators such as plant-derived forskolin, also stimulate melanin production (<a href=\"#bib11\">D'Orazio et al., 2006</a>), but the degree to which other endogenous molecules, other than \u03b1MSH regulate melanin synthesis in tissue is unclear. However, the observation that melasma frequently occurs in non-pregnant women using oral contraceptive pills, which contain only steroid hormone analogs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sheth and Pandya, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Resnik, 1967a</a>), suggests that humans may maintain \u03b1MSH-independent pigment control mechanisms. Identifying these pathways, and strategies to specifically access them pharmacologically to modulate skin pigmentation, may have substantial therapeutic utility."

This resulted in a dose-dependent melanin increase (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). After 4 days of exposure to 25 nM estrogen, a medically-relevant concentration observed during pregnancy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbassi-Ghanavati et al., 2009</a>), melanin was markedly increased (208% +/- 27%) in three individual isolates of primary human melanocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The magnitude of this change was similar to that observed with \u03b1MSH (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), and is consistent with prior in vitro studies implicating estrogen in melanin synthesis (<a href=\"#bib33\">McLeod et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ranson et al., 1988</a>). Hormonal oral contraceptives, most of which incorporate ethinyl estradiol, are associated with melasma (<a href=\"#bib43\">Resnik, 1967b</a>). Ethinyl estradiol also increased melanin to levels similar to those observed with native estrogen. To examine the effects of estrogen on melanocyte homeostasis in the context of intact human epidermis, architecturally-faithful three-dimensional organotypic skin was established utilizing normal primary epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes in native human stroma (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ridky et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Monteleon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Duperret et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McNeal et al., 2015</a>).

To determine whether this reciprocal relationship is active in melanocytes, we treated cells with physiologic levels of progesterone, which resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in melanin production (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). At 500 nM, a concentration observed in third trimester pregnancy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbassi-Ghanavati et al., 2009</a>), progesterone decreased melanin production by half (58% +/- 11.4%), both in culture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and in skin tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), without altering melanocyte cell number (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Most of our primary melanocytes were derived from newborn male foreskin. To determine whether female cells also responded similarly, we treated female iPS-derived melanocytes with estrogen and progesterone and noted responses similar to those observed with the male cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). To determine whether melanocytes isolated from body sites other than foreskin also responded similarly to sex hormones, we treated melanocytes from adult facial skin with estrogen and progesterone and again observed responses that were similar to those observed with the foreskin melanocytes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>)."

Estrogen treated melanocytes tended to proliferate slightly slower, while progesterone treated cells tended to proliferate slightly faster (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). The effects varied with the\u00a0basal level of melanin production. Melanocytes from dark skin were more sensitive to progesterone than estrogen, while melanocytes from light skin were more sensitive to estrogen. These proliferation changes are likely an in vitro artifact, as adult interfollicular epidermal melanocytes are relatively nonproliferative in vivo, and we did not note any changes in melanocyte numbers in sex steroid-treated 3-D organotypic tissues. Consistent with this lack of melanocyte proliferation in interfollicular epidermis, another group thoroughly examined 280 tissue sections from normal human skin from 18 donors, and identified only 2 proliferative interfollicular melanocytes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jimbow et al., 1975</a>)."

To identify possible candidates, we analyzed whole transcriptome melanocyte RNAseq data. Of 412 known or predicted 7-pass human GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander et al., 2013</a>), 61 distinct GPCRs were expressed in MCs, including the membrane-bound, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (<a href=\"#bib16\">Filardo et al., 2002</a>) (GPER) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Given that prior work in breast cancer cell lines and fish oocytes determined that estrogen binding to GPER modulates cAMP (<a href=\"#bib16\">Filardo et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Thomas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cabas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Majumder et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pang and Thomas, 2010</a>), and that cAMP signaling stimulates melanin synthesis, we thought it possible that GPER may be the physiologically relevant human melanocyte estrogen receptor. The melanocyte RNAseq studies also demonstrated that an analogous, noncanonical G protein-coupled progesterone receptor, progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tang et al., 2005</a>), was also expressed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Analogous shRNA-mediated PAQR7 depletion ablated the pigmentary response to progesterone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). To verify these results, we next used a complementary genetic approach based on CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene disruption of GPER or PAQR7, which also completely blocked the pigmentary response to estrogen and progesterone, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013H</a>). Consistent with our model in which these receptors access melanin synthesis at the level of adenylate cyclase, PAQR7 was found to bind progesterone and regulate the final stages of sea trout oocyte meiosis through cAMP reduction (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tokumoto et al., 2012</a>). In that fish system, PAQR7 signals through G protein complexes containing the inhibitory G subunit (G<sub>i</sub>), which represses adenylate cyclase. To examine whether this signaling mechanism is functional in melanocytes, we treated melanocytes with progesterone in the presence of pertussis toxin (PTX), an exotoxin that specifically inactivates G<sub>i</sub> subunits via ADP-ribosylation. With PTX treatment alone, we observed a small increase in melanin production. This likely reflects inhibition of G<sub>i</sub> released from basal PAQR7 activity, as well G<sub>i</sub> subunits from other GPCRs that collectively contribute to the basal level of cAMP signaling observed in culture. Importantly, PTX blocked progesterone effects, establishing that progesterone signals through G<sub>i</sub> subunits (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

However, tamoxifen is a GPER agonist (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thomas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2010</a>), and increased melanin to levels comparable to those observed with estrogen (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To determine whether GPER signaling was sufficient to increase melanin, we utilized the specific GPER agonist G-1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bologa et al., 2006</a>), an estrogen analog developed for mechanistic studies in other systems that does not bind ER. G-1 drove a dose-dependent increase in melanin production through pCREB and MITF that was GPER dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). Further establishing that GPER is the melanocyte estrogen receptor, G-1 and estrogen effects were blocked by either of two specific GPER antagonists, G-15 and G-36 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), which do not have inhibitory activity against ER (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dennis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">2011</a>). To establish that PAQR7 signaling is sufficient to decrease melanin production, we used a specific PAQR7 agonist Org OD-02 (CH2P4), which does not bind PR (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kelder et al., 2010</a>). CH2P4 caused a dose-dependent decrease in melanin production through pCREB and MITF that was PAQR7 dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>)."

We treated the right ears of mice daily for 3 weeks with vehicle or 2% (w/v) G-1 in DMSO, and observed a gradual increase pigmentation compared to vehicle-treated controls over 3 weeks (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Clinically apparent skin darkening on mice increased over 2\u20133 weeks while pigment changes in culture were more rapid.

Defining these mechanisms is important however, as myriad genetic and acquired conditions including common afflictions such as acne, eczema, vitiligo, ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, traumatic injury, and pregnancy are associated with alterations in skin pigmentation that can be extensive and long-lasting (<a href=\"#bib22\">James et al., 2011</a>). Another population that could potentially benefit from modulating skin pigment are people with naturally light skin, especially those with red hair, who have a markedly decreased ability to synthesize UV-protective brown eumelanin as a result of inactivating mutations in MC1R (<a href=\"#bib55\">Valverde et al., 1995</a>). This large population is especially susceptible to photodamage, sunburns, and has an increased lifetime risk of keratinocyte and melanocyte-derived skin cancers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Han et al., 2006</a>). There is currently no available therapeutic that promotes protective eumelanin pigment production. However, the specific activation of GPER alternatively activates cAMP signaling, bypassing MC1R, to stimulate melanin synthesis, and could therefore be especially useful in this sun-vulnerable population. Selective GPER activation in skin could potentially be a safe alternative to intentional UV radiation exposure (via natural sunlight or tanning beds) for individuals seeking what they perceive as an aesthetically desirable tan.

In immune cells, GPER expression on T cells has been shown to play a role in 17\u03b2-estradiol-induced thymic atrophy and autoimmune encephalomyelitis. PAQR7 is expressed in the reproductive and nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tokumoto et al., 2016</a>), and in murine macrophages (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lu et al., 2015</a>) and in human T cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dosiou et al., 2008</a>), although the functional role of PAQR7 in those tissues remains relatively unclear. Given that the increased systemic estrogen and progesterone associated with pregnancy does not typically result in skin cancer or significant pathology in other tissues, we think it likely that the specific GPER and PAQR7 agonists will be well-tolerated. Nonetheless, formal toxicity studies and careful evaluation of human skin treated in clinical trials will be important."

This group performed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to support the claim that nuclear estrogen receptors are expressed in melanocytes, but in our view, the data presented in that work is not especially convincing, and there is no evidence in that work that nuclear hormone signaling drives changes in melanin synthesis. Another group demonstrated that melanocyte protein extracts have the ability to bind radioactive estrogen, but that work did not identify the specific protein(s) responsible for the binding activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jee et al., 1994</a>). We do not exclude the possibility that in some tissue settings, including neoplastic lesions and possibly hair follicles, melanocytes express nuclear ER/PR. Still, as there is no known direct signaling pathway linking nuclear sex hormone receptors to the melanin synthesis machinery, it is most likely that the major effects of estrogen and progesterone on pigment production are mediated through the G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs identified in our current work."

Future functional analysis of these and other GPCRs in melanocytes may elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the pigmentation changes that frequently accompany many skin diseases associated with inflammation.

(2002) Donor specific response of estrogen and progesterone on cultured human melanocytes. J. Korean Med. Sci.; Schmidt AN, et al. (2006). Oestrogen receptor-\u03b2 expression in melanocytic lesions. Exp Dermatol.</i> We agree that there is potentially contradicting literature regarding the expression of nuclear estrogen or progesterone receptors in normal melanocytes and melanocytic neoplasms. Jee et al. demonstrated that melanocyte protein extracts have the ability to bind radioactive estrogen, but that work did not identify the specific protein(s) responsible for the binding activity. Im et al. used immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to support the claim that nuclear estrogen receptors are expressed in melanocytes, but in our view, the data as presented is not convincing, and the techniques used are not quantitative. Critically, those experiments lacked negative controls. We did not examine hair-follicle derived melanocytes, as the cells for our study were derived primarily from foreskins (which are hairless). Although we attempted to review the Tobin et al. poster cited by the reviewer, we were unable to locate any images or corresponding data, and therefore cannot comment directly on the claim in the title of that poster. However, we would certainly be willing to do so if the reviewers were to provide us with the data and methods used to obtain it. To our knowledge there are no peer-reviewed publications providing unequivocal evidence that classical estrogen or progesterone receptors are expressed and functional in normal primary human melanocytes. However, we do not exclude the possibility that in some tissue settings, including neoplastic lesions and possibly hair follicles, melanocytes express nuclear ER/PR. Still, as there is no known direct signaling pathway linking nuclear sex hormone receptors to the melanin synthesis machinery, it is most likely that the major effects of estrogen and progesterone on pigment production are mediated through the G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs identified in our current work. These points and references are included in the text in the subsection \u201cEstrogen and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis\u201d and in the Discussion."

There are also a few clarifications that would improve the quality of the manuscript: 1) The authors state that there have been no changes in melanocyte number in the organotypic human tissue. They should also clarify whether treatment of melanocytes in culture had any effect on the proliferation or not.</i> We observed modest changes in melanocyte proliferation when cells were treated with estrogen or progesterone in 2-D monolayer in vitro culture. Estrogen treated melanocytes tended to proliferate slightly slower, while progesterone treated cells tended to proliferate slightly faster. The proliferation effects varied with the basal level of melanin production. Melanocytes from dark skin were more sensitive to progesterone than estrogen, while melanocytes from light skin were more sensitive to estrogen. This is consistent with the idea that more a differentiated melanocyte produces more pigment and proliferates more slowly than a less differentiated melanocyte, but inconsistent with previous studies that have suggested that E2 somehow stimulates proliferation. Nonetheless, these changes in proliferation in monolayer culture are likely an in vitro artifact, as adult epidermal melanocytes are relatively nonproliferative in vivo. In an exhaustive examination of 280 tissue sections of normal human skin from 18 donors, Jimbow et al. identified only 2 proliferative interfollicular melanocytes. Mitotic activity in non-neoplastic melanocytes in vivo as determined by histochemical, autoradiographic, and electron microscope studies. The Journal of Cell Biology. 1975;66(3):663-670.

Melanocytes integrate input from many GPCRs to regulate the level of cAMP/pCREB/MITF signaling that determines the rate of melanin production at any given time. There is likely basal contribution from PAQR7, as well as from other G<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs that contribute to the total cAMP signaling observed in culture. Pertussis toxin treatment inhibits all G<sub>i</sub> subunits, and this inhibition of the inhibitory inputs is therefore predicted to increase cAMP and downstream pigment production. This point is clarified in the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cSex steroid signaling in melanocytes is dependent on the nonclassical membrane bound G-protein coupled sex hormone receptors GPER and PAQR7\u201d."

While topical delivery of such agents would likely avoid off target effects in distant tissues, there exits the theoretical possibility of off-target effects within the skin. However, we did not note any significant abnormalities in the epidermis from our in vitro skin tissues treated with the sex steroids. FDA approved topical estrogen and progesterone products (approved for other non-pigment related indications) have not been associated with increased skin cancer risk or significant skin abnormalities. Interestingly however, topical estrogen has been associated with hyperpigmentation. Given that the increased systemic estrogen and progesterone associated with pregnancy also does not typically result in skin cancer or other non-pigment skin pathology, we think it likely that specific GPER and PAQR7 agonists, will be well-tolerated. Nonetheless, formal toxicity studies and careful evaluation of human skin treated in any future clinical trials will be important. These points are addressed in the Discussion."
