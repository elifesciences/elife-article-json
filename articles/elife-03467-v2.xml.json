                    "text": "We show that multiple, functionally specialized cohesin complexes mediate the establishment and two-step release of sister chromatid cohesion that underlies the production of haploid gametes. In <i>C. elegans,</i> the kleisin subunits REC-8 and COH-3/4 differ between meiotic cohesins and endow them with distinctive properties that specify how cohesins load onto chromosomes and then trigger and release cohesion. Unlike REC-8 cohesin, COH-3/4 cohesin becomes cohesive through a replication-independent mechanism initiated by the DNA double-stranded breaks that induce crossover recombination. Thus, break-induced cohesion also tethers replicated meiotic chromosomes. Later, recombination stimulates separase-independent removal of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesins from reciprocal chromosomal territories flanking the crossover site. This region-specific removal likely underlies the two-step separation of homologs and sisters. Unexpectedly, COH-3/4 performs cohesion-independent functions in synaptonemal complex assembly. This new model for cohesin function diverges from that established in yeast but likely applies directly to plants and mammals, which utilize similar meiotic kleisins."

Changing this single subunit has a major impact on cohesin's function. Consequently, each complex plays a specific role in tethering and then releasing sister chromatids. One of the cohesin complexes is triggered to tether the sister chromatids when the chromosomes replicate. Unexpectedly, another complex only tethers the sisters once breaks occur in the DNA. These breaks allow sister chromatids that are produced from maternally- and paternally-derived chromosomes to cross over and swap genetic material\u2014which increases the genetic diversity of any future offspring. After these genetic swaps occur, the cohesin complexes are then selectively removed by different mechanisms, first to release the pairs of chromosomes and then the sister chromatids."

Accurate chromosome transmission is required both for the proliferative cell divisions that occur during mitosis and the sequential divisions that occur during meiosis to reduce genome copy number from two in diploid germline stem cells to one in haploid gametes. Approximately 30% of human zygotes have abnormal chromosomal content at conception due to defects in meiosis. Such aneuploidy is a leading cause of miscarriages and birth defects (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</a>), and is thought to result, in part, from defects in sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chiang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jessberger, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nagaoka et al., 2012</a>). SCC tethers replicated sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis and is critical for accurate chromosome segregation."

Smc1, Smc3 and the kleisin form a tripartite ring proposed to mediate SCC by encircling sister chromatids. The kleisin subunit differs between mitotic and meiotic cohesin complexes. During yeast meiosis, the mitotic kleisin Scc1 is replaced by the meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Klein et al., 1999</a>). This substitution is crucial for the reduction of ploidy."

Here, we establish a new model: multiple, functionally specialized cohesin complexes that differ in their kleisin subunit perform distinct roles in reducing ploidy. The kleisin influences nearly all aspects of meiotic cohesin function, including how a cohesin complex loads onto meiotic chromosomes, how a complex becomes cohesive once loaded, and when, where and how a complex is removed from chromosomes in meiotic prophase. We first summarize the known roles of meiotic kleisins to provide context for these findings."

First, homologous chromosomes become covalently linked through reciprocal exchange of DNA during the process of crossover (CO) recombination. COs promote accurate homolog segregation during anaphase of meiosis I, and Rec8 cohesin is required for efficient CO formation and maintenance. Second, sister chromatids attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole (co-orient) in meiosis I to ensure that spindle forces pull homologs apart but not sister chromatids. Sister chromatids then attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles (bi-orient) in meiosis II, as they do in mitosis. Rec8 cohesin facilitates co-orientation. Third, spatially-regulated release of meiotic SCC must occur in two steps to allow the sequential separation of homologs in anaphase I and then sisters in anaphase II.

We identify factors required for association of REC-8 cohesin, but not COH-3/4 cohesin, with meiotic chromosomes, providing strong evidence of complex-specific loading mechanisms. We show that COH-3/4 cohesin is triggered to become cohesive, and thereby establish SCC, independently of DNA replication and requires the programmed, SPO-11-dependent double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination. This result was not expected, because prior work showed that yeast mitotic cohesin loads onto chromosomes during telophase or G1 of the cell cycle and becomes cohesive only during S phase (<a href=\"#bib68\">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wood et al., 2010</a>). The sole example of replication-independent SCC establishment occurs in mitotically proliferating yeast that suffer DNA damage in G2 or M of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib65\">Str\u00f6m et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Unal et al., 2007</a>). The SCC formed in response to DSBs is thought to reinforce the cohesion generated during S phase. Since Rec8 cannot generate SCC in response to DNA damage, damage-induced SCC was thought to occur only in proliferating cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</a>). Our data indicate that damage-induced SCC is an essential feature of meiosis. Finally, we show that prior to homolog separation in anaphase I, REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesins become selectively removed from complementary domains that flank the single CO of each worm chromosome in a separase-independent manner, consistent with their distinct roles in meiotic chromosome segregation: COH-3/4 becomes enriched where SCC is released at anaphase I and REC-8 becomes enriched where sister chromatids co-orient and SCC persists until anaphase II. Because REC-8 alone can co-orient sisters and mediate SCC that persists after anaphase I, this reciprocal pattern of cohesin removal may facilitate or underlie the stepwise separation of homologs and sister chromatids. This finding contrasts with the two-step cohesion release mechanism of yeast that utilizes only Rec8 and factors like Mei-S332/Shogushin to protect centromeric Rec8 cohesin from degradation during anaphase I, thereby ensuring sister cohesion until anaphase II. Our findings not only reveal unanticipated features of meiosis in <i>C. elegans</i>, but also establish models of meiotic cohesin function applicable to gametogenesis in plants and mammals."

In zygotene, central region (CR) proteins assemble between homologous AEs, tethering homologs along their lengths in a process called synapsis. Chromosomes remain clustered until pachytene, when the fully-synapsed homologs redistribute around the nuclear periphery."

In contrast, COH-3/4 was not detected in premeiotic nuclei, but intense COH-3/4 staining appeared abruptly on meiotic chromosomal axes in the transition zone and persisted through prophase I, suggesting that COH-3/4 first accumulates at the onset of meiosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Two additional lines of evidence supported this conclusion. First, COH-3/4 staining was not detected in nuclei that expressed PCNA, an S phase-specific DNA polymerase processivity factor used for mitotic and premeiotic DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Second, in animals carrying a <i>glp-1</i> gain-of-function allele that blocks the initiation of meiosis (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Berry et al., 1997</a>), REC-8, but not COH-3/4, was strongly expressed in the mitotically proliferating nuclei that filled the entire gonad (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, COH-3/4 associates with chromosomes after premeiotic S phase is complete, suggesting that COH-3/4 and REC-8 cohesins may load onto chromosomes and become cohesive by different mechanisms."

Our finding that REC-8 accumulates in both premeiotic and meiotic nuclei, but COH-3/4 accumulates only in meiotic nuclei, suggested that REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesins might load by different mechanisms. We therefore examined COH-3/4 loading in two mutant strains in which REC-8 was undetectable on meiotic chromosomes but SCC persisted: <i>htp-3</i> mutants lacking the HORMA domain AE protein HTP-3 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goodyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Severson et al., 2009</a>), and <i>tim-1</i> mutants lacking the <i>C. elegans</i> TIMELESS homolog TIM-1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). TIMELESS was initially identified in <i>Drosophila</i> as a factor involved in circadian rhythms, but TIMELESS orthologs were subsequently shown to function during DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gotter et al., 2007</a>). In both mutants, REC-8 was detected at normal levels in premeiotic nuclei but failed to associate with meiotic chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Severson et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, COH-3/4 loading appeared normal in <i>htp-3</i> and <i>tim-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

The number and morphology of DAPI-staining bodies in diakinesis nuclei of each genotype examined indicated that other chromosomes behaved similarly to chromosome V (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Thus, the distance between LacI::GFP spots is a reliable measure of the global status of SCC in diakinesis nuclei."

Although COH-3/4 associates with chromosomes of <i>him-3 rec-8</i> animals, the intensity of COH-3/4 signal is less than that detected in <i>him-3</i> single mutants, which, in turn, is less than that in wild-type animals (See also <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A reduction in signal is also true of DAPI and HTP-3, which loads onto chromosomes independently of HIM-3 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goodyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Severson et al., 2009</a>). Thus, the strong staining of COH-3/4 and HTP-3 observed in wild-type nuclei likely results from the close association of the four chromatid axes via synapsis and SCC, while the reduced staining in <i>him-3</i> mutants likely results from homolog separation due to defective synapsis, and in <i>him-3 rec-8</i> mutants from homolog and sister separation due to defective synapsis and SCC. Consistent with this model, a similar reduction in the intensity of COH-3/4 and HTP-3 staining was detected in <i>rec-8</i> animals also lacking the CR protein SYP-1, which is dispensable for chromosomal loading of all known AE proteins (<a href=\"#bib45\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>; AFS unpublished data).

Abundant RAD-51 foci are detected in <i>him-3 rec-8</i> and <i>rec-8; syp-1</i> mutants, indicating that DSBs are formed. RAD-51 staining persists abnormally late in these mutants, and chromosomal fragmentation and fusions are evident in diakinesis nuclei (<b>D</b>) stained with DAPI (red) and LacI::GFP (green) as in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. Thus, establishment of COH-3/4-dependent SCC is essential for homology-directed DSB repair in animals homozygous for a <i>rec-8</i> deletion.

Prior experiments showed that \u03b3-irradiation restored CO recombination in <i>spo-11</i> mutants and suppressed lethality (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dernburg et al., 1998</a>). In our experiments, 12 Gy of \u03b3-irradiation triggered CO recombination between most homolog pairs of <i>spo-11</i> mutants without causing chromosomal fragmentation or fusion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). That dose also restored SCC: sisters were tethered in 75% of irradiated <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). Thus, programmed meiotic DSBs are essential for COH-3/4-dependent SCC, and the kleisin subunit determines whether a cohesin requires DSBs to establish cohesion. Moreover, our data suggest that meiotic SCC is established in successive waves: during premeiotic DNA replication, the nascent sister chromatids are tethered by Watson-Crick base pairing in unreplicated regions and by REC-8 cohesin in replicated regions. Subsequently, DSBs trigger COH-3/4 cohesin to become cohesive during meiosis. This second wave of SCC establishment reinforces the cohesion generated during DNA replication. Evidence supporting this model is described in the following paragraphs."

Mec1 in turn stimulates the Chk1 kinase to phosphorylate the mitotic kleisin Scc1 on serine 83, which triggers cohesin to become cohesive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</a>).

In contrast, sisters are separated in most pachytene nuclei of kleisin triple mutants but still remain close together, suggesting that residual SCC persists. Partial depletion of SCC-1 in kleisin triple mutant animals increases both the frequency of sister separation and the distance between sisters, demonstrating a meiotic role for SCC-1.

In prophase, cohesin complexes are removed from chromosome arms via the prophase pathway, a non-proteolytic pathway that involves phosphorylation by Polo and Aurora B kinases. At anaphase onset, cohesin is removed from centromeres by proteolysis of the kleisin by the cysteine protease separase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buonomo et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Uhlmann et al., 2000</a>). The timing of removal of REC-8 and COH-3/4 suggested that cohesin complexes are triggered to dissociate from chromosomes in prophase, independently of separase. Consistent with this, removal of REC-8 from the short arm did not require the worm separase homolog SEP-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) but did require the Aurora B kinase AIR-2, which accumulates at the short arm in late diakinesis, prior to the reduction of REC-8 in this region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rogers et al., 2002</a>). These data are consistent with removal of REC-8 cohesin from the short arm by a meiotic prophase pathway. Dissociation of COH-3/4 from the long arm was also independent of SEP-1. However, neither removal of COH-3/4 from the long arm nor maintenance of COH-3/4 at the short arm required AIR-2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These data are consistent with our finding that COH-3/4 begins to disappear from the long arm in diplotene, well before the accumulation of AIR-2 at the short arm. Thus, the kleisin determines not only when and where, but also how a cohesin complex is removed from chromosomes. Kleisin-specified cohesin removal in late prophase could promote the stepwise separation of homologs and sisters, a model consistent with the mutant phenotypes of <i>rec-8</i> single and <i>coh-4 coh-3</i> double mutants."

To the contrary, we found meiotic DSBs to be the essential trigger that induces COH-3/4 cohesin to tether sisters. Mutants deficient in SPO-11 failed to form DSBs and failed to generate COH-3/4\u2013dependent cohesion unless subjected to ionizing radiation.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate a requirement for DSBs in triggering COH-3/4-mediated SCC. First, COH-3/4 was not detected in PCNA-positive nuclei, suggesting that a replication-independent mechanism initiates the process by which COH-3/4 cohesin becomes cohesive. DSBs are the only known trigger for establishing SCC outside of S phase. Second, the AE protein HIM-3 can tether sisters in pachytene nuclei independently of REC-8 in both <i>rec-8</i> single and <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> double mutants, thereby obscuring the role of DSBs in establishing COH-3/4-mediated SCC. Third, synaptonemal complexes form between sisters in <i>rec-8</i> and <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> animals. Disrupting DSB formation in <i>rec-8</i> mutants lacking the SC central region protein SYP-1 (<i>i.e., spo-11 rec-8; syp-1</i> triple mutants) increased the frequency of sister separation in pachytene nuclei relative to that of <i>rec-8; syp-1</i> double mutants proficient in DSB formation. This result strengthens the view that DSBs are required to establish SCC, but the requirement is partially masked by sister linkages mediated by SC proteins. Finally, sister separation is greater in pachytene nuclei of <i>rec-8</i> mutants with a defective ATM/ATR signaling pathway than in <i>rec-8</i> mutants with a functional pathway."

Because <i>rec-8; chk-2</i> mutants exhibited reduced COH-3/4 staining and complete failure to tether sisters, CHK-2 may function in regulating cohesin loading as well as in triggering sister linkages. To assess whether the loading and SCC establishment defects are separable, the predicted CHK kinase phosphosites in COH-3/4 are being changed to alanine. S81 and/or T82 in COH-3/4 are the most plausible sequence homologs of S83 in yeast Scc1, but COH-3 and COH-4 also have four sites with a perfect match to the Chk kinase consensus sequence that might serve as targets of CHK-2 phosphorylation required for SCC establishment by COH-3/4 cohesin."

The strikingly different SC assembly defects in mutants that retain COH-3/4 binding but lack both REC-8- and COH-3/4-mediated cohesion (<i>spo-11 rec-8)</i> compared to mutants that lack COH-3/4 binding as well as REC-8- and COH-3/4-dependent cohesion (<i>rec-8; coh-4 coh-3</i>) revealed the answer. Robust SC assembled along chromosomes of <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> mutants, between sister chromatids or non-homologous chromosomes, but SC assembly failed on chromosomes of kleisin triple mutants. Thus, SC assembly requires COH-3/4 binding but not its conversion to a cohesive state, revealing that cohesin functions in cohesion-independent processes. These data also demonstrated that SC assembly is more sensitive to disruption of COH-3/4 cohesin than REC-8 cohesin, since we observed severe SC structural defects in <i>coh-4 coh-3</i> double mutants but not in <i>rec-8</i> single mutants (See also <a href=\"#bib62\">Severson et al., 2009</a>).

Our data support the following model. REC-8 cohesin mediates the first wave of SCC establishment. SCC-1 may function together with REC-8 during that process. Both REC-8 and SCC-1 are present in all premeiotic nuclei and likely bind to chromatids prior to premeiotic S phase and become cohesive during DNA replication, a pattern similar to that described for cohesin complexes in mitotically proliferating cells. HIM-3 may mediate a second wave of cohesion, but through a mechanism distinct from that of cohesin. HIM-3 is expressed and loads onto chromosomes in leptotene, at the onset of meiosis (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zetka et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>), and our data suggest that HIM-3 tethers sisters independently of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin. More definitive evidence for the involvement of HIM-3 in mediating cohesion will require a separation-of-function allele that disrupts SCC but not SC assembly or crossover recombination. A final wave of SCC establishment is mediated by COH-3/4 cohesin, which loads onto chromosomes at the onset of meiosis but is not triggered to become cohesive until the formation of SPO-11-dependent DSBs during leptotene and/or zygotene. Sequential mutational analysis in kleisin-defective animals enabled us to strip away the layers of chromosome tethering that are mediated by mitotic kleisin SCC-1, axial protein HIM-3, and SC to uncover the central roles of DSBs, REC-8, and COH-3/4 in establishing SCC."

Moreover, the idea that factors other than known meiosis-specific cohesin complexes contribute to SCC during spermatogenesis is suggested by the persistence of partial cohesion in meiotic nuclei of mouse <i>Rad21L Rec8</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#bib43\">Llano et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ishiguro et al., 2014</a>). The mitotic kleisin RAD21 appears to associate with meiotic chromosomes of both wild-type and <i>Rad21L Rec8</i> mutants, suggesting that \u2018mitotic\u2019 cohesin might tether sisters during gametogenesis in mammals, as in worms (<a href=\"#bib55\">Prieto et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Parra et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Xu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ishiguro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee and Hirano, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Llano et al., 2012</a>)."

High levels of REC8 were detected in premeiotic mouse nuclei, consistent with REC8 cohesin becoming cohesive during DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eijpe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ishiguro et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, RAD21L staining was faint in PCNA-positive premeiotic testicular cells but greatly increased on meiotic chromosomes during leptotene and zygotene (<a href=\"#bib31\">Herran et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee and Hirano, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ishiguro et al., 2014</a>), indicating that substantial amounts of RAD21L cohesin load after meiotic entry. Thus, different mechanisms may promote the premeiotic loading of REC8 cohesin and the post-replicative loading of RAD21L cohesin, a model consistent with a role for programmed meiotic DSBs in triggering replication-independent SCC establishment by RAD21L cohesin."

However, the partial sister separation observed in <i>Spo11 Rec8</i> double mutants could have resulted from defective SC assembly rather than a failure to establish DSB-induced SCC, since DSBs promote formation of SC between homologs of wild-type animals and between sister chromatids of <i>Rec8</i> mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib59\">Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Xu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ishiguro et al., 2014</a>). On the other hand, while DSBs may be critical for RAD21L cohesin to establish SCC, the sisters may have remained tethered in <i>Spo11 Rec8</i> mutants by RAD21 cohesin, thereby obscuring the essential role of DI-SCC. Thus, establishing whether DSBs are essential for mammalian meiosis will require an assessment of whether AE and/or SC CR proteins can tether sisters in mice, as they do in worms, and whether RAD21 cohesin contributes to meiotic SCC."

For quantification of distances between sister chromatids, Z-stacks of 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel, unbinned images were acquired at 0.2 \u00b5m axial spacing on a Deltavision microscope (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) equipped with a 100x/1.4 NA objective lens.
