We have used formation of the <i>Drosophila</i> indirect flight musculature for studying the assembly and maturation of thin-filament arrays in a skeletal muscle model system. Employing GFP-tagged actin monomer incorporation, we identify several distinct phases in the dynamic construction of thin-filament arrays. This sequence includes assembly of nascent arrays after an initial period of intensive microfilament synthesis, followed by array elongation, primarily from filament pointed-ends, radial growth of the arrays via recruitment of peripheral filaments and continuous barbed-end turnover. Using genetic approaches we have identified Fhos, the single <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of the FHOD sub-family of formins, as a primary and versatile mediator of IFM thin-filament organization. Localization of Fhos to the barbed-ends of the arrays, achieved via a novel N-terminal domain, appears to be a critical aspect of its sarcomeric roles."

Each mature sarcomere is made up of precisely arranged and intertwined thin filaments of actin and thicker bundles of motor proteins, surrounded by other proteins. Sliding the motors along the filaments provides the force needed to contract the muscle. However, it was far from clear how sarcomeres, especially the arrays of thin-filaments, are assembled from scratch in developing muscles."

While smaller in size, these flight muscles closely resemble the skeletal muscles of animals with backbones, and therefore serve as a good model for muscle formation in general. New muscles require new sarcomeres too, and now Shwartz et al. have observed and monitored sarcomeres assembling in developing flight muscles of fruit flies, a process that takes about three days."

Looking at how these green-glowing proteins become incorporated into the growing sarcomere revealed that the assembly process involves four different phases. First, a large store of unorganized and newly-made thin filaments is generated for future use. These filaments are then assembled into rudimentary structures in which the filaments are roughly aligned. Once these core structures are formed, the existing filaments are elongated, while additional filaments are brought in to expand the structure further. Finally, actin proteins are continuously added and removed at the part of the sarcomere where the thin filaments are anchored."

Without Fhos, the thin-filament arrays cannot properly begin to assemble, and the subsequent steps of growth and expansion are blocked as well."

The spatial organization and efficient operation of this remarkable cellular machinery relies on a host of dedicated proteins and protein complexes, which act to regulate sarcomere size and streamline its activity, and to coordinate between the multiple sarcomeric units that comprise individual myofibrils (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ehler and Gautel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gautel and Djinovic-Carugo, 2016</a>)."

Spatial organization of the mature, evenly-spaced IFM sarcomeres closely mirrors that of striated vertebrate skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib44\">Reedy and Beall, 1993</a>). Individual sarcomeric units are defined by Z-disc borders, which serve as anchoring sites for the barbed ends of the thin-filament arrays, and by a central, microfilament-free H-zone, bordered by the pointed-ends of neighboring thin-filament arrays. We utilized temporally-controlled expression of GFP-tagged actin monomers (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roper et al., 2005</a>) to follow thin-filament array dynamics, and recognize key phases and distinct transitions of the arrays throughout sarcomerogenesis. In parallel we identified Fhos, the single <i>Drosophila</i> member of the conserved FHOD family of formin proteins (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schonichen and Geyer, 2010</a>), as a major contributor to thin-filament array assembly and growth. An important aspect of Fhos involvement is its critical role in radial growth of the arrays, by mediating incorporation of new peripheral filaments to the nascent core structure. The elongation of thin filament arrays, shown to occur primarily from their pointed ends (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</a>), is mediated by the WH2-domain actin regulator Sals protein. While the combined activities of Fhos and Sals can account for most aspects of thin-filament array growth and maturation during pupal stages, other elements are likely involved in additional processes that shape and maintain the arrays, such as continuous monomer exchange at the barbed-ends."

However, in order to decipher the underlying regulatory mechanisms and uncover the machineries that drive this process, it is essential to monitor the dynamic patterns of actin monomer incorporation into the growing sarcomere. We therefore followed the incorporation of GFP-tagged actin monomers into IFM sarcomeres, throughout the pupal stages of development, as a means of revealing the assembly and maturation of IFM sarcomeric thin-filament arrays in developing flies. Inducible UAS-based GFP-actin transgenes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roper et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Verkhusha et al., 1999</a>) have proven to be reliable tools and have been used extensively to study microfilament localization and dynamics during <i>Drosophila</i> development (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fulga et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jacinto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kaltschmidt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Perkins and Tanentzapf, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schottenfeld-Roames and Ghabrial, 2012</a>).

During this (final) phase of pupal development, sarcomere units grow noticeably in both length and width, and the characteristic striated pattern of alternating Z-discs and filament-free H zones becomes clearly evident. Newly added actin is observed to form a distinct 'frame' that surrounds a dark rectangular core (insets <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and E\u2019</a>). The core presumably corresponds to the initial thin-filament array assembled during earlier phases. Conversely, the frame-like structure is likely composed of two separate contributions of newly synthesized actin to the nascent core array: extension of the initial fibers at their 'pointed' (M-line associated) ends, and addition of complete new fibers at the circumference of the sarcomere. This picture coincides well with previous studies of global IFM sarcomere growth (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Reedy and Beall, 1993</a>).

These observations demonstrate that both aspects of actin incorporation- pointed end growth and peripheral thickening- continue throughout the entire period.

This observation suggests that elongation and thickening of the array during the final 50\u201390\u2009hr APF interval are accompanied by a third mode of monomer incorporation, at the barbed end of the arrays. Absence of GFP-actin88F incorporation at the Z-disc was previously noted by <a href=\"#bib47\">Roper et al (2005)</a>, who also demonstrated preferential localization of other GFP-actin isoforms at this site, implying a specific, possibly steric hindrance of GFP-actin88F incorporation. We therefore chose to use the GFP-tagged version of actin5C (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roper et al., 2005</a>), a ubiquitous isoform, as a tool for monitoring monomer incorporation dynamics at barbed ends of the thin-filament array. Expression of GFP-actin5C during the 40\u201390\u2009hr APF time-window resulted in a nearly complementary incorporation profile to the one generated by actin88F-GFP: a prominent stripe of GFP-actin adjacent to the Z-disc and relatively limited incorporation in the peripheral actin strands and pointed ends (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Initiation of the GFP-actin5C pulse at different times within this 50\u2009hr interval, generated a thin bright incorporation stripe of constant width adjacent to the Z-disc in all cases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H\u2013J</a>). This result implies continuous exchange and turnover of actin, rather than actual growth at the barbed ends of the arrays, and is consistent with the notion that lateral growth of array filaments occurs primarily at their pointed ends (<a href=\"#bib33\">Littlefield et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Molnar et al., 2014</a>)."

It is difficult to accurately measure the width of the domain of dynamic actin-monomer exchange due to the limitations of light microscopy resolution, but it is roughly 0.15\u20130.3 \u00b5m on each side of the Z-disc. Given an estimated actin subunit size of 2.7 nm (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sept et al., 1999</a>), we can say that a complete thin filament is comprised of ~650 monomers, whereas the zone of continuous exchange at the Z-disc encompasses 50\u2013100 monomers."

The <i>Drosophila</i> genome harbors six members of this protein family, each representing a distinct formin sub-family (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mi-Mi et al., 2012</a>). To assess their involvement in the\u00a0IFM sarcomere formation, we used the muscle-specific driver <i>mef2-</i>Gal4 to induce expression of RNAi directed against each of the six formins throughout development via UAS-based transgenic constructs, and examined IFM morphology following their isolation from newly eclosed or pharate adults. In most instances, IFM development was only mildly affected, if at all, following individual knockdown of the different <i>Drosophila</i> formins."

Shown are the nine known <i>fhos</i> transcripts (designated Fhos-RA--Fhos-RI), which are divided into two groups (RA-RG and RH-RI). The two groups share a nearly identical set of 3\u2019 exons (red dashed rectangle), which encode a conventional FHOD-family formin, but are expressed via distinct regulatory regions, and possess distinct sets of 5\u2019 exons, including 5\u2019 coding exons (blue and purple dashed rectangles) that encode different N-terminal domains. The two transcript variants, RH and RA, used to generate, respectively, the long and short transgenic UAS-Fhos constructs are indicated by orange arrows. The insertion positions of three MiMIC elements, MI04231 (inserted downstream of long isoform initiation sites), MI01421 (inserted downstream of all transcript initiation sites), and MI09324 (used to produce the Fhos-GFP 'protein trap') are indicated by inverted triangles. Positions of two dsRNA target sequences used, one common to all <i>fhos</i> isoforms (red bar) and the other specific to the long forms (blue bar) are shown above the transcript map. The CRISPR/Cas9-generated deletion of the guanine residue at position 99 of the short isoform transcript and its adjacent sequence are indicated.

The canonical formin domains common to all forms are colored red, while the alternative N-terminal domains are in blue (long forms) and purple (short form). Canonical domains indicated include the GTPase binding domain (GBD), formin homology (FH) domains 1/2 and 3, and the diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). The positions of the I966A point mutation in the FH2 domain and\u00a0the premature stop codon, generate by the frameshift mutation \u0394G99 in the Fhos-PA N-terminal domain are indicated.

To pursue this notion, we set out to determine the localization patterns of the different Fhos isoforms. We first made use of a MiMIC transposable element insertion in the <i>Fhos</i> gene locus (MI09324) and the RMCE technique (<a href=\"#bib58\">Venken et al., 2011</a>) to generate a GFP 'protein trap' (Fhos-GFP), so that all isoforms of endogenous Fhos would also harbor a GFP tag (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

This observation raised the possibility that the short isoform is not functional on its own in IFMs due to its restricted localization pattern, which does not include the Z-disc associated barbed-ends of the thin-filament arrays. Notably, instances of ectopic localization of EGFP-Fhos-PA to Z-discs, which were sporadically observed when this construct was over-expressed in a null <i>Fhos</i> mutant background, were associated with markedly improved organization of the affected sarcomeres (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013B\u201d\u2019</a>).

The IFM system possesses several key features that make it amenable for detailed analysis. These include an extended developmental time window of ~60\u2009hr, the availability of genetic methods for investigation (e.g., RNAi-based knockdown) and the highly ordered and repetitive organization of sarcomeric units within IFM myofibrils, which allows for the detection and analysis of both major and subtle alterations and defects. Our study focused on the actin based thin-filament array component of sarcomeres. Towards this end, we utilized an additional, highly useful feature of the IFM system: the capacity to monitor the incorporation pattern of new actin monomers at discrete stages of the process, using transgenic GFP-actin constructs whose expression can be readily manipulated. The analyses performed using the various approaches and tools available for the\u00a0study of the IFMs allow us to chart the principles, timeline and molecular basis for assembly, organization and maturation of thin-filament arrays within this model of sarcomerogenesis."

The identity of actin nucleators and in particular formins involved in the extensive initial polymerization is not known, and it is certainly possible that several formins act redundantly, given our failure to disrupt this process by single formin knockdowns, including that of <i>Fhos</i>. An initial sign of internal myofiber organization is seen in the segregation of the abundant microfilaments produced during the early phase of pupal development, into elongated myofibrils that align in parallel to the fiber. We do not know the nature of the signal governing this alignment, but it is noteworthy that previous studies of the dynamic organization of sarcomeres in cultured muscle cells have indicated that microtubules which are aligned along the fiber may provide an initial cue for the recruitment and orientation of myosin heavy chain and possibly microfilaments as well (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pizon et al., 2005</a>)."

The initial, widespread polymerization gives way to a more limited mode of incorporation, characterized by 'patches' of actin monomers that are added to a nascent microfilament array, suggesting that this period is devoted to proper structuring of the arrays within individual, uniformly-sized and regularly separated sarcomeric units. It is during this interim period that disruption of Fhos activity first leads to alteration of the monomer incorporation pattern, in what we interpret to be a telling fashion, as it retains an underlying, highly regular pattern of monomer incorporation at the pointed-ends of the thin filament arrays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013G</a>). This observation constitutes a direct demonstration that IFM arrays elongate from their pointed-ends, contrary to the conventional barbed end-biased growth of microfilaments, and in keeping with previous findings based on studies of the pointed-end capping protein Tropomodulin in both IFMs and vertebrate cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Littlefield et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler, 2001</a>). Furthermore, our investigation identifies the WH2-domain protein Sals as a major mediator of the pointed-end growth of IFM thin-filament arrays, similar to its function in <i>Drosophila</i> larval muscle sarcomeres (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, Leiomodin acts to mediate pointed-end elongation in vertebrate cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chereau et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tsukada et al., 2010</a>), implying a conserved function for WH2-domain actin regulators in sarcomerogenesis."

We suggest that, rather than participating directly in the process of actin polymerization, Fhos plays a key organizational role during this period, which leads to the initial structuring of thin-filament arrays, using microfilaments generated by other formins and actin regulators. FHOD-family formins are considered to be poor microfilament nucleators (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schonichen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Taniguchi et al., 2009</a>), and are thought to act via alternative modes- such as microfilament bundling (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kutscheidt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schonichen et al., 2013</a>)- to provide shape and structure to microfilament arrays. Our analysis is consistent with this notion, as we have demonstrated that FhosI966A, a Fhos variant presumably lacking barbed end associated activities, supports formation of small but properly organized sarcomeres, similar to the sarcomeres normally formed during the early and interim stages of pupal development. We suggest therefore, that Fhos plays a critical early role, coupling organization of pre-existing filaments into ordered arrays, with a secondary but important capacity to coordinate array size and structure through 'patchy' monomer incorporation."

Radial growth requires Fhos, and therefore constitutes a second major contribution of this formin to thin-filament array assembly. Fhos may contribute to radial thickening by bundling and recruiting complete filaments to the periphery of the array core. The reliance on localization to the vicinity of the Z-discs and the arrest in growth of FhosI966A sarcomeres prior to radial thickening strongly imply that this activity depends on association of Fhos with the barbed ends of the thin-filament arrays."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, indirect flight musculature (IFM) is a well-established skeletal muscle model system for studying assembly and maturation of thin-filament arrays. This study (Arkadi Shwartz et al.) described the role of Fhos, the single <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of the FHOD sub-family of formins, as a primary mediator of indirect flight musculature (IFM) thin filament organization. The authors also identified several phases in the dynamic construction of thin-filament arrays: intensive microfilament synthesis -&gt; assembly of nascent arrays -&gt; elongation primarily from filament pointed-ends -&gt; radial growth of the arrays via recruitment of peripheral filaments -&gt; continuous barbed-end turnover. In addition, the authors showed that the WH2-domain protein Sals that is known to contribute to pointed-end filament elongation, was specifically responsible for pointed-end elongation."

The IFM is a great model for sarcomere and thin filament assembly, and the authors take advantage of the fly genetics as well as the ability to express 'pulses' of GFP-actin during IFM myofibril assembly to evaluate the role of the Fhos proteins in actin incorporation/assembly at the barbed vs pointed ends of the thin filaments, as well as assembly of new peripheral thin filaments during stages of myofibril growth. This is an important area in which relatively few careful studies combining genetic deletion or knockdown with tests of actin incorporation have been undertaken. The key findings are that the long isoform of Fhos (Fhos-PH) is required for actin assembly at barbed ends and peripheral thin filament addition during myofibril growth, and that the nucleation activity of Fhos is not essential for this function. In addition, data is presented suggesting that the SALS protein is important for pointed end actin addition and thin filament elongation. The data is of high quality and interesting and reinforce and extend substantially the earlier findings from Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler (2001) that thin filament elongation during myofibril assembly takes place at their pointed but not barbed ends, and from Bai et al. (2007) that SALS is important for thin filament elongation at pointed ends. There are a few areas that require clarification and extension to solidify the conclusions."

However, to my eye this image shows thin myofibrils but with clearly demarcated and short sarcomeres, quite similar to the image of the myofibrils for the point mutant Fhos I966A in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A-A</a>', which is described as having \"an organized structure of repeated sarcomeric units, with clear demarcation of the Z-discs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A-A</a>'), suggesting an arrest in sarcomere growth following proper initial assembly and organization.\" Thus, it appears to me that the rescue with the short GFP-Fhos-PA should be reinterpreted, and the text rewritten.

Knockdown and a previously described mutation lead to thin and randomly oriented myofibrils, with defects appearing after 50hs APF, suggesting an involvement at early stages of sarcomere formation. They further analyze the involvement of different isoforms as well as SALS in the regulation of actin assembly and find that the long isoform is targeted to the Z-disc, where it assembles and bundles the actin, while the short isoform is localized to the pointed ends and dispensable for myofibril formation. SALS, in contrast, as previously demonstrated (Bai et al., 2007) is needed to regulate the thin filament length at the pointed end. The article provides an unprecedented level of detail regarding the different stages of actin assembly during myofibrillogenesis and the involvement of FHOD proteins therein.

This is an important area in which relatively few careful studies combining genetic deletion or knockdown with tests of actin incorporation have been undertaken. The key findings are that the long isoform of Fhos (Fhos-PH) is required for actin assembly at barbed ends and peripheral thin filament addition during myofibril growth, and that the nucleation activity of Fhos is not essential for this function. In addition, data is presented suggesting that the SALS protein is important for pointed end actin addition and thin filament elongation. The data is of high quality and interesting and reinforce and extend substantially the earlier findings from Mardahl-Dumesnil and Fowler (2001) that thin filament elongation during myofibril assembly takes place at their pointed but not barbed ends, and from Bai et al.
