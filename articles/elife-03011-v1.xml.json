                    "text": "In presynaptic boutons, calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) triggers both neurotransmitter release and short-term synaptic plasticity. Whereas synaptotagmins are known to mediate vesicle fusion through binding of high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> to their C2 domains, the proteins that sense smaller global Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases to produce short-term plasticity have remained elusive. Here, we identify a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of plasticity thought to underlie short-term memory. We find that at the functionally mature calyx of Held synapse the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase C isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2 are necessary for PTP, and the expression of PKC\u03b2 in PKC\u03b1\u03b2 double knockout mice rescues PTP. Disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKC\u03b2 C2 domain specifically prevents PTP without impairing other PKC\u03b2-dependent forms of synaptic enhancement. We conclude that different C2-domain-containing presynaptic proteins are engaged by different Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases evoked by tetanic stimulation are sensed by PKC\u03b2 to produce PTP."

Whereas synaptotagmins are known to mediate vesicle fusion through binding of high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> to their C2 domains, the proteins that sense smaller global Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases to produce short-term plasticity have remained elusive. Here, we identify a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of plasticity thought to underlie short-term memory. We find that at the functionally mature calyx of Held synapse the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase C isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2 are necessary for PTP, and the expression of PKC\u03b2 in PKC\u03b1\u03b2 double knockout mice rescues PTP. Disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKC\u03b2 C2 domain specifically prevents PTP without impairing other PKC\u03b2-dependent forms of synaptic enhancement. We conclude that different C2-domain-containing presynaptic proteins are engaged by different Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases evoked by tetanic stimulation are sensed by PKC\u03b2 to produce PTP."

These ions activate specific calcium sensors, triggering release of molecules called neurotransmitters from the presynaptic cell through exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, and produce an electrical signal whose size is a measure of synaptic strength."

Synaptotagmin-1, synaptotagmin-2, and synaptotagmin-9 have been identified as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for synchronous release (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sudhof, 2013</a>), but the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that regulate short-term use-dependent plasticity remain elusive. For a widespread form of short-term plasticity termed post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a high-frequency burst of presynaptic APs enhances subsequent AP-evoked release for tens of seconds. PTP requires sustained elevation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and in most cases synaptic enhancement outlives Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases (<a href=\"#bib28\">Regehr et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Brager et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Habets and Borst, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Fioravante et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2012</a>). Although PTP is thought to contribute to short-term memory (<a href=\"#bib34\">Silva et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</a>), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that mediates this plasticity has not been identified."

Because these isoforms contain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding C2 domains (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sutton and Sprang, 1998</a>), we hypothesize that they function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for PTP. However, it is unclear whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties of the C2 domain of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kohout et al., 2002</a>) are well-suited to mediate PTP, which is thought to rely, at least in part, on the waning residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> after the AP burst (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fioravante and Regehr, 2011</a>). Moreover, diacylglycerol (DAG) binding to the C1 domain of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) can regulate the activity of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Newton, 2010</a>), and it has been proposed that PKC could play a permissive role in PTP rather than function as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (<a href=\"#bib29\">Saitoh et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, presynaptic C2-domain proteins do not necessarily function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors; rather, they can regulate release independent of their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties (for an example, see <a href=\"#bib11\">Groffen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pang et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, additional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins have been implicated in short-term plasticity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Junge et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mochida et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), but it has not been established that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to these proteins is required for short-term plasticity. Thus, in order to determine whether PKC<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that mediate PTP, it must be determined if PTP relies on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the PKC<sub>Ca</sub> C2 domain."

We tested whether PTP could also be induced under more physiological conditions (34\u00b0C, 1.5 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 1.2 mM external Mg<sup>2+</sup>). In this recording from a representative cell, we first induced PTP with our standard stimulation protocol (100 Hz, 4 s) at 24\u00b0C (top). We then increased the temperature to 34\u00b0C, repeated the induction protocol, but failed to obtain PTP (middle). However, we successfully induced PTP at 34\u00b0C in the same cell with higher frequency stimulation (400 Hz, 2 s). We found that at elevated-temperature, PTP could not be reliably induced with the 100 Hz, 4 s stimulation protocol (2.9% \u00b1 0.6%, n = 8 cells) but it could be readily obtained with the 400 Hz, 2 s protocol (83 \u00b1 14%, n = 5 cells). These results indicate that PTP can be obtained under near-physiological conditions. The higher stimulation frequency needed to induce the plasticity at 34\u00b0C is within the physiological firing frequency range observed at matured calyces of Held in vivo (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sonntag et al., 2009</a>)."

We recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from principal neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in response to extracellular stimulation.

Thus, in contrast to the immature calyx of Held where a substantial component of PTP (\u223c20%) is independent of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fioravante et al., 2011</a>), PTP at the functionally mature calyx of Held relies entirely on PKC<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms."

Expression of PKC\u03b2<sup>D/A</sup>-YFP in \u03b1\u03b2 dko calyces, similar to wild-type PKC\u03b2, did not affect basal synaptic properties (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>).

Similar to synaptotagmin-1, synaptotagmin-2, and synaptotagmin-9, PKC\u03b2 requires binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to its C2 domain for its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). However, PKC\u03b2 acts upstream of vesicle fusion (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Jong and Verhage, 2009</a>), does not regulate basal transmission or paired-pulse plasticity (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), and is not expected to be activated by single stimuli. How do PKC\u03b2 and synaptotagmins respond to such different activity patterns and, consequently, such different Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals? It is likely a combination of differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties and subcellular localization that underlie these contrasting responses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nalefski et al., 2001</a>). Synaptotagmin-1 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> cooperatively with low affinity and fast kinetics, and localizes close to release sites on synaptic vesicles; therefore, it is poised to detect large, transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals near open voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sudhof, 2013</a>). In contrast, PKC\u03b2 is activated by lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with lower cooperativity and is cytosolic (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nalefski and Newton, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kohout et al., 2002</a>). Prolonged stimulation is necessary to produce a sufficient buildup of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to activate PKC\u03b2, which is consistent with the prolonged activity requirement for PTP (<a href=\"#bib12\">Habets and Borst, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>)."

At the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse, PTP can be dependent on either PKC\u03b1 or PKC\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fioravante et al., 2012</a>), and at the calyx of Held synapse prior to the onset of hearing PTP depends on PKC\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chu et al., 2014</a>). These findings suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive PKC isoforms, including PKC\u03b1 and PKC\u03b3, may constitute a class of proteins that acts as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for PTP, much as multiple isoforms of synaptotagmin act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for fast synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sudhof, 2012</a>). Further studies are required to determine whether PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b3, and other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive proteins implicated in PTP, such as Munc13 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wierda et al., 2007</a>), calmodulin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Junge et al., 2004</a>), and synaptotagmin-2 (<a href=\"#bib14\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Xue and Wu, 2010</a>), can also act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors to produce PTP."

The probability of obtaining an \u03b1\u03b2 double knockout animal from heterologous (het) crosses is very low (1:16), making viral injection experiments unfeasible. We therefore bred het-ko animals together to increase the probability of getting desired animals. Similarly, to increase the probability of obtaining wild-type mice, we crossed PKC het\u2013het or het-wild-type mice to use as wild-type controls. Wild-type mice were derived from the same genetic line as \u03b1\u03b2 dko animals. To prevent genetic drift in the inbred ko lines, we backcrossed them every second generation to C57BL/6J or 129S2. For experiments, animals of both sexes were used and age-matched wild-type, PKC\u03b1 ko and PKC\u03b1\u03b2 dko mice from our colony were interleaved."

In the ideal world we would prefer to perform all experiments at physiological temperatures, but this is impractical. The reviewers are right that it is important to show that PTP is also observed at physiological temperatures and that it is mediated by PKC<sub>Ca</sub>. We have been interested in this issue for some time and had begun to perform PTP experiments at near physiological temperatures. We found that higher stimulation frequencies were required to induce PTP at near physiological temperatures (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). We went on to investigate the role of PKC<sub>Ca</sub> in this PTP. We could have used knockout mice, but our colony is currently small and breeding would have to be ramped up to obtain the necessary mice. We therefore used a PKC<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitor that we had previously characterized using knockout mice to validate its specificity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chu et al. 2014</a>). We found that the PTP at 34\u00b0C is also mediated by PKC<sub>Ca</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a>)."
