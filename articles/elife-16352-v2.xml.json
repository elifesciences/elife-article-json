As new particles are developed and tested <i>in vivo</i>, it is critical to characterize their biodistribution profiles. We demonstrate a new method that uses adaptive algorithms for the analysis of hyperspectral dark-field images to study the interactions between tissues and administered nanoparticles. This non-destructive technique quantitatively identifies particles in <i>ex vivo</i> tissue sections and enables detailed observations of accumulation patterns arising from organ-specific clearance mechanisms, particle size, and the molecular specificity of nanoparticle surface coatings. Unlike nanoparticle uptake studies with electron microscopy, this method is tractable for imaging large fields of view. Adaptive hyperspectral image analysis achieves excellent detection sensitivity and specificity and is capable of identifying single nanoparticles. Using this method, we collected the first data on the sub-organ distribution of several types of gold nanoparticles in mice and observed localization patterns in tumors."

As new particles are developed and tested <i>in vivo</i>, it is critical to characterize their biodistribution profiles. We demonstrate a new method that uses adaptive algorithms for the analysis of hyperspectral dark-field images to study the interactions between tissues and administered nanoparticles. This non-destructive technique quantitatively identifies particles in <i>ex vivo</i> tissue sections and enables detailed observations of accumulation patterns arising from organ-specific clearance mechanisms, particle size, and the molecular specificity of nanoparticle surface coatings. Unlike nanoparticle uptake studies with electron microscopy, this method is tractable for imaging large fields of view. Adaptive hyperspectral image analysis achieves excellent detection sensitivity and specificity and is capable of identifying single nanoparticles. Using this method, we collected the first data on the sub-organ distribution of several types of gold nanoparticles in mice and observed localization patterns in tumors."

In particular, metal and metal oxide NPs made from gold, silver, iron, and titanium are commonly used in biomedicine owing to their unique electromagnetic properties (<a href=\"#bib16\">Giustini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Husain et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lee and El-Sayed, 2006</a>).

However, each of these techniques has notable disadvantages. ICP can be coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) or atomic/optical emission spectrometry (AES/OES) to quantify the presence of a metallic species in tissues of interest with high sensitivity (~10 parts per billion); incidentally, detection of large metal NPs with ICP relies upon dissolving samples in strong acids. The need to dissolve NP-containing samples has severe drawbacks with respect to characterizing particle uptake including the complete loss of spatial insights such as NP distribution patterns within the given tissue. Moreover, the sample preparation itself can impede detection sensitivity, especially for small tissue samples and tissues with intrinsically low NP uptake, which must be diluted in acid. Conversely, EM studies provide exquisite high-resolution images of NP uptake by individual cells. Unfortunately, EM requires cumbersome sample preparation and acquires qualitative data over fields of view that are too small to be tractable for whole organ studies. Fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Poon et al., 2015</a>) and radioactivity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kreyling et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Collingridge et al., 2003</a>) detection can also be used to assess NP biodistribution, however these techniques typically require the addition of a labeling moiety to the NP prior to <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0use. Aside from the potential that labels may detach or even alter NP pharmacokinetic properties, whole-organ studies with these techniques can be impeded by poor spatial resolution."

                        "text": "Hyperspectral dark-field microscopy (HSM) is a technique that obtains scattered light spectra from a sample on a per-pixel basis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roth et al., 2015</a>). HSM is capable of identifying individual nanoparticles in pure solutions and cell culture by their intrinsic scattering spectra without the addition of a labeling molecule (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fairbairn, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fairbairn et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Patskovsky et al., 2015</a>). This approach may be ideal for detecting metallic nanoparticles with unique visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral signatures. Unlike current methods that characterize NP biodistribution, HSM simultaneously achieves diffraction-limited spatial resolution and excellent detection sensitivity without destroying the sample. HSM has been used to study NP uptake in cell culture (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fairbairn, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fairbairn et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Patskovsky et al., 2015</a>) and the induction of toxic effects in tissue (<a href=\"#bib23\">Husain et al., 2015</a>), but its use for characterizing NP biodistribution has not yet been demonstrated due to several outstanding constraints. The primary limitation that has prevented HSM from being used in evaluating the biodistribution of NPs in tissue is the inability to accurately distinguish NPs from the background of tissue scattering. To abate this limitation, we use a modified dark-field microscope that uses oblique sample illumination to enable 150-fold brightness enhancement and ~15-fold better signal to noise ratio (SNR) than standard dark-field optics (<a href=\"#bib3\">Badireddy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Another challenge with HSM detection stems from the reality that individual NPs within a given sample do not exhibit the exact same spectrum. Furthermore, the\u00a0NP uptake within tissues inevitably results in a combination of the NP spectrum with tissue scattering, which can be spectrally diverse. Current approaches such as spectral angle mapping (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roth et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kruse, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">De Carvalho and\u00a0Meneses, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Luc, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Roth et al., 2015</a>) (originally developed for non-biological applications) and manual delineation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Husain et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Roth et al., 2015</a>) cannot adapt to these conditions and may yield high false positive and false negative detection rates. It has been observed that no HSM method to date has demonstrated robust capabilities for quantifying false positive rates or other diagnostic measures (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roth et al., 2015</a>). Thus, HSM methods must be customized to address spectral mixing and diffraction effects as well as detection sensitivity and specificity if they are to be successfully used for microscopic analyses of complex biological samples."

In the resulting images (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>), each pixel contains the spectral profile of the sample at the corresponding spatial position and can be used to detect LGNRs with near diffraction-limited resolution (1\u2009\u03bcm). While standard dark-field images did not reveal notable differences between uninjected and injected samples, the hyperspectral images, in which three bands of the spectrum (800.0 nm, 700.6\u00a0nm, and 526.2\u00a0nm) were respectively color-coded as red, green, and blue, indicated that species with strong near infrared scattering (putative LGNRs, depicted in orange) were present in injected tissues but not observable in control tissues. We created HSM-AD, a method that combines pre-processing and adaptive classification algorithms to automatically detect and quantify LGNRs in hyperspectral images. The pre-processing stage is described in detail in the methods section (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). One of the first stages of processing includes vignette correction and a\u00a0determination of whether each pixel in the image belongs to one of three categories\u2014background, tissue, or potential LGNR\u2014based on its average intensity across the measured spectrum. Only high-intensity pixels that belong to the potential LGNR group are classified by the adaptive algorithm (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For the\u00a0training of the adaptive algorithm, pre-processed images of tissue samples from LGNR injected mice were input into a standard k-means clustering algorithm (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bishop, 1995</a>). Four initial clusters were identified using this scheme\u00a0and were used to produce a spectral cluster library (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). Owing to the unique spectral profile of LGNR scattering, the particle spectrum was automatically recognized as a separate cluster by the k-means algorithm. Next, a fifth cluster was manually added to the spectral cluster library to account for edge artifacts caused by chromatic aberrations that were frequently falsely detected as LGNRs (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The five spectra in this library were used as cluster centers for automatic detection of LGNRs in tissue sections using a nearest centroid (or nearest-neighbor) classifier. In this scheme, pixels that exhibited a spectrum that was closest (in a Euclidean sense) to the LGNR cluster center were identified as containing LGNRs (denoted as LGNR+). The rest of the pixels were classified as not containing LGNRs (denoted as LGNR-). Initial validation of the algorithm shows that regions of the image that were detected as LGNR+ indeed exhibited the characteristic plasmonic peak at around 900 nm while pixels identified as LGNR- did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>). The mean and standard deviation spectra of pixels classified into each cluster for a representative image also indicate the high fidelity of the algorithm (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

The false positives, which also have a spectral peak near 900 nm, usually appear near the edges of the tissue section. We attribute this red-shift of the spectrum to chromatic aberrations, ostensibly due to the spectral dependence of the diffraction diameter (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lipson and Lipson, 2010</a>). Next, we measured the false negatives in an image of LGNRs in mounting media (CytoSeal 60, Electron Microscopy Sciences) on a glass slide and obtained a detection sensitivity of 99.4%. We attributed the false negatives to LGNRs with hybridized surface plasmon resonances (<a href=\"#bib15\">Funston et al., 2009</a>), which resulted in spectral scattering that was different from the distinct plasmonic resonance of single LGNRs (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 5</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s6\">6</a>). Because all training and test samples were mounted using the same media, spectral shifts due to local refractive environments did not contribute to false detection (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Independently we also calculated specificity and sensitivity by analyzing LGNR-injected tissue samples (see <i>Methods</i>). We obtained a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 98.5% using this approach. The high sensitivity of the automated algorithm is further evident from its ability to detect single LGNRs, both on a glass slide and in injected tissue samples (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 5</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s8\">8</a>)."

For quantitative measurements of LGNR uptake, we analyzed kidney tissue from uninjected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2a</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s3\">3a</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s4\">4a</a>) and injected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 9a</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s10\">10a</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s11\">11a</a>) mice. Our analysis found a relative LGNR signal of 4.8% \u00b1 2.3% in injected mouse kidney tissue. By comparison, a relative LGNR signal of 0.08% \u00b1 0.01% was measured from uninjected samples, indicative of the method\u2019s high specificity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar low false positive rates were measured in other organ tissues (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2b\u2013e</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s3\">3b\u2013e</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s4\">4b\u2013e</a>). In addition to the kidney, HSM-AD was used to analyze LGNR uptake in liver, lung, muscle, and spleen sections to demonstrate an alternative to common biodistribution techniques. While a conventional biodistribution study of LGNRs has not yet been reported, HSM-AD analysis indicated that LGNRs exhibited a similar uptake profile (mostly in the liver and spleen) as commonly-used smaller gold nanorods (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Niidome et al., 2006</a>). The greatest relative LGNR signal (38.5% \u00b1 4.5%) was observed in the spleen. LGNRs were also concentrated in the liver (7.5% \u00b1 1.5%). Particle uptake was minimal in lung tissue (0.5% \u00b1 0.1%) and muscle tissue (0.8% \u00b1 0.5%) sections (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 9</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s11\">11</a>). Tissue sections without H&amp;E; staining were also analyzed and yielded results similar to those obtained for H&amp;E; stained sections (<a href=\"#fig2s12\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 12</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig2s14\">14</a>)."

Conventional dark-field images highlight features including nuclei (salmon-pink), cytoplasm (green-brown), and erythrocytes (yellow-orange) within the tissues, but they reveal little information regarding the presence or absence of LGNRs. By comparison, putative LGNRs can be roughly identified as red-orange pixels in false-colored hyperspectral images, while nuclei and cytoplasm appear in green and indigo, respectively. (<b>c</b>) HSM-AD analysis of hyperspectral images demonstrates the absence of LGNRs in uninjected tissues and LGNR presence in injected samples (two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.054).

Waste-laden blood flows into capillary-dense structures called glomeruli within the kidney. Blood plasma containing small species including ions, biomolecules, cell fragments, and (in some cases) nanoparticles can extravasate from glomerular capillaries and traverse Bowman\u2019s space before being collected into an extensive network of efferent tubes called Proximal Convoluted Tubules (PCT) and, further downstream, Distal Convoluted Tubules (DCT), which ultimately traffic waste from the kidney out to the bladder. Using our method, we observed that the vast majority of LGNRs within the kidney were concentrated in glomeruli and were virtually absent in the PCT and DCT, which are functionally downstream (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d\u2013f</a>). Glomerular uptake was 13-fold greater than uptake within the convoluted tubule network. These results can be explained by comparing the size of an individual LGNR with the narrow width of cellular junctions and the\u00a0architecture of endothelial cells that form glomerular capillaries (<a href=\"#bib45\">Satchell and Braet, 2009</a>). For reference, the sub-organ segmentation maps of all tissue images analyzed for quantification have been provided (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Partially because the size cutoff for hepatic filtration is notably larger than that of renal ultrafiltration (<a href=\"#bib31\">Longmire et al., 2008</a>), we observed 1.6-fold greater LGNR uptake within the\u00a0liver tissue compared to the kidney. Interestingly, the hepatic distribution of LGNRs also appeared to be non-uniform. Hepatocytes, which constitute the majority of liver tissue by mass, exhibited mild LGNR signal (2.9% \u00b1 1.1%). By contrast, 15-fold more LGNR signal (43.5% \u00b1 12.0%) in the liver was localized in a manner consistent with the shape, size, and number of Kupffer cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s10\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 9b</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s11\">10b</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s9\">11b</a>). We attribute this localization to the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Owens III and Peppas, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Longmire et al., 2008</a>). Thus, the variable localization of nanoparticles within the liver appears to be largely derived from the organ\u2019s innate immunological functions. It is interesting to note that aggregation within Kupffer cells likely caused spectral hybridization of some LGNRs, an observation that is consistent with previous studies of cellular uptake of gold NPs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen, 2014</a>). This spectral shifting, which was most prevalent at the centers of LGNR aggregates, caused a portion of LGNRs to remain undetected by HSM-AD. While these aggregates were undetected by algorithmic means, their manual identification as LGNRs was evident from the lack of similar morphological features in uninjected liver tissue."

While there is mild uptake of LGNRs within liver hepatocytes (blue ROI), HSM-AD sub-organ quantification indicates that uptake by Kupffer cells is roughly 15-fold higher than hepatocytic accumulation. (<b>b</b>) The pattern of LGNR uptake in the spleen is also consistent with the physiological functions of various splenic tissues.

This pattern is consistent with the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells in clearing particulate matter from circulation.

The spectral clusters identified during this training corresponded well to the spectra of each particle type and enabled high-specificity and high-sensitivity identification in samples of Nanoshells + LGNRs, Nanoshells-only, and LGNRs-only (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results demonstrate that HSM-AD can spectrally resolve plasmonic particles despite similarities in composition, although this capability was not tested in <i>ex vivo</i> tissues."

Notably, GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> are distinct from LGNRs and Nanoshells in terms of shape, size, composition, particle surface, and plasmonic resonance (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). Because GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> exhibit a visible regime plasmonic peak (~550 nm), HSM-AD analysis was performed on unstained tissue sections. First, a spectral cluster library was developed for GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> classification as described for LGNRs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Control tissues classified with this library displayed negligible false positives (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> uptake in the liver and spleen was observed at 2 and 24\u2009hr post-IV injection (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b,c</a>). Interestingly, GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> uptake appeared to be even more localized to Kupffer cells than LGNR accumulation in the liver. Furthermore, GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> in the spleen are consistently found in the marginal zone, and presence within the red pulp and white pulp is minimal (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Quantitative results from HSM-AD correlate well with those obtained using ICP-MS (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 3</a>,<a href=\"#fig7s4\">4</a>), although it should be noted that HSM-AD measurements are more\u00a0relative rather than absolute with respect to the amount of gold present in each tissue. As for LGNR quantification, four FOVs per sample were analyzed (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 5</a>,<a href=\"#fig7s6\">6</a>)."

This newly-formed vasculature is composed of endothelial cells that express high levels of cell adhesion receptors including \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> integrin (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avraamides et al., 2008</a>). Thus, \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> is commonly used as a target biomolecule for tumor imaging (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sipkins et al., 1998</a>). Such studies have demonstrated that NPs targeted to \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> exhibit greater accumulation in tumors in vivo\u00a0than NPs coated with non-specific antibodies or small molecules. We hypothesized that the presence or absence of specific molecular targeting moieties would influence tissue-NP interactions beyond simply the degree of accumulation in target tissues. To test this, we used HSM-AD to observe the spatial patterns of targeted and non-targeted LGNR uptake within U87MG (human glioblastoma cells, \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) tumor xenografts. We observed 7.4-fold greater relative LGNR signal of anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs than isotype LGNRs in tumor tissue (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a\u2013d</a>). However, the most striking differences were in the localization patterns of each LGNR type. Anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs were present in high density around the edges of small blood vessels within the tumor while isotype LGNRs showed no such association (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c\u2013f</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The prevalence of anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs around the edges of tumor capillaries is highly consistent with the expression pattern of \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> in angiogenic vessels. Moreover, isotype LGNRs found outside of the vasculature were notably dispersed compared to extravascular anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs, which often appeared in small clusters. While NPs are known to accumulate in tumors regardless of molecular specificity due to leaky vasculature, these results indicated that the enhanced extravascular accumulation of anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs may have originated from specific binding of \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> integrins present on the U87MG cells themselves."

The greater uptake of anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs may result in part from specific LGNR binding to \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> integrin, which is over-expressed by U87MG cells. (<b>c\u2013f</b>) Validation of HSM-AD images with dark-field images of slightly higher spatial resolution further indicates that a substantial portion of anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs are located along the edges of small capillaries within the tumor tissue (<b>c,e</b>) while no such association is observed for IgG-LGNRs (<b>d,f</b>). This observation is consistent with the nature of angiogenic tumor vasculature, which is also characterized by high expression levels of \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> integrin in the vascular endothelium.

Discrete regions of anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNRs were also observed outside of the tumor vasculature, presumably due to either (1) specific binding to \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub>integrin expressed by U87MG cells and/or (2) non-specific accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect characteristic of tumors. The absence of IgG-LGNR extravascular accumulation suggests the former of these mechanisms as the predominant source of anti-\u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> LGNR uptake in tumor tissue."

However, EM can only scan minimal fields of view\u2014a typical transmission EM (TEM) image for studying NP uptake covers ~1 \u00d7 1 \u00b5m. For comparison, TEM scanning of the same area depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> would require ~460,000 TEM images, which is infeasible for single tissue studies and virtually unrealistic for multiple-organ studies. The necessity of thin samples (~10 nm) for TEM imaging compared to samples analyzed using HSM-AD (~1 \u00b5m optical focus) would further multiply the number of TEM scans (&gt;46 million) required for equivalent volumetric imaging. Other biodistribution techniques based on radioactivity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kreyling et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Collingridge et al., 2003</a>), photoacoustic (<a href=\"#bib40\">Poon et al., 2015</a>), and fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib19\">He et al., 2010</a>) detection have been used previously as alternatives to ICP and TEM. By comparison, HSM-AD offers roughly 100-fold higher spatial resolution (~1 \u00b5m vs ~100 \u00b5m) than current fluorescence and photoacoustic biodistribution methods. Fluorescence-based methods may also suffer from high false positive detection arising from tissue autofluorescence, as has been observed for renal capsule tissue (<a href=\"#bib40\">Poon et al., 2015</a>). While HSM-AD was excellently suited for exploring the sub-organ localization of NPs, it has been observed that radiolabeling approaches may be poorly-equipped for accurately determining particle distribution within organs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kreyling et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, single-particle detection sensitivity was not demonstrated by any of these alternatives to ICP and TEM."

This impressive approach can obtain images of full mouse tissue sections (cm in scale), but the limited spatial resolution (50 \u00b5m) precludes the study of NP uptake within individual cells. Because detection relies upon particle fragmentation and ionization, it is unclear whether imaging mass spectrometry can achieve single particle sensitivity\u2014calculations based upon the reported data indicate that ~10 (<a href=\"#bib49\">von Maltzahn et al., 2009</a>) particles per pixel are required for detection. However, the cited spatial resolution negates many of the potential advantages of single-particle sensitivity such as direct observation of NP uptake by cells through endocytosis or adhesion to the cell membrane. More generally, while mass spectrometry provides an approach to biodistribution studies of certain materials, its use for identifying gold NPs has been constrained to NPs smaller than 10 nm and typically requires the inclusion of 'mass barcode' molecules as capping agents (such as alkanethiols) on the NP surface (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Harkness et al., 2010</a>). Incidentally, gold NPs have previously been demonstrated as assisting matrices to improve mass spectrometry detection of biomolecules (<a href=\"#bib48\">Su and Tseng, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Huang and Chang, 2007</a>). Notably, many metallic NPs are compositionally similar yet spectrally distinct (for example, gold nanospheres, nanorods, nanoshells, etc.), which may confound results in mass spectrometry-based analysis of samples containing more than one NP species. We have demonstrated that HSM-AD can successfully identify gold nanoparticles with different spectra, shape, size, and composition in tissues. Furthermore, Nanoshells and LGNRs were discernible from each other in particle mixtures. While not directly tested in this work, HSM-AD may thus be capable of distinguishing such NPs from each other in tissues, enabling biodistribution studies of multiplexed NPs. Thus, we expect that HSM-AD will extend the advantages of high sensitivity and resolution to the analysis of a variety of metallic NPs with unique spectral properties."

Spectral shifts of ~80 nm were evident between preparations of LGNRs in water (n = 1) relative to the same particles prepared in CytoSeal (n = 1.5) (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), and similar shifts were observed for Nanoshells and GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, in order to generate reliable spectral cluster libraries, it is critical to train the adaptive algorithm using images prepared in similar fashion to the samples being studied. The orientation of anisotropic NPs within a sample has also been shown to influence the observed spectrum (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biswas et al., 2012</a>). Because LGNRs are anisotropic, variation in particle orientation may affect detection sensitivity in our case, but this effect appears to be negligible in light of empirically measured sensitivity values. Because it relies on spectral identification of NPs, HSM-AD cannot detect NPs that have shifted their spectrum markedly, such as concentrated NP aggregation within cells. Such spectral hybridization is most prominent in Kupffer cells within the liver, which likely results in an artificially low measure of LGNR uptake in that organ. However, the absence of these bright aggregates in hyperspectral images of uninjected control tissues confirms their identity as LGNRs. Because of plasmon hybridization, LGNR aggregates produce shifted spectra that can resemble the scattering from H&amp;E-stained; tissue, which can impede automated detection. Thus, future efforts to detect such aggregates should rely on the analysis of unstained tissues."

In addition to improved diagnostic capabilities, the automated and adaptive features of HSM-AD enable standardized high-throughput analysis previously absent from biomedical HSM studies (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roth et al., 2015</a>). Unlike Spectral Angle Mapping (the current gold standard for HSM image analysis), HSM-AD does not require the manual steps typically needed to create target spectral libraries, define particle intensity and size thresholds, filter false positives from libraries, and calibrate angular tolerance for accurate classification on an individual image basis (<a href=\"#fig2s15\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 15</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roth et al., 2015</a>). Along with an ability to image millimeter-scale fields of view on reasonable timescales (&lt;30 min) and simple sample preparation, these properties make HSM-AD a favorable alternative to existing methods for characterizing NP biodistribution. Beyond biodistribution, this work demonstrates that HSM-AD can be used for post-injection validation of NP localization in target tissues as a function of surface modifications. Because HSM-AD is non-destructive, samples can be further analyzed by a variety of conventional microscopy techniques including immunohistochemistry to provide additional molecular detail. Collectively, the results presented herein indicate that HSM-AD provides a new approach for studying interactions of cells and whole tissues with spectrally unique NPs commonly used in biomedical imaging and therapeutic studies."

For all experiments, mice were euthanized 24\u2009hr (or 2\u2009hr, for GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub>) post-injection, and tissues including kidney, liver, lung, spleen, thigh muscle, and (when applicable) tumor were immediately resected and preserved in 10% formalin. Tissues were also resected from uninjected mice for control imaging experiments. These tissues were subsequently embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 5 \u00b5m thick samples. Sections were prepared with and without H&amp;E; stains and mounted on microscope slides using CytoSeal 60 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) as the mounting medium. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with IACUC guidelines and with the Stanford University Animal Studies Committee\u2019s Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals. Experimental protocols (APLAC #s 27499 and 29179) were approved by Stanford University\u2019s Animal Studies Committee."

First, due to noise at lower wavelengths, the spectra were truncated to disregard values below a cutoff of 566 nm. As part of HSM-AD, we initially segmented the image into background, tissue, or potential NPs based on each pixel\u2019s average intensity across its spectrum. This segmentation allowed a more accurate calculation of the biodistribution by measuring the number of pixels that correspond to tissue inside the field of view. The segmentation of potential NPs helped to avoid classifying low intensity edges that may be falsely detected as NPs due to chromatic aberrations. Before measuring the intensity of each pixel, we also applied a correction for vignetting. Vignetting is a common artifact in photography and microscopy in which image brightness is reduced at the periphery compared to the image center. We assumed a natural illumination fall-off that follows the 'cosine fourth' law, in which the light fall-off is proportional to the fourth power of the cosine of the angle at which the light impinges on the sensor. We measured the radial falloff of several images and found that it can be approximated by <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>o</mi><msup><mi>s</mi><mn>4</mn></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, in which <math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><msup><mi>n</mi><mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, where <math id=\"inf3\"><mi>R</mi></math> is the calculated distance from the center of the image and <math id=\"inf4\"><mi>d</mi></math> was found by fitting to be 2\u2009mm.

Next, we calculated the segmentation thresholds adaptively for each image (to account for different exposure times and variations in tissue scattering). The thresholds were obtained by analyzing the histogram of pixel intensities of each image (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The histogram was calculated with 510 bins and then re-sampled (using interpolation) every 5 intensity units. Pixels with the lowest intensities were segmented as background. The threshold for segmenting the background was calculated as the first minimum of the histogram (minHist) multiplied by a user-defined parameter (which is slightly larger than 1) to allow fine tuning of the background threshold. Next, we assumed that pixels representing tissue without NPs have a relatively consistent intensity lower than that of NPs and therefore correspond to a peak in the histogram. The threshold for differentiating between pixels that correspond to tissue and those that can be potential NPs can be determined by the peak of the histogram (peakHist) multiplied by a pre-defined parameter (larger than 1) which allows tuning of the threshold. This intensity-based segmentation was confirmed to be effective by comparing results over 20 separate fields of view from all analyzed tissue types. Pixels segmented as potential NPs were preprocessed by smoothing their spectra using a Savitzky-Golay algorithm (<a href=\"#bib37\">Orfanidis, 1995</a>) implemented by a\u00a0Matlab\u2019s built-in function. Next, we normalized the spectrum of each pixel by the maximal intensity across its spectrum.\u00a0Training and classification were performed only on pixels which were segmented as potential NPs."

The 4 clusters found by the k-means algorithm matched the expected spectra of the injected and stained tissue. One of the spectra automatically matched the spectrum of LGNRs, owing to their distinct spectrum compared to tissue and staining dyes, two of the spectra represent the Hematoxylin and Eosin stains, and the fourth is an intermediate cluster representing the sum of both stains (see <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Testing the algorithm on uninjected tissue samples showed false detections of LGNRs near the edges of the tissue. We attributed these false positives to spectral red-shifting caused by chromatic aberrations due to the larger point spread function of longer wavelengths compared to the smaller point spread function of shorter wavelengths. To minimize the number of these false positives, we manually added a cluster representing the spectrum of the chromatic aberrations by averaging the spectra of falsely detected pixels from uninjected samples. Indeed, this cluster showed a spectral peak near the resonance of the LGNRs, albeit much broader. The initial clusters found by k-means with the added cluster representing chromatic aberrations were used for classification of pixels as LGNR+ or LGNR- with a nearest centroid (or nearest neighbor) classifier, based on the Euclidean distance to the cluster centers. We then measured the sensitivity and specificity and also qualitatively assessed the results on injected tissue section using the algorithm with different numbers of clusters. We chose to use the cluster library which includes 5 clusters (4 obtained through k-means and the 5th added manually) because it produced the best results and clusters that were more consistent with the actual spectra present in the samples. Several other machine learning algorithms were also explored for this purpose, including support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression, but k-means yielded better results (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liba and Shaviv, 2014</a>). The classification results are presented as detection maps in which the average intensity at each pixel is displayed in grayscale and the pixels that are LGNR+ are shown in orange. Similar training and classification steps were performed for samples containing GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> (3 clusters used) and Nanoshells (5 clusters for images\u00a0of\u00a0<i>ex vivo</i> tissues, 2 clusters for Nanoshells + LGNRs)."

First, we measured the false positive and true negative rates in uninjected tissue samples to obtain the specificity. Note that false positives and true negative rates can be measured reliably from tissue-only samples due to the absence of LGNRs. Next, we measured the false negatives and true positives in an image of pure LGNRs in mounting media on a glass slide and obtained the detection sensitivity. Note that false negatives and true positives can be measured reliably from LGNR-only samples due to the absence of tissue and scattering media other than the particles themselves. In order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity for detecting LGNRs in tissue samples, we created a 'ground truth' data set by randomly choosing &gt; 200 pixels, half of which were detected by the algorithm to contain LGNRs. We then manually (and in a manner blind to the results from the algorithmic classification) determined whether pixels were LGNR+ or LGNR- based purely on observing their raw spectra and looking for the unique plasmonic peak of LGNRs. Low-intensity pixels that were considered as the background or tissue were not considered in this calculation. By comparing the ground truth to the results of the automated algorithm we obtained the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, and used them to calculate additional measures of sensitivity and specificity. Confidence intervals for these measurements, presented in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, were calculated using the 'log method' (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altman et al., 2000</a>) with the aid of a statistical calculator (<a href=\"#bib34\">MedCalc\u00a0Software, 2016</a>)."

This measurement takes into account the amount of tissue versus background in a frame and also the signal of the detected LGNRs. For this calculation, we refer to LGNR signal as the average intensity around the plasmonic peak of the LGNRs (833\u2013988 nm). The relative LGNR signal is the sum of the LGNR signal over LGNR+ pixels divided by the number of tissue pixels (i.e., the number of all pixels minus the number of background pixels) and divided by the median LGNR signal over the LGNR+ pixels in the field of view. For whole-organ analysis, we measured the relative LGNR signal in four fields of view for each organ (taken from the same mouse) and calculated the mean and standard deviation for each organ. For the sub-organ calculation, the measurement of relative LGNR signal yielded results with substantial variability due to a small number of pixels and high variability of intensity within several regions of interest. Therefore, a simpler pixel ratio (termed pixel coverage) was calculated by dividing the number of LGNR+ pixels by the number of tissue pixels for each region of interest (ROI). ROI maps are presented for each field of view in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> as well as for the additional images used for quantification (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

However, all three reviewers raised from different angles the same concern: How new and versatile is the technique. Reviewer #1 provides a number of papers that your approach should be carefully compared to \u2013 potentially with additional validation experiments. Similarly, Reviewer #3, an expert in machine learning, is not convinced that the approaches taken are all state-of-the-art. Some cross-validation with other methods would help easing this concern for a future reader of a publication. Reviewer #2 raises the most critical point: although the claim of generality is made, the data presented relies on a single type of nano-particles. In the discussion among the reviewers following the initial evaluation it became clear that manuscript could only be considered if data from multiple nano-particles were shown. We suppose that acquisition of such complementary data will exceed the typical time <i>eLife</i> grants for a revision. Therefore, we have decided at this point to reject the manuscript. That said, there is significant merit in the combination of approaches, leading to a significant result. Thus, with a more thorough comparison of your approaches to others and a demonstration of applicability to other nano-particles we would consider a new submission of this work and make our best effort to send the manuscript back to the same editor and reviewers."

Hyperspectral imaging is based on the collection of images containing spectral information across a large (relatively speaking) range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Typical applications are found for military, geoscience, or environmentally studies. Here for each pixel within an image for example the signal across the visible or infrared spectrum is collected and hyperspectral data cubes are built and analyzed. Because different objects possess different optical properties, knowing <i>a priori</i> specific signatures allow classifying the information present within a scene."

See for example a review paper from Brenner's group detailing recent works (\"Hyperspectral microscopy as an analytical tool for nanomaterials\").

From what I've seen a lot of sophisticated work has been done for hyperspectral classification in areas outside from the biological one (e.g. recently deep-learning based approaches for feature extraction for hyperspectral imaging have been implemented from different groups). Therefore, I honestly cannot judge in this regard and perhaps maybe someone with a specific imaging processing background in the field of hyperspectral classification (not necessarily limited to biomedical microscopy, but a more broad one) could perhaps provide more insights into it and comment on the novelty of the computational approach used here."

In the paper I did not find any discussion related to this. Classification methods of the type authors claim to have attempted (nearest neighbor, SVMs, etc.) could be applied on such unmixed data, and to me this would constitute a more standard way of doing things.

Similar comments for the reverse situation (false negatives). It would be necessary to know the specifics of these details better, and even better have the data (e.g. histograms and if pixel counts are used, how thresholds are utilized). Also, how is the user defined parameter (it seems a manually selected threshold is used to initially determine if a pixel is potentially LGNR) handled during validation? Is data used in the validation stage also used by the user when selecting this parameter? It is a little confusing when in the subsection \u201cData processing and automatic biodistribution detection\u201d the authors comment \"We then manually (and in a manner blind to algorithmic classification)\u2026\". How is this possible given that for a positive detection the pixel must be classified as potential LGNR first?

Reviewer #2 raises the most critical point: although the claim of generality is made, the data presented relies on a single type of nano-particles. In the discussion among the reviewers following the initial evaluation it became clear that manuscript could only be considered if data from multiple nano-particles were shown. We suppose that acquisition of such complementary data will exceed the typical time eLife grants for a revision. Therefore, we have decided at this point to reject the manuscript.

While not necessarily prohibitive, higher spectral sampling density with a tunable laser typically leads to longer scan times. Sufficiently high spectral resolution is important for the accurate classification of spectra into clusters. Also, as Meunier notes, the use of laser-based sources can introduce speckle that can corrupt image formation and quantification.

In fact, we found that it was important to analyze unstained tissue sections when detecting GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub>. While this requires consideration of sample preparation methods, we found that GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> detection and characterization in unstained tissues was as successful as our original detection of LGNRs, despite the ~300 nm difference in spectral peaks. Thus, scattering from (unstained) cellular components does not appear to preclude the detection of commonly-used nanoparticles that lack near infrared spectral signatures. We believe this new data provides a demonstration of the broader utility of our reported methods. Reviewer #2 is correct that spectra in the near-infrared will be easier to identify in stained sections. However, our results for GNS@SiO<sub>2</sub> indicate that particles with visible spectrum signatures can also be studied with our methods, given the aforementioned preparation of unstained sections."

This is because of the un-supervised nature of k-means, which automatically found the correct target LGNR spectrum, which turned out to be slightly different in tissue sections compared to the spectra of LGNRs dispersed on a glass slide. These results are explained in a report, which we referenced in our manuscript (Liba and Shaviv, 2014 in the revised manuscript), and have also been uploaded along with the revision."

Similar comments for the reverse situation (false negatives).
