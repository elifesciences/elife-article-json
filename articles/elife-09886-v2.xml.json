Histone H3 acetylation at K56 and phosphorylation at T45 are two important chromatin modifications that accompany chromatin assembly. Here we have identified the protein kinase Pkc1 as a key regulator that coordinates the deposition of these modifications in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> under conditions of replicative stress. Pkc1 phosphorylates the histone acetyl transferase Rtt109 and promotes its ability to acetylate H3K56. Our data also reveal novel cross-talk between two different histone modifications as Pkc1 also enhances H3T45 phosphorylation and this modification is required for H3K56 acetylation. Our data therefore uncover an important role for Pkc1 in coordinating the deposition of two different histone modifications that are important for chromatin assembly."

Specifically, Pkc1 helps prepare the third histone protein (histone H3) so that DNA can recoil around it.

This involves the re-deposition of both pre-existing and newly synthesised histones into intact nucleosomes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Groth et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ransom et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</a>). This process must be tightly controlled and in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> one key event is the Rtt109-mediated modification of histone H3 by acetylation of lysine 56 (H3K56) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Han et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Driscoll et al., 2007</a>). Rtt109 cooperates with two different histone chaperones Asf1 and Vps75 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tsubota et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Driscoll et al., 2007</a>) and although it is generally accepted that Asf1 is the major chaperone involved in promoting H3K56 acetylation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Keck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Tang et al., 2011</a>), recent evidence suggests a role for Vps75 in this process (<a href=\"#bib32\">Radovani et al., 2013</a>). However, the signalling pathways controlling Rtt109-mediated H3K56 acetylation are unknown. Another important modification that occurs coincidentally with DNA replication is H3 phosphorylation at threonine T45 (H3T45) but current evidence suggests that this modification has no relationship with the closely located H3K56 acetylation event (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2010</a>). In the context of an unperturbed cell cycle, Cdc7-Dbf4 has been shown to be a major kinase involved in controlling H3T45 phosphorylation levels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2010</a>)."

Pkc1 has a growing number of nuclear functions and through genetic experiments this protein kinase has previously been implicated in cell cycle events (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">Levin, 2005</a>). Part of this role can be attributed to its connection to pathways sensing cell wall integrity and its effects on the activity of the downstream MAP kinase pathway. However MAP kinase-independent roles for Pkc1 have emerged and Pkc1 was recently shown to directly affect the cell cycle by inhibiting the activity of the transcriptional coactivator protein Ndd1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Darieva et al., 2012</a>). This finding suggested that Pkc1p might act as a checkpoint kinase under conditions of replicative stress where progression to G2 phase is inhibited. However, mutant strains containing <i>ndd1</i> mutant alleles lacking the Pkc1 phosphorylation sites did not fully re-capitulate the <i>pkc1</i> mutant phenotypes, indicating that additional defects are associated with loss of Pkc1 activity. Indeed, <i>pkc1</i> mutants are sensitive to hydroxurea (HU) treatment (<a href=\"#bib31\">Queralt and Igual, 2005</a>), suggesting a potential role for Pkc1 in controlling the response to replicative stress. It is unclear how Pkc1 might affect replicative stress but previous genetic studies have linked <i>PKC1</i> and components of the RSC chromatin remodelling complex and Pkc1 overexpression can suppress the defects associated with <i>RSC</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hosotani et al., 2001</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">Levin et al., 2005</a>). This is suggestive of a potential role for Pkc1 in regulating chromatin assembly during DNA replication."

Moreover, Pkc1 also promotes H3T45 phosphorylation and this modification is important for the coordinated deposition of H3K56 acetylation."

                                "text": "To examine whether Pkc1 has a role in protecting cells from replicative stress we first determined cell sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU) in the presence and absence of active Pkc1. To do this we made use of strains containing temperature sensitive <i>pkc1</i> alleles which could be inactivated by incubating yeast cells at 34\u00baC, thereby negating the confounding effects of heat shock stress response obtained using the traditionally used <i>pkc1<sup>ts\u00a0</sup></i>allele (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anastasia et al., 2012</a>). In comparison to cells containing wild-type <i>PKC1</i> (DK186), temperature sensitive <i>pkc1-14</i> (DK1690) cells, grown at 34\u00baC to inactivate Pkc1 were inviable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top panel) consistent with previous studies using a <i>pkc1</i>\u0394 deletion strain (<a href=\"#bib31\">Queralt and Igual, 2005</a>). Loss of <i>PKC1</i> function results in cell lysis in the absence of osmotic support. The presence of sorbitol saved the <i>pkc1-14</i> mutant phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle panel) but HU sensitivity was observed under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom panel). This suggested a role for Pkc1 other than signalling through the well studied downstream MAP kinase cascade which includes the kinase Bck1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 1993</a>). Indeed <i>bck1</i>\u0394 (Y01328) cells were not sensitive to HU, further emphasising a new alternative mechanism of action for Pkc1 under replicative stress conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To determine whether the kinase activity of Pkc1 is needed to protect cells from replicative stress, we attempted to rescue <i>pkc1-14</i> cells by re-expressing a catalytically dead (KD) version of Pkc1 in the presence of HU. However, while wild-type (WT) Pkc1 was able to rescue the growth defect of <i>pkc1-14</i> cells, the catalytically dead version was unable to do so (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

We therefore examined whether Pkc1 is required for H3K56 acetylation under replicative stress conditions. Upon release from a HU block, wild-type cells showed accumulation of acetylated H3K56 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lanes 1\u20136). In contrast, temperature sensitive <i>pkc1-21</i> cells (DK1697) showed much reduced levels of H3K56 acetylation when grown at 34\u00baC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lanes 7\u201312) even though they had progressed through S phase and arrested at G2 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Importantly, this effect was not limited to strains harbouring the <i>pkc1-21</i> allele but was also observed in a different temperature sensitive strain, harbouring the <i>pkc1-14</i> allele either upon release from a HU block (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) or upon entry into S phase upon release from an \u03b1 factor block (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). H3K56 acetylation is deposited by Rtt109, and this enzyme also acetylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Driscoll et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Han et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tsubota et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, in addition to H3K56 acetylation defects, <i>pkc1-14</i> cells showed much reduced levels of H3K9 acetylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, middle panel) which suggests a defect in Rtt109 activity."

Inspection of Rtt109 sequence revealed a potential phosphorylation site at threonine 46 (T46) which partially matches the PKC consensus sequence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To establish whether Rtt109 can be phosphorylated by Pkc1 at this site, we raised a phospho-specific antibody which specifically recognised a phosphorylated peptide surrounding T46 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

In the presence of HU, <i>rtt109</i>\u0394 cells grew poorly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This growth defect could be rescued by re-expressing wild-type Rtt109 but this rescue was lost with the non-phosphorylatable Rtt109(T46A) mutant. In contrast, Rtt109(T46D) was able to suppress the growth defect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) indicating that the insertion of a phosphomimetic residue at the Pkc1 phosphorylation site reinstated the activity of Rtt109. To understand the molecular basis to this rescue, we again examined H3K56 acetylation. As expected, this was severely depleted in <i>rtt109</i>\u0394 cells but restored upon re-expression of wild-type Rtt109 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, left panels). Rtt109(T46A) only partially re-constituted H3K56 acetylation levels and the kinetics were delayed whereas Rtt109(T46D) promoted rapid and high levels of H3K56 acetylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, left panels). These results are fully consistent with a role for Pkc1-mediated phosphorylation of Rtt109 being required for its ability to promote H3K56 acetylation."

This suggested that Pkc1-mediated phosphorylation might be important for stabilising Rtt109. Indeed, we found that Rtt109 protein was expressed to lower levels in <i>pkc1-14</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This was not due to a transcriptional defect as <i>RTT109</i> mRNA levels were elevated in <i>pkc1-14</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that these cells are attempting to compensate for the loss in Rtt109 protein. This lower level of Rtt109 likely contributes to the decreased levels of H3K56 acetylation we observed. Together, these results indicated that Pkc1-mediated Rtt109 phosphorylation is required for maintaining Rtt109 protein levels and H3K56 acetylation levels as cells recover from HU-mediated replicative stress."

Indeed, in cells released from HU block, a highly significant overlap was observed for <i>pkc1-14</i> cells or cells expressing Rtt109(T46A) in genes either downregulated or upregulated compared to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). Importantly no such significant overlaps were observed when we considered genes that were regulated in opposite directions in the two mutant strains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, when we considered the biological processes that were affected, there was a strong overlap in gene ontology (GO) terms, with over-representation of GO terms associated with processes such as 'cell wall' and 'nucleolus' strongly associated with both mutant strains and reciprocal effects seen with 'telomere maintenance' and 'DNA helicase activity' (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>). These data therefore further support a strong association between Pkc1 activity, phosphorylation of Rtt109 at T46 and subsequent downstream effects on chromatin structure and gene expression. One prediction of these results is that the phosphomimetic version of Rtt109 might be able to bypass the defects seen in <i>pkc1-14</i> cells. However, no rescue of the growth defects of <i>pkc1-14</i> cells in the presence of HU was observed (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore a working model suggested a direct role for Pkc1 in controlling H3K56 acetylation through Rtt109 phosphorylation but also that additional activities were controlled by Pkc1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

As this residue is conserved in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and is located in the vicinity of K56, it is possible that Pkc1-mediated phosphorylation of T45 might influence acetylation events at K56. We therefore examined whether Pkc1 could phosphorylate H3T45 in vitro by using purified histone H3 and immunoprecipitated Pkc1p. Efficient H3 phosphorylation was observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and phosphorylation at T45 was confirmed as the only major phosphorylation site by mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Next we examined H3T45 phosphorylation and its dependence on Pkc1 <i>in vivo</i>. As cells were released from a HU-mediated block, H3T45 became strongly phosphorylated in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

                                "text": "Given the relatively close proximity of T45 to K56 in the histone H3 tail and the link of modifications of both of these residues to Pkc1 activity, we next asked whether there is a connection between H3T45 phosphorylation and H3K56 acetylation. Importantly, H3K56 acetylation was greatly reduced in cells containing the H3(T45A) allele upon release from a HU block (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, lanes 3 and 4; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In contrast only a small change in H3K56 acetylation was observed upon release from an alpha factor block under normal growth conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, lanes 1 and 2). However, if cells were released from an alpha factor-mediated G1 arrest into HU, and the HU subsequently removed, H3K56 acetylation again accumulated following HU removal in wild-type cells. This accumulation of H3K56 acetylation did not occur in cells harbouring the <i>H3(T45A)</i> mutant allele (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggested functional coupling between H3T45 phosphorylation and H3K56 acetylation. To further probe this phenomenon, we asked whether the Rtt109(T46D) mutant could bypass the defects seen in cells containing the <i>H3(T45A)</i> mutant allele. However, only low levels of H3K56 acetylation were observed in the presence of Rtt109(T46D) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), demonstrating that this protein was unable to suppress the defects from H3(T45A) thereby indicating a crucial role for H3T45 phosphorylation in promoting H3K56 acetylation. Indeed, the Rtt109(T46D) mutant couldn\u2019t bypass the growth defects of <i>H3(T45A)</i> cells in HU (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We also tested whether Rtt109(D) could bypass the HU-mediated growth defects of <i>H3(K56R)</i> cells but again this mutant was unable to rescue the growth defect (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This further emphasises the importance of Rtt109-mediated H3K56 acetylation in protecting against the deleterious effects of HU treatment, even when H3T45 was available for phosphorylation. These results lead to a model whereby Pkc1 signals through promoting phosphorylation of both Rtt109 and histone H3 to promote H3K56 acetylation. One prediction from this model is that downstream gene expression defects should be at least partially shared by <i>pkc1-14, H3(T45A)</i> and <i>Rtt109(T46A)</i> mutant strains. Indeed pairwise comparisons of the gene expression changes observed between these strains following release from a HU block, showed highly significant overlaps in genes being upregulated in all cases (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Importantly though, of the 51 genes showing significant upregulation in the <i>pkc1</i> and <i>Rtt109(T46A)</i> mutant strains, 41 (80%) were also upregulated in the <i>H3(T45A)</i> mutant strain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Moreover, consistent co-regulation of genes in the 'DNA helicase' GO term category could be observed across all mutant strains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). These mutants therefore exhibit common defects in gene expression. This finding provides further supporting evidence that adds to the mechanistic links we have uncovered between Pkc1, Rtt109, H3T45 phosphorylation and H3K56 acetylation, and strengthens our major discovery that Pkc1 coordinates histone H3 modifications during the replicative stress response."

This must be achieved during both an unperturbed cell cycle and under conditions of replicative stress where the cell cycle must pause to ensure DNA repair occurs before recommencing the cycle. Histone H3 T45 phosphorylation and K56 acetylation are two important modifications that occur during S phase and are required for chromatin reassembly (<a href=\"#bib26\">Masumoto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hyland et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ozdemir et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2010</a>). Here we show that in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Pkc1 coordinates the deposition of these two marks under conditions of replicative stress. Previous results had implicated the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase complex in directly controlling H3T45 phosphorylation during S phase of and unperturbed cell cycle but this kinase did not affect H3K56 acetylation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2010</a>). However, a role under replicative stress conditions was not investigated and residual levels of H3T45 phosphorylation were observed in the <i>cdc7</i>\u0394 cells, indicating the existence of another H3T45 kinase. Indeed, Cdc7/Dbf4 activity has been shown to be downregulated under conditions of replicative stress, suggesting the involvement of a different histone H3 kinase under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib41\">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</a>). Here we focussed on histone H3 modification control under replicative stress conditions and in combination with previous results (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2010</a>) our data indicate that at least two different kinases are involved in controlling H3T45 phosphorylation, with Cdc7/Dbf4 operating during an unperturbed cell cycle and Pkc1 operating under replicative stress conditions where it also coordinates H3K56 acetylation."

It is not clear how this delay is achieved but Pkc1 promotes the re-activation of H3 modifications upon removal of replicative stress. Mechanistically, Pkc1 controls H3K56 acetylation through phosphorylating the Rtt109 acetyltransferase. This modification stabilises Rtt109 and thus safeguards its availability for modifying histone H3 following removal of replicative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle. It is possible that Pkc1 might also directly target other elements of the chromatin modification machinery to coordinate efficient chromatin assembly such as occurs with Cdc7-Dbf4 which can also target CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gerard et al., 2006</a>) as well as H3T45."

This is likely direct as histone H3 is efficiently phosphorylated at this site in vitro. This leads to a model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>) whereby Pkc1 promotes the coordinate modification of these two chromatin modifications and H3T45 phosphorylation is functionally coupled to H3K56 acetylation. It is not clear how this coupling is mediated but one possibility is that H3T45 phosphorylation blocks histone binding to DNA, thus allowing H3K56 to be exposed and hence accessible for acetylation by Rtt109. More complex scenarios are of course possible such as phosphorylated H3T45 acting as binding platform for recruiting a histone mark reader which then coordinates H3K56 acetylation. Indeed, further complexities in the regulatory links between histone H3 modifications and Pkc1-mediated signalling are suggested by the observation that Pkc1 levels appear to be reduced in <i>H3(T45A)</i> mutant strains (data not shown). Future studies will be required to distinguish between and dissect out the underlying molecular mechanisms. One outcome of perturbed Pkc1 activity and its downstream molecular events following HU treatment is likely to be defective chromatin assembly and preliminary evidence suggest that this might be the case (data not shown). Our data show a consistent sensitivity of <i>pkc1, rtt109(T46A)</i> and <i>H3(T45A)</i> mutants to HU treatment which complements previous data showing that <i>H3(K56A)</i> alleles are also sensitive to HU (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matsubara et al., 2007</a>) and supports a role in replicative stress. However, the response to other stress inducing conditions such as MMS and 6-AU treatment is less clear. For example, the <i>H3(T45A)</i> strain is sensitive to both MMS and 6-AU whereas the <i>rtt109(T46A)</i> strain is only sensitive to MMS (data not shown). Thus different elements of the regulatory network we have uncovered may be used to respond to different stress inducers."

Alternatively, other upstream pathways might be involved, and one potential link might be through TOR signalling as TORC2 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Pkc1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nomura and Inoue, 2015</a>) and TOR signalling has also been linked to H3K56 acetylation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2012</a>).

It is not clear whether PKC is linked to H3K56 acetylation in mammals but this modification is induced by replicative stress and its deposition is mediated by p300/CBP, the functional homologue of Rtt109 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Das et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Vempati et al., 2010</a>). Indeed, atypical protein kinase C zeta has been shown to phosphorylate and control the histone acetylation output of CBP in the context of neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Given these links between PKC and CBP/p300 it appears likely that our findings will be directly relevant to human cancer where oncogene-driven replicative stress is an important contributory event (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartek et al., 2007</a>) and therefore warrants further investigation."

They also show that Pkc1 promotes phosphorylation of H3 T45, which also promotes H3 K56Ac. The findings are novel and important. Some of the westerns are rather ugly but are still convincing. The micrococcal nuclease analyses however are not technically acceptable nor credible, nor consistent with data published for the same mutants in the literature previously. Additionally, they do not add anything to the story and need to be removed, given the effect of lack of H3 K56Ac on chromatin and MNase ladders is well established already."

The gel percentages and ladders need to be used that will enable 150bp and 300bp fragments to be seen. Also, the same amount of sample has to be digested for different samples. This is clearly not the case in these MNase analyses, especially <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. For the MNase digestion in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, the wild type sample is totally unconvincing. It is not a MNase ladder \u2013 there are intermediate bands between the nucleosomes and the tri-nucleosome is far brighter than the mono and di bands, but there is no tetra. This does not happen; they never look like this; and the state of overdigestion of the Pkc1 mutant would not be compatible with life! The results of the MNase digestion analysis of H3 K56R is far more extreme than what Steve Jackson published in Nature nearly ten years ago, and this degree of relative lack of chromatin would not support life. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> MNase also lacks a ladder. The labeling of the size markers on <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> does not correspond to the size markers and appears to be completely arbitrary. Where is the mononucleosome on this analysis? A ladder cannot have di and tri and no mononucleosome."

Yeast growth phenotypes are applied to implicate pkc1 alleles in HU resistance and H3K56 acetylation as well as to study H3 and Rtt109 PKC phosphorylation site mutant alleles. Co-IP and in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation assays suggest a network of phosphorylation whereby PKC may directly phosphorylate H3 on T45 and Rtt109 on T46. The emergent model is attractive because there appears to be a two-pronged PKC-mediated regulatory pathway, whereby direct PKC phosphorylation of H3T45 promotes acetylation of H3K56 whilst concomitant phosphorylation of the H3K56 acetylase Rtt109 on T46 also promotes H3K56 acetylation. The model appears to have been tested adequately to sustain the claims, including epistasis experiments using colony formation and gene expression as a read-outs."

It is not clear whether as such these add substantially to the manuscript. Technically a full titration/time course of MNase for each strain/condition would be more informative. Furthermore, as different strain backgrounds are compared (1C = W303, 2C = Rothstein 1983 = W303, 6E = FY406), at different temperatures (30\u00baC? and 34\u00baC), the only result is that the chromatin structure is MNase hypersensitive and therefore 'messed up'. The assays displayed do not have the resolution to indicate in what way or to what extent the chromatin is messed up. Darieva et al. again do not systematically indicate at what temperature the control strain was grown. I feel that one dedicated accessibility figure describing a logical set, rather than the present chronological-discovery-set across three figures would render the manuscript stronger on this front. For instance, comparing WT, H3T45A and H3T45D combined with <i>pkc</i> mutants at 34\u00baC. A further set of possibilities would include the H3K56A, and R mutations. Yet another, would employ the rtt109 null and Rtt109A and Rtt109D alleles. Leaving MNase experiments out altogether is also an option, however."

We would like to emphasise however that the MNase digests were carried out on chromatin isolated from cells released from HU treatment (perhaps not made clear in the paper). Under these conditions, it might be expected that chromatin would not be fully assembled correctly as many cells are still in S phase. In the case of defective Pkc signalling (and its downstream molecular events) we consistently saw changes relative to WT cells, and the increased MNase susceptibility would likely be resolved after longer release times from HU block (and hence compatible with cell survival). We do however appreciate that there are technical shortcomings with the current data (although we did use equal amounts of chromatin for each digestion) and agree that the data are not central to the paper and merit further investigation to pin down the precise defects involved. We have now mentioned this possibility in the Discussion as an area to investigate more fully in the future."

We have therefore not shown this data in the current paper. However, the data do show that although the phenotypic defects we see for all the mutant alleles investigated in this study under HU-mediated stress conditions, show consistent sensitivity responses, this is not the case in the context of MMS or 6-AU treatment which are known to elicit different molecular defects in yeast cells. We have however included an additional paragraph in the Discussion section to highlight this point:"

However, the response to other stress inducing conditions such as MMS and 6-AU treatment is less clear. For example, the <i>H3(T45A)</i> strain is sensitive to both MMS and 6-AU whereas the <i>rtt109(T46A)</i> strain is only sensitive to MMS (data not shown). Thus different elements of the regulatory network we have uncovered may be used to respond to different stress inducers.\u201d"
