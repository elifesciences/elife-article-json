This immense amount of chemical information, combined with the availability of fully sequenced genomes for a growing number of hosts and pathogens, could in theory accelerate efforts to identify new drugs for the treatment of a variety of diseases. In practice, however, sampling the complete chemical space to discover molecules with therapeutic potential is inefficient. Instead, using a handful of carefully selected compounds that identify a limited set of targets may be a more fruitful means of uncovering candidate drugs."

The UCSF team began by selecting protein kinases as their intended targets because inhibiting these enzymes in other systems is often lethal. As well as playing essential roles in the cell, kinases are druggable: that is, small molecules have been developed that can selectively inhibit these proteins in a variety of screening assays. More importantly, some of these small-molecule inhibitors have become effective drugs: Gleevec (imatinib), the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and other cancers, is probably the best known."

Most of these \u2018CDXG kinases\u2019, named after the motif found at their active sites, were expected to react with and be inhibited by a proven CDXG inhibitor called hypothemycin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Nair and Carey, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agatsuma et al., 1993</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

CDXG kinases are conserved in mammals, and these results highlight the liability of kinase inhibitors that lack sufficient host/parasite selectivity. Significantly, however, while hypothemycin could kill parasites in a mammalian host, it was not established that it did so by inhibiting CDXG kinases, or if it did, which of the 21 such kinases in <i>T. brucei</i> was affected."

First, it allowed Taunton and colleagues to define the activity of a single molecule, hypothemycin, in a whole-organism assay that, by its very nature, includes all targets. Secondly, since hypothemycin had a known mechanism of action\u2014covalently inhibiting a small class of kinases by reaction with a critical cysteine residue\u2014the initial search for the target was greatly simplified. By narrowing down the original set of plausible suspects to <i>Tb</i>CLK1, the UCSF team illustrated the power of systematically applying several new technologies."

This discrepancy likely results from the experimental differences between probing cell lysates with small molecules and probing whole organisms. So the hypothemycin-based chemoproteomics approach, with its early attention to mechanism and target structure, yielded a significant dividend."

But there is room for optimism, as large numbers of kinase inhibitors already exist and may be repurposed to inhibit <i>Tb</i>CLK1 or related factors in parasites that cause other neglected tropical diseases. Importantly, the amino-acid sequences of human and <i>T. brucei</i> CLK1s are dissimilar, so <i>Tb</i>CLK1 holds promise as a drug target. Further studies should enable the development of inhibitors that preferentially bind the parasite kinase and cure trypanosomiasis without being toxic to humans."
