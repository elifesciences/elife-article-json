In mammals, a master clock residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is reset by the light\u2013dark cycle, while timed food intake is a potent synchronizer of peripheral clocks such as the liver. Alterations in food intake rhythms can uncouple peripheral clocks from the SCN, resulting in internal desynchrony, which promotes obesity and metabolic disorders. Pancreas-derived hormones such as insulin and glucagon have been implicated in signaling mealtime to peripheral clocks. In this study, we identify a novel, more direct pathway of food-driven liver clock resetting involving oxyntomodulin (OXM). In mice, food intake stimulates OXM secretion from the gut, which resets liver transcription rhythms via induction of the core clock genes <i>Per1</i> and <i>2</i>. Inhibition of OXM signaling blocks food-mediated resetting of hepatocyte clocks. These data reveal a direct link between gastric filling with food and circadian rhythm phasing in metabolic tissues."

In mammals, a master clock residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is reset by the light\u2013dark cycle, while timed food intake is a potent synchronizer of peripheral clocks such as the liver. Alterations in food intake rhythms can uncouple peripheral clocks from the SCN, resulting in internal desynchrony, which promotes obesity and metabolic disorders. Pancreas-derived hormones such as insulin and glucagon have been implicated in signaling mealtime to peripheral clocks. In this study, we identify a novel, more direct pathway of food-driven liver clock resetting involving oxyntomodulin (OXM). In mice, food intake stimulates OXM secretion from the gut, which resets liver transcription rhythms via induction of the core clock genes <i>Per1</i> and <i>2</i>. Inhibition of OXM signaling blocks food-mediated resetting of hepatocyte clocks. These data reveal a direct link between gastric filling with food and circadian rhythm phasing in metabolic tissues."

Screening mice and tissue samples from mice for hormones that perturb circadian rhythms showed that a hormone called oxyntomodulin, which is released from the gut after eating, activated important circadian clock genes in mouse livers. The increases in clock gene activation were comparable to those seen in the brain in response to exposure to light."

One major factor believed to contribute to this adverse health impact of shift work is a disruption of endogenous circadian clocks by mistimed resetting stimuli, so called <i>Zeitgebers</i>, as a consequence of altered sleep/wake schedules. Most organisms have evolved internal timekeepers to anticipate the environmental changes brought about by the Earth's rotation around its axis. In mammals, these so called circadian clocks are based on ubiquitously expressed cellular interlocking transcriptional\u2013translational feedback loops (TTLs) of clock genes/proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Albrecht, 2012</a>). In the core TTL, the transcriptional activators circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1; ARNTL) regulate the expression of two <i>Cryptochrome</i> (<i>Cry1/2</i>) and three <i>Period</i> (<i>Per1-3</i>) genes. Towards the end of the day, PER and CRY proteins translocate into the nucleus where they inhibit their own abundance via inhibition of CLOCK/BMAL1. Further accessory loops serve to stabilize this 24-hr feedback rhythm and integrate the clock with cellular processes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Takahashi et al., 2008</a>). The clock machinery regulates physiology via orchestration of tissue-specific rhythmic expression of clock output genes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yan et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "The external light\u2013dark cycle is the most prominent <i>Zeitgeber</i> of the central circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Golombek and Rosenstein, 2010</a>). The SCN receives light information from the retina and synchronizes peripheral clocks throughout the body via neuronal and hormonal pathways (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dibner et al., 2010</a>). While the SCN itself is largely non-responsive to non-photic timing signals such as food intake, meal timing is an important <i>Zeitgeber</i> for clocks in peripheral tissues (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stokkan et al., 2001</a>). If food access is restricted to the normal rest phase of an organism, that is, the night for humans or daytime for nocturnal rodents, peripheral clocks become uncoupled from the SCN and adapt to the timing of food availability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Damiola et al., 2000</a>). Shift workers often eat at times when their digestive timing system is poorly prepared for food (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lowden et al., 2010</a>). Animal studies suggest that food intake during the normal rest phase promotes obesity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arble et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hatori et al., 2012</a>) and peripheral circadian uncoupling has been suggested to contribute to the development of metabolic disorders in night shift workers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Antunes et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Barclay et al., 2012</a>). Various other factors can regulate clock gene expression in peripheral tissues, including glucocorticoids and changes in body temperature or autonomic signaling (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dibner et al., 2010</a>). The mechanisms of food-dependent peripheral clock resetting, however, remain poorly understood. Metabolic hormones such as insulin, ghrelin, and glucagon (GCG) have been shown to affect circadian rhythms associated with food restriction (<a href=\"#bib29\">LeSauter et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tahara et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chaves et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2015</a>). While ghrelin appears to act primarily on the brain, insulin and GCG levels are mainly regulated via blood glucose. However, it was shown that carbohydrate intake alone has only a minor phase resetting capacity, while complex foods show much stronger effects (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hirao et al., 2009</a>), indicating that other factors must be involved. Besides the pancreas, other organs\u2014notably including the gastrointestinal tract itself\u2014show acute hormonal responses to fasting or feeding (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stanley et al., 2005</a>). This led us to hypothesize that postprandial, gut-derived signals may be implicated in food-driven resetting of peripheral clocks. In a screen using rhythmic liver slice cultures, we identified oxyntomodulin (OXM) as a potent resetting signal of liver circadian clocks. OXM is an anorexigenic incretin hormone produced in the gut by prohormone convertase 1/3-driven cleavage of the precursor preproglucagon (for review see <a href=\"#bib16\">Drucker, 2005</a>). It modulates energy and glucose metabolism by acting on various tissues, including brain, liver, and pancreas (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baldissera et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gros et al., 1993</a>). Since OXM secretion is dependent on food intake, we hypothesized that OXM may directly link food intake to hepatic transcriptional activity by resetting of the liver clock."

Interestingly, out of 200 peptides applied during the descending phase (\u223c180\u00b0, corresponding to the early morning) of the luciferase activity rhythm, only a few produced marked phase shifts, including three proglucagon-derived peptide (PGDP) hormones: exendin-4, OXM, and GCG (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>).

To compare the effectiveness of mammalian PGDPs in liver clock resetting, we treated slices with increasing doses of OXM, GCG, and the three other commercially available PGDPs, glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). GLP-1, GLP-2, and GRPP (0.5\u2013450 nM) had no significant resetting effects on PER2::LUC phase compared to PBS-treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). GCG resulted in phase delays of up to 3 hr, but only at relatively high concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In contrast, OXM reset PER2::LUC rhythms in liver slices at much lower doses, resulting in phase delays of up to 8 hr at higher concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). To act as a true <i>Zeitgeber</i> signal one would expect differential OXM effects depending on treatment time, that is, a circadian <i>gating</i> effect. We tested this by applying OXM at different phases of the PER2::LUC rhythm. To validate the setup, slices were treated at different PER2::LUC phases with 100 \u03bcM of the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone (DEX), which was previously shown to reset hepatocyte clocks in vivo (<a href=\"#bib8\">Balsalobre et al., 2000</a>). In a phase-dependent manner DEX treatment reset PER2::LUC activity rhythms in slices (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Very similar to what had been observed after DEX treatment in animals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Balsalobre et al., 2000</a>), application in the first quarter of the PER2::LUC activity rhythm (0\u201390\u00b0) resulted in phase delays, while later treatments produced phase advances (100\u2013180\u00b0) or had no marked effect (around 270\u00b0). Likewise, OXM effects were phase dependent. Delays were predominantly observed at 90\u2013210\u00b0 of the PER2::LUC cycle with a maximum around 180\u00b0, while only modest phase shifts were seen at 270\u2013360\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Though GCG also showed potential in resetting liver clock rhythms, OXM emerged as the most potent liver clock synchronizer from our screen. Moreover, contrary to GCG, OXM secretion is directly induced by food consumption in humans (<a href=\"#bib28\">Le Quellec et al., 1992</a>), making it an attractive candidate for linking meal timing and clock function. Therefore, we focused on OXM for further analyses."

This pathway is reminiscent of the SCN, where nocturnal light exposure induces <i>Per</i> gene transcription via cAMP signaling and CREB activation downstream of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (<a href=\"#bib49\">Welsh et al., 2010</a>). To investigate if OXM would impinge on the hepatic clock machinery in a similar way, we treated liver explants with OXM and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to measure CREB binding to cAMP response elements (<i>CRE</i>) in the <i>Per1</i> gene promoter. 30 min after OXM treatment, CREB binding was significantly increased at the <i>Per1</i> CRE, but not at downstream sequences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In addition, we analyzed clock gene expression in liver slices at different intervals after treatment with OXM at 180\u00b0. <i>Per1</i> expression was transiently induced 60 min after addition of OXM to the medium, returning back to normal levels after 120 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Similarly, <i>Per2</i> was induced by OXM after 60 min, but mRNA levels remained high even after 120 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). No significant effect was seen on <i>Bmal1</i> expression at all time points (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In line with the absence of OXM-induced phase shifts at 360\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), <i>Per1/2</i> and <i>Bmal1</i> mRNA levels were unaffected by OXM treatment at this phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>).

To test whether this effect is conserved in mice, we determined diurnal plasma oxyntomodulin-like immunoreactivity (OLI) profiles in mice with ad libitum food access and in fasted animals. In fed mice, OLI levels were elevated during the active dark phase, while under fasting conditions OLI concentrations were constant and consistently low (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In line with this, non-rhythmic <i>Gcg</i> mRNA expression in the gut was observed under fasting conditions (data not shown). These data suggest a link between food intake and OXM secretion. To test this more directly, we used a 12-hr fasting-refeeding paradigm. Mean fasting OLI levels in the early morning (ZT1) were \u223c3.5 ng/ml, but showed high inter-individual variation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Upon food intake, a rapid increase (relative to individual fasting levels) was observed after 20 min. This effect persisted for more than 1 hr before returning to baseline levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Of note, OLI induction after OXM injections were about twofold\u2013threefold higher than what was observed after refeeding (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To test if postprandial OLI induction is sufficient to affect liver clock gene expression, we analyzed <i>Per1</i>/<i>2</i> mRNA levels in livers of wild-type mice after fasting-refeeding. Parallel to the rise in plasma OLI, we observed a transient postprandial increase of hepatic <i>Per1</i> expression. <i>Per2</i> expression showed a delayed, but a more persistent induction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Food-mediated <i>Per</i> activation was partly inhibited by treatment with purified <i>anti</i>-OXM IgG to neutralize the effects of endogenous OXM in wild-type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and in <i>Glp1r</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Importantly, the effects of refeeding on insulin, GLP-1, and GCG plasma levels were not affected by treatment with <i>anti</i>-OXM IgG, suggesting that these peptides are not involved in the activation of food-induced hepatic <i>Per</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013I</a>)."

Different mechanisms of food-related circadian synchronization have been proposed, including blood glucose-responsive peptide hormones (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dibner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tahara et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chaves et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2015</a>).

Consistently, peripheral OXM injections in mice reset clock gene rhythms, as well as genes involved in hepatic carbohydrate regulation, thus impinging on hepatic energy metabolism (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 5</a>). In contrast, no significant effect of OXM treatment was observed at the level of the SCN pacemaker (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In mice, food intake during day (i.e., the normal rest time) uncouples the liver clock from that in the SCN (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lamia et al., 2008</a>), leading to a state of internal circadian desynchrony that is associated with elevated body weight and other metabolic impairments (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arble et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hatori et al., 2012</a>). In the liver, around 10% of the transcriptome is under circadian regulation including many genes involved in energy metabolism (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akhtar et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Miller et al., 2007</a>). Genetic ablation of the liver clock abolishes the circadian rhythms of several glucose regulatory genes and results in a perturbed diurnal profile of blood glucose (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornmann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lamia et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "Our experiments suggest that OXM signaling involves activation of GCGR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This is puzzling given that OXM displays a much greater capacity for clock gene induction in liver slices than GCG itself, despite having a lower binding affinity for GCGR (<a href=\"#bib29\">LeSauter et al., 2009</a>). While we cannot conclusively answer this question at the moment, there are two scenarios that might explain our observations. First, GCGR may not be the only receptor involved in OXM-mediated clock resetting. While our data suggest that GLP1R does not play a role in this context (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 3</a>), an additional OXM receptor has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baldissera et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2015</a>), the activation of which may interact with GCGR downstream signaling. Second, an additional signal may be involved that acts synergistically with OXM to activate hepatic <i>Per</i> transcription. One such candidate could be insulin, which is similarly elevated after food intake and has previously been suggested to affect liver clock rhythms (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yamajuku et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chaves et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2015</a>). In response to food intake OXM levels go up, while GCG plasma concentrations are reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), suggesting that postprandial GCGR activation does not depend on GCG itself. Interestingly, GCG/GCGR signaling has recently been implicated in the regulation of hepatic <i>Bmal1</i> expression in response to prolonged starvation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2015</a>). Sun et al. show that fasting-induced GCG signaling activates <i>Bmal1</i> transcription via CREB/CRTC2 during the night. As we did not observe any acute effects of OXM treatment on <i>Bmal1</i> transcription (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), these data suggest that GCGR signaling may have different clock targets depending on the time of activation. GCGR activation is known to induce protein kinase A-mediated nuclear translocation and DNA-binding of phosphorylated CREB on target genes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dalle et al., 2004</a>). In line with this, we show OXM-induced binding of CREB to <i>Per1</i> promoter <i>CRE</i> motifs and induction of <i>Per</i> clock gene expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2\u20134</a>). Similar phase-dependencies were observed for <i>Per</i> induction as were seen for clock shifting (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 3, 4</a>). For various tissues\u2014including the SCN\u2014it has been shown that resetting of the circadian clock involves acute up-regulation of <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dunlap, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004</a>). <i>Per</i> induction was observed after DEX treatment or serum shock in fibroblast and hepatoma cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Balsalobre et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2000</a>). Light pulses given during the dark phase induce CREB activation and <i>Per</i> expression in the SCN (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albrecht et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yan and Silver, 2002</a>). In line with this, we showed <i>Per1</i> and <i>Per2</i> induction after OXM treatment. Of note, <i>Per</i> induction in liver slices was weaker than in vivo, suggesting that additional mechanisms may amplify OXM effects in intact animals. Along the same line, OXM-mediated <i>Per</i> induction in vivo appeared to be slightly faster than in slices (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>). Importantly, peripheral treatment with OXM also altered the diurnal expression rhythms of genes involved in regulating liver carbohydrate metabolism which may underline the metabolic effects of daytime feeding in rodents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Similar to the OXM effects on clock gene expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>), refeeding acutely induces hepatic <i>Per1/2</i> expression, which has been proposed as an integral part of the food-driven clock-resetting mechanism (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oike et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tahara et al., 2011</a>). In our study, we demonstrated that food intake after overnight fasting stimulated OXM secretion and led to hepatic up-regulation of <i>Per</i> expression, which was blocked by OXM neutralization in the circulation. Accordingly, liver slice cultures from re-fed <i>Per2::LUC</i> reporter mice showed food-dependent phase delays and these effects were attenuated by OXM neutralization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). OXM neutralization does not completely inhibit the effects of refeeding on <i>Per</i> induction and liver clock resetting. This might be due to incomplete neutralization of OXM or the contribution of other food-induced factors as discussed above. Of note, while our data do not provide evidence for a direct involvement of GLP-1(R), it has been suggested that postprandial GLP-1 signaling may indirectly affect liver clock phase (<a href=\"#bib36\">Panjwani et al., 2013</a>)."

Similar to what was previously reported in humans (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mayo et al., 2003</a>), we detected elevated OLI levels in fed as compared to starved mice and in response to acute food intake (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The diurnal variability of OLI under ad libitum feeding conditions was moderate, but fasting resulted in an approximate 20% reduction of diurnal OLI secretion. Together this indicates that small meals as consumed during the inactive phase affect OXM secretion, but that substantial food intake is necessary to acutely increase OXM secretion to an extent sufficient to affect the liver clock. Of note, interpretation of plasma OXM blood levels is difficult as many OXM assays exhibit some degree of cross-reactivity with GCG and the closely related glicentin. Glicentin differs from OXM only by a 32-amino acid N-terminal extension (IP-1; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and is released from the gut after food intake at approximately similar levels (<a href=\"#bib10\">Blache et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tang-Christensen et al., 2001</a>), thus we cannot exclude the possibility that glicentin may exhibit actions that overlap with those described for OXM."

OXM treatment mimics food-mediated clock resetting in slices and in vivo in a time of day-dependent manner. Food is a major regulator of hepatic transcriptome rhythms (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vollmers et al., 2009</a>). A role for metabolic hormones, for example, insulin, GCG, or glucocorticoids, in the regulation of peripheral clocks has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib8\">Balsalobre et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tahara et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2015</a>). However, the mechanisms of food-related synchronization of peripheral clocks and their uncoupling from the SCN under time-restricted food intake rhythms are still poorly understood. Our data suggest that OXM\u2014most likely in concert with other gut- and pancreas-derived hunger- or satiety-signaling peptides\u2014is involved in the detrimental effects of mistimed food intake on metabolic homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arble et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Albrecht, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hatori et al., 2012</a>). While interfering with insulin signaling may be clinically problematic because of its potential deleterious effects on glycemia, chronotherapeutic targeting of peripheral incretin signaling may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy against metabolic disorders arising from circadian strain as observed in shift workers or during jetlag."

Degrees at the time point of treatment were calculated as follows: <i>T</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> <i>[\u00b0] = ((T</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> <i>[hsm] \u2212 P</i><sub><i>bt</i></sub> <i>[hsm])</i>: <i>P</i><sub><i>bt</i></sub><i>)</i> \u00d7 <i>360 + 90</i> with T<sub>p</sub> = treatment phase; \u00b0 = degree; hsm = hours after start of measurement; P<sub>bt</sub> = peak before treatment. If the result was &gt;360\u00b0, the value was subtracted by 360. Raw data were baseline subtracted with running averages of 24 hr. Peaks were defined as middle time point between two troughs of the sine wave. Period was determined as the time between peaks averaged over 2\u20133 consecutive cycles. For the duration of treatment, samples were maintained at 32.5\u00b0C to avoid resetting of clock gene expression rhythms due to temperature changes. Phase shifts were determined by comparing extrapolated peak times from sine wave fits before and after treatment. Unless otherwise stated, peptides used for experiments were dissolved in culture medium and administered at a final concentration of 450 pM."

This study complements earlier work by other groups that examine how corticosterone or body temperature can synchronize clocks in peripheral tissues. OXM has not been implicated in this process and this study demonstrates a new role for this neuropeptide. Moreover, the findings also point to unusual receptor signaling mechanisms as underpinning the actions of OXM in the liver."
