                    "text": "Previously we reported that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is pivotal for DNA damage-stimulated NF-\u03baB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes (Fu et al., 2016). Here we show that Sam68 is critical for genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB activation in the \u03b3-irradiated colon and animal and that Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation provides radioprotection to colon epithelium in vivo. Sam68 deletion diminishes \u03b3-irradiation-triggered PAR synthesis and NF-\u03baB activation in colon epithelial cells (CECs), thus hampering the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules in situ and facilitating CECs to undergo apoptosis in mice post whole-body \u03b3-irradiation (WBIR). Sam68 knockout mice suffer more severe damage in the colon and succumb more rapidly from acute radiotoxicity than the control mice following WBIR. Our results underscore the critical role of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-\u03baB activation signaling in the colon tissue and whole animal and reveal the pathophysiological relevance of Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation in colonic cell survival and recovery from extrinsic DNA damage."

Here we show that Sam68 is critical for genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB activation in the \u03b3-irradiated colon and animal and that Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation provides radioprotection to colon epithelium in vivo. Sam68 deletion diminishes \u03b3-irradiation-triggered PAR synthesis and NF-\u03baB activation in colon epithelial cells (CECs), thus hampering the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules in situ and facilitating CECs to undergo apoptosis in mice post whole-body \u03b3-irradiation (WBIR). Sam68 knockout mice suffer more severe damage in the colon and succumb more rapidly from acute radiotoxicity than the control mice following WBIR. Our results underscore the critical role of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-\u03baB activation signaling in the colon tissue and whole animal and reveal the pathophysiological relevance of Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation in colonic cell survival and recovery from extrinsic DNA damage."

Accumulating evidence highlights an important role of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in cellular responses to various genotoxic stresses and DNA damage-stimulated NF-\u03baB signaling cascade in the nucleus that leads to NF-\u03baB activation has been recently revealed (<a href=\"#bib19\">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Miyamoto, 2011</a>). In particular, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase gamma subunit (IKK\u03b3), protein inhibitor of activated STATy (PIASy), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) were reported to be indispensible for genoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Huang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Li et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Mabb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Piret et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, we recently revealed that Sam68/KHDRBS1 (Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa/KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1, encoded by <i>KHDRBS1</i> gene), a versatile single-strand nucleic acid binding protein (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lukong and Richard, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Richard, 2010</a>), is an important molecule in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>). Specifically, Sam68 is essential for DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and the subsequent polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) synthesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>). Sam68 deletion dampens the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling and transcription of an array of anti-apoptotic genes, thus sensitizing Sam68-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and colon epithelial cells (CECs) in culture to genotoxicity caused by DNA-damaging agents (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>). The levels of Sam68, PAR, NF-\u03baB activation, and anti-apoptotic molecules B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) are elevated and positively correlated in colon tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue derived from either the tumor-laden <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice or human colon cancer patients. Moreover, downregulation of Sam68 substantially sensitizes human colon cancer cells to spontaneous and genotoxic stress-induced cell death and retards colon tumor burden in <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>). These findings suggest that upregulated Sam68 is crucial in orchestrating DNA damage-initiated NF-\u03baB activation signaling in cultured cells and conferring the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB activation to respond to the intrinsic DNA damage frequently occurred in cancerous cells. However, the in vivo impact of physiological Sam68 levels on extrinsic genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB signaling and activation in normal cells at the organ and even the whole animal levels has not been fully understood."

                        "text": "Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are extensively used in current-day cancer treatments. It has been recognized that \u03b3-irradiation induced DNA damage triggers rapidly-proliferating tumor cells to undergo apoptosis; whereas non- and slowly-dividing cells rarely die of \u03b3-irradiation. Of note, CECs in colon crypts are among the most rapidly dividing cells in the body, which makes them susceptible to \u03b3-irradiation-induced cell death. Indeed, colon tissue injury remains one of the major adverse effects of radiotherapy, when \u03b3-irradiation is employed to treat colon cancer and other intra-abdominal cancers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Egan et al., 2004</a>). Although greater antitumor effects could be produced by higher doses of \u03b3-irradiation, the tolerance of patients to the acute side effects caused by \u03b3-irradiation to the colon limits the administered dose (<a href=\"#bib4\">Egan et al., 2004</a>). Given the essential role of DNA damage-induced NF-\u03baB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes in cell fate determination post genotoxic stresses, it will be extremely important to understand genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB activation signaling pathway not only in cancerous cells but also in normal cells under pathophysiological conditions. Besides the recently revealed critical function of Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation to overcome intrinsic DNA damage for the development and survival of colon cancer (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>), whether Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling is crucial in normal colon epithelium in response to extrinsic \u03b3-irradiation remains elusive. We therefore examined the hypothesis that Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation offers an anti-apoptotic response in the \u03b3-irradiated colon epithelium in vivo hence providing radioprotection to the organ and the animal following whole-body \u03b3-irradiation (WBIR)."

As expected, vigorous PAR production, as illustrated by immunofluorescence staining on colon tissue sections, occurred in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> colon 20 min post WBIR; whereas such an acute response was almost abolished in the colon from <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In support, immunoblot analyses showed that robust PAR chair formation in whole cell lysates of CECs from <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice at 20 min post WBIR, which was markedly tempered in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice post WBIR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These results suggest that Sam68 is crucial for facilitating genotoxic stress-induced PAR production in the \u03b3-irradiated colon tissue in vivo. Consistently, WBIR-induced p65 phosphorylation, one of the biochemical hallmarks of NF-\u03baB activation, was profound in the CECs from \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice, but was substantially tempered in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Moreover, WBIR triggered nuclear translocation of p65, as assayed by immunohistostaining and subcellular fractionation, in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> CECs; whereas p65 nuclear accumulation was greatly attenuated in the \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013F</a>). Of note, the levels of PAR, total p65, and nuclear accumulated p65 were comparable in CECs derived from mock-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> and <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> animals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013F</a>), suggesting that Sam68 deletion does not affect the physiological PAR synthesis and NF-\u03baB signaling in the colon without any stimulation. In contrast, Sam68 deletion almost abolished genotoxic stress-triggered PAR formation and the signaling events that lead to NF-\u03baB activation in the colon following WBIR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013F</a>). Consistent with our recent report that Sam68 plays a key role in DNA damage-initiated PAR synthesis and the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling in the isolated and in vitro cultured CECs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>), these results further support the crucial function of Sam68 in genotoxic stress-triggered PAR production and signaling to NF-\u03baB activation in the \u03b3-irradiated colon from whole animals in vivo."

We therefore assessed the impact of Sam68 on \u03b3-irradiation-induced expression of NF-\u03baB target gene <i>Bcl2l1</i>, which encodes B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL). As illustrated by digoxigenin-labeled messenger RNA (mRNA) in situ hybridization, <i>Bcl2l1</i> mRNA levels were elevated in colon tissue sections derived from whole-body \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

In striking contrast, WBIR-induced Bcl-XL upregulation was diminished in the colon derived from the whole-body \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, these results were further supported by immunoblot of Bcl-XL and another anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), encoded by the NF-\u03baB target gene <i>Bcl2</i>, in the CEC lysates isolated from the whole-body \u03b3-irradiated mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

In contrast, Caspase-3 cleavage was substantially augmented in the \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> colon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which correlates with the diminished NF-\u03baB signaling in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and inefficient anti-apoptotic gene expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) in the absence of Sam68. Moreover, immunoblot analyses of the CEC lysates further ascertained that the elevation in cleaved Caspase-3 and cleaved PARP1, another known biochemical hallmark for apoptosis, occurred in the whole-body \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice, but not <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

To assess the impact of Sam68 on the radiodamage to the colon tissue, we examined the morphology of the colon from mice, relative to mock-treated controls, by gross dissection and histological staining. Indeed, the colonic morphology, length, and structure of mock-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> and <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice were indistinguishable, suggesting that Sam68 is dispensable for mouse colon development (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). Fourteen days post WBIR, the colons in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> mice were comparable to those from mock-irradiated animals in morphology and length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>).

                        "text": "Herein, we report that Sam68 is critical for \u03b3-irradiation-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling and anti-apoptotic transcription in the colon in vivo and that Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation executes a protective function to the colon epithelium in the whole-body \u03b3-irradiated animals. Sam68 deletion substantially dampens the \u03b3-irradiation-initiated signaling cascade essential for NF-\u03baB activation, which includes PAR synthesis, p65 phosphorylation, and p65 nuclear translocation, in the colon derived from mice at various time periods post WBIR. As a consequence, \u03b3-irradiation-induced expression of NF-\u03baB target genes, in particular <i>Bcl2l1</i> encoding the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, is remarkably tempered in the colon epithelium from <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice, compared to <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> controls. These results are consistent with our prior report that Sam68 deletion diminishes the genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB signaling and NF-\u03baB-mediated anti-apoptotic gene expression in the cultured MEFs and CECs in vitro (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, WBIR fosters <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> CECs to undertake apoptosis in situ in the colon from <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice, but not <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> controls, which also mirrors our prior report that <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> CECs are hypersensitive to \u03b3-irradiation and other genotoxic stresses in culture (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>). Our results generated from whole-body \u03b3-irradiated animals, along with our previous reports in the cultured cells, further support the physiological relevance of Sam68 in orchestrating genotoxic stress-initiated NF-\u03baB activation signaling in the colon epithelium in response to genotoxic stresses. As elucidated previously (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>), knockdown/knockout of Sam68 substantially sensitizes human colon cancer cells to undergo spontaneous apoptosis and retards colon tumor development in <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice, which highlights the critical role of Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB transactivation in the cellular responses to the intrinsic DNA damage that occurs frequently in the rapidly-dividing/proliferating cancer cells. We show here that <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice suffer more severe damage in the colon and succumb rapidly from acute radiotoxicity than their <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> controls post the extrinsic DNA damage challenge by WBIR. These results, extending additional support to the reported key role of NF-\u03baB in providing radioprotection to the colon epithelium (<a href=\"#bib4\">Egan et al., 2004</a>), highlight the pathophysiological relevance of the Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB activation in colonic cell survival and recovery from extrinsic/environmental DNA damage."

                        "text": "Elevation in Sam68 protein levels has been proposed as a prognostic marker in multiple cancers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Liao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Song et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), although the exact function of Sam68 in these cancers remains obscure. We recently revealed that Sam68 plays a crucial role in controlling DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation and PAR production; hence Sam68 deficiency dramatically dampens the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling and DNA repair pathways initiated by DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Sun et al., 2016</a>). As a key early signaling regulator that converges at the proxy of the DNA damage-triggered signaling cascade in the nucleus, Sam68 could provide a novel target for cancer therapeutics. In support of this notion, manipulation of Sam68 sensitizes colon cancer to DNA damage-triggered apoptosis in human colon cancer cell lines and retards colon tumor burden in <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fu et al., 2016</a>). Besides its crucial role in cancer cells to overcome the frequently-occurred intrinsic DNA damage, our results here demonstrate that Sam68-dependent NF-\u03baB transactivation is pivotal for normal cells in the colon epithelium by executing an important physiological function to prevent the radiodamage to the colon caused by extrinsic/environmental \u03b3-irradiation. The levels of Sam68 proteins in both normal and cancerous colon tissues could be a potential biomarker to facilitate the optimization of the administered dose of \u03b3-irradiation, when employed as a single therapy or combined with other means for cancer treatment, in order to achieve superior outcomes via an elegant balance between the antitumor effects to tumor tissue and the acute side-effects to normal tissue caused by \u03b3-irradiation."
