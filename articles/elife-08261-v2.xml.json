However, in vivo screens have not attained throughput capacities possible with in vitro assays. We therefore developed a method enabling in vivo high-throughput screening (HTS) in zebrafish, termed <span class=\"underline\">a</span>utomated <span class=\"underline\">r</span>eporter <span class=\"underline\">q</span>uantification <span class=\"underline\">i</span>n <span class=\"underline\">v</span>ivo (ARQiv). In this study, ARQiv was combined with robotics to fully actualize whole-organism HTS (ARQiv-HTS). In a primary screen, this platform quantified cell-specific fluorescent reporters in &gt;500,000 transgenic zebrafish larvae to identify FDA-approved (Federal Drug Administration) drugs that increased the number of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells in the pancreas. 24 drugs were confirmed as inducers of endocrine differentiation and/or stimulators of \u03b2-cell proliferation. Further, we discovered novel roles for NF-\u03baB signaling in regulating endocrine differentiation and for serotonergic signaling in selectively stimulating \u03b2-cell proliferation. These studies demonstrate the power of ARQiv-HTS for drug discovery and provide unique insights into signaling pathways controlling \u03b2-cell mass, potential therapeutic targets for treating diabetes."

However, in vivo screens have not attained throughput capacities possible with in vitro assays. We therefore developed a method enabling in vivo high-throughput screening (HTS) in zebrafish, termed <span class=\"underline\">a</span>utomated <span class=\"underline\">r</span>eporter <span class=\"underline\">q</span>uantification <span class=\"underline\">i</span>n <span class=\"underline\">v</span>ivo (ARQiv). In this study, ARQiv was combined with robotics to fully actualize whole-organism HTS (ARQiv-HTS). In a primary screen, this platform quantified cell-specific fluorescent reporters in &gt;500,000 transgenic zebrafish larvae to identify FDA-approved (Federal Drug Administration) drugs that increased the number of insulin-producing \u03b2 cells in the pancreas. 24 drugs were confirmed as inducers of endocrine differentiation and/or stimulators of \u03b2-cell proliferation. Further, we discovered novel roles for NF-\u03baB signaling in regulating endocrine differentiation and for serotonergic signaling in selectively stimulating \u03b2-cell proliferation. These studies demonstrate the power of ARQiv-HTS for drug discovery and provide unique insights into signaling pathways controlling \u03b2-cell mass, potential therapeutic targets for treating diabetes."

We therefore hypothesized that identifying pre-existing drugs that promote increased \u03b2-cell mass during zebrafish development might provide potential new drug leads and therapeutic targets for treating diabetic patients. In embryonic zebrafish, early endocrine cells exist as a single principal islet in the head of the pancreas. At larval stages, additional endocrine cells are added by differentiation of extra-pancreatic ductal cells and proliferation within the principal islet (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pisharath et al., 2007</a>). Around 6 days post-fertilization (dpf), progenitors located in the pancreatic duct start to differentiate to form smaller secondary (2\u00b0) islets. At this early stage, 2\u00b0 islets consist of one or more endocrine cells that form within the tail of the pancreas (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biemar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ninov et al., 2012</a>). These easily visualized features of zebrafish pancreatic development can be used to delineate the specific effect(s) of exogenous factors on \u03b2-cell biology. For instance, the appearance of \u2018precocious\u2019 2\u00b0 islets before 6 dpf is an indication of induced endocrine differentiation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rovira et al., 2011</a>). Conversely, an increase in principal islet cell numbers, in the absence of effects on endocrine differentiation (e.g., 2\u00b0 islet formation), suggests stimulation of endocrine cell proliferation. We previously visualized precocious 2\u00b0 islet formation in a manual chemical screen of a library of largely FDA-approved drugs (Johns Hopkins Drug Library; JHDL) to identify six compounds that induced endocrine differentiation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rovira et al., 2011</a>). Here, we developed a reporter-based strategy for identifying compounds that increase \u03b2-cell mass at high-throughput rates. By labeling \u03b2 cells with a fluorescent protein and quantifying changes in fluorescence after exposure to JHDL compounds, many more drugs were identified that induced endocrine differentiation and/or stimulated proliferation of \u03b2 cells."

These approaches attain only mid-throughput rates, thus, in vivo drug screens have typically been limited to small sample sizes and screening compounds at a single concentration (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mathias et al., 2012</a>). Ideally, false-call rates could be minimized by using \u2018statistical power\u2019 to establish appropriate sample sizes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ellis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grissom and Kim, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Halsey et al., 2015</a>) and by testing compounds at multiple concentrations, a strategy called \u2018quantitative HTS\u2019 (qHTS; [<a href=\"#bib24\">Inglese et al., 2006</a>]). However, due to increased volume demands, applying such strategies to whole-organism drug discovery requires methods for evaluating compounds at HTS rates in vivo. Toward that end, we previously adapted existing HTS instrumentation, specifically a microplate reader, to the task of quantifying fluorescent reporters in living zebrafish, termed <span class=\"underline\">a</span>utomated <span class=\"underline\">r</span>eporter <span class=\"underline\">q</span>uantification <span class=\"underline\">i</span>n <span class=\"underline\">v</span>ivo (ARQiv; (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker et al., 2012</a>). ARQiv provides purely quantitative data whereas HCS typically produces images, thus, more complex data. However, offsetting any comparative reduction in data complexity, ARQiv significantly increases throughput capacity. Indeed, ARQiv assays can be performed at a pace equivalent to in vitro HTS; an upper limit of 200,000 organisms per day, per plate reader (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker et al., 2012</a>). Accordingly, ARQiv enables optimal HTS practices, such as qHTS, to be applied to whole-organism drug discovery."

We analyzed a zebrafish transgenic line in which \u03b2 cells are labeled with (Yellow Fluorescent Protein) YFP and neighboring delta (\u03b4) cells are labeled with RFP (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker et al., 2012</a>). The goal of the primary screen was to identify drugs that increased \u03b2-cell reporter activity relative to vehicle only controls, thus, compounds that potentially increased \u03b2-cell mass. Secondary confirmation screens were designed to determine whether potential hit drugs induced endocrine differentiation (precocious secondary islet formation) or stimulated \u03b2-cell proliferation (increased \u03b2-cell numbers in the absence of effects on differentiation). Our results revealed: (1) ARQiv can be applied at HTS rates. Over 500,000 transgenic larvae were evaluated in the primary screen and can detect small differences in the number of fluorescently labeled cells; (2) qHTS can be effectively applied to whole-organism drug discovery. All JHDL compounds were tested at six different concentrations and a sample number of 16 per condition; (3) new purposes for FDA-approved drugs in increasing \u03b2-cell mass. We validated 11 drugs that induced endocrine differentiation and 15 drugs that stimulated \u03b2-cell proliferation (two compounds had activity in both assays); and (4) novel roles for NF-\u03baB signaling in regulating pancreatic progenitor differentiation and for serotonergic signaling in selectively stimulating \u03b2-cell proliferation. Due to the near limitless number of reporter-based assays applicable to ARQiv-HTS\u2015that is, anything involving a change in reporter intensity\u2015we anticipate this approach will become a useful platform for whole-organism drug discovery and development."

Toward that end, we established a dual-reporter transgenic line, <i>Tg(ins:PhiYFP-2a-nsfB, sst2:tagRFP)lmc01</i> (\u03b2/\u03b4-reporter) in which the <i>insulin</i> (<i>ins</i>) promoter drives expression of a yellow fluorescent protein (PhiYFP) in \u03b2 cells, and the <i>somatostatin 2</i> (<i>sst2</i>) promoter drives a red fluorescent protein (TagRFP) in adjacent \u03b4 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>; (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker et al., 2012</a>). We reasoned that the \u03b2/\u03b4-reporter line would allow us to detect compounds affecting endocrine differentiation and/or proliferation of \u03b2 cells or their progenitors since both would cause an increase in YFP reporter signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Expressing RFP in \u03b4 cells secondarily could facilitate identification of compounds that selectively increased \u03b2-cell mass (&gt;YFP only) vs expansion of endocrine tissue in general (&gt;YFP and &gt;RFP). We tested whether a chemical inhibitor of \u03b3-secretase (DAPT), an enzyme necessary for Notch signaling, could serve as a positive control. Prior studies had shown that inhibition of Notch signaling promoted precocious 2\u00b0 islet formation and thereby increased <i>insulin</i> reporter activity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parsons et al., 2009</a>). We therefore adapted a protocol used to manually screen for precocious 2\u00b0 islet formation at 5 dpf (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rovira et al., 2011</a>) to the task of detecting increased \u03b2-cell numbers (&gt;YFP fluorescence) via ARQiv."

To generate large data sets for this analysis, 192 individual positive (DAPT) and negative (DMSO) control assays were performed. Strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) calculations were used to determine assay quality, set a hit call cut-off, and as a means of comparing effect size across compounds (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang, 2011</a>). This analysis determined that our assay was of high enough quality to pursue HTS (robust SSMD* score of 1.67). The sample size calculation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ellis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Grissom and Kim, 2011</a>), using power and significance values minimizing false-call rates (99.9% and p = 0.001, respectively), determined that a sample number of 14 was sufficient to detect a 50% effect size (i.e., half as potent as the DAPT positive control). However, to account for occasional automation errors, and in keeping with 96-well plate layouts, we elected to screen 16 larvae per compound concentration. Due to greater background autofluorescence in the RFP emission range, a sample size of 16 was predicted to be insufficient for detecting a 50% effect size on \u03b4 cells. Thus, we limited the use of RFP data to a simple comparison between YFP and RFP dose-responses, rather than as a ratiometric standard. Bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) of the positive and negative control data sets at a sample size of 16 resulted in a predicted SSMD score of 1.3 for an effect size of 50% relative to the positive control. Accordingly, we set the SSMD \u2018hit\u2019 selection cut-off at \u22651.3."

Corresponding plates underwent an initial visual assessment. 29 hit call compounds proved to be autofluorescent, another 19 negatively impacted fish viability and/or morphology. These 48 compounds were designated as false positives and eliminated from further evaluation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The remaining 177 hit call plates were further examined for evidence of enhanced 2\u00b0 islet formation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parsons et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rovira et al., 2011</a>). Increased 2\u00b0 islet formation was observed in 23 plates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, \u2018Hit I\u2019 subset; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

The other 154 hit call plates displayed no preliminary evidence of enhanced 2\u00b0 islet formation. To account for other mechanisms that could result in elevated insulin reporter activity, we examined a second group of 23 strongly implicated drugs (SSMD values \u22651.75, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, \u2018Hit II\u2019 subset) for evidence of increased \u03b2-cell numbers in the absence of differentiation effects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A residual 131 compounds await further evaluation (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). The majority of the 46 Hit I and Hit II compounds underwent a series of \u2018validation assays\u2019 to confirm effects on endocrine differentiation and/or \u03b2-cell proliferation. In keeping with common HTS practices, secondary assays were performed with complementary toolsets rather than the \u03b2/\u03b4-reporter line used in the primary screen in order to independently confirm the findings of the primary screen."

Typically, additional 2\u00b0 islets were observed only in a subset of treated larvae among a given hit call condition (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This is likely due to the \u03b2/\u03b4-reporter being less than ideal for detecting endocrine differentiation effects; reporters are linked to late-stage differentiation of \u03b2 and \u03b4 cells, which are only just beginning to appear in 2\u00b0 islets at 7 dpf (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parsons et al., 2009</a>). The requirement of a 4-day chemical exposure to observe expression differences in the \u03b2/\u03b4-reporter line via ARQiv reflects this issue. Conversely, we have shown that transgenic lines labeling early endocrine progenitors are useful for identifying compounds that induce endocrine differentiation as early as 5 dpf (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rovira et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, in keeping with the practice of using \u2018orthogonal\u2019 assays to confirm the activity of compounds implicated in primary screens (<a href=\"#bib58\">Thorne et al., 2010</a>), we tested Hit I compounds in transgenic backgrounds better suited to visualizing 2\u00b0 islets. In particular, we used the pan-endocrine reporter line, <i>Tg(neurod:EGFP)nl1</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Obholzer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dalgin and Ward, 2011</a>), to confirm the efficacy of \u2018Hit I\u2019 drugs for inducing early endocrine differentiation<i>.</i> In this line, GFP is expressed in nascent endocrine cells, permitting the detection of \u2018precocious\u2019 2\u00b0 islet formation at 5 dpf after 2-day drug exposures, akin to our previous manual screen (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rovira et al., 2011</a>)."

An alternative Notch pathway inhibitor, RO4929097 (5 \u03bcM, Selleck Chemicals; <a href=\"#bib33\">Luistro et al., 2009</a>), was used as the positive control. Our prior studies had shown that RO4929097 functions equivalently to DAPT for this assay (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Transgenic larvae were treated from 3 to 5 dpf with compounds across an expanded concentration range (0.5\u201325 \u03bcM) to account for differences with the primary assay (e.g., transgenic line used, timing and duration of compound treatment) and/or differences between compound lots. Following treatments, larvae were fixed at 5 dpf and processed for imaging by confocal microscopy. As GFP expression is widespread throughout the endoderm in the <i>neurod:EGFP</i> line, pancreata of treated fish were micro-dissected. High-resolution imaging afforded an increased sensitivity in scoring the induction of 2\u00b0 islets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Of the 20 Hit I drugs tested, 11 were validated as inducers of endocrine differentiation (55%; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To verify that the actions of paroxetine were specific to \u03b2 cells, we treated double transgenic (<i>ins:hmgb1-EGFP;</i> \u03b2/\u03b4-reporter<i>)</i> larvae with paroxetine at the optimal concentration (1 \u00b5M) from 3 to 5 dpf and quantified \u03b2 and \u03b4 cells using confocal microscopy. DMSO treated larvae had an average of 29.4 \u00b1 1.1 \u03b2 cells and 24.1 \u00b1 1.6 \u03b4 cells. As expected, RO4929097 treatment caused a significant increase in both endocrine cell types examined (35.8 \u00b1 1.3 \u03b2 cells and 29.7 \u00b1 1.5 \u03b4 cells; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013H</a>), consistent with DAPT treatment in the ARQiv assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and likely due to induced differentiation of progenitors contributing to the principal islet. Conversely, paroxetine significantly increased \u03b2-cell numbers (37.1 \u00b1 1.4, p &lt; 0.01) but had no effect on \u03b4 cells (23.0 \u00b1 1.1, p = 0.57) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013H</a>).

                                "text": "Two of the 11 drugs in the \u2018Lead I\u2019 set, thioctic acid and parthenolide, are known inhibitors of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ying et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ghantous et al., 2013</a>). This inspired us to ask whether these drugs enhance endocrine differentiation by modulating NF-\u03baB signaling. In quiescent cells, the NF-\u03baB complex is sequestered in the cytoplasm and associates with inhibitory I\u03baB proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schmitz et al., 2004</a>). Activation of NF-\u03baB signaling leads to kinase-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB, allowing NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus and regulate target-gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schmitz et al., 2004</a>). Despite having different molecular targets, thioctic acid and parthenolide both block NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ying et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ghantous et al., 2013</a>). To further validate the NF-\u03baB pathway as a target for stimulating endocrine differentiation, we used two other compounds, not present in our chemical library, but known to inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling at different steps in the pathway: NF-\u03baB inhibitor II (NF\u03baBi-II) blocks the target transcription without affecting I\u03baB degradation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shin et al., 2004</a>); and NF-\u03baB I inhibitor III (NF\u03baBi-III) inhibits cytokine-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). <i>Neurod:GFP</i> larvae were used to determine effects on 2\u00b0 islet appearance following incubation (3\u20135 dpf) with either NF\u03baBi-II (1 \u00b5M) or NF\u03baBi-III (10 \u00b5M). Initial working concentrations of these compounds were based on previous studies (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). Dosages were then decreased until concentrations that did not induce morphological defects were defined. Treated larvae showed significant increases in the 2\u00b0 islet number with both NF\u03baB inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). From this work, it is clear that targeting multiple steps in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway results in precocious 2\u00b0 islet formation, and therefore, \u03b2-cell neogenesis. Using a previously characterized NF-\u03baB reporter transgenic line, <i>Tg(6xNF\u03baB:EGFP)nc1</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kanther et al., 2011</a>), we confirmed that 2-day treatments (3\u20135 dpf) with thioctic acid, parthenolide, as well as NF-\u03baB inhibitors II and III dramatically reduced NF-\u03baB reporter activity in the pancreas and globally (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next sought to confirm that NF-\u03baB inhibition could induce endocrine differentiation. Larvae from the pan-endocrine reporter line, <i>neurod:EGFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>), showed a significant increase in 2\u00b0 islet number when treated with either inhibitor. This result clearly demonstrates that targeting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway results in precocious 2\u00b0 islet formation, thus, \u03b2-cell neogenesis through induction of endocrine differentiation."

Using a validated serotonin antibody (<a href=\"#bib60\">Uyttebroek et al., 2010</a>), we found this molecule localized to adult pancreatic islets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,G\u2032</a>). Immunolabeling was evident along a serotonergic nerve that appeared to innervate the pancreas (indicated by overlap with anti-tubulin staining, that is, \u2018yellow\u2019 regions in merged image, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) and was also consistent with possible expression within \u03b2 cells (overlap with insulin, compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,G\u2032</a>). The observed expression pattern for serotonin is consistent with immunohistochemistry data from human pancreatic tissue and mammalian model systems. To test if serotonergic signaling also enhances proliferation in the adult zebrafish, we injected mature fish (&gt;3 month old) with a 20 \u00b5l mixture of paroxetine (1 mM) and EdU (25 \u00b5M) every other day for 10 days (5 injections), followed by an injection of EdU alone on day 12.

Finally, to check if the effect of paroxetine is conserved in mammals, we performed intraperitoneal injections of paroxetine (15 mg/kg) in young mice daily from the age of postnatal day 6 (P6). EdU intraperitoneal injections (60 \u03bcg per injection) were carried out every other day from P8. Pancreata were then collected at P14 and P21 for staining of \u03b2 cells (Nxk6.1 antibody) and EdU.

We leveraged the high-throughput capacity afforded by ARQiv to reduce false-call rates using qHTS principles\u2014that is, titration-based primary screening (<a href=\"#bib24\">Inglese et al., 2006</a>). To our knowledge, this is the first time qHTS has been applied to whole-organism drug discovery utilizing a vertebrate model system. We were motivated to utilize this approach as our chemical library, the JHDL, was assembled to \u2018repurpose\u2019 existing drugs for new disease targets (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shim and Liu, 2014</a>). Thus, a primary goal was to reveal the maximal number of novel therapeutic opportunities afforded by the JHDL, an endpoint which qHTS facilitates by reducing false negatives. Our screen was specifically designed to identify compounds that elevated transgenic <i>insulin</i> reporter activity in larval zebrafish. More specifically, we wanted to find drugs that increased pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass, thus, possible new therapeutics for ameliorating \u03b2-cell paucity in diabetic patients. To create a platform capable of handling high-throughput volumes, we combined ARQiv with a customized robotic workstation (Hudson Robotics) and the COPAS-XL system (Union Biometrica), which we termed \u2018ARQiv-HTS\u2019. Using this system, automated quantification of YFP reporter activity (i.e., \u03b2-cell numbers) in more than a half-million transgenic larvae resulted in the identification of 177 hit candidates. Secondary assays on a subset of prioritized hit candidates validated the majority of lead drugs tested as being able to increase \u03b2-cell numbers by induction of endocrine differentiation and/or stimulation \u03b2-cell proliferation."

We identified several compounds in those categories as well and implicated an additional 11 mechanisms of action in affecting \u03b2-cell biology (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1, 2</a>). Importantly, their results support our interpretation of the data presented here regarding serotonergic signaling promoting \u03b2-cell replication. In our prior manual screen, we found that inhibition of RA signaling can maintain pancreatic progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rovira et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Our results, and those of Tsuji et al., have now demonstrated another role for RA (e.g., tretinoin, compound #31, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) in stimulating \u03b2-cell proliferation. Both studies also found that glucocorticoids induce \u03b2-cell proliferation (e.g., amcinonide, compound #5, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) indirectly by elevating glucose levels (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, our screen also revealed a broader range of compound categories that potentially enhance \u03b2-cell mass (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1, 2</a>). Follow-up of these candidates could suggest multiple new mechanisms for increasing \u03b2-cell numbers. Such studies will be facilitated by knowledge of implicated mechanisms of action for most of the compounds in the JHDL. As an example, we explored the role of two mechanisms of action that were potentially shared between two lead drug subsets in regulating endocrine differentiation and \u03b2-cell proliferation. A third possibility, compounds stimulating a direct increase in insulin expression without changes in \u03b2-cell number remain to be evaluated."

Among 20 Hit I compounds tested, 11 were validated as Lead I drugs that promoted endocrine differentiation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). It is possible that Lead I compounds stimulated endocrine progenitor proliferation as well, further experimentation will be required to test this. In follow-up studies, we sought to identify common molecular mechanisms of these drugs. Intriguingly, we found that two Lead I compounds, parthenolide and thioctic acid, inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ying et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ghantous et al., 2013</a>). We subsequently verified that NF-\u03baB signaling was active in pancreatic progenitors and defined a novel role for NF-\u03baB signaling in regulating pancreatic development; inhibition of the pathway enhances endocrine differentiation. In keeping with this finding, NF-\u03baB positively regulates expression of the pancreatic progenitor marker, SOX9, in human pancreatic cancer stem cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). As we and others have shown, Sox9 is an important transcription factor in the maintenance of pancreatic progenitor cells under regulation of Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kopp et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Manfroid et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shih et al., 2012</a>).

Taken together, these data suggest a model where NF-\u03baB and Notch signaling maintain transcriptional regulators essential for progenitor maintenance, including <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Hes</i>/<i>Hey</i> genes, respectively (<a href=\"#bib37\">Maniati et al., 2011</a>)."

Accordingly, quantification of \u03b2 cells within the principal islet was used to confirm 15 of 30 Hit II compounds as Lead II drugs for stimulating proliferation of \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In terms of mechanism of action, two serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paroxetine and amitriptyline (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sangdee and Franz, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dechant and Clissold, 1991</a>), were among the 15 leads promoting proliferation (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). As noted above, serotonin was also implicated in a recent manual screen for factors promoting \u03b2-cell proliferation in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tsuji et al., 2014</a>). However, unique to this study, our primary screen data suggested that paroxetine acts in a cell-type selective manner; increasing \u03b2-cell number without affecting \u03b4 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013H</a>). Paroxetine is a more SSRI (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dechant and Clissold, 1991</a>), suggesting cell-specific proliferative effects may be mediated through serotonin. This intriguing possibility was tested further by assessing the effect of serotonin and another SSRI on \u03b2-cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), confirmed by direct assessments of \u03b2-cell division using EdU labeling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013F</a>), and supported by expression of serotonin in pancreatic islets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,G\u2032</a>). These data are in keeping with preferential uptake of serotonin in human \u03b2 cells in vitro, and in the pancreas of non-human primates and rats (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eriksson et al., 2014</a>). We went on to show that paroxetine stimulated \u03b2-cell proliferation in both adult fish (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H\u2013J</a>) and neonatal mice (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Serotonin signaling also increases \u03b2-cell mass and insulin secretion in pregnant mice (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2013</a>). It has been known for over a hundred and 50 years that the pancreas is well innervated. Consistent with a role for neuronal signaling in regulating pancreatic biology, we previously found that disruption of sympathetic innervation in mice leads to abnormal islet structure and loss of functional maturation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Borden et al., 2013</a>). Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that neurotransmitters may play significant roles in pancreatic development and \u03b2-cell proliferation."

In addition, neuromodulator drugs are known to be highly promiscuous (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bianchi and Botzolakis, 2010</a>), therefore, it will be important to test whether other neurotransmitter pathways also affect islet structure and/or \u03b2-cell proliferation.

Thus, both screening strategies can surmount current \u2018biological validation\u2019 bottlenecks in drug discovery (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mathias et al., 2012</a>). HCS approaches are extremely powerful, providing multi-dimensional data that can be used to speed hit-to-lead transition times, rapidly gain mechanistic insights (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rennekamp and Peterson, 2013</a>), and identify promising new therapeutics (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zon and Peterson, 2005</a>). Unlike HCS approaches, ARQiv provides only single-dimension data, quantification of reporter levels\u2014that is, no corresponding images. However, as we have demonstrated here, ARQiv can be coupled to robotics to push the boundaries of throughput for whole-organism drug discovery. Moreover, ARQiv can detect extremely subtle phenotypic changes (e.g., as few as ten additional \u03b2 cells) using a completely non-subjective methodology (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker et al., 2012</a>). The increase in throughput afforded by ARQiv-HTS has potent practical benefits, supporting HTS \u2018best practices\u2019 such as qHTS (<a href=\"#bib24\">Inglese et al., 2006</a>). By screening the JHDL at multiple concentrations, we substantially increased the number of hits implicated, thus, increasing our chances of identifying an optimal drug target for increasing \u03b2-cell mass. The majority of the validated leads, 18 of 24 (75%), are already approved for use in humans, thus, facilitating relatively rapid clinical translation of these findings. Mechanism of action investigations revealed two important signaling pathways affecting \u03b2-cell biology: NF-\u03baB was implicated in regulating endocrine differentiation, and serotonergic signaling was shown to selectively stimulate \u03b2-cell proliferation. Studies in human pancreatic cells could establish if the function of these pathways is conserved, better define the roles of inflammatory and neurotransmitter modulation in pancreatic biology, and help to determine the degree to which these findings have clinical relevance."

The \u03b2/\u03b4-reporter transgene labels pancreatic \u03b2 cells with yellow fluorescent protein (Phi-YFP, Evrogen) and neighboring \u03b4 cells with red fluorescent protein (TagRFP, Evrogen). At the start of each screening session, customized mass fish breeding chambers were used to collect 3000 to 15,000 eggs. At 24 hr post-fertilization (24 hpf), embryos were transferred into a 0.3\u00d7 Danieu's solution containing 200 nM of 1-Phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU). PTU is a tyrosinase inhibitor, which reduces pigmentation and thereby increases signal-to-noise ratios for ARQiv assays (<a href=\"#bib27\">Karlsson et al., 2001</a>). A customized Hudson Robotics system (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was used to dispense and serially dilute individual JHDL stock solutions 1:2 across a 96-well plate (Greiner bio-one, #650209) such that final concentrations were 4 to 0.125 \u00b5M in 0.1% DMSO (drug solvent). Positive and negative control 96-well plates were prepared such that they bracketed every 10 drug plates, to account for changes in reporter activity over time (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Positive control plates consisted of six concentrations of DAPT, a Notch-signaling inhibitor that enhances precocious endocrine differentiation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parsons et al., 2009</a>), serially diluted 1:2 with final concentrations ranging from 200 \u00b5M to 6.25 \u00b5M. Titrating DAPT in every control plate served to account for lot and/or assay variability over the course of the screen. Negative controls consisted of an entire 96-well plate of drug solvent (0.1% DMSO). After drug and control plates had been prepared, a COPAS-XL unit (Union Biometrica, Holliston, MA) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was used to sort 3 dpf \u03b2/\u03b4-reporter larvae for viability and dispense them into individual wells. All plates were then incubated under standard temperature and light cycle conditions for 4 days until reporter levels were quantified at 7 dpf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). 15 min prior to scanning, 10 \u00b5l of 0.2% Eugenol (Sigma) in drug solvent was added to anesthetize larvae."

An extraction algorithm was used to determine the total fluorescent signal of each well and tagged with experimental condition information for future analysis (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker et al., 2012</a>). For wells where the signal could not be detected, the maximum regional value was used. A plate parsing algorithm (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker et al., 2012</a>) was used to separate control and drug plates into groups and blocks. Each block consisted of 14 plates including ten drug plates and the flanking sets of positive and negative control plates. The most effective DAPT concentration was parsed out as a subset of 16 per each control plate and used in the drug plate analysis algorithm. Drug plate analysis was performed on each plate in correlation to respective control data. Each drug plate consisted of six concentrations, resulting in eight conditions total for the analysis. Graphical representations of the data were plotted as described above in the text. To ensure accurate SSMD score calculation, outliers (defined as any well having a signal value greater than three standard deviations from the median of the 16 wells comprising that condition) were removed from the calculations. Empirically, we found that outlier data correlated with blank wells, multiple fish per well, floating larvae, and dead larvae. All curves in graphed data were drawn using either a best fit (solid lines) or single polynomial curve fitting function (dashed lines). The original MATLAB code was updated to an R-based code to facilitate improved graphical outputs. The R-based code for processing a series of drug and control plates configured as described above is provided as <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Source code 2</a>."

Therefore, one likely explanation for increased fluorescent signal is simply more \u03b2 cells in the pre-existing principal islet. This we showed to be the case by counting \u03b2 cells in the principal islet .Since we had shown that no differentiation is induced by serotonin, any effect on progenitor proliferation would have no effect on \u03b2-cell numbers. Instead, additional progenitors would remain as progenitors. More progenitors can only produce more \u03b2-cells if precocious differentiation was also induced. Indeed, as discussed above, since differentiation and proliferation are often coupled, compounds inducing proliferation in progenitors are likely to cause precocious secondary islet formation and be classified as Lead I compounds."

By EdU pulse-fix, on average of 9 cells are labeled (versus an average of 3 in the control). This data would be confusing if labeled cells divide only once as 9 EdU+ cells should have only lead to an increase of 4.5 cells. However, if some cells divide twice many possibilities can occur (e.g. 3 cells dividing twice gives 9 labeled cells and an increase of 6). In addition, some new \u03b2 cells could have arisen from \u03b2 cells that had already traversed S-phase. Finally, as this was a pulse-fix assay, some of the labeled cells are likely post-S but pre-M phase. Clearly, these possibilities make it difficult to simply add the number of EdU labeled cells and divide by two, let alone to use that approach to determine which types of cell are dividing."

We feel the revised manuscript will be of great interest to many researchers as it establishes methods that can be used for multiple whole-organism screening applications. Moreover, the manner of high-throughput screening described here reaches a capacity not seen before for whole-organism assays. The methods described will allow researchers to utilize existing transgenic lines to find new molecular pathways in their areas of interest. Furthermore, compared to previous high-content screens, ARQiv is more cost efficient \u2013 a vital attribute these days. Finally, there are a lot of important statistical matters that do need to be addressed and described to account for signal variability that attends in vivo screening whether in cell culture or model organisms. To do so fully in one paper is difficult. To these ends we have expanded the Methods section in the revised manuscript and put additional details in a methodological JoVE article that will be published as a companion to this work."

Clearly, this is because the progenitors use Notch-signaling to remain undifferentiated. This observation has been made by many people in different organisms and multiple different tissue systems. Notch-inhibition, therefore, would make an unlikely therapeutic agent as the effects would be widespread and detrimental. This has been discussed and published several times elsewhere by us and others. Thus, we were actually encouraged to see compounds having partial effects as compared to Notch inhibition. We were in fact trying to identify compounds that modulated other, hopefully more discrete, pathways that act parallel to, or in concordance with, Notch. We have emphasized this in the Discussion of the revised manuscript."

The updated figure more clearly demonstrates the utility of DAPT as a positive control.

Serotonin has also been implicated in insulin secretion in cells in vitro. In addition, Tsuji et al., recently performed a manual chemical screen in early fish larvae (72-96 hpf) suggesting serotonin signaling can stimulate \u03b2-cell proliferation. However, this was not the emphasis of their manuscript; only a single potential hit compound, trazodone, was validated with no further experimentation regarding the role of serotonin. In addition, whereas Tsuji et al., identified only three neuromodulators, this is the largest class of potential hits in our study, implicating twenty-plus neuromodulators. More importantly, only in our work is data presented suggesting that serotonin may act in a cell-type selective manner; increasing proliferation of \u03b2 cells, or their progenitors, without altering \u03b4 cell numbers. As such, we were motivated to thoroughly characterize this pathway and thus our study is a more comprehensive description of the effects of serotonergic signaling in the endocrine system. To further emphasize this point, in the updated manuscript we now go on to show that paroxetine significantly increases \u03b2-cell numbers in larval and adult fish, and neonatal mice. Our results therefore stand as novel and should be disseminated in a journal promoting widespread exposure. Furthermore, considering the number of people using paroxetine as a medication, it is of general importance that potential actions of this drug are highlighted."

The JHDL contains drugs approved for use in humans which facilitates repurposing for new indications following new screens. However, much is known about potential mechanisms of action for compounds in such libraries and this information can be used to test the relevance of implicated signaling pathways. Accordingly, we noted that among our validated Lead I drugs, two were known to inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling. Accordingly, we tested two other NF-\u03baB inhibitors, which are well known and as mentioned in original text inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling at different levels of the pathway. For additional clarity we now mention in greater detail the mechanism of action for these additional compounds. All 4 compounds stimulated endocrine differentiation and as mentioned in text each compound targets a separate part of the NF-\u03baB pathway. We believe this result is consistent with NF-\u03baB signaling being involved in pancreatic progenitor maintenance."
