Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of <span class=\"underline\">k</span>inase-<span class=\"underline\">d</span>ead ATM (<i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup>) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (<i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup>) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup>, but not Atm-proficientor <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for Topo-isomerase I inhibitor based therapy."

Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of <span class=\"underline\">k</span>inase-<span class=\"underline\">d</span>ead ATM (<i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup>) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (<i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup>) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup>, but not Atm-proficientor <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for Topo-isomerase I inhibitor based therapy."

Germline inactivation of ATM causes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is associated with greatly increased risk of lymphoma and leukemia\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Lavin, 2008</a>). Somatic mutations of ATM occur frequently in mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (TPLL)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Be\u00e0 et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Stilgenbauer et al., 1997</a>).

Recent sequencing studies also identified recurrent ATM mutations in 2\u20138% of breast, pancreas or gastric cancers\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib56\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cremona and Behrens, 2014</a>). While the majority of A-T patients (~90%) have <i>truncating ATM</i> mutations that result in little or no ATM protein expression\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Concannon and Gatti, 1997</a>), missense <i>ATM</i> mutations are more common in cancers and with the exception of the few that cause A-T, their biological functions are unknown."

                        "text": "As a serine/threonine protein kinase, ATM is recruited and activated by DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) through direct interactions with the MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 (MRN) complex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee and Paull, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Paull, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Stewart et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carney et al., 1998</a>). Activated ATM phosphorylates &gt;800 substrates implicated in cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis to suppress genomic instability and tumorigenesis. ATM activation is also associated with inter-molecular autophosphorylation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kozlov et al., 2011</a>). Studies in human cells suggest that auto-phosphorylation is required for ATM activation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kozlov et al., 2011</a>). However, alanine substitutions at one or several auto-phosphorylation sites do not measurably affect ATM kinase activity in transgenic mouse models (<a href=\"#bib18\">Daniel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pellegrini et al., 2006</a>), leaving the biological function of ATM auto-phosphorylation unclear. In this context, we and others generated mouse models expressing kinase dead (KD) ATM protein (Atm-KD)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Daniel et al., 2012</a>). In contrast to the normal development of <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> and <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/KD</sup> mice die during early embryonic development with severe genomic instability\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Daniel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barlow et al., 1996</a>), implying that the expression of Atm-KD in the absence of WT ATM further inhibits DNA repair beyond the loss of ATM. Among the major DNA DSB repair pathways, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is uniquely required for the repair phases of lymphocyte specific V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination (CSR). ATM promotes NHEJ (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zha et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bredemeyer et al., 2006</a>), and\u00a0<i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and A-T patients suffer from primary immunodeficiency (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jiang et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zha et al., 2011a</a>). The end-joining defects in V(D)J recombination and CSR are similar in <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> and <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> lymphocytes, suggesting that Atm-KD protein is not dominant-inhibitory for NHEJ. Meanwhile, <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells show moderate yet significant hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors in comparison to both <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>Atm</i><sup>+/+</sup> cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Daniel et al., 2012</a>), and ATM kinase inhibitor, but not loss-of-ATM, reduced homologous recombination (HR) as measured by sister chromatid exchange (SCE)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib69\">White et al., 2010</a>) and the DR-GFP HR reporter\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib52\">Rass et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kass et al., 2013</a>), suggesting a role of ATM auto-phosphorylation in replication associated homology dependent repair. Yet, it is unknown how ATM auto-phosphorylation contributes to DNA replication and HR beyond its previously identified signaling roles. Finally, consistent with the 'inter'-molecular autophosphorylation model, <i>Atm</i><sup>+/KD</sup> mice are largely normal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that <i>ATM</i><sup>KD</sup> mutation carriers could be asymptomatic and somatic loss of the WT allele in the carriers might create the Mut/Del status reported in human cancers and lymphomas."

Given the severe phenotype of <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup>, but not <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/+</sup> cells, we further analyzed the subset (~105/286) of <i>ATM</i> missense mutations in TCGA that are concurrent with heterozygous loss of <i>ATM</i> (shallow deletion) or truncating mutations in the same case, and found that, again, <i>ATM</i> missense mutations cluster around the C-terminal kinase domain even in this smaller subset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The kinase and FATC domains of ATM share 31% sequence identity with mTOR, a related phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) for which the high resolution crystal structure is available\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Homology modeling using mTOR (PDB 4JSP)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2013</a>) revealed that 64% (27/42) (at 18 unique amino acids) of ATM kinase domain missense mutations from TCGA, affect highly conserved residues and 50% (21/42) of the mutations (red on the ribbon structure) likely abolish kinase activity based on structural analyses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Specifically, residues K2717, D2720, H2872, D2870, N2875 and D2889 of human ATM are predicted to bind ATP or the essential Mg<sup>+</sup> ion (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Notably, N2875 is mutated in two TCGA cases at the time of initial analyses. One of the two cases have concurrent shallow deletion in this region (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Since then, one additional N2875 mutation was reported in a prostate cancer case (TCGA-YL-A8S9) with an allele frequency of 0.92, consistent with homozygosity. Mutations corresponding to N2875K of human ATM were previously engineered into the <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/+</sup> mice together with the corresponding D2870A mutation of human ATM. This combination was found to abolish ATM kinase activity without significantly affecting ATM protein levels\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamamoto</a> <a href=\"#bib71\">et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Canman, 1998</a>). Finally, immunoblotting confirmed the expression of catalytically inactive ATM protein in several human cancer cell lines with missense mutations around the kinase domain (CCLE, Broad Institute) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F</a>)."

Furthermore, the median survival of thymic lymphoma bearing VKD mice is ~35 days shorter than that of VN mice (104 and 139 days respectively, p=0.03) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The thymic lymphomas from the VN mice and VKD mice are both clonal, immature (TCR\u03b2/CD3<sup>low</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>) with frequent trisomy 15, have focal amplifications around the TCR\u03b1/\u03b4 loci, and have hemizygous deletion of the telomeric portion of chromosome 12, as is the case for previously characterized <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> thymic lymphomas (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jiang et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zha et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). About 8% of the VKD, but none of the VN mice, also developed clonal pro-B cell lymphomas (B220<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>-</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>). Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) showed that all VKD thymic lymphomas, but none of the VN controls, carried deep deletions at the <i>Pten</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Immunoblotting of additional lymphomas revealed severe reductions of Pten protein levels in all but one of the VKD tumors, while most VN tumors retained Pten expression. The only Pten-expressing VKD tumor (6684) appeared to have lost Atm-KD expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). <i>Pten</i> deletion was previously found in ~25% of germline <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> or <i>Tp53</i><sup>-/-</sup> thymic lymphomas and was thought to occur in the early progenitors before T cell commitment\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib74\">Zha et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dudgeon et al., 2014</a>). Based on our findings, we propose that expression of Atm-KD protein further increases genomic instability in lymphoid progenitors/HSCs, eventually led to frequent <i>Pten</i> deletion and early lymphomas in the VKD mice. Consistent with this model, frequency of chromatid breaks are significantly higher in VKD T cells, than in VN or <i>Atm</i><sup>+/+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

All the experiments were repeated \u22653 times in several independently derived and freshly deleted cells to avoid secondary alterations in genomically unstable Atm-deficient cells. While both <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> and <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs were similarly sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR), <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells were significantly more sensitive to the Topo1 inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) than <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>Atm</i><sup>+/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). The CPT hypersensitivity of <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells does not appear to reflect an inability to process blocked DNA ends or overcome replication blockage in general, as <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells were not hypersensitive to etoposide, a Topoisomerase <i>II</i> inhibitor, nor to two replication blocking agents, hydroxyurea (HU) or aphidicolin (APH), (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Finally, shRNA knockdown of mutated ATM in Granta519 human lymphomas cell lines, moderately, yet significantly, rescued the CPT hypersensitivity and CPT induced apoptosis associated with the expression of catalytically inactive ATM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>)."

                                "text": "Topo1 inhibitors prevent DNA-religation by Topo1, and trap Topo1 in a covalent DNA complex (Top1cc) at the 3\u2019-end of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) nicks generated by Topo1 cleavage\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Pommier, 2006</a>). If not removed, Top1cc interferes with transcription and replication to elicit cytotoxic effects. We found that <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup>, but not <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> or <i>Atm</i><sup>+/+</sup> MEFs accumulated Top1cc even at low CPT concentrations (0.1\u00a0\u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). ATM kinase inhibitor (ATMi, KU55933, 15\u00a0\u00b5M) also leads to CPT-dependent Top1cc-accumulation in <i>Atm</i><sup>+/-</sup> MEFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). At high CPT concentration (15\u00a0\u00b5M), the Top1cc level is greatest in <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells, followed by <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup>, then <i>Atm</i><sup>+/+</sup>(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). Meanwhile, CPT-induced degradation of full-length Topo1, necessary for its subsequent removal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Pommier, 2006</a>), is not significantly affected in <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> or <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) or 3\u2019 flapase (<i>e.g.</i> XPF) can remove Top1cc independent of DNA replication\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Pommier, 2006</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In quiescent neurons, ATM promotes transcription-dependent removal of Top1cc potentially by facilitating Topo1 degradation independent of its kinase activity or MRN\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Alagoz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Katyal et al., 2014</a>). While this function of ATM might contribute to the moderate accumulation of Top1cc in CPT treated <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs at high CPT concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), the kinase-dependent and protein-dependent role of ATM in Top1cc removal revealed in proliferating <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> MEFs appears to be independent of Topo1 degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In this context, a recent study using Xenopus extract suggests that collision of the replication forks with protein conjugated to DNA would lead to rapid and robust proteolytic degradation of the conjugated proteins, which might mask the moderate effects of ATM in Top1cc-proteolytic degradation described in none proliferative neuronal cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Duxin et al., 2014</a>). During replication, it is proposed that the collision of the DNA replication forks with Top1cc blocks the replication on the involved strand, leads to uncoupling of the leading strand and lagging strand syntheses and fork reversal. Eventually a subset of the stalled replication forks are cleaved to remove Top1cc (as diagrammed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The resulting single-ended DSBs generated from fork cleavage can only be repaired by HR, not NHEJ. Resolution of the holiday junction intermediates during HR generates crossover (CO), thus CPT is known to induce SCEs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). CPT (1\u00a0\u00b5M) induced SCEs were reduced in <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> MEFs, but not <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, and ATM inhibitor decreased CPT-induced SCEs in <i>Atm</i><sup>+/-</sup>, but not in <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggesting a defect at replication-dependent removal of Top1cc in the <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells. ATM kinase inhibitor did not suppress SCEs in Blmhelicase-deficient\u00a0(<i>Blm</i><sup>-/-</sup>) MEFs, suggesting that the lack of SCEs could not be simply explained by the bias in CO-generating holiday junction resolvases (<i>e.g.</i> MUS81, SLX1/4, GEN1) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Chan and West, 2014</a>)."

Fork reversal slows replication. In one hand, fork reversal could allow the replication machinery to bypass the lesion using the newly synthesized stand as the template. On the other hand, the four-way junctions, if they persist, could be recognized by structural specific nucleases (<i>e.g</i>. MUS81, SLX1/4) implicated in CPT induced DSBs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Regairaz et al., 2011</a>). In this regard, we reported that CPT induced RPA phosphorylation at Thr 21, a marker for ssDNA and ssDNA induced CHK1 phosphorylation by ATR are normal in <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells and ATM kinase inhibitor-treated Atm<sup>+/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Moreover, we found that ATM kinase inhibitor did not alter the frequency or size of CPT induced ssDNA, or the frequency of actual fork reversal in <i>Atm</i><sup>+/-</sup> cells measured by electron-microscopy\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib73\">Zellweger et al., 2015</a>)(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B and C</a>). Correspondingly, CPT significantly reduced fork velocity in <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> as well as control <i>Atm</i><sup>+/+</sup> or <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), consistent with fork reversal. We noted that baseline fork progression is slowest in <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), potentially reflecting defects in resolving spontaneous Top1cc or related lesions, such as Topo1-processed ribonucleotide mis-incorporation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). Together, our findings support a model, in which ATM is recruited to stalled replication fork by MRE11 (or MRN complex), where ATM kinase activity is necessary to release ATM and allow fork cleavage without affecting fork uncoupling and fork reversal. This role of ATM at the replication fork explains the increased genomic instability, especially chromatid breaks, and hypersensitivity to CPT in murine cells as well as human cancer cells that express catalytically inactive ATM protein."

While previous studies have mostly focused on the complete loss of ATM (<i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup>, truncating mutations), recent sequencing analyses identified a large number of missense ATM mutations in human cancers with limited information on their biological function. Here we report that cancer-associated ATM missense mutations are highly enriched in the kinase domain. Using murine models, we showed that expression of ATM-KD causes cancer more frequently and rapidly than loss of ATM, and the <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cancers are selectively hypersensitive to Topo1 inhibitors. As such, Topo1 inhibitors could potentially be a <i>targeted</i> therapy for tumors with ATM kinase domain mutations. Mechanistically, we found that ATM-KD physically blocks CPT-induced DSBs formation during replication in a MRN-dependent manner. Given that\u00a0both <i>Atm</i><sup>KD/-</sup> cells and ATM kinase inhibitor treated <i>Atm</i><sup>+/-</sup> cells display defects in replication-dependent Top1cc removal, our data revealed not only a neomorphic function associated with kinase domain point mutations of ATM, but\u00a0also a previously unappreciated auto-phosphorylation dependent structural function of normal ATM that is not apparent in <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells (due to the lack of both ATM protein and ATM kinase activity). This new function of ATM expands the repertoire through which ATM functions as a tumor suppressor and has implications on DNA repair and cancer therapy."

This and other findings\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib62\">Spring et al., 2002</a>) led to the speculation that ATM mutations are different in cancer compared to A-T\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Gatti et al., 1999</a>). Here we reported\u00a0that,\u00a0while <i>Atm</i><sup>+(C)/KD</sup> mice are normal\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>), somatic inactivation of the <i>Atm</i><sup>C</sup> allele in VKD mice led to aggressive lymphomas. As such, while missense ATM mutations in the kinase domain are not compatible with embryonic development when homozygous and are not found in A-T, they could predispose carriers to cancers, and maybe have more potent oncogenic potential than A-T causing truncating mutations. Notably, loss of ATM preferentially affects NHEJ\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Franco et al., 2006</a>)\u00a0and predisposes patients primarily to lymphomas. Here we show that <i>Atm</i><sup>KD</sup> also compromises HR, a pathway implicated in breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers, in which recurrent ATM missense mutations were recently identified\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib56\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cremona and Behrens, 2014</a>).

Our results also revealed that the ATM-KD protein physically blocks strand cleavage in a MRN-dependent manner, further suggesting the level of mutant ATM protein and MRN status can modify both the cancer risk and therapeutic responses. ATM kinase inhibitor seems to reduce CPT-induced DSBs more efficiently in <i>Mre11</i><sup>Nuc/-</sup> cells, than in <i>Mre</i><sup>+/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). This result suggests that Mre11 nuclease activity might contribute to the removal of ATM or the termination of ATM activation. Further investigation is likely needed to clarify this issue. We noted that loss of sae2, a modulator of Mre11 nuclease activity in yeast, causes persistent DNA damage responses mediated by <i>tel1/mec1</i>, yeast orthologs of <i>ATM</i> and <i>ATR</i>. Two recent studies have identified mre11 mutations that rescued the hyper activation of mec1 in sae2 deficient yeast. (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Puddu et al., 2015</a>). Mre11 nuclease might also contribute to fork cleavage directly. In this context, we noted that Mre11 nuclease inhibitors \u2013 either PFM01 or Mirin\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib60\">Shibata et al., 2014</a>), reduced CPT induced \u03b3-H2AX in both <i>Atm</i><sup>+/-</sup> and <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells, supporting an ATM independent function of Mre11 in fork cleavage (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). However, given the toxicity associated with Mre11 nuclease inhibitors, further experiments are warranted to understand the molecular details of MRE11 function in fork cleavage. Together, these findings support our model in which MRE11, together with the MRN complex recruits ATM to the stalled replication forks, while the kinase activity of ATM is important for fork cleavage in the presence of ATM protein.</a>"

The efficient accumulation of IR induced Rad51 foci in <i>Atm</i><sup>-/KD</sup> cells, suggests that Atm-KD does not block the loading of Rad51 to resected DSBs, an early step required for HR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, Rad51 loading or filament stability at a stalled replication fork might also be regulated differently from those at resected DSBs (from IR) and might occur independent of DSBs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schlacher, 2011</a>). In any case, our findings suggest that ATM-KD probably suppresses a later step of HR, especially holiday junction resolution, because the same structure specific nucleases (MUS81 and SLX1/4), are implicated in both holiday junction resolution and strand cleavage during Interstrand Crosslink (ICL) or Top1cc repair\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang and Walter, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rouse, 2009</a>).

Briefly, 5\u201310 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (Rosa<sup>+/ERCRE</sup> Atm<sup>+/C</sup>) cells were harvested and genomic DNA was cross-linked by three rounds of incubation in 10 \u00b5g/ml 4,5\u2032,8-trimethylpsoralen (Sigma-Aldrich) and 3\u2009min of irradiation with 366 nm UV light on a precooled metal block. Cells were lysed and cellular proteins were digested with 2 mg proteinase K (Life technologies) in 5\u2009ml digestion buffer. DNA was purified by isopropanol precipitation, restriction digested with PvuII HF for 4\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C, and replication intermediates were enriched using benzolylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) in 3\u00a0ml BioRad poly-prep chromatography columns. Samples were prepared by spreading DNA on carbon-coated grids in the presence of benzyl-dimethyl-alkylammonium chloride and formamide. Rotary platinum shadowing was performed using the Balzers BAF400 with Quartz crystal thin film monitor. Images were acquired on a JOEL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope with side-mounted camera (AMTXR41 supported by AMT software v601) and analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health)."

Once the leukemia developed (monitored by peripheral blood GFP+ cells), ~1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010^6 GFP+ leukemia cells (from one mouse to ensure clonality) were transduced to 2nd recipients (n\u00a0=\u00a04\u20136). 4 days later, the 2nd recipients were fed with oral tamoxifen (n\u00a0=\u00a03) or carrier alone (sun flower oil, n\u00a0=\u00a03) for two days. When the 2nd recipients developed leukemia, the leukemia cells were genotyped for ATM status (KD/- or KD/C) and analyzed for clonality (TCR\u03b2 rearrangements by Southern). Once the isogenic (defined by identical TCR\u03b2 rearrangements) leukemia was obtained, they were transduced to tertiary recipients (n\u00a0=\u00a05\u201310 per genotype). 3 days after the transplantation, the tertiary recipients were treated with IP injection of irinotecan (10\u00a0mg/kg) for 5 days or vehicle alone (for 5 days) and observed for leukemia development. In ~10 days after the last drug injection, the vehicle groups displayed terminal diseases and both the vehicle control and the irinotecan treated mice were euthanized and analyzed for GFP+ cells in the spleen, histology and spleen weight and size.

This suggests that the loss of ATM and expression of a kinase dead version of ATM leads to very different cellular defects. In this manuscript they explore the potential function of ATM mutations in cancer. They find that there is an increase in cancers with mutations that would be expected to lead to the generation of a kinase-dead version of ATM, suggesting that this mutation may promote cancer. They show that the expression of a kinase dead version of ATM, but not loss of ATM, prevents the removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts making these tumor cells more sensitive to Topo-isomerase inhibitors. Overall the experiments are well done and the findings shed important light on the potential unique activity of the kinase dead version of ATM. Moreover, they are relevant to the treatment of cancers with ATM mutations that effect kinase activity."

The authors attributed this observation to the lack of DSB generation <i>ATM<sup>KD</sup></i> cells, rather than impaired RAD51 loading. While this statement is valid with the support the absence (or reduced number) of gH2AX foci and neutral comet assay, the possibility of defective RAD51 loading should not be excluded. The authors stated in the response to reviewer's comment that the ssDNA at stalled replication fork would not lead to RAD51 loading. However, two independent studies have directly or indirectly shown that RAD51 is present at stalled replication forks to promote fork reversal or protect the integrity of nascent DNA strands (Zellweger R et al., JCB, 2015 and Schlacher K et al., Cell, 2011). The later study actually proposed that the stability of RAD51 filament, rather than RAD51 \"loading\", is important for protecting nascent DNA at stalled fork. Whether RAD51 loading is an issue or not does not affect the core value of this manuscript, but it would be nice if the authors could make a minor revision to include all possibilities."

And in this context, ATM kinase activity and potentially the inter-molecular auto-phosphorylation, are necessary to release ATM, which in turn allows fork cleavage. As such, our ATM-KD model likely reveals a phosphorylation dependent structural function of normal ATM protein that is not apparent in the ATM null mouse/cells (lacking both ATM protein and its kinase activity).

First, MRE11 nuclease activity might help to cleave the DNA and therefore release the stalled Atm-KD (possibly together with MRN complex) from the replication forks and in turn \u201callow\u201d CPT induced strand cleavage. In this context, lack of Sae2, a potent modulator of MRE11 nuclease activity, cause hyper activation of Tel1 (yeast orthology of ATM). Two recent papers have identified Mre11 mutants that suppresses persistent ATM (Tel1 in yeast) mediated checkpoint activation in Sae2 deficient cells (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Apr 14;112(15):E1880-7; and EMBO J. 2015 Jun 3;34(11):1509-22.)

We noted that we had already cited Zellweger R et al., JCB, 2015 in our first revision. We now further clarify that we could only exclude a \u201cgeneral\u201d defect that affecting RAD51 loading to \u201cresected DSBs\u201d in <i>Atm<sup>KD/-</sup></i>cells (subsection \u201cATM-KD blocks replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage\u201d, second paragraph), since IR induced RAD51 foci formation is <i>not</i> significantly reduced in <i>Atm<sup>KD/-</sup></i>cells. We also added discussion that explores the possibility that Rad51 loading or stability at the stalled replication fork might be regulated differently than those occurred at the resected DSBs (from IR) (Discussion, fourth paragraph)."
