Vertebrae derive from embryonic somites that are continuously produced posteriorly from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) during body formation. We show that in the chicken embryo, activation of posterior <i>Hox</i> genes (paralogs 9\u201313) in the tail-bud correlates with the slowing down of axis elongation. Our data indicate that a subset of progressively more posterior <i>Hox</i> genes, which are collinearly activated in vertebral precursors, repress Wnt activity with increasing strength. This leads to a graded repression of the <i>Brachyury/T</i> transcription factor, reducing mesoderm ingression and slowing down the elongation process. Due to the continuation of somite formation, this mechanism leads to the progressive reduction of PSM size. This ultimately brings the retinoic acid (RA)-producing segmented region in close vicinity to the tail bud, potentially accounting for the termination of segmentation and axis elongation."

Vertebrae derive from embryonic somites that are continuously produced posteriorly from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) during body formation. We show that in the chicken embryo, activation of posterior <i>Hox</i> genes (paralogs 9\u201313) in the tail-bud correlates with the slowing down of axis elongation. Our data indicate that a subset of progressively more posterior <i>Hox</i> genes, which are collinearly activated in vertebral precursors, repress Wnt activity with increasing strength. This leads to a graded repression of the <i>Brachyury/T</i> transcription factor, reducing mesoderm ingression and slowing down the elongation process. Due to the continuation of somite formation, this mechanism leads to the progressive reduction of PSM size. This ultimately brings the retinoic acid (RA)-producing segmented region in close vicinity to the tail bud, potentially accounting for the termination of segmentation and axis elongation."

The <i>Hox</i> genes achieve this by repressing the activity of a signaling pathway called Wnt so that Wnt activity in the tail-bud progressively decreases as the embryo develops."

The PM becomes segmented into epithelial structures called somites, which are sequentially produced in a rhythmic fashion from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The PSM is formed caudally during gastrulation by ingression of the PM progenitors located initially in the anterior part of the primitive streak (PS) and later, in the tail-bud (<a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00e9naz\u00e9raf and Pourqui\u00e9, 2013</a>). At the end of somitogenesis, the embryonic axis is segmented into a fixed species-specific number of somites which varies tremendously between species ranging from as little as \u223c32 in zebrafish to more than 300 in some snakes. The somites subsequently differentiate into their final vertebral and muscular derivatives to establish the various characteristic anatomical regions of the body. <i>Hox</i> genes code for a family of transcription factors involved in specification of regional identity along the body axis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mallo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Noordermeer and Duboule, 2013</a>). In mouse and chicken, the 39 <i>Hox</i> genes are organized in four clusters containing up to thirteen paralogous genes each. <i>Hox</i> genes exhibit both spatial and temporal collinearity, meaning that they are activated in a sequence reflecting their position along the chromosome and become expressed in domains whose anterior boundaries along the body axis also reflect their position in the clusters."

Downregulation of <i>Cyp26A1</i> in the tail-bud ultimately leads to rising RA levels and to differentiation and death of the PM progenitors which terminates axis elongation. Premature exposure of the tail-bud to high RA levels in chicken or mouse embryos inhibits Wnt and FGF signaling and leads to axis truncation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tenin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Iulianella et al., 1999</a>) suggesting that the tail-bud must be protected from the differentiating action of RA. In the <i>Cyp26A1</i> null mutant mice, RA-signaling reaches the tail-bud, prematurely inducing the downregulation of FGF signaling and the increase of <i>Sox2</i> expression, resulting in axis truncation posterior to the thoracic level (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abu-Abed et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sakai et al., 2001</a>). In chicken, the tail-bud starts to produce RA when explanted in culture after the 40-somite stage (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tenin et al., 2010</a>). This late RA signaling activity in the tail-bud is involved in the termination of segmentation and axis elongation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tenin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</a>). At the 40-somite stage, the mRNA for <i>Raldh2</i>, the RA-biosynthetic enzyme becomes expressed in the tail-bud potentially accounting for this late RA activity. What triggers this late expression of <i>Raldh2</i> in the chicken tail-bud is however unknown."

The shrinking of the PSM which brings the segmented region producing RA in the vicinity of the tail-bud might also contribute to the raise in RA levels in the tail-bud and possibly to the late <i>Raldh2</i> activation in the tail-bud. Thus in the chicken embryo, the timing of elongation arrest (and hence the total number of somites formed) could be in part controlled by the kinetics of PSM shrinking. PSM size depends on the velocity of somite formation which removes cells anteriorly and on the flux of cells from the primitive streak and tail-bud generated during elongation which injects cells posteriorly. How this flux of progenitors ingressing in the PSM is regulated over time, and which genes are regulating this process remain poorly understood. <i>Hoxb1-9</i> genes have been proposed to control cell ingression of paraxial mesoderm precursors from the epiblast during gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iimura and Pourqui\u00e9, 2006</a>). However, <i>Hoxb1-9</i> genes are only expressed in anterior regions of the embryo precluding their playing a role in the control of axis termination."

We show that, in the chicken embryo, activation of Abdominal B-like posterior <i>Hox</i> genes in the tail-bud correlates with the slowing down of axis elongation, while the speed of somitogenesis remains approximately constant. Our data indicate that a subset of progressively more posterior <i>Hox</i> genes, which are collinearly activated in vertebral precursors, repress Wnt and FGF activity with increasing strength, leading to a graded repression of the <i>Brachyury/T</i> transcription factor. This progressively reduces mesoderm ingression and cell motility in the PSM, thus slowing down the elongation process. Due to the continuation of somite formation at a steady pace, this mechanism leads to the progressive reduction of PSM size."

                                "text": "In order to test the role of posterior <i>Hox</i> genes on the control of cell ingression and cell motility in the developing chicken embryo, we used an in vivo electroporation technique, allowing to precisely target the paraxial mesoderm precursors in the epiblast of the anterior primitive streak (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00e9naz\u00e9raf et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We developed a strategy allowing to overexpress two different sets of constructs in largely different populations of paraxial mesoderm cells by performing two consecutive electroporations of the paraxial mesoderm (PM) precursors of the epiblast of stage 4\u20135 HH embryos. Embryos are first electroporated on the left side of the primitive streak with a control Cherry construct, and then on the right side of the streak with a second vector expressing the yellow fluorescent protein Venus and a <i>Hox</i> construct (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This strategy results in essentially different PM cells expressing the two sets of constructs with the Cherry expressing cells enriched on the left side whereas Hox expressing cells are mostly found on the right side. When no <i>Hox</i> construct is present in the Venus vector, the Cherry and Venus-expressing populations of cells were observed to extend from the tail-bud to the same antero-posterior level of the paraxial mesoderm indicating that they began ingressing at the same time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, n = 8 embryos). In contrast, cells expressing Cherry were always extending more anteriorly than cells expressing Venus and one of the following posterior <i>Hox</i> gene: <i>Hoxa9, Hoxc9, Hoxd10, Hoxd11, Hoxc11, Hoxa13, Hoxb13,</i> or <i>Hoxc13</i>, indicating that these <i>Hox</i> genes can delay cell ingression of the PSM progenitors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a> n &gt; 6 for each condition and not shown). This simply reflects the fact that cells ingressing later become located more posteriorly. Strikingly, the effect on ingression was progressively stronger when overexpressing more 5\u2032 genes suggesting a collinear trend (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Inverting the order in which the constructs are electroporated did not affect the final phenotype. The distance between the anterior boundaries of the two domains was found to progressively increase with more posterior <i>Hox</i> genes as shown by measuring the ratio between Venus and Cherry posterior domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Over-expression of <i>Hoxa10, Hoxc10, Hoxa11, Hoxc12, Hoxd12 and Hoxd13</i> showed no difference with the control Cherry vector (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>, n &gt; 6 for each condition and data not shown). Using consecutive electroporation of <i>Hoxd10</i> and <i>Hoxc11</i> constructs labeled with Cherry and Venus, respectively, we observed that <i>Hoxc11</i> has a stronger effect on ingression than <i>Hoxd10</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, n = 12 embryos). A similar result was observed when <i>Hoxa13</i> was compared to <i>Hoxc11</i> in the same assay (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, n = 6 embryos). Thus, a subset of posterior <i>Hox</i> genes is able to delay PSM cell ingression in a collinear manner."

No ectopic expression of laminin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B\u2013C\u2033</a>), acetylated tubulin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D\u2013E\u2033</a>), or E-cadherin (data not shown) was observed after <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expression. We compared the number of Venus-positive cells in epiblast vs primitive streak and mesoderm in embryo sections. The majority of <i>Hoxa13</i>-expressing cells were still found in the epiblast while control cells have ingressed into the primitive streak and mesoderm indicating that <i>Hoxa13</i> delays ingression by retaining cells in the epiblast (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013H</a>, n = 4 embryos for each condition). No up-regulation of the neural marker <i>Sox2</i> was observed in the tail-bud of embryos electroporated with <i>Hoxa13</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013J</a>, n = 8 embryos for each condition) and very few cells were observed in the neural tube of embryos electroporated with Hox constructs (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013J</a>, Figure 6A\u2013B, Figure 7D\u2013J and Figure 9A and Videos 4\u20138). This indicates that the effect on ingression is not caused by the recruitment of PM precursor cells to a neural fate. Ingression of cells from the epiblast to the primitive streak occurs via an epithelium to mesenchyme transition which involves first destabilization and then complete loss of basal microtubules in these cells. This process has been shown to be regulated by a basally localized activity of the small GTPase RhoA (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nakaya et al., 2008</a>). In order to test if the effect of the posterior <i>Hox</i> genes on delaying PSM progenitors ingression could involve regulation of microtubule stability, we used a dominant negative form of <i>RhoA</i> (DN-RhoA) as a tool to destabilize basal microtubules in the epiblast (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nakaya et al., 2008</a>). We performed consecutive electroporations at stage 5 HH to overexpress a control Cherry vector in one population of PSM progenitors and <i>Hoxa13</i> with <i>DN-RhoA</i> vectors in another population and allowed the embryos to develop for 20 hr. We observed that the two populations of cells reach the same anterior level (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>, n = 5/5 embryos) indicating that these cells ingressed at the same time<i>.</i> Altogether<i>,</i> these results suggest that <i>Hox</i> genes control PSM progenitors ingression through the regulation of basal microtubule stability in the epiblast."

We previously showed that posterior prevalence applies for the control of cell ingression by <i>Hoxb1-9</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iimura and Pourqui\u00e9, 2006</a>). To test whether this property also applies to the posterior <i>Hox</i> genes with an effect on axis elongation, we performed consecutive electroporations first with a mix of <i>Hoxd10</i> and <i>Hoxc11</i> constructs (leading to expression in the same cells, in green <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and then with a mix of <i>Hoxc11</i> and a control construct (a mutated <i>Hoxc11</i> unable to bind DNA (<i>Hoxc11mutH</i>), in red <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We observed that cells over-expressing the two functional <i>Hox</i> genes reach the same anterior position as cells over-expressing <i>Hoxc11</i> and control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>, n = 10 embryos). Thus <i>Hoxc11</i> function is dominant over <i>Hoxd10.</i> Similarly, we observed dominance of <i>Hoxa13</i> over <i>Hoxc11</i> in the same assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, n = 8 embryos). Therefore, posterior prevalence appears to generally apply for <i>Hox</i> control of cell ingression in the mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iimura and Pourqui\u00e9, 2006</a>). As a result, the effect of <i>Hox</i> genes on cell retention in the epiblast should become progressively stronger as more posterior genes become activated."

TALE (Three Amino-acid Loop Extension) family members have been shown to differentially interact with anterior and posterior <i>Hox</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Moens and Selleri, 2006</a>). In chicken, the only TALE gene expressed in PM precursors is <i>Pbx1</i> which is detected in the primitive streak from stage 4 to 7 HH (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, n = 8 embryos for each condition [<a href=\"#bib12\">Coy and Borycki, 2010</a>]). Electroporation of a siRNA targeting <i>Pbx1</i> in the epiblast resulted in strong down-regulation of <i>Pbx1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013C</a>, n = 4 embryos for each condition). In consecutive electroporations performed first with Cherry and a control siRNA and then with Venus and a siRNA targeting <i>Pbx1</i>, cells electroporated with the <i>Pbx1</i> siRNA were found extending more anteriorly than control cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,K</a>, n = 19 embryos). The effect of <i>Pbx1</i> siRNA on ingression could be rescued by co-expressing <i>Pbx1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,K</a>, n = 16 embryos). We compared in consecutive electroporations the effect of expressing first a control siRNA with either <i>Hoxb7, Hoxb9</i>, <i>Hoxa9, Hoxc9, Hoxd10, Hoxd11, Hoxc11, Hoxa13, Hoxb13</i> or <i>Hoxc13</i>, and then the <i>Pbx1</i> siRNA with the same <i>Hox</i> gene. Cells co-expressing <i>Hoxb7</i> or <i>Hoxb9</i> and the <i>Pbx1</i> siRNA reached more anterior levels than cells co-expressing these <i>Hox</i> genes and the control siRNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F\u2013G, K</a>, n = 10 and 15 embryos respectively). In contrast, cells co-expressing either a control or the <i>Pbx1</i> siRNA together with a posterior <i>Hox</i> gene were found to extend up to the same anterior level (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H\u2013K</a> and not shown, n &gt; 8 embryos for each condition). Over-expression of <i>Pbx1</i> in PM precursors after the 3-somite stage slowed down axis elongation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7L</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, n = 12 embryos), suggesting that <i>Pbx1</i> can restore the effect of anterior <i>Hox</i> genes on ingression during this time window. Thus, <i>Hox</i>-dependent control of ingression in the paraxial mesoderm requires <i>Pbx1</i> for anterior but not for posterior <i>Hox</i> genes."

                                "text": "To identify effector targets regulated by posterior <i>Hox</i> genes, we electroporated epiblast PM progenitors in stage 5 HH embryos, either with a control <i>H2B-Venus</i> or with a <i>Hoxa13</i>-IRES-<i>H2B-Venus</i> vector, and we harvested embryos at 9 somites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Venus-positive cells were sorted by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) following tail dissociation and their transcriptome was analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, n = 2 \u00d7 2 arrays for each condition). The Wnt/\u03b2catenin pathway targets, <i>Axin2, Fgf8,</i> and <i>Sp8</i> were down-regulated in <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expressing cells (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) suggesting that posterior <i>Hox</i> genes might control axis elongation rate by progressively down-regulating the Wnt/\u03b2catenin pathway. To test this hypothesis, we first performed in situ hybridizations (ISH) for <i>Axin2, Fgf8,</i> and <i>T</i>/<i>Brachyury</i> that show that their expression in the tail-bud is down-regulated when <i>Hoxa13</i> becomes activated (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>, n = 8 embryos for each condition). Since the ISH technique is not quantitative enough to resolve slight differences, we performed quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on micro-dissected tail-buds from 10, 15, 20, and 25-somite stages for <i>Axin2, Fgf8,</i> and <i>T</i>/<i>Brachyury.</i> These experiments show a slight progressive down-regulation of these genes from the 10 to 20-somite stage followed by a significant decrease in gene expression at the 25-somite stage correlating with the slowing down of axis elongation as well as with the timing of posterior genes expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013E</a>, n = 5 embryos for each stage). Co-electroporation of <i>Hoxd10, Hoxc11,</i> or <i>Hoxa13</i> with <i>\u03b2catLEF</i> (which activates the Wnt/\u03b2catenin pathway [<a href=\"#bib21\">Galceran et al., 2001</a>]) rescues axis elongation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6\u20138</a>, n = 41). We co-electroporated a Wnt/\u03b2catenin firefly luciferase reporter (BATLuc) and a CMV-Renilla luciferase construct in PM progenitors together with either Venus or <i>Hoxa9</i>, <i>Hoxc9</i>, <i>Hoxd10</i>, <i>Hoxd11</i>, <i>Hoxc11, Hoxa13, Hoxb13,</i> or <i>Hoxc13</i>. These <i>Hox</i> genes induced a down-regulation of luciferase activity which increased in a collinear fashion (except for <i>Hoxd10</i> and <i>Hoxd11</i> which showed a weaker effect) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, n = 83 embryos). All together, these results strongly suggest that the posterior <i>Hox</i> genes control axis elongation by modulating Wnt/\u03b2catenin signaling activity. When co-expressing <i>Hoxa9</i> and <i>Hoxa13</i>, the Wnt-repressive effect was equivalent to that of <i>Hoxa13</i>, indicating that posterior prevalence also applies to Wnt repression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a>, n = 30 embryos). By expressing various amounts of <i>Hoxa13</i>, we observed that Wnt repression is independent of the quantity of protein expressed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a>, n = 62 embryos), suggesting that Hox proteins levels are saturating in our experiments. Therefore, the same posterior <i>Hox</i> genes can regulate ingression, axis elongation, and Wnt signaling with strikingly similar collinear trends."

                                "text": "We next analyzed how <i>Hox</i> genes interfere with Wnt function. <i>Hoxa13</i> ingression phenotype is rescued by an activated form of <i>Lrp6</i> or a stabilized form of <i>Ctbbn1</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>, n = 42 embryos) but not by <i>Wnt3</i>a or <i>Wnt5a</i> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>, n = 30 embryos). This suggests that, genetically, <i>Hox</i> genes act on Wnt signaling at the membrane level. Over-expression of the Wnt receptor <i>Fzd2</i> (down-regulated in <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)) with <i>Hoxa13</i> rescued Wnt repression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>, n = 29 embryos). <i>Fzd2</i> is expressed in the tail-bud at 15 somites and down-regulated after 25 somites (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, n = 8 embryos). Over-expression of the Wnt pathway component <i>Dact2</i> (which is expressed in the tail-bud from 25 somites onward and up-regulated in <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expressing cells [<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>, n = 8 embryos, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>]), repressed Wnt activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8M</a>, n = 9 embryos). In <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expressing cells, the FGF receptor <i>FGFR1</i>, its ligand <i>Fgf8</i>, and its targets <i>Etv1</i> and <i>Cyp26A1</i> as well as the FGF pathway component <i>Rasgrp3,</i> were down-regulated while the FGF/MAPK inhibitor, <i>Spred2</i>, was up-regulated (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), indicating that <i>Hoxa13</i> can also inhibit FGF signaling. This inhibition is consistent with the down-regulation of PSM cell motility observed after <i>Hoxc11</i> or <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expression (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, n = 20 embryos) (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00e9naz\u00e9raf et al., 2010</a>). FGF down-regulation is expected since FGF and Wnt signaling reciprocally regulate each other in PM precursors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aulehla et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Naiche et al., 2011</a>). Down-regulation of <i>Cyp26A1,</i> which degrades RA, can up-regulate RA signaling leading to repression of the Wnt pathway non cell-autonomously (<a href=\"#bib35\">Iulianella et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Young et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Martin and Kimelman, 2010</a>). Together, these data suggest that posterior <i>Hox</i> genes act on a gene network converging toward autonomous and non-autonomous negative Wnt regulation."

Q-PCR analysis of micro-dissected tail buds shows that T expression levels decrease between 10 and 20-somite stage and then significantly drop at the 25-somite stage (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Over-expressing <i>T</i> by electroporation often resulted in PM-expressing cells extending more anteriorly than control cells suggesting that they ingress earlier (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013B</a>, n = 6 embryos). Over-expression of <i>T</i> together with either <i>Hoxa9</i>, <i>Hoxd10</i>, <i>Hoxc11</i> or <i>Hoxa13</i> rescued the ingression delay (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013B</a>, n = 6, 11, 10 and 7 embryos respectively). <i>T</i> also rescued the elongation slow down observed after <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expression (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, n = 4 embryos). A lower dose of <i>T</i> (0.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) only led to partial rescue of the <i>Hoxa13</i> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, n = 4 embryos). Endogenous <i>T</i> expression is down-regulated in <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expressing cells FACS-sorted from electroporated embryos (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>, n = 2 FACS sorted cell samples for each condition). Over-expression of a reporter generated by fusing one kilobase of the chicken <i>T</i> promoter to the firefly luciferase (cTprLuc) together with <i>Hoxc11</i> or <i>Hoxa13</i> and the CMV-Renilla luciferase show <i>T</i> repression which is stronger for <i>Hoxa13</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>, n = 19 embryos). Over-expression of <i>\u03b2catLEF</i> leads to <i>T</i> up-regulation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>, n = 20 embryos) and co-expression of <i>Hoxa13</i> with <i>\u03b2catLEF</i> totally rescues <i>T</i> repression (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>, n = 20 embryos) suggesting that <i>Hox</i> genes down-regulate <i>T</i> expression by repressing the Wnt/\u03b2catenin pathway. Over-expressing T had no effect on BATluc activation (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, n = 8 embryos). This argues that the effect of <i>Hox</i> genes on epiblast ingression involves quantitative regulation of <i>T</i> expression levels."

A similar truncation in the chicken homolog (<i>Hoxa13dn</i>) acts as a dominant-negative inhibiting the function of all <i>Hox13</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Santa Barbara and Roberts, 2002</a>). When over-expressed before activation of <i>Hox13</i> paralogs, <i>Hoxa13dn</i> had no effect on BATluc activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>, n = 18 embryos). However, co-expression with <i>Hoxa13</i> in similar conditions abolished Wnt repression (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>, n = 18 embryos). Similar truncations in chicken <i>Hoxd10</i> (<i>Hoxd10dn</i>) and <i>Hoxc11</i> ( <i>Hoxc11dn</i>) also exert a dominant-negative effect on their wild-type counterparts (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H\u2013I</a>, n = 38 embryos). We over-expressed <i>Hoxa13dn</i> alone or combined with either <i>Hoxc11dn</i> or with <i>Hoxc11dn</i> and <i>Hoxd10dn</i> along with BATLuc and CMV-Renilla constructs in PM precursors of the streak at stage 8 HH. Embryos were harvested at the 28-somite stage when most <i>Hox10-13</i> paralogs are expressed. Increasing the number of dominant-negative constructs results in a corresponding increase in luciferase activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9J</a>, n = 35 embryos). We next co-expressed the three dominant-negative vectors <i>Hoxd10dn, Hoxc11dn,</i> and <i>Hoxa13dn</i> together, along with Venus and FACS-sorted dissociated Venus-positive cells from tail-buds of 28-somite embryos. qRT-PCR analysis of <i>T</i>, <i>Axin2,</i> and <i>Fzd2</i> in the Venus-positive cells shows up-regulation of the three genes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K-L</a>, n = 4 embryos for each condition). All together these results argue that a subset of posterior <i>Hox</i> genes gradually represses Wnt/\u03b2catenin signaling and consequently <i>T/Brachyury</i> in paraxial mesoderm precursors of the epiblast. This progressive repression leads to reduced cell ingression and cell motility in the PSM, resulting in a slowing down of axis elongation."

We next tested if the nature of the homeodomain could have a role in refining the level of repression of T by designing chimeras where the homeodomain of Hoxc11 and Hoxa13 was replaced by the homeodomain of Hoxa5 (Hoxc11Ha5 and Hoxa13Ha5, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>).

Around stage 4 HH, somite precursors begin to ingress from the superficial epiblast of the anterior primitive streak and posterior Node region (<a href=\"#bib55\">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Iimura et al., 2007</a>). Two types of PM precursors have been identified in chicken and mouse embryos (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wilson et al., 2009</a>). A first set derives from the Node/primitive streak border and exhibits long-term self-renewal properties (<a href=\"#bib59\">Selleck and Stern, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cambray and Wilson, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2007</a>).

During these stages, PM precursors are continuously produced first by the primitive streak and then by the tail-bud. Fate mapping of the 25-somite stage tail-bud with quail-chick chimeras and diI labeling showed that the formation of the PM follows morphogenetic movements very similar to that seen earlier at the primitive streak level during gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Catala et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Knezevic et al., 1998</a>).

There is also some lineage continuity at the level of the PM precursors of the Node/primitive streak border which were shown to become internalized to become part of the chordo-neural hinge in the tail-bud. DiI labeling of the late chordo-neural hinge in stage 20\u201322 HH (40\u201345 somites) embryos showed that mesoderm cells are produced by this structure at late stages (<a href=\"#bib52\">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</a>). The cellular organization of the chordo-neural hinge has not been characterized and whether mesoderm production by this structure occurs through ingression movements involving an epithelium to mesenchyme transition as is seen for the production of paraxial mesoderm from the primitive streak is not established.

The resulting imbalance between the velocity of somitogenesis and of axis elongation could account for the progressive shortening of the PSM observed during the production of the next 25\u201328 somites. Alternatively, it could be that, as suggested by Ohta et al. and by Olivera-Martinez et al., ingression continues up to the 40\u201345 somite stage.

By reducing the flux of cells to the PSM and their motility, posterior <i>Hox</i> genes can indirectly control its progressive shortening. Furthermore, the inhibition of FGF and Wnt signaling which are required for the segmentation clock oscillations provides an explanation for the arrest of somite formation before the complete exhaustion of the PSM described in avians (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bellairs, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tenin et al., 2010</a>). In vivo, the downregulation of the FGF target <i>Cyp26A1</i> downstream of Hox13 genes (this report, <a href=\"#bib77\">Young et al., 2009</a>) would leave the tail-bud more vulnerable to the increase of RA. Whether, the raise in RA levels caused by bringing the segmented region closer is also responsible for <i>raldh2</i> activation in the late tail-bud remains to be explored.

This is highly reminiscent of our observations showing different quantitative effects of the overexpression of the same three Hox13 genes in chicken embryos.

This argues for a conserved role of posterior Hox proteins in the repression of the Wnt and FGF pathway between chicken and mouse embryos. In mouse embryos however, no strong <i>raldh2</i> expression or late RA production is detected in the tail bud (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tenin et al., 2010</a>) and axis elongation continues for a longer time resulting in tail formation. Moreover, <i>raldh2</i> \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryos which lack RA production during posterior body formation can form normal tails, suggesting that RA is not involved in axis termination in mouse (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cunningham et al., 2011</a>).

Thus, in mouse embryos, termination of axis elongation could simply result from exhaustion of PM progenitors caused by the slowing of axis elongation triggered by posterior <i>Hox</i> genes acting on cell ingression and motility. Remarkably, among amniotes, many species such as lizards, rodents, or monkeys bear a long tail whereas others such as birds or humans do not. Closely related species such as monkeys and apes can differ by the presence of a tail suggesting that the genetic switch involved in the control of tail formation is quite simple. Whether this switch involves an RA-dependent elongation arrest mechanism as seen in chicken and whether this control depends on posterior <i>Hox</i> genes is an attractive possibility which remains to be investigated."

Together, this suggests that the information driving the quantitative effects of Hox proteins on Wnt repression, cell ingression, and elongation is built in the structure of the proteins themselves rather than reflecting the actual amounts of Hox proteins present.

At the cellular level, it argues that the Hox-dependent regulation of <i>T</i> levels in the epiblast is critical to control the balance between cell ingression and maintenance of a self-renewing paraxial mesoderm progenitor pool in the epiblast/tail-bud. Cell ingression requires an EMT that involves destabilization of the basal microtubules of epiblast cells followed by basal membrane breakdown (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nakaya et al., 2008</a>). Inhibiting Rhoa activity can rescue the ingression delay caused by <i>Hoxa13</i> overexpression, suggesting that posterior <i>Hox</i> genes can control cell flux to the PM by acting on basal microtubule stabilization in epiblast cells.

However, <i>Hoxa13</i> overexpression does not lead to up-regulation of the neural marker <i>Sox2</i> in electroporated cells as detected by in situ hybridization and in our microarray analysis. Furthermore, electroporated cells are seen to enter the PM and do not enter the neural tube (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and supplementary videos). This therefore suggests that posterior <i>Hox</i> genes are unlikely to control cell ingression by promoting acquisition of a neural fate in epiblast cells.

Embryos were first prepared for EC culture at room temperature which pause their development. The first construct mixed with the control vector pCX-MyrCherry (gift from X Morin) was microinjected on one side of the PS groove and the first electroporation was carried out as described above right after injection. Only 10 s after the first electroporation, the second construct, containing the gene to over-express (<i>Hox</i>, <i>T\u2026</i>) cloned in the pCAGGS-I2-MyrVenus, was then microinjected at the same level on the other side of the PS groove and immediately electroporated. This procedure targets the entire paraxial mesoderm territory of the epiblast of the anterior primitive streak on the electroporated side. Thus, in these experiments, we only track the timing of ingression of the most anterior epiblast cells which give rise to the most anteriorly localized progeny in the paraxial mesoderm. By biasing the position of the electrode on the right or on the left side of the primitive streak, we can ensure that the electroporation is biased on one side allowing easier observation of the anterior boundaries of the over-expressing cells. In most cases, however, some electroporated cells are seen on both sides despite this bias. The control Cherry vector is usually found to be more bilateral than the <i>Hox</i> expressing Venus-positive cells as can be seen from the pictures, which reflects an effect specific to <i>Hox</i> genes. Inverting the order of the electroporated plasmids in consecutive electroporation has no effect on the outcome of the experiment, and similar results are observed when the entire somitic territory of the epiblast of the anterior streak is electroporated. Following consecutive electroporation, embryos were cultured in a humidified incubator at 38\u00b0C to resume their development. 3 hr after electroporation, the embryos were screened based on fluorescence to ensure that both constructs were expressed and that the correct region was targeted for each construct. At this stage, up to 70% of the embryos are successfully electroporated. The embryos were then reincubated at 38\u00b0C until they reach the 15-somite stage (\u223c20 hr). As can be seen on the embryos shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> or in the videos, virtually no cells are seen outside of the paraxial mesoderm meaning that the electroporation accurately targeted the anterior streak epiblast. Since expression of the constructs is driven by the ubiquitous CAGGS promoter, even a slight inaccuracy in positioning the electrode would result in expression in the neural tube or the lateral plate."

Following fragmentation, cRNAs were hybridized for 16 hr at 45\u00b0C on GeneChip Chicken Genome arrays. Each microarray (one microarray per condition = two control microarrays and 2 <i>Hoxa13</i> microarrays) was then washed and stained on a GeneChip fluidics station 450 and scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Finally, raw data (.CEL Intensity files) were extracted from the scanned images using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) version 3.1. CEL files were further processed with MAS5 and RMA algorithms using the Bioconductor package (version 2.8) available through R (version 2.12.1). Probe sets were filtered based on their expression intensity value (MAS5 value). Probe sets with an intensity value under 100 were discarded. Probe sets were ranked based on fold change between the intensity value of the control condition and the <i>Hoxa13</i> over-expression condition.

They test the interesting hypothesis that some posterior <i>Hox</i> genes repress Wnt and FGF signaling and so decrease expression of mesodermal gene T, which then leads to reduced ingression of cells through the primitive streak. This eventually leads to termination of the body elongation process by lack of available mesoderm. In this view, 'posterior <i>Hox</i> genes' regulate the extension of the body plan by indirectly controlling the amount of available mesoderm cells in the tail end of the embryo (via the regulation of cell ingression from the epiblast)."

Vertebral formula is very stable within the same species and thus must rely upon a robust mechanism. How the robustness of this process relates to the quantities of factors is a key issue (are these factors saturating?) At the time of the start of decreasing Wnt signaling due to increasing Hox amounts, a rather smooth gradient of T must be established. At these time points, genetic conditions in mice would be expected to have an effect perhaps stronger than what was reported by Capecchi for the <i>Hoxb13</i> mutants? And if several <i>Hox</i> genes contribute to this phenomenon, then how to prevent intra-species variations, in particular at the time-points when the system would no longer be saturated?"

However, the Hox constructs are driven by the ubiquitous Caggs promoter. Why is expression of the Hox constructs not observed at the same time as that of the control construct? A simple explanation might be that the RNA derived from these constructs is post-transcriptionally controlled, either by immediate degradation or by translational repression. This might assure position-adequate activity of the <i>Hox</i> genes. RNA in situ hybridization experiments testing for the time and position of transcription of the constructs are missing. However, they are required at least for some of the constructs. In addition, co-transfection of the control reporter construct with the Hox expression constructs should reveal if indeed ingression is delayed by Hox over-expression.

Of course this would mean measuring expression levels per mesoderm cell (e.g. FPKM or qPCR values determined on FAC sorted cells) at different embryonic stages but at the same axial position (e.g. close to the node), not just overall expression in the embryo.

Previous work has shown that FGF signaling is upstream of E-cadherin downregulation, prompts EMT and formation of T expressing mesoderm at the mouse primitive streak (Ciruna and Rossant, 2001, Dev. Cell), while more recent work has demonstrated that high Wnt signaling promotes mesoderm differentiation from neuro-mesodermal (<i>Sox2/T</i> co-expressing) progenitors and that reduced Wnt signaling in this context leads to neural differentiation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tsakiridis et al, 2014</a>, Dev; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gouti et al, 2014</a>, PLOS Biology).

It seems likely that the mechanism identified by the authors is most functionally significant at this mid-way stage; from then on the PSM is added to from an \u201cinternalized\u201d set of precursor cells. McGrew et al, 2009, and <a href=\"#bib52\">Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</a> identify these cell populations by lineage analysis in the chick tail bud as the NMps (Sox/bra expressing cells) and also a transit amplifying cell population of mesodermal progenitors. I think the authors should explain this in the Discussion (and in the Introduction). As the paper currently reads it might be thought that ingression through the primitive streak continues until the end of axis elongation, when in fact in both chick and mouse embryos this ceases at somite 30 of \u223c50-53 (chick, HH16) and 33 of 65 (mouse, E10.5). The cessation of ingression thus fits more closely with the establishment of the tailbud about half way through body axis elongation. As <i>Hoxb</i> and <i>d13</i> begin to be expressed just after tailbud formation, they may contribute to conclusion of the ingression process, but this early role also leaves room for other actions for such <i>Hox</i> genes, including the regulation of cell proliferation in the tailbud mesoderm, described by <a href=\"#bib19\">Economides et al, 2003</a>. I think these considerations are important to clarify that the regulation of ingression that they uncover is distinct from the model they originally proposed in which this was directly linked to \u201cexhaustion\u201d of PSM precursors and elongation arrest."

However, this simply shows that de-stabilizing microtubules can force ingression and there is no molecular link made here from Brachyury to regulation of RhoA activity.

Regarding mRNA stability, we overexpress only the coding sequences (without UTRs) and use the same SV40 polyA signal for all of our constructs. Also in most cases, <i>Hox</i> genes are expressed from an IRES-YFP vector and thus Hox expression can be indirectly monitored by examining YFP fluorescence. All <i>Hox</i> genes are expressed from the CAGGS promoter which is a strong promoter and which is expected to generate expression levels higher than the endogenous ones. Moreover, we clearly show in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F-H</a> that the quantity of Hox protein overexpressed does not affect the phenotype observed. So our conditions are saturating, abolishing any effect of gene dosage of the overexpressed <i>Hox</i> genes and leaving the differences only due to the nature of the <i>Hox</i> genes overexpressed. These observations are consistent with the analysis of paralog knock-out experiments from Deneen Wellik (Wellik et al, Science, 2003; McIntyre et al; Development, 2007)) showing that leaving only one single wild type allele leads to a much milder phenotype than the deletion of an entire paralog group. These experiments also confirm previous results published in Iimura and Pourquie (Nature, 2006) showing that <i>Hoxb</i> genes expression driven by promoters of different strength (CMV, TK and CAGGS) leads to similar ingression phenotypes. Our data suggest that the quantitative effects on ingression result from the progressive expression of more posterior genes. The fact that 8 of the 16 posterior <i>Hox</i> genes from all posterior paralogs groups except <i>Hox12</i> show an effect in the ingression, elongation and Wnt signaling assays argue for an extreme redundancy of the system that could explain the intraspecific robustness of the vertebral formula.

This phenotype is much stronger than that reported for <i>Hoxb13</i> in which only the tail part of the axis is affected. In the experiments performed by Deschamps and Mallo where they overexpress <i>Hox13</i> paralog genes in the paraxial mesoderm along the entire AP axis, these genetic conditions result in axis truncations, occurring posterior to the thoracic level (Young et al, Dev Cell, 2009). Strikingly no effect in the anterior regions is seen in these transgenic animals. The phenotype of these animals resembles hypomorphic <i>Wnt3A</i> or <i>T</i> mutants suggesting that the Wnt repression by posterior <i>Hox</i> genes is not an on-off mechanism but rather a quantitative effect. This notion is further supported by the different truncation levels reported for <i>Hoxa13</i>, <i>Hoxb13,</i> and <i>Hoxc13</i> expressed from the same promoter in mouse (Young et al, Dev Cell, 2009). These experiments are consistent with the notion that Wnt and T play an important role in the control of axis elongation from the cervical to the caudal level and that posterior <i>Hox</i> genes quantitatively modulate Wnt activation in the paraxial mesoderm precursors of these regions.

However, whether this can be generalized will require further studies. The Duboule lab has generated transgenic mice with a human HoxD cluster or an extra mouse HoxD cluster (Spitz et al, Genes and Dev, 2001). Since the effect of Hox proteins is saturating, duplicating an existing cluster is expected to act on expression levels (rather than timing) of the Hox proteins and thus is not expected to interfere with axis elongation. Accordingly, they did not observe any change in the vertebral counts in these transgenic animals. They also have performed many duplications and deletions within the HoxD cluster and shown that these manipulations can lead to heterochronic expression of <i>HoxD</i> genes in the tail bud. However, they do not report any significant variations in vertebral numbers in these cases either (Tarchini et al, Dev Cell, 2006; Tschopp et al, PLOS Genet, 2009, Denis Duboule, personal communication). Importantly, all these genetic manipulations have been performed on the HoxD cluster and in our hands, neither <i>Hoxd12</i> nor <i>Hoxd13</i> have an effect on elongation/Wnt, and the effect of <i>Hoxd10</i> and <i>Hoxd11</i> is weaker than that of other <i>Hox</i> genes thus providing a possible explanation for the lack of significant effect of this heterochronic expression of posterior <i>HoxD</i> genes. In contrast, heterochronic expression of other posterior <i>Hox</i> genes such as <i>Hoxa13</i>, <i>Hoxb13</i> or <i>Hoxc13</i> (but not <i>Hoxd13</i>) genes in the tail bud precursors as described in Young et al (Dev Cell, 2010; and Jacqueline Deschamps, personal communication) was shown to make the body shorter consistent with our hypothesis.

The two constructs (Hox-green and control-red) are electroporated one after the other (see detailed description for consecutive electroporations below) and then we routinely examine electroporated embryos 3 hours after electroporation to make sure that both control and Hox constructs are expressed at the same time in the precursors of the paraxial mesoderm in the anterior streak region. Then whereas control cells expressing Cherry start to ingress in the posterior PSM, cells expressing the Hox-IRES-GFP constructs remain in the epiblast of the anterior streak region ingressing only later.

This experimental paradigm was originally introduced in , see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K-O</a>, using grafts of epiblast expressing different <i>Hox</i> genes. These experiments results in a gap separating the position of the anterior boundary of red control cells from the position of the anterior boundary of green Hox-expressing cells reflecting the fact that cells ingressing later become located more posteriorly. This gap is proportional to the ingression delay experienced by Hox-expressing cells. To quantitatively estimate the variation in the ingression delay, we measure the ratio between the red and the green domains in the paraxial mesoderm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-C</a>).

This increase in RA level is accompanied by Raldh2 reexpression in the tail bud and it triggers differentiation and death of the paraxial mesoderm precursors. Remarkably, no such increase in RA levels is observed in mouse embryos. Furthermore, a normal tail can form even in the absence of RA in the <i>raldh2</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cunningham et al, 2011</a>). Therefore, it could be that in mouse, termination of the axis and hence tail formation, does not result from an active RA-dependent process but simply from exhaustion of paraxial mesoderm due to the shrinking of the PSM resulting from posterior <i>Hox</i> genes effect on elongation. Whether this RA-dependent mode of axis termination can be more broadly generalized to species lacking a tail remains to be explored. What causes this difference is currently unknown but it could be that in chicken, specific genetic alterations of posterior <i>Hox</i> genes can trigger the late expression of radlh2 in the tail bud thus leading to premature termination of axis elongation.

Only embryos successfully electroporated in the PSM progenitors at the exact same antero-posterior level and the same medio-lateral level relative to the midline of the primitive streak are reincubated for about 20 more hours. About 10 to 20% of the embryos fail to develop because of the 2 consecutive injections/electroporations. The embryos that develop successfully are then examined for GFP expression and routinely more than 90% show restricted YFP expression in the paraxial mesoderm. Such a high level of success rate is obtained only after a long period of training.

Since expression of the constructs is driven by the ubiquitous CAGGS promoter, even a slight inaccuracy in positioning the electrode would result in expression in the neural tube or the lateral plate.

As stated above, we do not see cells overexpressing posterior <i>Hox</i> genes activating <i>Sox2</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I-J</a>) nor entering massively the neural tube (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, and <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> or supplementary videos) arguing against a conversion of epiblast cells to a neural fate by posterior <i>Hox</i> genes. Ingression of cells during gastrulation requires disruption of a RhoA-dependent mechanism required for stabilization of basal microtubules in epiblast cells (Nakaya Y et al, NCB, 2008). This ultimately leads to loss of cell basement membrane interaction and breakdown of the basement membrane allowing cell ingression. We now include experiments showing that co-overexpression of a Dominant-negative-RhoA construct rescues the ingression phenotype caused by <i>Hoxa13</i> overexpression (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>). This suggests that posterior <i>Hox</i> genes control the timing of ingression by stabilizing the connection between microtubules and the ECM rather than diverting epiblast cells to a neural fate. We now discuss these arguments in more detail in the revised text."

This might however be the case in mouse and we have amended our text accordingly. We have proposed that axis termination is caused by exposure of the tail bud to retinoic acid produced by the somitic region, which is made possible due to the shrinking of the PSM (Gomez et al, Nature, 2008). RA has been shown to down-regulate FGF signaling and to induce differentiation and death of the tail bud precursors leading to the arrest of elongation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tenin et al, 2010</a>, BMC Biol; Olivera Martinez et al, 2011, PLOS Biol). In line with this hypothesis, we found that Cyp26A1 which is involved in RA degradation is downregulated by <i>Hoxa13</i>, which was also observed by Deschamps\u2019s group in mouse (Young et al, Dev Cell, 2009). Whether the raise in retinoids levels observed in the chicken embryo is caused by the shrinking of the PSM, which brings the RA-producing somitic region next to the tail bud or by another mechanism remains to be investigated. We now provide a more detailed description of these arguments in the new version of the manuscript."

Furthermore as shown on the movies, we clearly see ingression of Hox expressing cells in the PSM."

This therefore suggests that posterior <i>Hox</i> genes are unlikely to control cell ingression by promoting acquisition of a neural fate in epiblast cells. While we cannot completely rule out that a subpopulation of these cells remains in the tail-bud as <i>Sox2</i>-positive cells, it is unlikely that this contributes to the dramatic axis elongation slow-down observed after posterior <i>Hox</i> genes overexpression.\u201d"
