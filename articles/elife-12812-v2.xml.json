Activations are compared to those produced by applying vibrotactile stimulation to the unit\u2019s receptive field, and unit-type perceptual reports are analyzed. We show that INMS and vibrotactile stimulation engage overlapping areas within the topographically appropriate digit representation in the primary somatosensory cortex. Additional brain regions in bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, insula and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in contralateral prefrontal cortex are also shown to be activated in response to INMS. The combination of INMS and 7T fMRI opens up an unprecedented opportunity to bridge the gap between first-order mechanoreceptive afferent input codes and their spatial, dynamic and perceptual representations in human cortex."

Activations are compared to those produced by applying vibrotactile stimulation to the unit\u2019s receptive field, and unit-type perceptual reports are analyzed. We show that INMS and vibrotactile stimulation engage overlapping areas within the topographically appropriate digit representation in the primary somatosensory cortex. Additional brain regions in bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, insula and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in contralateral prefrontal cortex are also shown to be activated in response to INMS. The combination of INMS and 7T fMRI opens up an unprecedented opportunity to bridge the gap between first-order mechanoreceptive afferent input codes and their spatial, dynamic and perceptual representations in human cortex."

Penfield and Boldrey (<a href=\"#bib31\">Penfield &amp; Boldrey 1937</a>) derived the first maps of the somatotopic human body representation in S1 using electrical stimulation of the cortical surface. Somatosensory research in humans has involved using psychophysical (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klatzky et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gescheider et al., 2002</a>), microneurographic (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vallbo &amp; Johansson 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Johansson &amp; Vallbo 1983</a>), and neuroimaging (<a href=\"#bib26\">McGlone et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Martuzzi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Servos et al., 2001</a>) techniques to study different stages and levels of detail in somatosensory function.

In this manner, mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the glabrous skin of the hand can be categorized into one of four types: fast-adapting type 1 (FA1), fast-adapting type 2 (FA2), slowly-adapting type 1 (SA1), and slowly-adapting type 2 (SA2) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</a>). In intraneural microstimulation (INMS), single mechanoreceptive afferents are selectively activated by passing a small (1\u20137 \u03bcA) current through the recording microelectrode, thus evoking a quantal sensation in the projected sensory field, which matches the physiological qualities of the recorded mechanoreceptive afferent (<a href=\"#bib39\">Torebj\u00f6rk et al., 1987</a>). Microstimulation of an FA1 afferent evokes a well-defined, local sensation of \u2018flutter\u2019 or \u2018buzzing\u2019, while microstimulation of an SA1 afferent evokes a sensation of continuous pressure or inward pulling (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vallbo et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ochoa and Torebj\u00f6rk, 1983</a>). Microstimulation of an FA2 afferent evokes a diffuse sensation of vibration over a larger area, whereas microstimulation of an SA2 afferent does not produce a consistent, conscious sensory experience (<a href=\"#bib43\">Vallbo et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ochoa and Torebj\u00f6rk, 1983</a>)."

The single previous study combining INMS with fMRI (<a href=\"#bib40\">Trulsson et al., 2001</a>), using a 3\u2009T scanner and a surface coil positioned over the parietal lobe contralateral to the site of stimulation, showed that INMS of FA1 and SA1 afferents induced activity in S1 and S2, which overlapped with regions activated by applying mechanical vibration to the relevant units\u2019 receptive fields. However, a detailed characterization of the specificity of single unit INMS activations within the representation of the digits in S1 has yet to be performed."

Ultra-high field (7T) fMRI has also recently been used in conjunction with vibrotactile stimulation to map individual digit representations and resolve the fine, within-digit organization (base-to-tip), thus revealing functional subdivisions of areas in S1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012</a>). Compared to lower field measurements, 7T fMRI provides greatly increased sensitivity and blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal contrast, coupled with improved intrinsic spatial specificity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gati et al., 1997</a>). Here, we used 7T fMRI to resolve whole-brain cortical activation patterns evoked by INMS of single mechanoreceptive afferent units in the glabrous skin of the hand, and to assess the precise spatial localization of INMS-evoked BOLD responses in contralateral S1, in comparison to activation due to mechanical vibrotactile stimulation."

Occasionally, participants reported that the sensation evoked by the INMS stopped, likely due to a minor dislodgement of the microelectrode. This occurred for U7 where a projected sensation was perceived prior to scanning, but no sensation was felt during the fMRI run. For some units, the sensation was weak (U2, U3; possibly due to difficulty in attending to the stimulus sensation when inside the scanner), or lost during the fMRI run (U5, U6, U8). We compared the location of fMRI responses of all perceived INMS units in contralateral S1 with the digit representation obtained from both vibrotactile stimulation of the microstimulated unit\u2019s receptive field and the fMRI somatotopy maps formed from the traveling-wave (phase-encoding) vibrotactile paradigm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We found that fMRI responses to INMS of single units (all except for U1; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were spatially localized within the relevant S1 digit representation identified from vibrotactile stimulation. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> shows example maps of digit somatotopy defined from the vibrotactile traveling-wave paradigm for Participant 4 in the right and left hemispheres (left and right of the figure, respectively). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> shows the BOLD response to INMS of U11 (right) and U9 (left) for Participant 4. These responses are well-localized within regions of the somatotopic map for digit 4 of the left hand and digit 1 of the right hand, respectively. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> shows the activation generated in S1 by applying vibrotactile stimulation to the receptive field of U11 (right) and U9 (left). Fits to the hemodynamic responses evoked in S1 by INMS and the application of vibrotactile stimulation to the unit\u2019s receptive field can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>."

This was achieved through the combined usage of two techniques: intra-neural microstimulation (INMS), to stimulate single mechanoreceptive afferents, and 7T fMRI, to map the cortex with superior spatial resolution. This work also shows that activity generated by stimulation of a single mechanoreceptive afferent can be perceptually characterized and produces a network of cortical responses."

The greater signal-to-noise ratio and improved BOLD contrast afforded by 7T fMRI allowed us to improve the spatial resolution, with a reduction in the voxel volume by a factor of 6 compared to previous work at 3T (<a href=\"#bib40\">Trulsson et al., 2001</a>). We have exploited the improved spatial resolution to provide a detailed characterization of the location and extent of the cortical network involved in encoding inputs from single mechanoreceptive afferents, as well as in comparing these responses to somatotopical maps created from vibrotactile skin stimulation."

The extent of the S1 responses to INMS was less than that elicited by vibrotactile stimulation to the unit\u2019s receptive field, although the response produced by single unit INMS was relatively extensive, considering that vibrotactile stimulation simultaneously engages a large number of afferents (<a href=\"#bib17\">Johansson and Vallbo, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</a>)."

To explore this finding further, we used the delineation of digit 2 from the somatotopic map obtained with the vibrotactile traveling-wave paradigm to inspect the time series of S1 responses evoked by INMS for U1 (located on the palm below digit 2). We also interrogated the BOLD response produced in contralateral S1 when vibrotactile stimulation was applied to the receptive fields of U1. In S1, we found negative BOLD responses (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) for both INMS and vibrotactile stimulation applied to the receptive field of the INMS. The negative BOLD response in this subject is possibly due to a steal effect from the nearby vasculature draining from the active cortex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bianciardi et al., 2011</a>) since draining venous regions are highly modulated by block paradigms with periods of 'on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 stimulation, as used to study the response to INMS and vibrotactile stimulation of the receptive field. In contrast, using the traveling-wave paradigm a complete map of the digits in S1 is seen. This is expected, as we have previously shown that a traveling-wave design is insensitive to the non-specific BOLD contributions from large veins that drain blood from across the whole hand representation in S1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">U\u011furbil et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Besle et al., 2013</a>), thus suppressing the venous signal modulations found in the block INMS/vibrotactile stimulation data. In order to estimate the spatial spread of INMS BOLD responses to neighboring digits, we show that, at the group level, the z-score, proportion of active voxels and GLM parameter estimates are significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) in the stimulated ROI than in the neighboring digits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These results are in-line with our previous findings reported for vibrotactile stimulation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Besle et\u00a0al.,2013</a>)."

Although M1 has previously been shown to be activated by tactile input (e.g. <a href=\"#bib11\">Francis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ackerley et al., 2012</a>), we cannot exclude the possibility that the M1 activation observed in this study may originate from spatial blurring of somatosensory activation (given that M1 and S1 are located on opposite banks of the central sulcus). When comparing responses to INMS and vibrotactile stimulation applied to the afferents\u2019 receptive fields, INMS activated a number of additional areas, specifically the AIC, PPC and PFC. Exploration of the INMS BOLD time series for these areas (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) suggests that the activity in these areas is locked to the S1/S2 activity and is not due to anticipation. Both insula and parietal cortices have been shown to contribute to the perception of touch (<a href=\"#bib32\">Preusser et al., 2014</a>), and a previous study of tactile attention (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burton et al., 2008</a>) has shown that a fronto-parietal network, which includes PFC and PPC, is involved in attention. Although identical paradigm timings were used for INMS and vibrotactile stimulation in order to compare the spatial localization of the BOLD response, there were differences in the attentional focus between the INMS and vibrotactile tasks. During the INMS fMRI runs, participants were aware that perception might be lost and hence had to concentrate on the stimulus and report any lack of sensation at the end of the run. In contrast, the vibrotactile stimulus was delivered at a suprathreshold level and participants did not have to monitor that the sensation was still present during the vibrotactile fMRI run. Hence, the increased activity in AIC, PFC and PPC observed in the present study may reflect the increased attentional effects (i.e., baseline or gain effects on evoked responses) during the INMS protocol compared to vibrotactile stimulation. However, this is a preliminary finding and requires further investigation with larger sample sizes and more quantitative analysis to be corroborated."

Although the notion that peripheral input from the skin is represented directly by four cytoarchitectonic areas (BA 3a, 3b, 1 and 2) in S1, each containing an orderly somatotopic map of the body surface has been supported by findings from animal studies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaas et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Paul et al., 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Favorov et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tommerdahl et al., 2010</a>) and 7T fMRI in humans (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Martuzzi et al., 2014</a>), a simple point-to-point topographical correspondence between skin surface and cortical representation does not hold. In reality, there is integration and processing through axonal synapsing in the dorsal column nuclei and thalamus prior to mechanoreceptive information entering the cerebral cortex. There appears to be a preserved transmission from single, mechanoreceptive second-order neurons in the dorsal column (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vickery et al., 1994</a>). At the level of the thalamus, an axon of a single ventral posterolateral nucleus terminates over a fairly wide, roughly 0.5\u2009mm, cortical territory (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rausell and Jones, 1995</a>), where many individual thalamocortical axons spread out in discrete patches over several millimeters of S1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Landry et al., 1987</a>). This spread corresponds well with our finding that the cortical activation from a single mechanoreceptive afferent extends over an area that is not dissimilar to the area activated by input from many afferents through point-vibrotactile stimulation. Also, neurons in S1 cortical columns have extensive lateral excitatory connections, not only with neighboring neurons, but also with neurons several millimeters away in the same cortical area (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burton and Fabri, 1995</a>). We have shown that single unit INMS produces bilateral somatosensory activation, as well as influencing motor areas and cognitive networks (e.g. PPC, PFC). Such a wide spreading of stimulus-evoked activity has been clearly documented in microelectrode recording studies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reed et al., 2010</a>). Overall, the spatiotemporal pattern of S1 response to vibrotactile stimulation is far from simple and its functional significance remains to be unraveled."

This demonstration of the feasibility of combining INMS with 7T fMRI opens up the possibility of a range of further neuroimaging studies that will allow interrogation of the precise anatomical and physiological properties of the fundamental encoding of touch. These include systematic investigation of the sub-cortical (e.g. thalamic) responses and laminar-specific cortical responses to INMS of different mechanoreceptive afferent classes using a variety of electrical stimulation patterns."

Trains of 30\u2009Hz pulses (200 \u00b5s, positive, square-wave pulses over 0.5\u2009s) were delivered (via Stimulus Isolator; ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia and controlled using the LabChart 7 software). The experimenter delivered 2\u20133 pulse sequences, while the current was increased slowly from 0 \u00b5A, in 1 \u00b5A steps, until the participant felt a sensation. Once a clear sensation was felt, the precise location of the sensation and its quality were recorded and tested to confirm whether the previously mapped receptive field spatially aligned with that perceived by the participant during INMS. This was done by a process of questioning the participant to determine whether mechanical touch to the receptive field matched the projected sensory field sensation during INMS to within ~1\u2009mm. If so, it was deemed that microstimulation was being applied to the afferent from which recordings had been made. If the participant felt a clear small, point-sensation in the projected sensory field that did not align with the mapped receptive field, the stimulated unit was nevertheless explored. These units were included if the perceived sensation (e.g. pressure from an SA1) was similar in quality to those in matched physiology-INMS trials (e.g. perceived size, shape, sensation) (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The stimulating current intensity which generated a sensation was recorded, along with the stimulation currents delivered during each fMRI run. INMS of a stable, single mechanoreceptive afferent could be carried out successfully for up to ~45 min, although Step 3 was completed successfully for only a subset of mechanoreceptive afferents (see Results)."

The somatotopic map was used to define ROIs specific to each of the 5 digits of the hand, these were subsequently used as independent ROIs to allow group-level inference tests to be conducted (as performed in <a href=\"#bib4\">Besle, 2013</a>). Here, data were not spatially smoothed in order to retain high spatial resolution. Both the INMS data, and data acquired during vibrotactile stimulation applied to the skin location where each afferent was perceived, were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) employing a canonical HRF model and its orthogonalized temporal derivative. FDR adjustment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benjamini and Hochberg\ufeff 1995</a>) was performed using an adaptive step-up method (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benjamini et al., 2006</a>). All adjusted P-values were converted to quantiles of standard normal distribution (Z-score). Analysis was restricted to voxels identified using the traveling-wave localizer (dilated by 5 voxels to ensure complete coverage of the S1 hand area) to reduce the number of inference tests on both the INMS and vibrotactile stimulation data to compute FDR corrected Z-scores. We investigated the spread of INMS induced activations, and vibrotactile stimulation to each unit\u2019s receptive field, by computing the mean Z-score, proportion of active voxels, and GLM parameter estimates in each digit ROI. Subsequently, to quantify spread of responses into neighboring digits at the group-level, INMS and vibrotactile responses for the ROI corresponding to the stimulated digit were combined, by averaging the mean Z-score, proportion of active voxels, and GLM parameter estimates (N=7 units; 3 Digit 1 ROIs, 2 Digit 3 ROIs, 2 Digit 4 ROIs). This procedure was then repeated for the 1<sup>st</sup> degree (N\u00a0=\u00a011), 2<sup>nd</sup> degree (N\u00a0=\u00a09), 3<sup>rd</sup> degree (N\u00a0=\u00a05) and 4<sup>th</sup> degree (N\u00a0=\u00a03) neighboring digit ROIs. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests was then performed on this data, and post-hoc multiple pairwise comparison, adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction."

The combination of 7-T field imaging, INMS and tactile stimulation provides a very impressive methodological advance, by demonstrating the feasibility of microneurography and fMRI and validating the approach against conventional tactile stimulation. The report establishes a nice correspondence between responses to microstimulation in S1, S2 and equivalent afferent input produced by somatosensory (vibrotactile) simulation. The nice thing about this correspondence is that the afferent input is carefully characterized using microneurography prior to scanning. The microneurography and MRI physics in this study are superb."

The extension to 7-T scanning and the recruitment of a broader range of brain areas are interesting, but in consideration of potential confounds that could drive these areas, the arguments need some tempering."

How consistent was the correspondence between the digit map finger-selectivity and the INMS activity across units? For example, did all units show topographically appropriate activity in SI? How much did the activity \"leak\" to other finger representations? Statistical quantification can improve the validity of the major findings. Given that the authors are arguing that the somatosensory representation of the two stimuli (INMS and vibrotactile) was similar, a direct comparison between the two modalities, and a contrast between two different locations within each modality seems more suitable to support this point. That said, as the stimulation used to construct the digit maps was on the fingertips, and the receptive fields (RFs) of the units were often more medial, I'm not sure the observed overlap is sensible. This warrants further consideration."

For example, if subjects reported the perceptual intensity changed during the fMRI scanning, it would have been better to perform a parametric analysis; testing for the effects of perception on induced responses. In other words, instead of simply showing that the activations in a particular subject reduced when they ceased to feel the microstimulation, you could have tested the hypothesis that perception was a key determinant of BOLD responses by using it as a parametric regressor. Similarly, when comparing the microstimulation with vibrotactile responses, instead of simply saying they are similar (or showing areas of conjunction) you could have modeled both in a single model. This would have allowed you to report the differences between microstimulation and somatosensory stimulation explicitly \u2013 by looking at the interaction between two experimental factors (on versus off and microstimulation versus vibrotactile stimulation). If you feel comfortable with the analyses above, it would be simple to say; for example, \"the differences between microstimulation and vibrotactile stimulation were tested formally in a general linear model of both time series (testing for interaction) and confirmed the recruitment of extra areas during microstimulation\"."

Given the activation of motor cortical areas, the response to INMS may depend on other factors (e.g., action and adaptive prediction, attention, arousal) by which the system may modulate the perceived response. The experiments and the data described here are not sufficient to address these points. Although one could continue this study further adding experiments where the subject has to respond by a movement or vice versa, (initiate a movement in order to trigger the INMS), the journal discourages requests for new experiments that are not essential to the paper. Therefore, the reviewers suggest leaving these findings for future experiments. You could briefly mention the finding and clearly state that these are preliminary results, suggesting that the method can be used in future experiments for quantitative studies."

How consistent was the correspondence between the digit map finger-selectivity and the INMS activity across units? For example, did all units show topographically appropriate activity in SI? How much did the activity \"leak\" to other finger representations? Statistical quantification can improve the validity of the major findings. Given that the authors are arguing that the somatosensory representation of the two stimuli (INMS and vibrotactile) was similar, a direct comparison between the two modalities, and a contrast between two different locations within each modality seems more suitable to support this point. That said, as the stimulation used to construct the digit maps was on the fingertips, and the receptive fields (RFs) of the units were often more medial, I'm not sure the observed overlap is sensible. This warrants further consideration.</i>"

We have previously shown the spatial overlap of the representations of individual digits in S1 using vibrotactile stimulation (Besle et al., \u2018Single-subject fMRI mapping at 7 T of the representation of fingertips in S1: a comparison of event-related and phase-encoding designs\u2019, J Neurophys, 2013; Besle et al., \u2018Event-Related fMRI at 7T Reveals Overlapping Cortical Representations for Adjacent Fingertips in S1 of Individual Subjects\u2019, HBM, 2013).

In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3(C</a>) and (D) we now plot quantitative results of the average FDR-corrected z-score and the proportion of active voxels in each digit ROI.

This is because S1 is divided into 4 Brodmann areas (3a/3b/1/2), with the tip of the finger being overrepresented in comparison to the base. It is thus appropriate to use ROIs derived from fingertip stimulation in a traveling-wave paradigm in order to assess the spatial localisation of more medial INMS units."

For example, if subjects reported the perceptual intensity changed during the fMRI scanning, it would have been better to perform a parametric analysis; testing for the effects of perception on induced responses. In other words, instead of simply showing that the activations in a particular subject reduced when they ceased to feel the microstimulation, you could have tested the hypothesis that perception was a key determinant of BOLD responses by using it as a parametric regressor. Similarly, when comparing the microstimulation with vibrotactile responses, instead of simply saying they are similar (or showing areas of conjunction) you could have modeled both in a single model. This would have allowed you to report the differences between microstimulation and somatosensory stimulation explicitly \u2013 by looking at the interaction between two experimental factors (on versus off and microstimulation versus vibrotactile stimulation). If you feel comfortable with the analyses above, it would be simple to say; for example, \"the differences between microstimulation and vibrotactile stimulation were tested formally in a general linear model of both time series (testing for interaction) and confirmed the recruitment of extra areas during microstimulation\".</i>"

This is most likely to be because the loss of perception was not gradual, but rather perception was completely lost within a single cycle.

The experiments and the data described here are not sufficient to address these points.
