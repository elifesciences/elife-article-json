However, the functional role of Cdc42 in synaptic plasticity and in behaviors such as learning and memory are not well understood. Here we report that postnatal forebrain deletion of Cdc42 leads to deficits in synaptic plasticity and in remote memory recall using conditional knockout of Cdc42. We found that deletion of Cdc42 impaired LTP in the Schaffer collateral synapses and postsynaptic structural plasticity of dendritic spines in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Additionally, loss of Cdc42 did not affect memory acquisition, but instead significantly impaired remote memory recall. Together these results indicate that the postnatal functions of Cdc42 may be crucial for the synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, which contribute to the capacity for remote memory recall."

However, the functional role of Cdc42 in synaptic plasticity and in behaviors such as learning and memory are not well understood. Here we report that postnatal forebrain deletion of Cdc42 leads to deficits in synaptic plasticity and in remote memory recall using conditional knockout of Cdc42. We found that deletion of Cdc42 impaired LTP in the Schaffer collateral synapses and postsynaptic structural plasticity of dendritic spines in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Additionally, loss of Cdc42 did not affect memory acquisition, but instead significantly impaired remote memory recall. Together these results indicate that the postnatal functions of Cdc42 may be crucial for the synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, which contribute to the capacity for remote memory recall."

The dendrites are protrusions coming out of the cell body that receive inputs from other cells; the axon is a cable-like structure that enables neurons to contact other cells. In excitatory neurons in part of the brain called the hippocampus, the dendrites are themselves covered in structures called spines, so most synapses are formed between an axon terminus (belonging to the presynaptic cell) and a dendritic spine (on the postsynaptic cell). The hippocampus is necessary for the formation of long-term memories."

Changes in the strength of synapses are thought to underlie learning and memory, and long-lasting changes in synaptic strength involve increases or decreases in the number and size of dendritic spines. Such changes are possible because spines have an internal skeleton that can be assembled and disassembled in a matter of minutes. This \u2018remodeling\u2019 process is regulated by a family of enzymes called small GTPases. One of these, known as Cdc42, has been shown to promote the formation and maintenance of spines in cell culture, but its role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory remains unknown."

This is surprising, given the presumed role of long-term synaptic plasticity in learning and memory, and indicates that Cdc42 is required for \u2018remote memory\u2019, the form of memory lasting for many days. Similar results were obtained with another memory test using a water maze, where the animals have to remember the location of a hidden platform. Normal mice remember the location for more than 30 days. In contrast, the knockout mice could only remember the location for a few days."

This synaptic morphoring is driven by fibrous actin (F-actin), which creates the underlying cytoskeletal scaffold for neuronal structures (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dillon and Goda, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Koleske, 2013</a>). Particularly, the dynamic actin turnover in dendritic spines, the postsynaptic portion of the excitatory synapse, produces morphological and functional changes in synapses (<a href=\"#bib24\">Matus, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Star et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2013</a>), that are thought to be a fundamental basis of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kim and Lisman, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Krucker et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Fukazawa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Okamoto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Within the spine, small GTPases of the Rho family, such as Cdc42, Rac, and RhoA exert distinct roles for actin remodeling by regulating actin organization by regulating many downstream factors including WAVE, WASP, Arp2/3 and cofilin (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hall, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Soderling et al., 2007</a>). In vitro studies have shown that both Cdc42 and Rac promote the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines, whereas RhoA may negatively regulate spinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nakayama et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Scott et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahnert-Hilger et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Newey et al., 2005</a>). These GTPases are regulated by more than 60 activators (guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GEFs) and inactivators (GTPase activating proteins or GAPs) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Saneyoshi et al., 2010</a>). Previous studies using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM) have demonstrated continuous activation of Cdc42 for more than 30 min within single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity. This activation is restricted to the stimulated spine heads and shows a steep signal gradient of active Cdc42 at the spine necks (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murakoshi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yasuda and Murakoshi, 2011</a>), suggesting that Cdc42 may be intimately involved in long-term maintenance of structural spine plasticity during the sustained phase of spine enlargement."

To analyze the expression pattern of Cre recombinase in the <i>Camk2-Cre</i> mouse at the adult stage (p60), the <i>Camk2a-Cre</i> mouse was crossed with the <i>Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato</i> reporter mouse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

Previously we showed that Cdc42 is required for structural and functional plasticity of dendritic spines using shRNA targeted to Cdc42 in rat hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murakoshi et al., 2011</a>). To further test the roles of Cdc42 in spine plasticity, we transfected neurons of <i>Cdc42</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> mice with EGFP-Cre or EGFP (control) together with mCherry as a volume marker using ballistic gene transfer, and measured spine volume change induced by glutamate uncaging in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). In control neurons, stimulated spines showed sustained volume change lasted more than 30 min (60 \u00b1 19% at 20\u201330 min) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). However, in neurons expressing EGFP-Cre, the volume change was significantly impaired (8 \u00b1 5%, p&lt;0.05). In another set of experiments, we expressed mEGFP-Cdc42 together with mCherry and EGFP-Cre. We found that structural plasticity in these neurons was similar to those paired neurons in which EGFP and mEGFP were expressed instead of EGFP-Cre and mEGFP-Cdc42 (64 \u00b1 20% vs 63 \u00b1 23%) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Thus, the impaired structural plasticity in neurons expressing EGFP-Cre was caused by removal of Cdc42 and exogenous Cdc42 can rescue the effect. From these experiments, we concluded that Cdc42 is necessary for spine structural plasticity, consistent with our previous report (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murakoshi et al., 2011</a>)."

Based on our findings that Cdc42 deletion leads to defects in structural/synaptic plasticity and spine loss in hippocampus, we also suspected that the behavioral outcomes of <i>Cdc42</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup><i>: Camk2a-Cre</i> mice may be abnormal in certain aspects of hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks. To test this hypothesis we conducted a variety of behavioral analyses of episodic memory. Contextual memory capability was tested by a fear conditioning paradigm in which mice learn to predict aversive events (mild electric shock) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Following an aversive stimulus in a conditioning chamber, control <i>Cdc42</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> and cKO <i>Cdc42</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup><i>: Camk2a-Cre</i> mice showed similar freezing rates when placed in the conditioning chamber for the first 4 days (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

These data suggested the Cdc42 cKO mice have pronounced deficits in remote memory recall. Moreover, the normal anxiety level in the cKO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013H</a>) support the fear conditioning data in that freezing rate (an indicator of memory) was not affected by a difference of innate anxiety levels between each genotype."

Because our previous study demonstrated an intensive activation of Cdc42 specifically within the spine head following single spine glutamate uncaging stimuli (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murakoshi et al., 2011</a>), we expected that Cdc42 cKO neurons may show specific defects in activity-dependent spine enlargement. In line with this hypothesis, glutamate uncaging-induced spine plasticity was markedly disrupted in both the transient and sustained phase of spine enlargement upon postnatal deletion of Cdc42. Electrophysiological LTP with <i>Cdc42</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup><i>: Camk2a-Cre</i> mice also confirmed a plasticity deficit upon Cdc42 deletion, indicating that Cdc42 activation is pivotal for both activity-dependent morphogenesis of spines and in the functional synaptic plasticity.

However, in contrary to this hypothesis, the spine loss in cKO neurons was very mild: only 8% reduction in spine density was found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, there was no detectable change in spine density in medial prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex of the cKO mice. This stands in contrast to our prior findings in <i>ArpC3</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup><i>: Camk2a-Cre</i> mice, which exhibit a loss of approximately 50% of spines in both the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Comparing these results suggest that although <i>Camk2a-Cre</i> drives the loss of floxed alleles in both regions, Cdc42 signaling is specifically involved in rapid time-scale spine morphing/maintaining processes during the neuronal activation but, unlike Arp2/3, it is not strongly involved in the long-term maintenance of spine morphology in mature neurons. This observation suggests functional characteristics of Cdc42 strongly dependent on the developmental status of neuron. During the early developmental stages, Cdc42 is reported to be essential for the morphogenesis and polarity establishment of neurons that leads to a permanent change of cell shapes and locations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mueller, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Luo, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wong et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aoki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schwamborn and Puschel, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Garvalov et al., 2007</a>). However, during the postnatal period, Cdc42 activity may be functionally restricted to manage activity-dependent changes of actin dynamics that governs aspects of synaptic plasticity rather than gross maintenance of spines."

Remote memory as determined by both the fear conditioning and water maze tests, however, was significantly diminished in the Cdc42 cKO mice. How does the loss of Cdc42 lead to the deficit in the process of remote memory? Two explanations are possible to account for the remote memory defect of the cKO mice: a memory storage defect, or a remote memory retention and retrieval problem. Normal performances in learning and intact working memory of the cKO mice suggest that memory formation and storage processing appears not to be altered by Cdc42 deletion, although it should be noted we did observe a slight delay in long-term memory formation that was specific to the water maze reversal test.

This finding is opposite to the behavioral phenotype observed in <i>Cdc42</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup><i>: Camk2a-Cre</i> mice.

Both pathways are implicated in synaptic plasticity and are thought to be critical for processes important for learning and memory. Thus it has remained unclear as to whether Rac or Cdc42 can be distinguished from each other at the level of behavioral phenotypes in intact animals. It is of interest, therefore, to compare the results reported here with the analogous <i>Rac1</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup><i>: CamKll\u03b1-Cre</i> mice previously characterized (<a href=\"#bib10\">Haditsch et al., 2009</a>). Loss of Rac1 results in impaired hippocampal LTP similar to our findings in the Cdc42 cKO mice. Surprisingly, however, the behavioral impairments are quite different. Loss of Rac1 results in impaired working memory, but has no effect on long-term or remote memory. This is in stark contrast to the Cdc42 cKO mice which display normal working memory, but are impaired in remote memory. Together, these findings reveal that although the biochemical pathways that modulate actin remodeling evoked by synaptic activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 may overlap, their functions during learning and memory are clearly distinguishable from the other, with little overlap. Further work will be required to define how the physiologic relevance of Rac1 and Cdc42 are functionally segregated during these processes despite their similar biochemical pathways."

Following a 2 min acclimation in the conditioning chamber, mice received a 0.4 mA scrambled foot shock for 2 s. Each mouse remained in the chamber for an additional 30 s before being placed into its home cage. Fear memory testing was conducted daily for 4 days by placing the mice in the conditioning chamber for 5 min in the absence of foot shock.

Freezing rate was analyzed by trained observers who were blind to the genotypes of mice using Noldus Observer (Noldus Information Technology; Wageningen, Netherlands) software.

Using field recordings, they further show that these structural deficits are accompanied by functional deficits \u2013 a complete loss of LTP in Schaffer collateral pathway. Surprisingly, despite these dramatic changes in plasticity in juvenile animals, they found only a small, but significant, decrease in spine density in the hippocampus in adults and no change in spine density in the PFC. Remarkably, adult animals show a dramatic and selective impairment of remote memory following postnatal loss of Cdc42, despite that locomotor activity, memory acquisition, anxiety level and working/long-term memories are preserved."

Specific cortical sites are activated by remote memory processes and such activation is absent in mice with remote memory deficits (e.g. Frankland et al., 2004). Furthermore, inactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex disrupt contextual fear memory at remote, but not recent time points showing that this cortical site is required for remote memory."

Specific cortical sites are activated by remote memory processes and such activation is absent in mice with remote memory deficits (e.g. Frankland et al., 2004). Furthermore, inactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex disrupt contextual fear memory at remote, but not recent time points showing that this cortical site is required for remote memory</i>."
