Slow waves are locally regulated, and local slow wave dynamics are important for memory, cognition, and behaviour. While several brainstem structures for controlling global sleep states have now been well characterized, a mechanism underlying fast and local modulation of cortical slow waves has not been identified. Here, using optogenetics and whole cortex electrophysiology, we show that local tonic activation of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) rapidly induces slow wave activity in a spatially restricted region of cortex. These slow waves resemble those seen in sleep, as cortical units undergo periods of silence phase-locked to the slow wave. Furthermore, animals exhibit behavioural changes consistent with a decrease in arousal state during TRN stimulation. We conclude that TRN can induce rapid modulation of local cortical state."

Slow waves are locally regulated, and local slow wave dynamics are important for memory, cognition, and behaviour. While several brainstem structures for controlling global sleep states have now been well characterized, a mechanism underlying fast and local modulation of cortical slow waves has not been identified. Here, using optogenetics and whole cortex electrophysiology, we show that local tonic activation of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) rapidly induces slow wave activity in a spatially restricted region of cortex. These slow waves resemble those seen in sleep, as cortical units undergo periods of silence phase-locked to the slow wave. Furthermore, animals exhibit behavioural changes consistent with a decrease in arousal state during TRN stimulation. We conclude that TRN can induce rapid modulation of local cortical state."

When a larger area is stimulated, the whole brain switches into this sleep-like pattern. Stimulation of the thalamic reticular nucleus also caused the animals to become drowsy and they were more likely to fall asleep, which suggests that sleep-like activity in small parts of the brain may contribute to drowsiness."

Memories are strengthened during sleep, so the next challenge is to study whether the thalamic reticular nucleus influences memory formation. The findings also suggest that further study of this brain region may be useful for understanding how the sleep and awake states are controlled by particular neurons."

A key marker of decreased arousal is cortical slow wave activity (1\u20134 Hz), which occurs both during non-REM sleep (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amzica and Steriade, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buzsaki et al., 1988</a>) and in awake animals during low vigilance states and sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huber et al., 2000</a>). The slow wave marks rhythmic periods of suppression in cortical neurons (OFF periods) lasting hundreds of milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Steriade et al., 2001</a>). These brief offline periods are a candidate mechanism for decreased arousal, and slow waves in local cortical regions are associated with behavioral deficits on sub-second timescales (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</a>). Slow waves are thus correlated with both behavioral decreases in arousal and disruption of cortical activity. However, while several brainstem structures for global control of sleep states have been well characterized (<a href=\"#bib23\">Giber et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tsunematsu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adamantidis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Anaclet et al., 2014</a>), no mechanism has been identified that generates the spatially isolated slow waves that occur during drowsiness, known as \u2018local sleep\u2019. Slow wave activity is locally regulated both during sleep, where it plays a role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huber et al., 2004</a>), and in the awake state, where it reflects a shift in cortical processing modes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Local modulation of slow waves is therefore an important element of cortical function, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood."

                        "text": "We sought to identify a forebrain structure that modulates local cortical slow wave activity. A central modulator of corticothalamic feedback that could initiate these dynamics is the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a subcortical structure that provides powerful inhibition to dorsal thalamic nuclei. The TRN is a thin sheath of GABAergic neurons that surrounds the thalamus and inhibits thalamic relay cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pinault, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Guillery and Harting, 2003</a>). TRN has been implicated in sensory processing (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hartings et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Deleuze and Huguenard, 2006</a>), attentional gating (<a href=\"#bib41\">McAlonan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Crick, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wimmer et al., 2015</a>), and sleep state modulation (<a href=\"#bib42\">McCormick and Bal, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Steriade, 2000</a>) - and is uniquely positioned to selectively and rapidly modulate cortical state. TRN has a causal role in initiating sleep spindles (<a href=\"#bib26\">Halassa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barth\u00f3 et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bazhenov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Steriade et al., 1987</a>), and molecular genetic manipulation of TRN conductances reduces EEG sleep rhythms (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cueni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Espinosa et al., 2008</a>), indicating a role for thalamocortical feedback in cortical sleep oscillations. However, direct manipulations of thalamic activity have yielded conflicting results. Nonspecific activation of multiple thalamic nuclei (including TRN) increases time spent in sleep (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2012</a>), whereas selectively stimulating thalamus induces a desynchronized cortical state (<a href=\"#bib50\">Poulet et al., 2012</a>), suggesting a role for thalamus in controlling arousal states. On the other hand, directly disrupting thalamic activity does not induce slow waves or sleep states (<a href=\"#bib12\">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Steriade et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">David et al., 2013</a>). These mixed findings suggest a complex involvement of thalamus in regulating behavioral arousal, which could be mediated through the TRN. In addition, many sedative and anesthetic drugs act to enhance GABAergic synaptic transmission and thus potentiate the effects of TRN activity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown et al., 2011</a>), further suggesting that it could be a component of the mechanism by which these drugs induce an unconscious state (<a href=\"#bib22\">Franks, 2008</a>). Neuronal activity in TRN is known to correlate with arousal (<a href=\"#bib25\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrionuevo et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Steriade et al., 1986</a>), but it remains unclear whether these firing patterns are a consequence of low arousal or a cause. In particular, the role of TRN in generating the low-frequency oscillatory dynamics characteristic of low arousal states is not known, and the behavioral significance of such cortical dynamics has not been causally tested."

Tonic activation of TRN in awake animals produced slow wave activity in the associated cortical region, together with phase-locked periods of silence in cortical neurons (OFF periods). This manipulation also produced a progressive decrease in arousal state: awake animals exhibited less motor activity and spent more time in non-REM sleep, and anesthetized animals exhibited a decrease in cortical activity and a shift in dynamics favoring OFF periods. We find that the net effect of TRN stimulation is to decrease thalamic firing, suggesting that TRN may modulate arousal state through selective inhibition of thalamic activity, facilitating the onset of slow waves. Furthermore, TRN and other thalamic neurons are phase-locked to the induced oscillations, suggesting that TRN, thalamus, and cortex are all engaged in the rhythm. We conclude that tonic depolarization of TRN rapidly modulates cortical state and controls the animals\u2019 arousal, by inducing suppression and rhythmic spiking in thalamus. The spatial characteristics and rapid timescale (&lt;50 ms) of these effects show that local oscillatory dynamics between thalamus and cortex are a central mechanism for modulation of arousal."

We implanted four mice with stereotrodes distributed across cortex and an optical fiber targeting the somatosensory sector of TRN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). To examine the intrinsic cortical dynamics that emerge when no specific oscillation frequency is imposed, we used tonic rather than phasic stimulation, activating TRN using constant light for 30 s. Tonic TRN activation produced an immediate and substantial increase in low-frequency power in the local field potential (LFP) of ipsilateral somatosensory cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b\u2013d</a>). This power increase was specific to the delta (1-\u20134 Hz) band, which increased by 2.56 dB (95% confidence interval [CI] = [2.13 2.97]) during laser stimulation. In contrast, beta and gamma (15\u201350 Hz) power decreased slightly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, median = -1.03 dB, CI = [-1.24 -0.84]). The increase in delta power was rapid and robust: delta waves were already evident in the first second of TRN activation (change = 1.12 dB, CI = [0.48 1.76]) and persisted throughout the stimulation period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). When individual slow wave events were detected automatically by thresholding filtered LFPs (see Materials and\u00a0methods), 0.3 slow waves per second were detected during TRN stimulation, significantly more than baseline (increase = 0.13 events/s, CI = [0.10 0.17]). The amplitude of the negative-going peak was smaller during stimulation (change = -148 \u03bcV, CI = [-244 -54]), whereas the amplitude of the positive-going peak was larger during stimulation (change = 43 \u03bcV, CI = [8.6 76.7]), similar to the asymmetric waveforms typically seen during sleep slow waves (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2009</a>). The precise frequency and amplitude of slow wave events depend on the detection criteria being used, but these statistics nevertheless indicate a substantial increase in slow waves during TRN stimulation. To test whether this effect was TRN-specific rather than due to long-range GABAergic projections to thalamus, we next studied VGAT-Cre mice injected with AAV-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-EYFP specifically into the TRN and replicated the increase in delta (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3\u20135</a>). No such effect was observed in littermate mice that were negative for ChR2 (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), indicating that the slow waves were not due to nonspecific light or heating effects."

Given that TRN establishes topographical connections with its cortical inputs and thalamic outputs, we hypothesized that TRN could support local slow wave generation. We manipulated the extent of TRN activation by varying laser power, stimulating at low (&lt;2 mW) or high (&gt;2 mW) power while simultaneously recording local field potentials across cortex in individual mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) to investigate the spatial spread of induced slow waves. We recorded in four awake head-fixed mice with fibers targeting the somatosensory sector of TRN. This stimulation protocol is expected to stimulate local somatosensory TRN at low laser power, and stimulate broader regions of TRN at higher laser power (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>, (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yizhar et al., 2011</a>)). We found that low laser power consistently enhanced local delta power in ipsilateral S1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). Across all electrodes in the ipsilateral posterior quadrant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, red circle), 9/20 recording sites (45%) showed a significant increase in delta power during tonic activation (p&lt;0.05, signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction). In contrast, only 2/32 recording sites (6%) in other cortical regions (e.g. contralateral or frontal) showed a significant increase in delta power, a significantly lower proportion than in the ipsilateral posterior quadrant (diff. = 0.37, CI = [0.15 0.6], binomial bootstrap [see Materials and methods]), demonstrating that slow waves were selectively induced in a local ipsilateral cortical region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e,g</a>). Trials using high laser power (i.e. with light spreading to larger regions of TRN) induced slow waves across a large cortical area: 10/20 (50%) of electrodes in the associated cortex and 11/32 (34%) of distant electrodes showed a significant increase in delta power (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f,h</a>). The proportion of distant electrodes showing increased delta power was significantly higher than in the low laser power condition (diff. = 0.26, CI = [0.08 0.44], binomial bootstrap [see Materials and methods]). These data suggest that weak tonic activation of a small population of TRN neurons produces slow waves in a local ipsilateral cortical region, and that the strength of TRN activation controls the spatial spread of cortical slow waves. Local activation of TRN thus controls an aligned region of cortex, and could support the spatially restricted slow waves that occur in local sleep."

To investigate these possibilities, we analyzed the phase relationships between different cortical sites during global induction of slow wave activity. We selected all channels with a significant increase in delta power during the high laser power stimulation, filtered the LFP between 1-\u20134 Hz, and quantified each electrode\u2019s phase relationship relative to the electrode closest to the optical fiber using the phase-locking value (PLV, [<a href=\"#bib33\">Lachaux et al., 1999</a>]). At baseline, all channels in both the ipsilateral posterior quadrant channels and the more distant channels were significantly phase-locked to the reference site (ipsilateral: mean PLV = 0.52, s.d. = 0.13; distant: mean PLV = 0.43, s.d. = 0.15). During TRN stimulation, the PLV decreased slightly across all electrodes (p=0.0065, signed rank test) but remained significantly larger than chance (ipsilateral: mean PLV = 0.48, s.d = 0.15; distant: mean PLV = 0.39, s.d. = 0.17, every channel significant in permutation test). The mean phase offset at baseline was 0.10 radians (std. = 0.22 rad), and did not change significantly during TRN stimulation (mean = 0.15 rad, std. = 0.26 rad, p=0.45, signed rank test). The mean phase offsets across channels were clustered around zero, indicating that the induced slow wave activity was generally synchronized across cortex and phase lags were relatively short. Within individual electrodes, the phase lag was strongly correlated across the baseline and stimulation conditions (R = 0.93, CI = [0.82 0.98], <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8\u20139</a>). These results suggest that TRN stimulation did not strongly affect cortical synchronization, but rather that the induced slow waves had similar phase relationships to the baseline dynamics across cortical regions. This result is consistent with previous findings that anesthesia-induced slow waves exhibit similar phase offsets to awake cortical dynamics (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lewis et al., 2012</a>). This evidence supports the idea that TRN can induce slow waves in local or global cortical regions, with different thalamocortical loops supporting oscillations with different phase offsets across cortical sites."

We isolated 28 single units from five mice and used spike waveforms to distinguish between putative TRN (\u2018Narrow\u2019) and putative thalamocortical (TC, \u2018Wide\u2019) neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>).

The magnitude of the increase in firing rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) suggested that stimulation induced strong local excitation of TRN, and possibly led to downstream inhibition of neurons located farther from the optical fiber through either intra-TRN inhibition or through suppression of thalamic drive to TRN. Alternatively, the heterogeneous effects of stimulation on TRN neurons could reflect variable expression levels or heterogeneous cell types within the TRN with different functional properties (<a href=\"#bib25\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrionuevo et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2014</a>), leading to increased spike rates in a specific subset of TRN cells due to their cell type and role in the local circuit structure. In either scenario, high firing rates in a subset of TRN neurons is sufficient to consistently inhibit thalamocortical cells. These results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation of TRN strongly drives only a local subpopulation of TRN neurons, but nevertheless causes consistent inhibition of thalamic activity."

We therefore hypothesized that thalamus participates in generating slow waves, and tested whether these neurons engaged in the induced rhythm. We indeed observed that subcortical units increased their phase-locking to the thalamic LFP slow waves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). Putative TRN unit phase-locking was diverse: laser stimulation increased overall phase-locking (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, increase = 0.027 bits, CI = [0.005 0.041]), but the preferred phase varied substantially across units (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>).

We expressed halorhodopsin in TRN neurons using local viral injections (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). resulting in widespread expression within a local region of TRN (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and recorded cortical LFPs during partial TRN inhibition. We found that TRN inhibition reduced slow waves in mice during NREM sleep (change = -0.45 dB, CI = [-0.77,-0.13], <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). To ensure that this effect was not due to spontaneous awakenings, we shuffled the laser onset times and did not observe any effect (shuffled change = 0.01, CI = [-0.39, 0.32]), suggesting that the decrease in slow wave activity was specifically due to TRN inhibition. We did not observe behavioural effects of TRN inhibition\u00a0(e.g.,\u00a0<a href=\"#media1\">Video\u00a01</a>), which likely reflects that multiple powerful pathways including brainstem are acting to suppress motor activity during NREM sleep rather than TRN alone (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lydic and Baghdoyan, 2005</a>),\u00a0but could also indicate that more extensive suppression of TRN is needed to modulate behaviour than can be achieved in this preparation. We therefore concluded that TRN can bidirectionally modulate cortical slow wave activity."

We recorded EEG during isoflurane anesthesia and found that the baseline delta power was high, and there was no further increase during TRN activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), suggesting that the ability of TRN to generate slow waves was saturated. When individual slow wave events were detected, they also showed no change in frequency during TRN stimulation (baseline = 0.30 events/s, stimulated = 0.29 events/s). Instead the EEG showed a broadband (0.5-\u201350 Hz) decrease in power (-0.53 dB, CI = [-0.69\u00a0-0.37]), demonstrating a generalized quieting of cortical activity. Furthermore, the fraction of time spent in OFF periods increased by 4.02 percentage points (CI = [1.9 6.2]) and the amplitude of the positive-going LFP slow wave peak increased by 45 \u03bcV (CI = [16 75]) Cortical units increased their phase-locking to slow waves (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4\u20135</a>, median = 0.06 bits, CI = [0.018 0.189]), while their firing rates decreased (median = -0.09 Hz [-5.5%], CI = [-0.22 -0.02]), suggesting that cortical activity became more strongly suppressed by the existing slow waves.

We concluded that the anesthetized cortex is shifted into an even deeper state by TRN activation: not by inducing slow waves, but rather by modulating the dynamics of a slow wave that is already present and thereby prolonging the duration of the periodic suppressions."

This result reinforces recent findings suggesting that sleep contains dynamics that are differentiated across cortex rather than a globally homogeneous cortical state (<a href=\"#bib32\">Krueger et al., 2008</a>). Awake sleep-deprived rats also exhibit slow waves and OFF periods in local cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2011</a>), and these local dynamics are correlated with behavioural deficits. Our results show that localized depolarization in TRN can produce such local oscillations, and could therefore underlie the fragmented cortical slow waves observed during sleep as well as drowsy awake states. In addition, local cortical OFF states have been observed during sleep (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nir et al., 2011</a>) and general anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lewis et al., 2012</a>) in human subjects, demonstrating that OFF periods frequently occur locally even when slow-wave activity is present throughout cortex. The observed asynchronous slow waves in these unconscious states could be due to a global activation of TRN, producing slow waves throughout cortex, but different cortical regions are associated with specific thalamocortical circuits that enable them to undergo separate and asynchronous oscillations. Finally, the local control that TRN exerts over cortex provides evidence for how TRN could modulate attention across sensory modalities, by suppressing arousal in specific cortical regions. This finding thus supports the theory that TRN could function to modulate attention, not only by gating thalamic transmission of sensory information to cortex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crick, 1984</a>), but also by modulating non-sensory-driven thalamic activity, which controls the ongoing state in local cortical regions and thereby influences the structure of functional networks in cortex. The finding that TRN can independently control limited corticothalamic circuits therefore suggests it could serve as a central circuit mechanism to regulate specific cortical regions, modulating both attention and arousal."

We find that the slow waves induced by depolarization of TRN are initiated abruptly, suggesting it could play a role in rapid state modulation. Cortical activity is suppressed within 20 ms of laser onset, and the deflection in the LFP can be detected within 35 ms. This pattern suggests that tens of milliseconds of TRN activation are sufficient to inhibit thalamic input to cortex and produce a cortical OFF state. The dynamics at laser offset are similarly abrupt, with slow waves vanishing within a second. TRN can therefore serve as a rapid modulator of arousal state. This finding is also compatible with established neuromodulatory sleep circuits (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</a>), such as monoaminergic arousal pathways (<a href=\"#bib53\">Saper et al., 2005</a>), as these neuromodulators affect TRN activity as one component of arousal regulation.

This tonic paradigm induced slow waves and modulated cortical state in awake mice without affecting power in the spindle band (7\u201315 Hz). In sleeping mice, tonic activation further increased slow waves and decreased spindle power, similar to the dynamics that occur during transitions into deeper stages of sleep. Interestingly, strong phasic activation of TRN induces spindles during non-REM sleep but not in the awake state (<a href=\"#bib26\">Halassa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barth\u00f3 et al., 2014</a>). Phasic and tonic modulation of TRN activity therefore produce qualitatively different sleep oscillations, suggesting that changes in the dynamics of inputs to TRN could underlie shifts between different stages of sleep. Brief activation of TRN may lead to a thalamic burst that entrains a cortical spindle, whereas prolonged activation hyperpolarizes thalamocortical cells and allows intrinsic slow waves to emerge. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that high-frequency vs. low-frequency corticothalamic input produces qualitatively different effects in thalamus (<a href=\"#bib13\">Crandall et al., 2015</a>), consistent with the idea that modulating the temporal dynamics of input to the thalamocortical circuit can lead to different arousal states."

Our results show that slow waves can be produced by depolarizing TRN, and suggest they may be generated through overall inhibition of thalamic input to cortex. Our manipulation activated a local population of TRN neurons that inhibit the associated region of thalamus. In the absence of this thalamic input to cortex, which drives the desynchronized cortical state (<a href=\"#bib50\">Poulet et al., 2012</a>), cortex and thalamus jointly enter an oscillation in which activity is periodically suppressed. Previous studies have demonstrated that cortex can maintain an awake state even when thalamus is lesioned or inactivated (<a href=\"#bib12\">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zagha et al., 2013</a>); our results therefore suggest that slow waves in the intact brain require the involvement of cortical, TRN, and TC neurons in a coordinated rhythm. Direct inhibition or lesioning of TC cells may disrupt the coordination of this rhythm, whereas physiological levels of inhibition from TRN may allow the emergence of intrinsic thalamic delta. Furthermore, TRN stimulation did not induce slow waves in the anesthetized animal, when thalamic T-type calcium channels are blocked (<a href=\"#bib62\">Todorovic and Lingle, 1998</a>), suggesting that thalamus may contribute to slow wave generation. This theory is also consistent with studies showing that anesthetic infusions directly into thalamus can induce slow waves (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), and that manipulations of thalamus affect the frequency of slow waves (<a href=\"#bib17\">David et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that TRN-mediated inhibition of thalamus is a robust driver of local slow wave activity, and that slow waves in the intact brain may require both cortical and TC neurons to fire in a coordinated rhythm. Hyperpolarization but not complete suppression of thalamus may be key to generating slow waves, as TRN induces partial suppression and bursting in TC neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,j</a>), as opposed to the stronger suppression achieved through direct manipulation of thalamus. However, TRN, thalamus, and cortex are independently capable of generating low-frequency rhythms (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amzica and Steriade, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Beltramo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dossi et al., 1992</a>) and our results could be consistent with any or all of these areas acting as the slow wave pacemaker. Slow waves could arise through thalamic oscillations, could be generated in cortex due to withdrawal of thalamic excitatory drive, or could be jointly driven by both structures. In each scenario, TRN may act as a local regulator that can shift the thalamocortical circuit between desynchronized and oscillatory regimes."

Interestingly, several reports have observed heterogeneous firing properties during sleep, and have suggested the possibility of multiple types of TRN neurons that play different roles in arousal state (<a href=\"#bib25\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrionuevo et al., 1981</a>). Such heterogeneity could explain the variable firing properties observed in different studies. While many TRN neurons decrease their firing rates during NREM sleep, a subset maintain or increase their firing rates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barrionuevo et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Steriade et al., 1986</a>). In addition, most TRN neurons exhibit bursting properties during sleep, with brief periods of activity locked to slow wave rhythms (<a href=\"#bib25\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrionuevo et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Steriade et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Marks and Roffwarg, 1993</a>). These observations are consistent with our results, in which we observe heterogeneous firing rates in TRN, but nearly all units exhibit phase-locking to the induced slow waves during stimulation. It may be that during natural sleep, high firing rates in TRN inhibit thalamic activity and thereby induce slow waves, but those high rates are limited to only certain phases of the slow wave (rather than tonic continuous firing) due to synchronized delta-range input from thalamus and cortex. Experiments using closed-loop control to stimulate at specific phases of slow wave activity could explore whether tonic or phase-locked activity in TRN is most effective at driving cortical slow waves. It may also be that a specific subtype of TRN neuron induces slow wave activity, and that the microcircuitry of TRN enables this subtype to fire more while suppressing other TRN neurons during optogenetic stimulation. Future studies could also examine the effect of stimulation across multiple regions of TRN, as there are distinct subnetworks within TRN that may play different functional roles in regulating arousal (<a href=\"#bib25\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2014</a>)."

However, the decrease in power was modest. This small effect size could be partially due to incomplete inhibition of TRN due to local light delivery and incomplete expression, as little is known about the structure of intra-TRN circuits, and inhibiting only a subset of TRN cells may have different effects than inhibiting all of them. However, the small effect size likely also reflects the fact that multiple arousal centers, including many brainstem nuclei, are modulated during NREM sleep (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Saper et al., 2010</a>), leading to broad thalamic inhibition. Suppressing TRN would thus only moderately reduce inhibitory input to the thalamus as other sources of inhibition persist, leading a reduction in slow wave activity rather than complete suppression. Similarly, stimulating TRN led to robust local cortical slow waves and a relatively small decrease in behavioural arousal, suggesting TRN activity drove local sleep and drowsiness more often than a complete transition into global sleep. Our results, in combination with previous studies, suggest that TRN acts as only one element of a redundant circuit for arousal control. Brainstem structures modulate global arousal state, whereas TRN may serve as a spatially selective circuit for fine-tuning arousal state across local cortical regions, allowing flexible modulation of slow wave activity. TRN may thus play a role in the local slow waves that subserve sleep-dependent memory consolidation, whereas brainstem would regulate the presence of sleep vs. wake states at a global scale."

Halorhodopsin experiments were done through injections of AAV-EF1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-EYFP into the same sites as described above, again using VGAT-Cre mice (n = 3 mice). These viruses were produced by the vector core at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, with titers around 10<sup>12</sup> VG/ml. A volume of 100\u2013200 nL per injection site was used. Viral injections were immediately followed by implant of electrodes and optical fibers as described below. Mice with viral injections were implanted at least 3 weeks prior to beginning experiments to allow time for viral expression to develop."

VGAT-Cre mice received implants of 2 to 4 optical fibers to allow for simultaneous manipulation of two sites in TRN. Two types of electrode implant were performed: either a cortical implant with stereotrodes (<a href=\"#bib44\">McNaughton et al., 1983</a>) distributed across different cortical sites; or a subcortical implant, with moveable stereotrodes targeted to TRN. Mice did not receive both implant types; an individual mouse in which units were recorded would receive either a cortical or subcortical implant. For the cortical implants, stereotrodes were made from pairs of 12.5 micron nichrome wire gold plated to \u223c300 kOhm (California Fine Wire, Grover Beach CA). Electrodes were attached to small sections of plastic tubing cut to defined depth offsets and inserted by hand in 11 recording sites distributed across the cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) at depths of 400, 500, 600, or 1300 microns, as defined by the length of the electrode extending from the plastic tubing. In one mouse with the cortical implant, subcortical recordings were also acquired simultaneously by gluing a stereotrode to the optical fiber, with the stereotrode extending 200 microns beyond the optical fiber. This allowed acquisition of single thalamocortical units. To calculate laser power within the brain, the laser power was first measured outside of the brain, and then this value was scaled to account for diminished power after passing through the fiber. For surgery, mice were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane and individual holes were drilled for electrode and optical fiber insertion. Electrodes were inserted by hand and the optical fiber was placed using a stereotaxic arm."

Electrophysiology data was acquired on a Neuralynx (Neuralynx, Bozeman MT) system with a 32 kHz sampling rate. Full sampling was used to record spikes, detected with a manually set voltage threshold. LFPs were collected with a highpass filter between 0.1 and 0.3 Hz and a lowpass between 2000 and 9000 Hz. EMG was collected with a highpass filter of 10 Hz to prevent data saturation. All electrophysiology data was exported to MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick MA), and LFPs and EMGs were then lowpass filtered offline at 500 Hz and downsampled to 1000 Hz sampling rate. Spike sorting was performed with custom software (Simpleclust, <span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"http://github.com/open-ephys/simpleclust\">http://github.com/open-ephys/simpleclust</a></span>), using standard waveform features to classify spikes. Spikes that could not be assigned to a well-defined cluster were labeled as multi-unit activity, and triphasic waveforms were excluded as fibers of passage. Awake recordings were carried out in either a head-fixed setup or in a clear plastic bowl. Anesthetized recordings were performed with isoflurane in 100% oxygen, in which drug levels were increased if the animal showed any signs of motion, and decreased when the EEG showed burst suppression, for an average range of 0.6% to 1% isoflurane. Experiments in anesthetized trials were performed only after anesthesia was induced with at least 1.5% isoflurane and mice had lost the righting reflex, and isoflurane was maintained at at least 0.5% isoflurane throughout the stimulation period. Anesthetic levels were varied manually to stay within a lightly anesthetized range, by decreasing levels if the EEG showed burst suppression and increasing levels if mice showed any sign of movement. In sessions with automated motion quantification, two video cameras were mounted at two orthogonal angles to enable automated motion capture."

Light was maintained at constant levels throughout a single 30 s period. For experiments comparing different laser strengths, the laser output was varied within a single session, but not within a single 30 s stimulation period. Simulations for the transmission of light through tissue at these different laser strengths were performed using the calculator developed by the Deisseroth lab (<a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php\">http://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php</a>).

Error bars across multiple sessions (e.g. , <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>) show the standard error of the mean across all trials. Statistical testing was done by taking the sum of power within a band of interest on individual trials, and then comparing power during the 30 s stimulation against power during the 30 s immediately preceding TRN stimulation. Change in power is reported as the median effect size and 95% confidence intervals, computed by inverting the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Automatic slow wave event detection was performed by bandpassing the LFP between 0.1\u20135 Hz using a finite impulse response filter, detecting local minima with magnitude\u00a0&gt;100 \u03bcV, and computing the difference between the negative trough and subsequent peak. The top 3% percentile of peak-to-peak amplitudes within each session were selected as slow wave events. Any peak within a 400 ms window with standard deviation &gt; 2000 was rejected as artifact. The difference in the number of peaks was statistically tested using a Wilcoxon signed rank test to compute the median difference in slow wave event numbers in the stimulated versus baseline periods for each trial. For analyses across electrodes, the change in power was computed for each electrode and the Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons across electrodes. To compare the number of activated electrodes in local versus global electrodes, and across laser power conditions, we treated the number of significant electrodes as a binomial distribution. We assumed a uniform prior for the binomial parameter, obtaining a beta density as the posterior distribution for each proportion. We estimated the difference between two conditions by sampling 1000 times from the posterior distributions in each condition, and calculating the median and 95% confidence intervals as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the difference between each resampled datapoint (i.e., a Monte Carlo bootstrap for the difference between two groups). To compute the PLV, each channel was filtered between 1-\u20134 Hz and Hilbert transformed to extract the instantaneous phase. The PLV was then taken as <i>the</i> circular mean of the difference in phase for each electrode relative to the electrode closest to the optical fiber (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lachaux et al., 1999</a>). To test whether the magnitude of the PLV was greater than expected by chance, the trial labels were shuffled 500 times and the true PLV was compared to permuted PLV values from the shuffled trials, at alpha = 0.05. To report the confidence interval for the angle of the PLV, the trials were resampled with a bootstrap procedure and the PLV angle across the resampled data was calculated 500 times."

Statistical significance was tested by performing a bootstrap with 1000 iterations on the paired power data, taking the 97.5% percentile of these resampled values, and testing whether its absolute value was larger than the correlation computed on a randomly shuffled set of times. This provided a test at significance level \u03b1 = 0.05 of whether the correlation between EEG and EMG effects was significantly higher during laser trials than would be expected during baseline conditions. Automated motion scoring was computed using automated custom software written in Matlab (<span class=\"underline\"><a href=\"http://github.com/jvoigts/optical_flow_analysis\">http://github.com/jvoigts/optical_flow_analysis</a></span>) that calculated the optical flow for each frame in the video via the Horn\u2013Schunck method (<a href=\"#bib28\">Horn and Schunck, 1981</a>). The points of maximal motion in each camera view were used to compute a motion vector in the horizontal plane. The motion vector was normalized by its mean to avoid artifact due to variations in lighting conditions and camera placement. The magnitude of the motion vector for each frame was then smoothed using a moving average filter (sigma = 200 frames/6.67 s) and used as a proxy for the magnitude of animal's overall motion. In order to ensure objective assessment of sleep, semi-automated sleep scoring was performed using an algorithm that first detects wake states as periods with heightened muscle tone by computing the instantaneous amplitude between 60\u2013200 Hz of the EMG or cranial screw recording motor activity, smoothing with a Gaussian filter of 50 ms, and then using a manually entered threshold to identify wake states as those with at least 5 s of data above the threshold. Second, it computes the ratio of &lt;4 Hz and 4\u201316 Hz power in the EEG, smooths with a Gaussian filter, and uses a manually entered threshold to segment non-REM and REM states. Sessions where the automated algorithm could not achieve a separation of sleep and wake states were not included in the analysis (1 session out of 13 total was excluded). The user selecting the EEG and EMG thresholds was blind to the timing of laser stimulation during the sleep scoring procedure. As with spectral effects, changes were reported as the median power change in dB, and 95% confidence intervals were computed by inverting the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The shuffled control to test whether halorhodopsin-driven decreases in slow wave activity were larger than would be expected by chance was performed by pseudorandomly selecting an equivalent number of laser onset times during spontaneous NREM sleep and recalculating the change in slow wave power. This shuffling procedure was repeated 400 times to produce confidence intervals."

When comparing cortical units on channels with and without a slow wave effect, normalized delta power changes were computed by dividing delta (1\u20134 Hz) power by total 0\u201350 Hz power in the [-30 0] and [0 30] periods. Electrodes with a normalized delta power increase of at least 2% during TRN activation were labeled as having a delta effect. Subcortical units were divided into two categories based on the time between the peak and trough of the waveform. Narrow (&lt;200 ms peak-to-trough) units were further subdivided into three categories based on their spike rate response to the laser, computed by taking the difference of their spike rates in the [0 30] s period vs. the [-30 0] period. Phase modulation was computed relative to the local LFP for each unit. To account for sign reversals due to electrode placement or referencing and ensure consistent phase measurements across units, thalamic LFPs were flipped such that the laser-induced deflection was negative across all channels. The fraction change in phase-locking strength for each unit was calculated by subtracting the MI during the stimulated period from the MI during baseline, and then normalizing by the MI during baseline. The peak phase was selected by dividing spikes into 10 phase bins and identifying the bin containing the most spikes. The narrowness of the phase distribution was tested by computing the kurtosis separately for putative TC and putative RE units using the CircStat toolbox (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berens, 2009</a>). The difference between the two unit types was then calculated. To test whether this difference was significant, the difference in kurtosis was bootstrapped 1000 times with random resampling of units, shuffling the unit type assignment, and then the original difference in kurtosis was compared to the 95% confidence interval derived from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the resampled differences. To test the timing of the rate decrease relative to laser onset, 10 ms windows in the 2 s pre-stimulus period were used to create a distribution of baseline values, which was bootstrapped 1000 times to determine a threshold for significant change (the 0.25th percentile, \u03b1 = 0.005). 10 ms windows after laser onset were then compared to this threshold to assess timing of a significant change. Triggered LFP analysis was done analogously, averaging the mean LFP value in 10 ms bins. For LFP and spike timing analyses, the alpha level was set at 0.005 to correct for multiple comparisons across time bins (10 bins of 10 ms width to span the 100 ms deflection interval)."

OFF periods were labeled as any period of at least 50 ms with a firing rate of zero. To verify that OFF periods were occurring at a greater rate than would happen by random chance, we also computed OFF periods on simulated data with the same mean firing rate as the experimental data. The simulated data was generated by taking the interspike intervals throughout the recording period, fitting a gamma distribution to these intervals, and then generating a new spike train from that gamma distribution with the same number of spikes as the original dataset. The OFF periods were then calculated with the same method for the simulated data. Statistical testing for OFF periods was performed across trials within each session: the percent of time spent in an OFF period during laser stimulation was compared to the percent of time spent in an OFF period in the 30 s preceding laser stimulation with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The significance of this difference within each animal is reported. The percent of time in OFF periods was compared to simulated data by running the simulation 1000 times and testing whether the experimental value was greater than the 97.5th percentile of the simulated value. Statistical testing for the phase distribution of OFF periods was computed by splitting the data into 10 phase bins and testing for uniform distribution of OFF periods using Pearson\u2019s chi-square test \u2013 a significant result indicated that OFF periods were not uniformly distributed across the LFP slow wave phases, but rather appeared predominantly at specific phases."

The model covariates consisted of either a 1 or a 0 to indicate whether a spike was observed in any given preceding time bin. The model used 50 bins of 2 millisecond width each. GLMs were fit in Matlab and confidence intervals were calculated using \u2018glmfit\u2019, which were then used to determine for each cell whether the parameter estimate for the [2 4] ms was significantly different during TRN stimulation as compared to baseline, with \u03b1 = 0.05.

Using optogenetics, electrophysiology, EEG and EMG recordings, the authors showed that local tonic activation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) rapidly induced slow wave (1\u20134 Hz) in isolated cortical regions (or more globally depending on stimulation intensity). They also provide some limited evidence that inhibiting TRN during sleep reduced slow wave activity. Single unit recording indicated that tonic TRN simulation predominantly suppressed thalamic firing rates, while at the same time promoting thalamic bursting. Importantly, the induced slow wave was behaviorally relevant, associated with a progressive reduction in arousal state, reduced movement. The main conclusion is that TRN-mediated thalamic inhibition can serve as a mechanism for local modulation of cortical arousal state. This study addresses a critical topic in thalamic control of cortical state, and is well motivated by a series of physiology and behavioral studies that suggest TRN is the key mediator of thalamocortical dynamics implicated in sensory processing, attentional gating and arousal/sleep state transition."

However, in this study, only the somatosensory sector of TRN was simulated. It is not clear why the somatosensory sector of TRN was targeted and whether other TRN regions have been simulated. Considering the topographically mapped projections from thalamus to cortex, it is important and desirable to know whether simulating a different TRN region would induce slow waves in other cortical regions. This issue is particular relevant in light of recent finding from the authors that the TRN composes of distinct subnetworks engaged in different functional circuits (<a href=\"#bib25\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>). Thus while we do not expect yet other experiments to stimulate other thalamic nuclei, it would be helpful to discuss this issue and to qualify the sweeping statements about TRN specifically throughout."

My opinion is that this is below the usual standards in the field, but I appreciate that actual thalamic recordings during halorhodopsin activation (as they managed to do for ChR2) would be difficult. The meager histological evidence provided is not very compelling, however. As the authors point out themselves, there is good evidence for neuronal heterogeneity in TRN. The single, small, supplementary histological photo does not allow one to judge whether NpHR expression was generalized to all TRN cells in an infected sector, or whether there was cellular selectivity. Such evidence would never suffice, for example, to demonstrate efficacy of NpHR expression in cortical interneurons where subtypes are diverse and well characterized. Cell counts and double-labeling are the norm. Different viral serotypes can have very strong cellular tropisms and lead to selective expression. To my eye, in fact, the expression in the supplementary image appears very patchy and nonuniform. TRN neurons are well known to interact via inhibitory synapses but the specific intra-TRN circuits are unknown, so patchy expression may not be a good predictor of the effect of optogenetic suppression on overall TRN activity."

We demonstrate that the NpHR virus expressed selectively in TRN (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplememnt 2</a>), analogously to the ChR2 virus (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Given the successful expression in TRN, the fact that we used a widely used virus that is known to express halorhodopsin, and the electrophysiological evidence that we suppressed slow wave activity, we believe that adding histological figures is sufficient to show that our optogenetic manipulation was selective and effective in TRN. Halorhodopsin has been previously well characterized (e.g. Zhang et al., Nature, 2007; Gradinaru et al., Brain Cell Bio, 2008), the virus has been used in several prior suppression experiments (e.g. Land et al., Nat. Neuro. 2014; Delevich et al., J. Neurosci. 2015; McCutcheon et al., Front. Neur. Circ. 2014) and we verified successful infection in TRN (the new <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, we have strong evidence for the selectivity and effectiveness of our manipulation by adding histology alone. Given the histological evidence of halorhodopsin expressing in TRN, and previous studies of halorhodopsin, there is no alternative hypothesis we can think of that could explain our results, other than successful suppression of TRN. Single unit recording in the TRN is challenging and is a lengthy process, requiring at least 6 months to record from even a small number of animals, so we were not able to acquire new unit recordings within the resubmission deadline. However, since we have added histology showing expression of halorhodopsin in TRN, and since many other studies have demonstrated the effects of the AAV halorhodopsin virus, the evidence for our manipulation is strong. We agree it would be interesting for future studies to examine the dynamics of unit firing during inhibition, as these changes may be complex rather than a simple decrease in firing rates (similar to the observed heterogeneity in our ChR2 manipulation), and future studies could combine slice experiments with computational models to explore those dynamics and provide insight into the microcircuitry of TRN. We believe these revisions fully address the reviewers\u2019 request to show effective manipulations in TRN, as the new histological figure demonstrates successful and selective viral expression."

Our statement about the requirement of all three structures to produce a slow wave was not intended to refer to the halorhodopsin experiment. Rather, we intended to discuss the fact that studies lesioning thalamus have in general not produced slow waves; it instead seems that all three structures need to be intact for this circuit to oscillate. We have added a clarification to this statement to avoid linking it to the halorhodopsin findings, and instead discuss the point that physiological inhibition of thalamus, rather than complete suppression or lesioning, seems to play a key role in slow wave generation. The primary conclusion of our study is that tonic activation of TRN can decrease cortical arousal state, and that this modulation is rapid, local, and behaviourally relevant."

Was it because higher laser power inhibited more thalamic nucleus projecting to a wider cortical area, or because stronger slow wave traveled more widespread across the cortex? Analyzing the slow wave data in different electrodes may solve this puzzle.</i> We appreciate the suggestion and have added new analyses showing the phase relationships between slow waves at distant cortical sites (subsection \u201cTRN activation selectively controls a local ipsilateral cortical region\u201d, second paragraph). While these data are not sufficient to decisively conclude the underlying mechanism, they suggest that dynamics across the recorded regions are significantly synchronized, with small but detectable phase delays across cortical sites. Inducing slow waves through TRN stimulation has very little effect on the magnitude or phase of cross-cortical dynamics (in the aforementioned paragraph, <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). The lack of substantial changes in phase offsets or increased phase-locking argues against the hypothesis that stronger slow waves are induced locally but are traveling further across cortex, and would be consistent with the idea that thalamocortical loops are oscillating according to their intrinsic dynamics. However, our experiments cannot definitely verify this. Future studies could investigate this by recording in additional thalamic sites, or by disrupting slow waves in a local cortical region and examining the impact on distant regions. We discuss these possibilities in the text, and mention that this also demonstrates that TRN activation can generate slow waves with phase offsets, which have been observed in natural sleep and in anesthesia."

We also report the statistics of OFF periods, which are the neuronal basis for the LFP slow waves (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, we recognize that slow wave events are of interest, so we have added new analyses demonstrating slow wave event statistical properties during TRN stimulation. We now compare the frequency and amplitude of slow waves in stimulation vs. baseline, and show a substantial increase in the number of events during TRN stimulation (subsection \u201cTonic activation of TRN produces cortical slow waves\u201d). We also report that the amplitude of the slow waves shifts to an asymmetric waveform in which the positive-going peak increases in amplitude, similar to the slow waves seen in natural sleep. We'd just like to caution that this type of analysis depends on the precise definition of a slow wave that is used, so most analyses we present still use delta power to provide a less biased metric of ongoing cortical dynamics. It is difficult to determine from LFP alone the true frequency and amplitude of slow waves, as there are no objective selection criteria. Additional relevant statistics are provided in our analysis of OFF periods (which analyzes periods with no unit firing rather than LFP slow waves) comparing the duration of OFF periods during stimulation vs. wake (subsection \u201cCortical units rapidly phase-lock to induced slow waves and undergo OFF periods\u201d), which quantifies the neuronal basis of the induced LFP slow waves."

In part due to the challenges of recording units in TRN, only a small number of studies have reported TRN firing patterns during sleep. There is increasing evidence that more than one cell type and firing rate pattern exists in TRN, and the local circuitry may cause our stimulation to only increase firing in some subset of TRN neurons. For instance, in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> of <a href=\"#bib56\">Steriade et al. (1986)</a>, they report that a subset of the TRN neurons they recorded had higher firing rates during NREM sleep than during wake, despite their switch into a rhythmic bursting mode. This is consistent with our data, in which only some neurons increase their firing rates, and both stimulated and suppressed neurons become phase-locked to the slow waves (e.g. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Although our stimulation paradigm is tonic, the resulting firing pattern is locked to slow waves, indicating that tonic drive to TRN is sufficient to induce oscillatory patterns within TRN as well. We therefore suggest that our results do not represent a discrepancy with past electrophysiology studies, but rather is consistent with the finding that during natural sleep one can observe high TRN firing rates that are intermittent, as the TRN units are firing at high rates at only a limited phase of the slow wave cycle, and that the firing patterns within TRN are heterogeneous and different subsets of neurons may play different functional roles in slow wave generation."

My opinion is that this is below the usual standards in the field, but I appreciate that actual thalamic recordings during halorhodopsin activation (as they managed to do for ChR2) would be difficult. The meager histological evidence provided is not very compelling, however. As the authors point out themselves, there is good evidence for neuronal heterogeneity in TRN. The single, small, supplementary histological photo does not allow one to judge whether NpHR expression was generalized to all TRN cells in an infected sector, or whether there was cellular selectivity. Such evidence would never suffice, for example, to demonstrate efficacy of NpHR expression in cortical interneurons where subtypes are diverse and well characterized. Cell counts and double-labeling are the norm. Different viral serotypes can have very strong cellular tropisms and lead to selective expression. To my eye, in fact, the expression in the supplementary image appears very patchy and nonuniform. TRN neurons are well known to interact via inhibitory synapses but the specific intra-TRN circuits are unknown, so patchy expression may not be a good predictor of the effect of optogenetic suppression on overall TRN activity.

The reason for the patchy appearance of the expression pattern is due to the anatomical structure of TRN. TRN is a weblike ('reticulated') structure that appears patchy because it is perforated with axon bundles passing through the structure (i.e. the TRN itself has a patchy structure). The new images show more clearly the distribution of EYFP and cell bodies, with higher resolution microscopy and images of individual cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The EYFP is membrane-bound, so it is absent within the cell bodies, and expression is seen as a ring of fluorescence that surrounds the cell body (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, left panels). While some fluorescence can be detected outside the TRN, this reflects expression in projections from TRN rather than in cell bodies outside the target region (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, bottom panels, no rings of fluorescence appear around thalamic cell bodies).
