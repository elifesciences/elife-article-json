Genes that can be turned on quickly could be activated by either Msn2 or Msn4, and both factors activated the genes to a similar extent. By contrast, both Msn2 and Msn4 were required to activate those genes that take a long time to be turned on. In these cases, Msn2 served as a 'switch' that governed the 'on' and 'off' state of the genes, while Msn4 behaved as a 'rheostat' to tune how much gene product was made. This cooperation between the two transcription factors is equivalent to a design commonly found in electrical circuits and may help the cell to survive in rapidly changing environments."

Although a large number of TF homologs have diversified over time to obtain distinct target genes from their partners, others have remained relatively conserved and share the same DNA binding motif, which limits their downstream interactions to identical target genes. Recent studies suggest that some closely related TF homologs or isoforms, which regulate a shared set of target genes, might have diverged expression patterns, dynamic responses or gene regulatory functions. For example, the yeast transcriptional regulator Dig1 inhibits the expression of mating response genes to pheromone stimulation, whereas its homolog Dig2 exhibits both negative and positive regulation depending on the conditions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Houser et al., 2012</a>). In mammalian cells, two TF isoforms NFAT1 and NFAT4 display distinct nuclear translocation dynamics in response to stimuli. It has been suggested that this dynamic diversity of isoforms might enhance the\u00a0temporal signal processing function of the cell (<a href=\"#bib27\">Yissachar et al., 2013</a>). In addition, a very recent study showed that the TF homologs STAT5A and STAT5B differentially contribute to the immune transcriptional response due to their different expression levels (<a href=\"#bib25\">Villarino et al., 2016</a>). Here we use the yeast homologous stress responsive TFs Msn2 and Msn4 as a model to quantitatively study the functional relevance of closely related TFs in the same single cells."

Upon stress stimulation, both TFs rapidly translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they bind to the same DNA recognition sequence and induce the expression of a common set of stress responsive genes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Martinez-Pastor et al., 1996</a>). Their nucleocytoplasmic translocation is controlled by phosphorylation and is directly regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gorner et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left). Therefore, it has been long believed that Msn2 and Msn4 are functionally redundant in regulating gene expression response. In fact, since Msn2 is assumed to play a more pronounced role in gene regulation, many previous studies focused only on Msn2, deleting the <i>MSN4</i> gene to simplify analysis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2015b</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Petrenko et al., 2013</a>). A microarray analysis, however, suggested that Msn2 and Msn4 might have different contributions to gene induction at individual promoters (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berry and Gasch, 2008</a>), but the mechanism underlying these differences remains unknown."

We find that Msn2 and Msn4 have non-redundant and distinct functions in the\u00a0combinatorial gene regulation. We have previously demonstrated that Msn2/4 target genes differ significantly in their promoter activation kinetics, which dramatically influences their responses to dynamic inputs (such as transient versus sustained inputs) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>). In this work, we show that, in response to a transient input, either Msn2 or Msn4 alone is sufficient to induce the expression of target genes with fast kinetics promoters, constituting what is essentially a biological 'OR' logic gate. In contrast, the induction of target genes with slow kinetics promoters requires activation of both factors, forming an 'AND' gate. At the single-cell level, even though Msn2 and Msn4 show similar nuclear translocation dynamics, they exhibit different levels of heterogeneity in nuclear localization and distinct gene regulatory functions. Msn2 is activated in a relatively homogeneous manner and functions as a low threshold 'switch' essential for turning on slow kinetics promoters. In contrast, Msn4 activation is highly heterogeneous and it serves as a 'rheostat' to effectively tune the induction level of target genes with slow kinetics promoters in individual cells. Therefore, while target genes with fast kinetics promoters are uniformly expressed in most cells, those with slow promoters are more likely to be fully induced in only a fraction of cells with high Msn4 activity. Our work reveals that the seemingly redundant TF Msn4 has a distinct gene regulatory role from its homolog Msn2 and enables diversified gene expression responses within a cell population, which might be beneficial for survival under rapidly changing environments."

We first focus on the dynamics of Msn2 and Msn4 nuclear translocation. We observe that Msn2 and Msn4 show similar temporal dynamics of translocation in the same single cells in response to a transient inhibitor input (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, we find that the level of Msn4 nuclear translocation is highly heterogeneous across single cells: some cells show high level of nuclear translocation, while other cells have very low localization levels. In contrast, the translocation levels of Msn2 are relatively homogeneous amongst individual cells. To illustrate the noise levels of Msn2 and Msn4 translocation, we plotted the standard deviation of their single-cell time traces scaled by the mean and reported the coefficient of variation (CV: standard deviation scaled by the mean) for the peak point of time traces. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A(ii)</a>, Msn4 nuclear translocation exhibits a higher level of cell-cell variability than that of Msn2. To investigate the dynamics of Msn2 and Msn4 translocation in response to natural stresses, we subject yeast cells to osmotic stress and ethanol stress treatments. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>, osmotic stress elicits a transient pulse of Msn2 and Msn4 translocation, while ethanol stress induces sustained nuclear localization of Msn2 and Msn4. In response to either stress, Msn4 exhibits similar temporal dynamics of nuclear translocation to Msn2 in single cells, consistent with the inhibitor treatments.

Using the deletion strains, we have revealed that target genes with different promoter activation kinetics exhibit different dependence to Msn2 and Msn4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). To further determine the dependence of gene regulation specifically on Msn2 or Msn4 in single cells when both factors are present, we simultaneously monitored nuclear localization of Msn2 and Msn4 and reporter gene expression under the fast kinetics promoter P<i><sub>DCS2</sub></i> or the slow kinetics promoter P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i> in the same wild-type cells. We then quantified and plotted the maximal level of reporter expression versus the peak nuclear localization level of Msn2 and/or Msn4 of each single cell to analyze the relationship between gene expression and the activity of Msn2 and Msn4, respectively. To cover a full range of TF translocation levels, we combined the single cell responses to 30-min inhibitor inputs with various doses."

Furthermore, the reporter gene is fully induced predominantly in the fraction of cells in which Msn4 is highly activated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,i</a>, red solid circles). In individual cells with a fixed level of Msn2 activity, a higher level of Msn4 activation results in an increase in both the probability and the level of gene induction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,i</a>, with a fixed y-axis value and an increasing x-axis value). However, in single cells with a fixed level of Msn4 activity, higher Msn2 activation does not necessarily lead to higher gene induction; in fact, too much Msn2 activation will suppress gene induction in the same cell, suggesting a competing role of Msn2 for binding to the promoter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,i</a>, with a fixed x-axis value and an increasing y-axis value). To quantitatively demonstrate this competing role of Msn2 against Msn4, we plotted the relationship between gene expression and the ratio of Msn2 versus Msn4 in single cells. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, gene expression decreases dramatically when the ratio of Msn2 versus Msn4 increases. We further analyzed the relationship between reporter gene expression with Msn2 or Msn4 activity, individually. Gene expression shows a switch-like relationship to Msn2 activation with a low threshold (~10 normalized a.u.: ~25% of maximal Msn2 localization): while a low level of Msn2 activity is required for turning the gene on, the induction level is independent of Msn2 activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,ii</a>, left, averaged response of single cells binned based on their TF levels). In contrast, gene expression exhibits a linear relationship with Msn4 activity in which both the probability and the level of gene induction increase with the level of Msn4 activity in single cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,ii</a>, right; Single-cell distributions of gene expression versus Msn2 or Msn4 are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; The probabilities of gene induction versus Msn2 or Msn4 are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In accordance with the deletion analysis in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>,\u00a0in response to prolonged (60-min) input pulses, the reporter expression of P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i> no longer specifically depends on Msn4 and the level of reporter expression shows graded relationships with both Msn2 and Msn4 (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In response to transient inputs, consistent with the required role of Msn2 for slow promoter induction shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, Msn2 in single cells serves as a low threshold 'switch' for gene induction: it is required to be activated above a certain threshold (~25% of its maximal level) to turn on transcription in the cell; once its activity is above that threshold, a further increase in Msn2 activity cannot positively contribute to the extent of gene induction. In contrast, despite of its low expression level, Msn4 is a highly potent activator of slow target promoters and thus is also required the full induction of slow promoters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Once Msn2 turns on gene transcription in a cell, Msn4 functions as a 'rheostat' in the same cell to effectively fine-tune the probability and level of gene induction. Furthermore, high levels of Msn2 in the nucleus may compete with Msn4 for binding to the same target promoters and can thus suppress gene induction. This possible inhibitory role of Msn2 against Msn4 counteracts its modest positive contribution to gene expression. Therefore, the expression level of target genes with slow promoter kinetics depends specifically on the Msn4 activity in individual cells. Furthermore, the homolog-specific gene regulation depends on the transient dynamics of TF inputs. In response to sustained inputs, the slow kinetics promoters no longer exhibit the specific dependence on Msn4 and behave like fast kinetics promoters upon transient inputs."

In response to 0.5\u2009M KCl treatment, we find that the reporter gene is fully induced specifically in the cells with high Msn4 activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,i and ii</a>), in accordance with the inhibitor experiments. In addition, the probability and the level of gene induction are independent of Msn2 activity, but increase linearly with Msn4 activity in single cells (Single-cell distributions of gene expression versus Msn2 or Msn4 are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; the relationship between gene expression and AUC are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>,\u00a0in accordance with other fast kinetics promoters, gene expression under this mutant promoter is induced in most cells and displays a similar graded relationship with both Msn2 and Msn4. Therefore, Msn2 and Msn4 no longer show distinct regulatory functions when the P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i> promoter, with the majority of the promoter sequence intact, is mutated to obtain fast activation kinetics. We next tested the opposite situation in which we slow down a fast kinetics promoter. To this end, we monitored the gene expression response under the P<i><sub>DCS2</sub></i> promoter in cells lacking the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (<i>snf6\u0394</i>). It has been shown previously that this mutant significantly slows down the activation kinetics of fast promoters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>). Consequently, we observe that gene expression under the P<i><sub>DCS2</sub></i> promoter in this mutant exhibits switch-like versus linear relationships with Msn2 and Msn4, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), consistent with the responses of other slow kinetics promoters. In summary, these results suggest that the distinct regulatory functions of Msn2 and Msn4 might depend more generally on the kinetics of promoter activation, but not on specific target promoters."

However, we anticipate that, in near future, the technological advances will allow us to track single-cell gene regulation at the whole genome level. Such technologies will undoubtedly provide further insights into combinatorial gene regulation by Msn2 and Msn4. For example, we previously grouped target genes with fast versus slow promoter kinetics based on a population-level assay using cells with the <i>msn4\u0394</i> background (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>). Given the newly identified role of Msn4 in shifting the promoter activation timescales in a subpopulation of cells, we suspect that its presence might alter the classification of some target genes with intermediate promoter kinetics. A genome-wide single-cell analysis will enable a more accurate classification of target genes and, more importantly, will lead to a comprehensive understanding about dynamic regulation of global transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli."

For target genes with fast promoter kinetics, both factors can contribute to gene expression in a graded manner. In contrast, for target genes with slow promoter kinetics, Msn2 and Msn4 play distinct and cooperative roles, in which Msn2 functions as a low threshold 'switch' governing the 'ON' and 'OFF' state of promoter activation, while Msn4 serves as a 'rheostat' to effectively tune the induction level of gene expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Further biochemical analysis is needed to elucidate the mechanistic details underlying these distinct regulatory functions of Msn2 and Msn4 at slow target promoters. One possible mechanism could involve the recruitment of distinct chromatin remodeling factors by Msn2 and Msn4 to target gene promoters. For example, to function as a low threshold 'switch', Msn2 might first recruit some initiation factors critical for opening up the tightly packed nucleosomes, characteristic of slow kinetics promoters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>). This could be followed by the subsequent promoter binding of Msn4, leading to the recruitment of Msn4-specific chromatin remodelers or modifiers to effectively promote and stabilize chromatin disassembly. In accordance with this mechanism, we observe that Msn4 always follows Msn2 in nuclear translocation with a short delay (~2\u20133\u2009min) under the inhibitor or natural stress conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

                        "text": "Target genes with fast and slow promoter activation kinetics are regulated differently and hence might have distinct physiological functions. In support of this, we find a close correlation between gene functions and promoter kinetics for previously identified target gene groups with fast or slow kinetics promoters (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; target gene groups are from <a href=\"#bib12\">Hao and O\u2019Shea, 2012</a>). Target genes with fast kinetics promoters are primarily involved in metabolic and cellular adaptation to glucose starvation (carbohydrate metabolism and autophagy), whereas the majority of target genes with slow kinetics promoters are involved in cellular protection against chronic stresses. These results suggest that, in response to carbon source changes that might require an\u00a0immediate adaptive response, cells could quickly modulate their metabolism via activating those genes with fast kinetics promoters. In contrast, the induction of genes with slow kinetics promoters is more tightly controlled. These genes are important for preparing cells to survive under chronic stress conditions, the response to which might be less time-sensitive and the occurrence of which might be less frequent in natural habitats. Cells would only activate these genes upon a sustained presence of stresses. This temporal separation of target genes with different functions could avoid initiating resource-intensive cell protection processes in response to minor environmental fluctuations and thereby optimize resource allocation under rapidly changing environments. Furthermore, cells may use Msn4 to control the level of heterogeneity at the population level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), as part of a bet hedging strategy against unpredictable environmental conditions. During the first onset of stresses, a subpopulation of cells with high Msn4 activity induce the expression of stress resistance genes with slow kinetics promoters, preparing for upcoming severe or chronic stresses; meanwhile, other cells with low Msn4 activity cannot induce these genes and therefore may consequently obtain a better fitness advantage if the subsequent stress is minor or short term. In this way, cells can be divided into two subpopulations, each of which is specialized at coping with one of the possible environmental scenarios. Cells lacking Msn4, however, are not able to induce the slow target genes within the whole population, and hence might be more likely to go extinct in the face of extreme stresses. Therefore, the Msn4-dependent gene regulation may represent a strategy that enables a homolog-'controlled' form of heterogeneity within a cell population."

                        "text": "The coupling of the homologous factors Msn2 and Msn4 in combinatorial gene regulation is analogous to logic gate systems commonly found in digital circuits: fast kinetics promoters behave as an 'OR' gate, becoming fully induced with adequate amount of either factor, while slow kinetics promoters behave as an 'AND' gate, requiring the activation of both Msn2 and Msn4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Interestingly, this logic gate scheme is not fixed, but rather dependent on the upstream dynamics of TF input \u2013 an 'AND' gate upon a transient input can become an 'OR' gate when the input duration is prolonged. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>,\u00a0in response to a 30-min input pulse, the slow kinetics promoter P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i> is an 'AND' gate, requiring both Msn2 and Msn4 for gene induction; But it becomes an 'OR' gate in response to a 60-min input pulse, in which Msn4 is no longer required. Therefore, given enough amount of time in the nucleus, Msn2 can also function as a 'rheostat' to compensate the absence of Msn4 and tune the induction level of slow target promoters, consistent with a previous study showing that increasing the steady-state expression level of Msn2 leads to a graded induction of its target genes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Stewart-Ornstein et al., 2013</a>). Our results suggest that the architectures of gene regulatory networks are not static and could be rewired by various upstream dynamics of TF inputs. In yeast, a recent proteomic analysis found that most proteins that exhibit transient pulsatile dynamics to environmental changes are members of paralogous or closely related TFs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dalal et al., 2014</a>). For example, Msn2 and a related transcriptional repressor Mig1, both having pulsatile dynamics, regulate their common target genes by modulating their relative pulse timing (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lin et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, in mammalian systems, an increasing number of TFs, including some closely related TF pairs such as NFAT1 and NFAT4 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Yissachar et al., 2013</a>), have been identified to possess highly diverse activation dynamics that contribute to gene expression responses (<a href=\"#bib1\">Behar and Hoffmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Purvis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Purvis and Lahav, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Tay et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Werner et al., 2005</a>). Given the prevalence of seemingly redundant TFs in eukaryotes, we anticipate that the time-dependent combinatorial gene regulation revealed here for Msn2 and Msn4 will be widely applicable to homologous or closely related TFs that are controlled dynamically in other organisms including mammals."

However, how paralogous TFs quantitatively and specifically influence gene expression remains largely unexplored. Using single-cell time-lapse microscopy, this manuscript analyzes the regulation of genes by a pair of dynamic paralogous TFs, Msn2 and Msn4, in budding yeast. The authors use artificial induction and natural stress signals to transiently induce the system. They then measure TF dynamics and target gene outputs in the same cell, and analyze the quantitative roles of Msn2 and Msn4 in target gene expression levels. The data indicate that under certain conditions Msn2 acts as a switch while Ms4 behaves like a rheostat, and in other conditions Msn2/Msn4 function as an OR gate. These results suggest that dynamic control of these two stress response regulators may provide important physiological benefits for budding yeast in response to environmental signals."

This is not the most obvious or reasonable choice, since there are many characteristics of the Msn2/4 pulse that can be influencing gene expression downstream. For example, since the authors used total reporter output (i.e., peak CFP level) as expression level, shouldn't the corresponding input variable be the integrated area under the Msn2 or Msn4 nuclear localization curve? Therefore, the authors should report analysis with area under curve as \"nuclear Msn2/Msn4 levels\" and make sure that the switch or rheostat behavior for Msn2 or Msn4 remains unchanged.

With these data, the msn4 mutant has a non-responsive Sip18 after 30 minutes, yet responsive at 60 minutes. Previous data from the \u03c0 (Hao &amp; O'Shea 2012, Supplementary Figure 12) suggests Sip18 does respond and climb steadily in this strain, albeit more weakly/slowly. Is it possible then that the msn4 mutant kinetics of Sip18 (and other \"slow\" targets) is simply slower/weaker, rather than qualitatively different (\"AND\" gate becoming an \"OR\" gate at prolonged inputs, as suggested by the authors)?

In addition, to further examine the generality of distinct regulatory functions of Msn2 and Msn4, we analyzed gene expression under the mutated P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i> promoter P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i>-A4 (a slow promoter becomes a fast promoter; Hansen and O\u2019Shea 2015) and the P<i><sub>DCS2</sub></i> promoter in cells lacking the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex <i>(snf6\u25b3</i>) (a fast promoter becomes a slow promoter; Hansen and O\u2019Shea 2013). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C and D</a>, P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i>-A4 behaviors similar to P<i><sub>DCS2</sub></i>; P<i><sub>DCS2</sub></i> in <i>snf6\u25b3</i> shows a similar response to that of P<i><sub>SIP18</sub></i>. In summary, these results suggest that the distinct regulatory functions of Msn2 and Msn4 might depend more generally on the kinetics of promoter activation, but not on specific target promoters."

With these data, the msn4 mutant has a non-responsive Sip18 after 30 minutes, yet responsive at 60 minutes. Previous data from the \u03c0 (Hao &amp; O'Shea 2012, Supplementary Figure 12) suggests Sip18 does respond and climb steadily in this strain, albeit more weakly/slowly.
