In contrast, here we show in a mouse knockout study that Mdm2-binding ribosomal protein S27-like (Rps27l), upon disruption, activates p53.  Germline inactivation of <i>Rps27l</i> triggers ribosomal stress to stabilize Mdm2, which degrades Mdm4 to reduce Mdm2-Mdm4 E3 ligase towards p53, leading to p53-dependent apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and postnatal death, which is rescued by <i>Trp53</i> deletion.  Paradoxically, while increased p53 is expected to inhibit tumorigenesis, <i>Rps27l<sup>-/-</sup>;Trp53<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice develop lymphomas at higher incidence with p53 loss-of-heterozygosity and severe genome aneuploidy, suggesting that <i>Rps27l</i> disruption impose a selection pressure against p53. Thus, Rps27l has dual functions in p53 regulation: under <i>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup></i> background, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption triggers ribosomal stress to induce p53 and apoptosis, whereas under <i>Trp53<sup>+/-</sup></i> background, <i>Rps27l</i> disruption triggers genomic instability and <i>Trp53</i> deletion to promote tumorigenesis.
