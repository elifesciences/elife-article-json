This results in underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis. This finding is extremely exciting as it represents the very first example of this particular class of neural birth defect to be observed in humans."

Mutant mice in which the Isthmic Organizer cannot express Fgf8 at all do not survive post-natally (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chi et al., 2003</a>). However, reduced Fgf8 signalling or a failure to maintain Fgf8 expression does not result in animal death, but rather causes cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Basson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Sato and Joyner, 2009</a>). The genetic regulatory network that leads to the formation of the Isthmic Organizer is highly conserved across vertebrates, and beyond (<a href=\"#bib9\">Robertshaw and Kiecker, 2012</a>), and it has long been postulated that disruption of the Isthmic Organizer must, therefore, be a cause of human cerebellar malformation. However, until now, this classical developmental phenotype had not been recognized in human patients."

Together, these disorders are relatively common, occurring roughly once in every 3000 live births. Cerebellar malformations can occur in isolation or as part of a broader malformation syndrome involving multiple systems. Although several cerebellar malformation genes have been identified, no gene directly involved in the formation or function of the Isthmic Organizer had previously been implicated in this class of birth defect, suggesting that Isthmic Organizer disorders might not be compatible with survival in humans."

They confirm multiple cerebellar abnormalities in 55% of these patients, with 25% of the patients having cerebellar vermis hypoplasia."

Mice lacking one working copy of the gene did not have any obvious cerebellar phenotype, but cerebellar vermis hypoplasia was evident when one copy of the <i>Fgf8</i> gene was also removed, suggesting genetic synergy between <i>Chd7</i> and <i>Fgf8</i>. Expression of <i>Fgf8</i> and its downstream gene <i>Etv5</i> were significantly down regulated at the junction of the midbrain and the hindbrain during the early development of <i>Chd7</i> mutant mice. Thus, reduced Fgf8 expression represents an underlying cause of CHARGE-related vermis hypoplasia because cerebellar development is exquisitely sensitive to the level of Fgf8 signalling."

Further, the work of Basson, Yu and co-workers suggests that Isthmic Organizer disruption may be a more common cause of human cerebellar malformation than previously thought. Although complete loss-of-function mutations in genes that are central to the formation of the Isthmic Organizer (such as <i>Otx2</i>, <i>Gbx2</i> and <i>Fgf8</i>) are still likely to be incompatible with human life, this study implies that genes which regulate the expression of central Isthmic Organizer genes may cause cerebellar malformation when mutated."

A difficult question remains as to how CHD7 achieves different functions in different tissues. For example although loss of <i>Chd7</i> disrupts Isthmic Organizer <i>Fgf8</i> expression, <i>Fgf8</i> expression is normal in the adjacent pharyngeal arches of the embryo. One possibility is that Cdh7 has different binding partners in different tissues."

One exciting prediction of this finding in combination with the work of Yu et al. on CHD7, is that systematic analysis of cerebellar morphology may uncover previously unrecognized cerebellar deficits related to Isthmic Organizer function in a wide range of other human birth defect syndromes."
