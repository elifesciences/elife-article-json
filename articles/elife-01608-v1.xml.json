Two important results emerged. First, the gut-associated <i>P. copri</i> entities in the controls were not exactly the same as those present in the recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients. Second, significant differences were observed between the metagenomes (the inventory of genes) of the two cohorts\u2014with the recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis patients showing relatively few genes for enzymes that metabolize vitamins and purines, and relatively many genes for enzymes that metabolize cysteine. While the functional relevance of these differences remains unexplored, they may prove to be useful biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis."

The mice also showed a reduced level of <i>Bacteroides</i> (and a few other species), analogous to the findings in the human cohorts. When the <i>P. copri</i>-colonized mice were challenged with dextran sulfate sodium, a model for inflammatory bowel disease, they exhibited more severe inflammation of the colon than did control animals."

Several lines of investigation now beg pursuit. One critical avenue of study will be to determine whether the association between <i>P. copri</i> and rheumatoid arthritis reflects cause, effect or co-association. The fact that the recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis patients alone exhibited high circulating levels of C-reactive protein (a marker of systemic inflammation) raises the possibility that the observed microbiota differences reflect a subclinical inflammatory response, perhaps an immediate precursor of clinical rheumatoid arthritis. More generally, any effects of the disease itself\u2014or of the drugs used to treat the disease\u2014on the microbiota need to be assessed. In humans, certain members of the HLA family of immune-related genes are known to increase the risk of rheumatoid arthritis. The observation that recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis patients with an excess of <i>P. copri</i> were less likely to possess some of these risk alleles raises the question of to what extent the association between <i>P. copri</i> and rheumatoid arthritis reflects a shared dependence on the HLA locus. Indeed, when human alleles associated with susceptibility or resistance to arthritis were introduced into mice, they had a profound impact on the faecal microbiota, as well as influencing gut permeability and certain populations of intestinal immune cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Gomez et al., 2012</a>)."
