The elongation cycle requires dramatic structural rearrangements of the ribosome. We show here that deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments reveals not only the position of each ribosome but also, unexpectedly, its particular stage of the elongation cycle. Sequencing reveals two distinct populations of ribosome footprints, 28\u201330 nucleotides and 20\u201322 nucleotides long, representing translating ribosomes in distinct states, differentially stabilized by specific elongation inhibitors. We find that the balance of small and large footprints varies by codon and is correlated with translation speed. The ability to visualize conformational changes in the ribosome during elongation, at single-codon resolution, provides a new way to study the detailed kinetics of translation and a new probe with which to identify the factors that affect each step in the elongation cycle."

The elongation cycle requires dramatic structural rearrangements of the ribosome. We show here that deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments reveals not only the position of each ribosome but also, unexpectedly, its particular stage of the elongation cycle. Sequencing reveals two distinct populations of ribosome footprints, 28\u201330 nucleotides and 20\u201322 nucleotides long, representing translating ribosomes in distinct states, differentially stabilized by specific elongation inhibitors. We find that the balance of small and large footprints varies by codon and is correlated with translation speed. The ability to visualize conformational changes in the ribosome during elongation, at single-codon resolution, provides a new way to study the detailed kinetics of translation and a new probe with which to identify the factors that affect each step in the elongation cycle."

During the initial decoding step of elongation, aminoacylated tRNAs are delivered to the decoding site (A site) as part of a ternary complex with EF-Tu (in prokaryotes) or the orthologous eEF1A (in eukaryotes). When the anticodon of one of these aminoacylated tRNAs is able to base-pair stably with the specific mRNA codon in the decoding site (A site), a new peptide bond is formed between the nascent polypeptide and the specified amino acid. The ribosome then undergoes a massive rearrangement in which the ribosomal subunits rotate relative to each other (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frank and Agrawal, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Along with this rotation, the A and P site tRNAs move from \u2018classic\u2019 to \u2018hybrid\u2019 states: the anticodon ends stay in their original A and P sites and the acceptor ends move to the P and E sites (<a href=\"#bib26\">Moazed and Noller, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Munro et al., 2007</a>). This rotated state of the ribosome undergoes additional conformational changes in preparation for translocation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fu et al., 2011</a>). The ribosome can fluctuate between rotated and non-rotated states until EF-G (eEF2 in eukaryotes) binds and stabilizes the rotated ribosome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agirrezabala et al., 2008</a>). GTP hydrolysis by EF-G then promotes translocation of the mRNA along the ribosome, coupled to a large intra-subunit rotation of the 30S head (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ratje et al., 2010</a>), after which the ribosome subunits rotate back to a closed formation for the next cycle (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gao et al., 2009</a>). Structural and biochemical studies have revealed many of the atomic-level changes that allow this complicated process to occur (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pulk and Cate, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tourigny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>), and new details continue to emerge, reshaping models, raising new questions, and leaving other questions still unanswered."

Cell lysates are treated with nuclease to degrade all mRNA not physically protected by ribosomes, and the ribosome-protected fragments are extracted, sequenced, and mapped back to the genome to show ribosome positions, revealing the overall translation level of each gene as well as the distribution of ribosomes along the mRNA. Nucleotide-level precision of ribosome positions is possible because of the very consistent size of ribosome footprints in the conditions assayed. The authors of the method used a nuclease protection assay to establish that, in yeast treated with the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide, each ribosome protects a footprint of 28 nucleotides (nt), confirming earlier reports (<a href=\"#bib39\">Steitz, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wolin and Walter, 1988</a>)."

Our experiments revealed that, in the absence of cycloheximide, the small ribosome-protected fragments were abundant, consistent with an early observation of short ribosome footprints in the absence of cycloheximide (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wolin and Walter, 1988</a>). We show here that the small fragments originate from ribosomes in a conformation distinct from that previously observed in the presence of cycloheximide. The ability to discern distinct ribosomal structural states by ribosome profiling has given us insight into how codon, tRNA, and amino acid identity and translational speed relate to ribosome structure. This additional dimension of ribosome-profiling data will provide a valuable new layer of molecular and mechanistic information, at codon resolution, for future studies of translation."

By selecting fragments in this broader size range, and, importantly, by carrying out the entire procedure in the absence of cycloheximide or other inhibitors, we observed two clearly distinct, abundant populations of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (\u2018footprints\u2019), 28\u201330 nt and 20\u201322 nt long.

Although anisomycin's precise mechanism is not characterized, it has higher affinity for post-translocation ribosomes than for pre-translocation, cycloheximide-treated ribosomes, suggesting that it preferentially binds a ribosome conformation distinct from that stabilized by cycloheximide (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barbacid and Vazquez, 1974</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">1975</a>).

We treated yeast with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), an inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis, to create a specific shortage of His-acylated tRNA and cause ribosomes to pause on histidine codons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We would therefore expect ribosomes to accumulate at histidine codons in a pre-peptide-bond conformation. Estimating codon-specific occupancy as described in more detail below, we found that the shortage of His-tRNA dramatically increased the relative abundance of large footprints from ribosomes with His codons in the A site, with minimal effect on the abundance of small footprints (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The relative occupancies varied over a fivefold range, from 0.48 \u00b1 0.04 (GGU) to 2.6 \u00b1 0.67 (CCG) (unitless, average of three replicates) and were highly correlated between independent replicates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

In yeast, the number of genes encoding a specific tRNA has been shown to be highly correlated with both codon usage and cellular tRNA concentrations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Percudani et al., 1997</a>). A related measure of codon optimality is the tRNA adaptation index (tAI), which attempts to rank codons in translational efficiency by accounting for tRNA copy number, wobble pairing constraints, and codon usage (<a href=\"#bib10\">dos Reis et al., 2004</a>). We found that the relative occupancy per codon was only weakly correlated with tAI and with tRNA genomic copy number (Spearman's r = \u22120.39 and \u22120.28, respectively; average of three replicates) and that the tAI was not particularly correlated with the relative abundance of either small footprints or large footprints (r = \u22120.34 and r = \u22120.20, respectively; average of three replicates). Thus, unexpectedly, codon \u2018optimality\u2019, as represented by the tAI, does not appear to be a major determinant of relative ribosome occupancy under the conditions tested here. The 3-AT data show that in an extreme case, a limited supply of the tRNA cognate to the A-site codon slows translation during the large-footprint stage. In contrast, our overall results in untreated yeast suggest that the differences in abundance among tRNAs in wild-type cells have only a minor effect on relative ribosome occupancy of the cognate codons under optimum growth conditions."

Wobble base pairing at the A site has recently been linked with slowed elongation in humans and worms (<a href=\"#bib38\">Stadler and Fire, 2011</a>). We compared codons with perfect Watson-Crick complementarity vs the synonymous codons that pair imperfectly with the same tRNA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Johansson et al., 2008</a>). While we found no consistent trend toward increased occupancy at wobble-paired codons, we observed notably higher occupancy on a subset of wobble-paired codons comprising proline CCG (G-U base pairing), leucine CUG (G-U), and arginine CGA (A-I) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). For these three wobble codon outliers, we see a dramatic increase in short footprints, representing post-decoding stages of translation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). The arginine CGA codon is known to be a strong inhibitor of translation in yeast, and its inhibitory effect is due more to wobble decoding than tRNA abundance and may include interactions after the initial decoding (<a href=\"#bib25\">Letzring et al., 2010</a>). Our data confirm that CGA is indeed one of the most slowly translated codons, and its high relative occupancy is due to increased abundance of small footprints, suggesting that its slow elongation is primarily due to a prolonged post-decoding stage. Overall, the abundance of footprints from each step of elongation was clearly affected by several distinct codon-specific features with sometimes synergistic and sometimes opposing effects."

We were quite surprised to discover that the ribosome protects two different footprint sizes (28\u201330 nt and 20\u201322 nt), as the original ribosome-profiling experiments and nuclease protection assays only captured the longer footprints (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>). The difference is explained by the experimental conditions: the small footprints were revealed only after we left out cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor commonly used to stabilize ribosomes on mRNA for ribosome profiling. Indeed, early study of ribosome pausing found that when cycloheximide was omitted, 20\u201324 nt footprints accumulated in addition to the larger footprints they saw from cycloheximide-treated ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wolin and Walter, 1988</a>).

It is not clear which of the known conformational changes during the elongation cycle are most relevant: the inter-subunit rotation after peptide bond formation, the intra-subunit swivel of the 30S head during translocation, or smaller rearrangements such as movement of the L1 stalk."

RNAse I may be small enough to penetrate into the mRNA entrance channel and cleave the mRNA just two nucleotides from the A site. Alternately, the ribosome itself may be more susceptible to RNAse degradation in the rotated conformation, allowing ribosomal RNA cleavage that in turn enables RNAse I to access the mRNA entrance channel, yielding a smaller mRNA footprint. Importantly, however, both small and large footprints have also been observed in wheat germ extract treated with micrococcal nuclease, indicating that the two footprint sizes are neither species- nor nuclease-specific (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wolin and Walter, 1988</a>)."

Comparing our relative occupancy values to an estimated bulk elongation rate of 5.6 amino acids per second (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>), our model would predict variation in average codon elongation time from as little as 0.08 s (GGU) to as much as 0.5 s (CCG). A number of caveats apply to this interpretation, and any hypotheses must be pursued with complementary approaches. Ribosome footprint data have inherent biases from ligation and other steps of the library preparation. Further, the overall balance of small and large footprints varied between replicates, leaving open the question of which conformation is more populated in vivo. Some variability arises from the mRNA fragment isolation. In this work, we chose size markers of 18 and 32 nt, but size selection from polyacrylamide gel is imprecise. (This choice also limits what we can observe: recent work found distinct 16 nt fragments from ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNAs, <a href=\"#bib17\">Guydosh and Green, 2014</a>.) The size distribution may also reflect differential efficiency of library preparation from smaller or larger fragments. Nonetheless, although the overall ratio of small to large footprints varied, the codon-specific variation in this ratio was robust."

Ribosomes are depleted from the first 50 codons when yeast are harvested by the procedure we used without inhibitors. We interpret this as evidence that elongation continues for around 10 s after initiation ceases during the harvest process. Because the selective depletion of ribosomes from this part of the mRNA could enrich for special cases, we excluded the first 50 codons from our analysis of per-codon footprint distributions. Different harvest methods had large effects on the precise footprint locations even when the overall translation per gene was highly reproducible (data not shown). Similarly, the average occupancies per codon with and without cycloheximide were surprisingly uncorrelated (Spearman's r = 0.02, comparing the average of three untreated samples and the average of two cycloheximide-treated samples), though the total footprints per gene correlated quite well (Spearman's r = 0.97 between the average fpkm in three untreated samples and the average fpkm in two cycloheximide-treated samples). Ribosomes in different positions may be differentially affected either by the drug treatment or by runoff elongation during harvest without inhibitors.

For example, interactions between the tRNA anticodon and the mRNA codon, the tRNAs and the ribosome, the amino acids and the peptidyl transferase center, and the nascent peptide and the tunnel, as the tRNAs move through the A, P, and E sites, can all presumably affect the speed of each step.

While this affinity tuning is a plausible result of selection for fidelity in decoding, ribosome profiling has revealed a lack of uniformity both in decoding and post-decoding steps. Once the interactions that determine the codon-specific rate of decoding are decoupled and replaced by a new set of codon-specific interactions in the subsequent steps of elongation, the great diversity in physical properties of amino acids and in the intrinsic stability of the codon\u2013anticodon interaction may lead to wide variation in the kinetics of post-decoding steps."

The data presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> are consistent with an interpretation that the short fragments are truncated at their 3' (rather than their 5') ends. That, taken together with the antibiotic and 3-AT data, makes for a strong overall conclusion. However, the figures are extremely confusing and fail to clearly convey this interpretation. While the 3D presentation of data in 2A is helpful, the authors failed to include a z-axis scale to calibrate the varied levels of shading. Also, they should have \u201cprojected\u201d the data from short and long fragment distributions onto two more standard \u201cmetagene\u201d style plots above of graph (much like 2C serves as a horizontal projection) since that is what most people have become familiar with in understanding this sort of data."

For example, why do all reads in between the 28- and 20-nt peaks seem to derive from a region around the start codon? In the plot, this appears as a diagonal line extending from (-12,28) on the plot to (0,15). Perhaps this could be addressed? Ideally, the authors would have done some kind of an RNase protection assay in vitro, possibly with multiple nucleases, to establish the certainty of their results. In the end, the authors are arguing that the alternative conformation of the ribosome is hyper-susceptible to RNase cleavage, thus revealing the mRNA to the nucleases in a way that is surprising given what we know about ribosome structure. So the clearer this section is the better. In addition, perhaps it would help to emphasize earlier and more emphatically that Walter et al. saw these fragments long ago in his in vitro experiments."

For example, it has been suggested that CHX treatment leads to high occupancy at start codons as initiation of ribosomes continues despite the inability of the ribosome to move away from the start codon (Ingolia et al., Nature Protocols 2012). Therefore, the authors should be more cautious in interpreting a selective enrichment of small fragments at start codons in CHX-treated yeast. At the least, the authors should have performed replicate experiments to verify that slight variation in sample preparation isn't leading to this effect. Similarly, the effects at stop codons, while intriguing, ought to be taken with a grain of salt because of widespread variation in the level of previously reported stop codon occupancy. Unlike the data reported here, higher than average occupancy at stop codons was shown in wild-type cells in Ingolia et al. Cell 2011, Liu et al. Cell 2013, and Lee et al. PNAS 2012. The authors' own experiments seem to suggest that this variability may be sometimes derived from differences in preparation (they show that variation in cell freezing rate can dramatically affect occupancy at stop codons).

Are the 20mers more abundant than 28mers because they are more efficiently turned into cDNA? Does codon identity introduce different bias to 20mer preparation vs 28mer preparation? While the systematic effect of amino acid polarity for various codons would suggest biases are not important here, it would be ideal if the authors had prepared mRNA-Seq libraries that consisted of fragments of 20- and 28-nt in size to get a handle on the bias.

Ideally, the authors would have done some kind of an RNase protection assay in vitro, possibly with multiple nucleases, to establish the certainty of their results.

Are the 20mers more abundant than 28mers because they are more efficiently turned into cDNA? Does codon identity introduce different bias to 20mer preparation vs 28mer preparation? While the systematic effect of amino acid polarity for various codons would suggest biases are not important here, it would be ideal if the authors had prepared mRNA-Seq libraries that consisted of fragments of 20- and 28-nt in size to get a handle on the bias.
