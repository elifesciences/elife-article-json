                    "text": "Kisspeptin (Kiss1) and neurokinin B (NKB) neurocircuits are essential for pubertal development and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin and glutamate and are postulated to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH) neurons, the synaptic mechanisms of which are unknown. We characterized the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal activity using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR in mice. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons evoked local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which were found to synchronize the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons by a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. We propose that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons play a dual role of driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function."

Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin and glutamate and are postulated to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH) neurons, the synaptic mechanisms of which are unknown. We characterized the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal activity using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR in mice. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons evoked local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which were found to synchronize the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons by a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. We propose that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons play a dual role of driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function."

Two populations of neurons within the hypothalamus produce a peptide molecule called Kisspeptin and drive the activity and subsequent release of GnRH. One population resides in an area called the arcuate nucleus and the other in the preoptic nucleus. Recent findings suggest that the arcuate nucleus is the \u201cpulse generator\u201d responsible for triggering the rhythmic release of GnRH by the hypothalamus, whereas the preoptic nucleus induces the surge of GnRH.

Qiu, Nestor et al. introduced a light-sensitive protein into the kisspeptin-producing neurons on one side of the arcuate nucleus, and then used light to activate those neurons.

The hypothalamus then translates this coordinated activity into pulses of GnRH release. The light-induced stimulation also triggered the release of glutamate, which caused kisspeptin neurons within the preoptic nucleus to fire in bursts. This in turn robustly excited the GnRH neurons, giving rise to the surge of GnRH."

The \u201cGnRH pulse generator\u201d consists of bursts of multiunit activity (MUA) in the arcuate nucleus that are timed with pulses of LH secretion, and this phenomenon has been demonstrated in the monkey (<a href=\"#bib24\">Knobil, 1989</a>), goat (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wakabayashi et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">Okamura et al., 2013</a>), and rat (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kimura et al., 1991</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib23\">Kinsey-Jones et al., 2008</a>). In mammals, two major populations of kisspeptin-synthesizing neurons exist - one in the anterior preoptic area and the other in the ARH (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lehman et al., 2010b</a>). In rodents, the anterior preoptic cell group is a periventricular continuum within the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and the periventricular preoptic nucleus (PeN) and is responsible for the GnRH/LH surge (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clarkson and Herbison, 2006</a>)."

These neurons were confirmed to express Kiss1 mRNA based on scRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). High fidelity responses to light (470 nm) were measured as evoked inward currents in voltage clamp (V<sub>hold</sub> = -60 mV) or depolarizations in current clamp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). A 10-s photostimulation at 1 or 5\u2009Hz had no lasting effect on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuron activity; however, with 10\u2009Hz stimulation there was a prominent depolarization of ~10 mV that peaked about a minute later, and it was accompanied by a train of action potentials during that time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We also varied the duration of photostimulation at 20\u2009Hz, which revealed that 1\u2009s was ineffective but with 5 or 10\u2009s of stimulation there was again a prominent depolarization accompanied by a barrage of action potentials that continued for about a minute after stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).The results from varying frequency and/or duration of photostimulation revealed that a maximum depolarization of 22 \u00b1 1.4 mV was obtained with a 10\u2009s stimulation at 20\u2009Hz (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). We refer to this depolarization as a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). To determine whether the slow EPSP is a unique property of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, we also tested the AVPV/PeN population of Kiss1 neurons with 10-s stimulation at 20\u2009Hz (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>); these neurons had a transient hyperpolarization after stimulation and a return to continuous firing ~30\u2009s after the stimulation. The depolarization of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons was also distinct from POMC and AgRP/NPY neurons in the ARH, even though they are probably all derived from a common precursor (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sanz et al., 2015</a>). The relatively quiescent POMC neurons fired action potentials during the 10-s, 20-Hz stimulation and exhibited a prolonged hyperpolarization afterwards (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>); whereas the spontaneously active AgRP neurons exhibited a brief pause in firing in conjunction with a slight hyperpolarization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). Thus, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are unique among the neurons tested in the generation of the slow EPSP. Given that the expression of Kiss1, dynorphin, NKB and Tacr3 are all down-regulated in kisspeptin neurons by E2-treatment (<a href=\"#bib51\">Smith et al., 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib14\">Gottsch et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib32\">Navarro et al., 2011a</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">Ruiz-Pino et al., 2012</a>), we asked the question whether the slow EPSP would also be reduced by E2 or even vary during the ovulatory cycle. The slow EPSP was induced in slices obtained from diestrous or proestrous animals or OVX females treated with either oil vehicle or E2. The slow EPSP was the most robust in OVX females (13.8 \u00b1 1.6 mV, n= 17), which was to be expected if this current was peptidergic in nature\u2014i.e., correlates with the up-regulation of NKB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). Moreover,\u00a0in vivo E2 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the slow EPSP amplitude (4.8 \u00b1 1.1 mV, n = 9, p&lt;0.001). Importantly, the slow EPSP was also of greater magnitude in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>neurons from diestrous animals (9.2 \u00b1 1.1 mV, n=14) and significantly reduced in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons from proestrous animals (3.3 \u00b1 0.8 mV, n=15, p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>)."

We could rescue TTX blockade of the light-induced response with the addition of K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 0.5\u2009mM) and tetraethylammonium (TEA, 7.5\u2009mM) to facilitate ChR2- mediated depolarization of nerve terminals and neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cousin and Robinson, 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib38\">Petreanu et al., 2009</a>), arguing that the response is dependent on direct pre-synaptic input from neighboring Kiss1 neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a>). Although the majority of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cravo et al., 2011</a>), release glutamate locally in ARH (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nestor et al., 2016</a>) and the fast EPSP was blocked by CNQX (10 \u00b5M) and AP5 (50 \u00b5M), the slow EPSP was unaffected by these ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Action potentials were abrogated by dialyzing Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons with the Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker QX314 (0.5\u2009mM in the internal solution) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Isaac and Wheal, 1993</a>). The expression of the slow EPSP was reduced but not blocked by QX314 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,E</a>). The reduction in the amplitude of the slow EPSP was probably due to QX314 suppression of calcium currents in the Kiss1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hu et al., 2002</a>). Moreover, postsynaptic electrical stimulation (20\u2009Hz, 10\u2009s) of individual neurons, even in the presence of 4-AP and TEA, did not mimic the light-induced EPSP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,E</a>), suggesting that the response was not dependent on the generation of action potentials in the cell soma."

As expected, these injections labeled mCherry-positive (Kiss1) cells and fibers ipsilaterally, but only mCherry-positive fibers in the contralateral ARH (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In addition to the ChR2:mCherry labeling ipsilaterally, control AAV-DIO-YFP was injected into the contralateral ARH in order to identify Kiss1 neurons for whole cell recordings (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>). With low-frequency photostimulation of the ChR2 fibers in the contralateral ARH (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013G</a>), we detected a glutamatergic fast EPSC in voltage clamp (22.9 \u00b1 8.3\u2009pA, n=6) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a><b>, upper trace</b>) and with high-frequency stimulation a peptidergic slow EPSP in current clamp (19.2 \u00b1 4.1 mV, n\u00a0=\u00a06) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, <b>lower trace</b>). There was no ChR2-mediated inward current and/or depolarization with photostimulation. The slow EPSP was blocked by TTX and rescued by TTX plus 4-AP and TEA, demonstrating direct communication between Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons on both sides (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Similar to the recordings in ipsilateral ChR2-expressing Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, the Tacr3 antagonist SB222,200 (3 \u00b5M) blocked the optogenetic response (reduced R2/R1 by 75% from 0.64 \u00b1 0.06, n\u00a0=\u00a04 to 0.16 \u00b1 0.04, n = 5; Un-paired t-test, t(7)\u00a0=\u00a07.193, ****p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Moreover, with dual patch recording we were able to simultaneously depolarize and excite the contralateral Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (n = 2 pair of neurons) following photostimulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). To ensure that the response was due to activation of the axonal terminal field of ChR2-projecting Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, we acutely cut the median eminence to isolate the contralateral Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, which did not express ChR2, and found that high-frequency photostimulation of the ChR2-expressing terminal field simultaneously depolarized and increased the firing of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (n = 3 pair of neurons) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013F</a>). Thus, high-frequency autoexcitation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons ipsilaterally is able to recruit Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons bilaterally to induce synchronization of this critical neural network."

Currently, we tested whether pharmacological activation of Tacr3 within Kiss1-GnRH circuits would directly and/or indirectly excite GnRH neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A<a href=\"#fig9\">,C</a></a>). The Tacr3 agonist senktide robustly excited GnRH neurons in the horizontal slice which included both ARH kisspeptin and the preoptic GnRH neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,<a href=\"#fig9\">B</a></a>), but not in the coronal slice in which the ARH kisspeptin neurons were separated from the preoptic (rostral) GnRH neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C<a href=\"#fig9\">,D</a></a>). As expected, kisspeptin excited GnRH neurons irrespective of slice orientation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B<a href=\"#fig9\">,D</a></a>). Therefore, NKB/Tacr3 signaling is upstream from kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling, and activation of kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling via Tacr3 stimulation results in excitation of GnRH neurons."

                                "text": "Given that Tacr3 is essentially not expressed in GnRH or in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, and Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons do not respond to kisspeptin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Navarro et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Ducret et al., 2010</a>), the question became how does activation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons excite GnRH neurons? A recent study has shown that mouse Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons project to Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yip et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, we recorded light-evoked EPSCs in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons (33.2 \u00b1 9.7\u2009pA, n\u00a0=\u00a05) following photostimulation of fibers from ChR2-mCherry or from ChR2-YFP expressing Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013D</a>). The fast EPSC was blocked with CNQX (10\u2009\u03bcM) and D-AP5 (50\u2009\u03bcM), documenting a glutamatergic input from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons to Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN\u00a0</sup>neurons (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). Furthermore, we bilaterally injected ChR2:mCherry-expressing viral vector into the AVPV/PeN of Kiss1-Cre::GnRH-EGFP female mice. The anterograde transport revealed close contacts with GnRH cell bodies in the mPOA (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A, B1\u20133</a>). Viral-labeled Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons also revealed projections caudally to the ARH (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B4</a>). High-frequency photostimulation of the Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons evoked a slow EPSP in GnRH neurons in both parahorizontal (8.0 \u00b1 2.9 mV, n\u00a0=\u00a04) (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C\u2013E</a>) and coronal slices (15.6 \u00b1 4.8 mV, n = 4) (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11F\u2013H</a>). The slow EPSP was mediated by the\u00a0kisspeptin release from Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>neurons based on the double rectifying, dual reversal potential I/V (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) and occlusion of the response by the partial agonist peptide 234 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2011</a>), which blocked the evoked kisspeptin response by 85% (from 15.6 \u00b1 4.8 mV to 2.4 \u00b1 0.9 mV, n = 4) in coronal slices (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11H</a>). Finally, we harvested Kiss1 <sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons and measured <i>Slc17a6</i> (vGluT2) mRNA expression using scRT-PCR. Based on the analysis of 71 Kiss1 neurons from 3 females (23\u201324 cells/ animal), only 2 cells (2.9% ) were found to express <i>Slc17a6</i> mRNA, an indication that glutamate is not packaged into vesicles and released by Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons."

The slow EPSP was abolished with Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker TTX treatment but rescued by the addition of K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, which is physiological evidence for Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> synaptic contacts on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Furthermore, the slow EPSP was attenuated by the Tacr3 antagonist SB222,200 and occluded by the Tacr3 agonist senktide pretreatment, demonstrating that the slow EPSP was mediated by the Gq-coupled Tacr3. In addition, the \u03ba-opioid receptor agonist U69,593 markedly attenuated the slow EPSP, whereas the selective \u03ba-antagonist nor-BNI enhanced the ChR2-evoked slow EPSP, indicative of \u03ba-opioid receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of NKB release. As demonstrated with dual whole-cell recordings, there was a simultaneous activation and recruitment of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons bilaterally to provide a synchronous drive to GnRH neurons. Finally, in horizontal but not the coronal hypothalamic slices, the Tacr3 agonist senktide indirectly excited GnRH neurons, and high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons depolarized/excited GnRH neurons via a multisynaptic pathway that involved glutamatergic excitation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, which excited GnRH neurons via kisspeptin release."

Indeed, high-frequency photostimulation of ChR2-expressing Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons elicited postsynaptic responses in neighboring Kiss1 neurons that entrained to stimulation frequencies up to 20\u2009Hz. We observed a slowly developing depolarization over tens of seconds that was unaffected by ionotropic glutamate receptor blockade, but was antagonized by a Tacr3 antagonist. <a href=\"#bib47\">Sch\u00f6ne et al.

Therefore, in both kisspeptin and histamine neurons there is glutamate-dependent (low-frequency) and peptide-dependent (high-frequency) release that transmit distinct postsynaptic excitatory effects; but in the case of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, it is a recurrent auto-excitation that allows recruitment of neighboring Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons for synchronizing firing."

                        "text": "Also unique to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons is that high-frequency stimulation co-released dynorphin, which modulated the NKB-Tacr3 response. Dynorphin is co-localized in the vast majority of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Navarro et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Lehman et al., 2010a</a>), and loose-cell attached recordings have shown that dynorphin and \u03ba-opioid receptor agonist U69,593 inhibit the activity of spontaneously firing Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, although it has not been established whether this was a postsynaptic or presynaptic action on excitatory input to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">de Croft et al., 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib44\">Ruka et al., 2013</a>). In our studies, dynorphin appeared to be co-released with high-frequency stimulation based on the fact that the slow EPSP evoked by high-frequency photostimulation was augmented with \u03ba-opioid receptor antagonism (nor-BNI treatment), and abrogated by the \u03ba-agonist U69,593. Moreover, although the \u03ba-opioid receptor agonist U69,593 directly inhibits Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via activating G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), we did not see a similar direct response in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. However, the \u03ba-agonist U69,593 did reduce the frequency of miniature EPSCs in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Therefore, co-released dynorphin most likely acts presynaptically to modulate NKB release. This is analogous to the co-release of dynorphin from vasopressin neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iremonger and Bains, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Iremonger et al., 2011</a>) in which it is co-packaged in the same dense core vesicles (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shuster et al., 2000</a>). However, kisspeptin, NKB and dynorphin are packaged in separate vesicles as documented by electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib30\">Murakawa et al., 2015</a>) so there must be a coordinated co-release of the segregated peptide neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vaaga et al., 2014</a>) from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Once released, dynorphin can inhibit synaptic vesicle mobilization/release via inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rusin et al., 1997</a>), activating K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Simmons and Chavkin, 1996</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib58\">Vaughan and Christie, 1997</a>) or directly inhibiting the presynaptic release machinery (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iremonger and Bains, 2009</a>). Presently, we do not know which one of the three mechanisms mediates the \u03ba-opioid receptor-mediated actions on the presynaptic Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> terminals, but it is clear that co-released dynorphin feeds back to modulate NKB release."

Moreover, morphological tract-tracing studies have shown that ARH NKB neurons, some of which are presumed to be Kiss1 neurons, are bilaterally interconnected, and NKB axons cross in the internal zone of the median eminence and project to the contralateral ARH (<a href=\"#bib25\">Krajewski et al., 2010</a>). However, a direct synaptic connection between Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons has not been demonstrated. Herein, we show that ChR2:mCherry-labeled fibers cross over to the opposite side, and both a fast EPSC and a slow synaptic response (slow EPSP) were evoked with low- and high-frequency photostimulation, respectively, in the contralateral Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. In fact, dual patch recording revealed simultaneous activation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Importantly, the contralateral Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons did not exhibit a direct ChR2 response thus confirming the confocal analysis that only ChR2 expressing fibers (axons) and control YFP expressing cell bodies were detected on the contralateral side of the ARH. Moreover, the slow EPSP was blocked by Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker TTX and rescued with the addition of K<sup>+</sup> blockers, which allowed robust depolarization of nerve terminals with photoactivation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cousin and Robinson, 2000</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib38\">Petreanu et al., 2009</a>), and in our studies release of NKB. Therefore, it appears that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are contacted by other Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> nerve terminals, and the activation of the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>  network is dependent on action potential-driven synaptic release of NKB. Moreover, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> fibers crossing within the median eminence allow for synaptic communication between the arcuate nuclei for recruiting bilaterally additional Kiss1 neurons to generate a robust excitatory drive to GnRH neurons."

Given that essentially all Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, but not Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> or GnRH neurons, express Tacr3 mRNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Navarro et al., 2011b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Navarro et al., 2015</a>) and Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons do not respond directly to kisspeptin (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ducret et al., 2010</a>), we applied senktide to activate Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and record changes in GnRH cell activity. Senktide induced robust firing in GnRH neurons in horizontal slices that included the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, but not in coronal slices excluding these neurons. These physiological findings support previous neuroanatomical tract tracing/immunocytochemical studies in mice showing that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons project to AVPV/PeN (Kiss1) neurons but not to GnRH somata in the preoptic area (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yip et al., 2015</a>). In addition, photoactivation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons excited Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via glutamate, which we have shown generates burst firing in these neurons (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), and transsynaptically depolarized and excited GnRH neurons via kisspeptin activation of GPR54 and the\u00a0opening of TRPC channels in a horizontal slice preparation that preserved all of the interconnections. These results are summarized in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>. Therefore, our findings provide the first evidence that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons can synchronize via NKB/Dyn auto-excitation/inhibition to provide an excitatory drive (via Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons) to GnRH neurons for stimulating GnRH neuronal activity and subsequent GnRH release. This does not preclude the fact that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also project to the median eminence (<a href=\"#bib55\">True et al., 2010</a>) and may stimulate pulsatile release of GnRH in the ovariectomized state (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yip et al., 2015</a>). Hence, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons probably play a dual role of driving pulsatile (episodic) secretion of GnRH through kisspeptin release into the external zone of the median eminence, but also excite Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via glutamate release to help generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH through a robust di-synaptic pathway (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). What is intriguing is the possibility that the\u00a0differential release of amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters (segregated co-transmission) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vaaga et al., 2014</a>) occurs at these different release sites (ARH, median eminence, and AVPV/PeN) to coordinate reproductive function."

Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons also communicate with the Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via the fast neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons.

It is well known that OVX animals exhibit increased GnRH and LH pulsatile secretion that coincide with increased expression of neuropeptides (including kisspeptin, neurokinin B and dynorphin) in ARH Kiss1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Caraty et al., 1989</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib51\">Smith et al., 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib11\">Dellovade and Merchenthaler, 2004</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib14\">Gottsch et al., 2009</a>). Since we were interested in determining the cellular mechanism by which ARH Kiss1 neurons synchronize to induce pulsatile GnRH and LH secretion, as well as determining the stimulus needed for peptide release, we primarily used OVX females for these experiments. However, we also used intact females at different stages of the estrous cycle in order to compare the magnitude of the high-frequency response from these animals to the response in OVX females (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). For studies involving AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons and GnRH neurons, we used OVX females treated with E2 as a model for the proestrous stage of the cycle (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib61\">2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib42\">R\u00f8nnekleiv et al., 2015</a>)."

Also in some experiments, angled parahorizontal brain slices were cut as previously described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2011</a>), and the vibratome blade was positioned to just touch the optic chiasm and a single 400 \u00b5m-thick horizontal slice prepared. Whole-cell, patch recordings were performed in voltage clamp and current clamp using an Olympus BX51W1 upright microscope equipped with video-enhanced, infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) and an Exfo X-Cite 120 Series fluorescence light source. Electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (1.5\u2009mm outer diameter; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and filled with a normal internal solution (in mM): 128 potassium gluconate, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 ATP, and 0.25 GTP (pH was adjusted to 7.3\u20137.4 with 1N KOH, 290\u2013300 mOsm). Pipette resistances ranged from 3\u20135 M\u03a9. In whole cell configuration, access resistance was less than 20 M\u03a9; access resistance was 80% compensated. For optogenetic stimulation, a light-induced response was evoked using a light-emitting diode (LED) 470 nm blue light source controlled by a variable 2A driver (ThorLabs, Newton, NJ) with the light path delivered directly through an Olympus 40\u00a0\u00d7 water-immersion lens. High fidelity response to light (470 nm) stimulation of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> ChR2-expressing neurons was observed, and both evoked inward currents (in voltage clamp, V<sub>hold</sub> = \u221260 mV) or depolarization (in current clamp) were measured (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). Electrophysiological signals were amplified with an Axopatch 200A and digitized with Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA), and the data were analyzed using p-Clamp software (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323\">SCR_011323</a>, version 9.2, Molecular Devices). A MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA) was used for the dual patch recording, and the signals were similarly digitized and analyzed. The amplitude of the slow EPSP was measured after low pass filtering in order to eliminate the barrage of action potentials riding on the depolarization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The liquid junction potential was corrected for all data analysis."

In the intervening 38 years, there has been no clear answer about how this is generated. The discovery of kisspeptin peptide (Kiss1) led to the hypothesis that these neurons might be a clue to the pulsatile production of GnRH1. The authors provide a clear and balanced view of the progress in understanding (or lack thereof) and used a collection of techniques to suggest a putative microcircuitry underlying the Kiss1/GnRH regulation. In rodents, Kiss 1 neurons are interconnected in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARH) and project GnRH1 terminals in the median eminence. The essential finding is that high frequency photoactivation of Kiss1 neurons in the ARH induced a NKB-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential, causing synchronization of Kiss1 neurons that in turn excites GnRH neurons. The results are interesting and significant because the many optogenetic experiments carried out in peptidergic neurons have not generally revealed peptide release."
