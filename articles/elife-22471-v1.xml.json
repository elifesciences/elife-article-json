The NIH helped make the US a global magnet for talented researchers, fueled the growth of great research universities and is also indirectly responsible for the strength of the American biotech and pharmaceutical industries. However, the NIH and the US biomedical research enterprise now have a serious problem: there are too many researchers and institutions chasing after too few dollars. Some hope that consistent NIH budget growth can solve or at least seriously ameliorate this problem. However, it seems unlikely that increases in the NIH budget will suffice; major reforms are also needed."

Although there have been some changes such as the addition of new institutes, the NIH is quite similar to when I began graduate school 50 years ago, in September 1966.

Indeed, the importance of model organisms (fruit flies, nematodes, tetrahymena, mice and so on) to human health and disease was not well-appreciated by the medical community until the 1980s. This is when recombinant DNA technology enabled cloning, sequencing and genetic rescue experiments. Such\u00a0work showed that all eukaryotes, indeed all life forms, use similar mechanisms. Although Darwin drew many of these same connections, the extent to which basic processes remain unchanged is mind-boggling. In my own field, work on fruit fly circadian rhythms identified genes and mechanisms that turned out to function almost identically in humans. There have been parallel changes in clinical medicine, with the approaches taken to different diseases being much more integrated today than they were in the past."

Ecology and evolution departments have undergone fusion or fission while incorporating new disciplines like population genetics. Many medical school departments of anatomy have closed or become cell biology departments, often with a substantial structural biology component. The key point is that these (and other) organizational changes make sense in light of what we have learned over the last 50 years. Moreover, all this change has been accompanied by an explosive increase in the size of the biomedical research community around the world."

Yet many researchers believe that human health writ large will benefit in the long run from less top-down direction. When the time is right for translational research, applications will emerge naturally from the bottom-up R01 mechanism that is used to fund most investigator-initiated applications. Top-down translational research and contract work should be left to biotech, big pharma, philanthropy and other non-federal funding sources."

Although other institutes also fund basic science, there is a lack of coherence, and some institutes often conflate disease focus and basic science goals. I suggest that most support for basic science be shifted to NIGMS (or to a new \"super-institute\" focused on top-flight basic science). To this end, each institute should transfer a fraction of its budget to NIGMS (or the new super-institute) over the next 10 years. As an extreme example, if this budget distribution were to change by 5% a year, in a decade 50% of total NIH dollars would fund basic research through a single institute. Independent of the amount and the mechanism, the NIH needs to increase its support for basic science and ensure that more of the grant applications in basic science are in direct competition with each other."

Do we need to make adjustments based on geographical distribution? If so, to what extent? For all of these reasons, the research community must engage in a serious debate about the NIH and how it allocates its money, rather than sticking with the status quo. This debate should also cover the distribution of funds between the different NIH institutes, as well as the distribution between intramural research at the NIH's own laboratories and extramural research at universities, medical schools and research institutes."

And Study Sections should be required to have a minimum percentage of established scientists at every meeting, for example at least three members with 20 years or more of NIH funding.
