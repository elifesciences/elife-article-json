The prevailing view is that MDSC-mediated immunosuppression is restricted to tissues where MDSC co-mingle with T cells. Here we show that splenic or, unexpectedly, blood-borne MDSC execute far-reaching immune suppression by reducing expression of the L-selectin lymph node (LN) homing receptor on na\u00efve T and B cells. MDSC-induced L-selectin loss occurs through a contact-dependent, post-transcriptional mechanism that is independent of the major L-selectin sheddase, ADAM17, but results in significant elevation of circulating L-selectin in tumor-bearing mice. Even moderate deficits in L-selectin expression disrupt T cell trafficking to distant LN. Furthermore, T cells preconditioned by MDSC have diminished responses to subsequent antigen exposure, which in conjunction with reduced trafficking, severely restricts antigen-driven expansion in widely-dispersed LN. These results establish novel mechanisms for MDSC-mediated immunosuppression that have unanticipated implications for systemic cancer immunity."

All of the animals were handled according to approved IACUC protocols at participating institutions (i.e., 859M and 1117M at Roswell Park Cancer Institute; SO01691417 at University of Maryland, Baltimore County; 15-16 #11 at University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee; and 1401-31272A at University of Minnesota). All surgery was performed under appropriate anesthesia and analgesia to minimize suffering and pain. The use of human PBMCs from anonymous, de-identified donors was classified as non-human subject research in accordance with federal regulations and thus not subjected to formal IRB review, but can be accessed through Roswell Park Clinical Research Services under the reference number BDR 069116."

The prevailing view is that MDSC-mediated immunosuppression is restricted to tissues where MDSC co-mingle with T cells. Here we show that splenic or, unexpectedly, blood-borne MDSC execute far-reaching immune suppression by reducing expression of the L-selectin lymph node (LN) homing receptor on na\u00efve T and B cells. MDSC-induced L-selectin loss occurs through a contact-dependent, post-transcriptional mechanism that is independent of the major L-selectin sheddase, ADAM17, but results in significant elevation of circulating L-selectin in tumor-bearing mice. Even moderate deficits in L-selectin expression disrupt T cell trafficking to distant LN. Furthermore, T cells preconditioned by MDSC have diminished responses to subsequent antigen exposure, which in conjunction with reduced trafficking, severely restricts antigen-driven expansion in widely-dispersed LN. These results establish novel mechanisms for MDSC-mediated immunosuppression that have unanticipated implications for systemic cancer immunity."

All surgery was performed under appropriate anesthesia and analgesia to minimize suffering and pain. The use of human PBMCs from anonymous, de-identified donors was classified as non-human subject research in accordance with federal regulations and thus not subjected to formal IRB review, but can be accessed through Roswell Park Clinical Research Services under the reference number BDR 069116."

MDSC have been most extensively characterized in the context of cancer where they thwart antitumor adaptive immunity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</a>). MDSC accumulate throughout cancer progression and are linked to poor clinical outcomes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Waight et al., 2013</a>) as well as resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy in murine tumor systems (<a href=\"#bib2\">Acharyya et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Xu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Alizadeh et al., 2014</a>). MDSC exert hallmark immunosuppressive activities via production of arginase, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase that locally block activation of tumor-specific T cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</a>). These immature myeloid cells further contribute to tumor immune evasion by expressing immunosuppressive molecules such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Youn et al., 2008</a>) and by supporting the function of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2006</a>) and M2 macrophages (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sinha et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beury et al., 2014</a>). Evidence that the MDSC-T cell suppressive axis is enacted by short-lived, contact-dependent mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sinha et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ostrand-Rosenberg et al., 2012</a>) supports the prevailing view that suppressive effector functions are mainly restricted to tissues where MDSC and T cells both localize."

MDSC are also abundant in the circulation of tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ostrand-Rosenberg and Sinha, 2009</a>) although it is not known if MDSC in the blood compartment mediate immunosuppression in situ. In contrast, MDSC are rare in lymph nodes (LN) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ostrand-Rosenberg and Sinha, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Garcia et al., 2014</a>), and thus, their suppressive roles at these critical sites of immune priming are largely overlooked. Our prior work demonstrating that MDSC partially downregulate expression of the L-selectin LN homing receptor on na\u00efve T cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hanson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Parker et al., 2014</a>) suggested that MDSC might interfere with T cell function by preventing access to the LN microenvironment. L-selectin\u2013mediated tethering and rolling within vessel walls is a prerequisite for trafficking of na\u00efve T and B cells across gateway high endothelial venules (HEV) in LN (<a href=\"#bib27\">Girard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Evans et al., 2015</a>). Efficient trafficking at HEV increases the probability that activating signals are delivered to specific-antigen restricted na\u00efve T and B lymphocytes existing at a frequency of only\u00a0~1 in 10<sup>5</sup>\u201310<sup>6</sup> in mice and humans (<a href=\"#bib55\">Oshiba et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jenkins et al., 2010</a>). In murine tumor models, MDSC are associated with partial reduction of L-selectin on naive T cells that can be restored upon MDSC depletion using gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hanson et al., 2009</a>). However, the biological implications of L-selectin down-modulation cannot be inferred solely from expression analysis since the high L-selectin\u00a0density normally present on leukocytes (~50,000\u2013100,000 molecules per cell) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kishimoto et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Simon et al., 1992</a>) could theoretically buffer against moderate fluctuations in expression during homing. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that MDSC are capable of systemic immunosuppression by investigating: (<i>a</i>) the spatiotemporally-regulated mechanisms underlying MDSC-driven L-selectin down-modulation in T cells, (<i>b</i>) whether L-selectin loss extends to B cells which are not validated MDSC targets in cancer, (<i>c</i>) if moderate L-selectin loss is sufficient to compromise lymphocyte trafficking and antigen-induced priming within the intranodal compartment."

We determined that MDSC function through a contact-dependent mechanism independent of the major L-selectin sheddase, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17, to target L-selectin loss exclusively on na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells located in close proximity within the splenic compartment. Surprisingly, this mechanism also takes place on both T and B cells as they circulate together with MDSC within the intravascular space. Our studies further show that even modest MDSC-driven L-selectin down-modulation is sufficient to profoundly reduce homing and antigen-dependent activation of na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in LN which is attributed to decreases in the quality of L-selectin-dependent rolling interactions within HEV. Additionally, we identify a role for MDSC preconditioning of T cells in the spleen or blood that reduces responsiveness to antigen outside these organ sites. These findings support a model in which MDSC act at remote tissue compartments to exert wide-spread, systemic immune suppression in distant LN, thus having broad implications to cancer immunity and inflammatory disease processes."

In this regard, during normal development T cell precursors leave the bone marrow and emigrate to the thymus where they differentiate into L-selectin<sup>+</sup> mature T cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Takahama, 2006</a>). After exiting the thymus, na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells use L-selectin to traffic directly into LN via gatekeeper HEV, or recirculate through the\u00a0spleen which is devoid of HEV and does not require L-selectin for entry (<a href=\"#bib27\">Girard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Evans et al., 2015</a>). In order to maximize the potential for detecting MDSC functions in various lymphoid organs we opted to use the 4T1 mammary tumor model in which tumor-produced granulocyte-colony stimulating factor drives robust expansion of MDSC (<a href=\"#bib76\">Waight et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">2013</a>). We excluded non-lymphoid organs and tumor tissues from this analysis since na\u00efve T cells do not recirculate at a high frequency at these sites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fisher et al., 2011</a>)."

Moreover, L-selectin was not altered on thymic na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup> T cells when compared to non-tumor bearing controls (NTB). MDSC were also rare in peripheral LN (pLN) of 4T1-bearing mice, including tumor-draining inguinal LN, which correlated with the absence of L-selectin modulation on na\u00efve T cells at these sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). MDSC exclusion from LN is likely explained by their low L-selectin expression as compared to normal na\u00efve T cells, (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The uniformly high L-selectin density detected on intranodal T cells in both control and tumor-bearing mice is suggestive of a stringent requirement for a high L-selectin threshold for entry of blood-borne T cells across HEV."

Additional insight into the MDSC mechanism of action came from profiling of splenic B cells that showed that while these cells express relatively low L-selectin compared to T cells as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gauguet et al., 2004</a>), there was no change in L-selectin density on splenic B cells of tumor-bearing mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

Like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we found that L-selectin was strongly downregulated on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of tumor-bearing mice regardless of whether there was an intact splenic microenvironment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the case of B220<sup>+</sup> B cells, the varying levels of baseline L-selectin detected in lymphoid organs of tumor-free mice was expected since L-selectin is known to fluctuate after B cells exit the bone marrow and recirculate through the blood and spleen (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Morrison et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, we did not detect L-selectin loss in the bone marrow and splenic compartments despite increased MDSC burden in sham or splenectomized tumor-bearing mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In sharp contrast, L-selectin was nearly completely downregulated on blood-borne B220<sup>+</sup> B cells in both sham and splenectomized tumor-bearing mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These observations allowed us to pinpoint the blood compartment as the preferential site of L-selectin modulation for B cells in tumor-bearing mice. Similar results were obtained for L-selectin downregulation on circulating T and B lymphocytes if the timing sequence was reversed by allowing tumor-induced MDSC to accrue prior to splenectomy (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The conclusion that blood is a prominent site of L-selectin loss was further supported by the strong L-selectin downregulation observed only 2 hr after adoptive transfer of na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B220<sup>+</sup> B cells into the MDSC-rich vascular compartment of 4T1-bearing mice (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Labeled cells detected in the blood at this short time-point mainly represent transferred populations retained in the vascular compartment since 2 hr is not sufficient for lymphocytes to recirculate from blood, through tissues, and back to the blood (e.g., transit times for T cells through lymph nodes, spleen, and peripheral tissues are\u00a0~8\u201312, 5, and 24 hr, respectively, and\u00a0~24 hr for B cells at these tissue sites) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ford, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Issekutz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Girard et al., 2012</a>)."

However, since gemcitabine has a wide spectrum of activities that also influence other immune cells (e.g., CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg and Th17 cells) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bracci et al., 2014</a>), we took several alternative approaches to further explore MDSC contributions to reducing L-selectin in vivo. Partial MDSC depletion (~50%) by administration of anti-Gr-1 antibody at three day intervals after 4T1 implantation had no impact on tumor growth but significantly rescued L-selectin on circulating na\u00efve T and B cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Complementary studies showed that L-selectin loss was reversible in an environment devoid of MDSC. In this regard, when CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSC were depleted from L-selectin<sup>lo</sup> splenic populations from 4T1-bearing mice we observed complete L-selectin recovery on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within four days after culture or post-adoptive transfer into non-tumor bearing recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, these findings demonstrate that continued exposure to MDSC is required to maintain L-selectin down-modulation. Finally, MDSC from tumor-bearing mice (&gt;95% CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup>) but not CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells from non-tumor bearing controls were shown to cause moderate but significant L-selectin loss during co-culture with splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Stronger L-selectin loss occurred if IFN-\u03b3 and LPS were included in co-cultures to sustain MDSC function ex vivo (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sinha et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stewart et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ostrand-Rosenberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beury et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, MDSC acted through a contact-dependent mechanism that was abrogated if MDSC were physically separated from target lymphocytes by cell-impermeable transwell inserts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Taken together, these results establish that MDSC directly target lymphocytes for L-selectin loss."

Thus, in agreement with the obligate role of ADAM17 reported for PMA-induced L-selectin shedding, we found that PMA-induced loss of lymphocyte L-selectin was abrogated (<i>1</i>) by an ADAM17-specific inhibitor (PF-5480090) (<a href=\"#bib48\">McGowan et al., 2013</a>) and by a dual ADAM17/ADAM10 inhibitor (INCB7839) (<a href=\"#bib80\">Witters et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wang et al., 2013</a>); (<i>2</i>) in cells from L(E)-selectin mice expressing a mutated ADAM cleavage site due to substitution of the L-selectin membrane-proximal extracellular domain with the shorter E-selectin homologous domain (<a href=\"#bib74\">Venturi et al., 2003</a>); or (<i>3</i>) in ADAM17-deficient lymphocytes from <i>Adam17<sup>flox/flox</sup>/Vav1-Cre</i> mice (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mishra et al., 2016</a>) cultured alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) or co-mixed with wildtype cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These findings confirm reports of a strict requirement for <i>cis</i>-acting ADAM17 for PMA-induced L-selectin down-modulation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feehan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Preece et al., 1996</a>). In contrast, MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation in vitro was unaffected by inhibitors of ADAM17 or ADAM17/ADAM10; L(E)-selectin mutation; or lymphocyte-intrinsic ADAM17 deficiency (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Further, while elevated constitutive L-selectin expression in mutant L(E)-selectin lymphocytes or on <i>Adam17</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells was indicative of an ADAM17 mechanism\u00a0operative in vivo as described previously (<a href=\"#bib74\">Venturi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>), this pathway was dispensable for MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation in mutant L(E)-selectin-expressing T and B cells or in <i>Adam17</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells following their adoptive transfer into MDSC<sup>hi</sup> 4T1-bearing SCID mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Collectively, these data exclude a role for ADAM17 or ADAM10 in either a <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> orientation for MDSC-induced L-selectin loss and are suggestive of the involvement of another ecto-protease."

To address the functional consequence of moderate L-selectin loss we isolated L-selectin<sup>hi</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (&gt;90% purity) from spleens of non-tumor bearing controls (NTB CD8<sup>+</sup>) or L-selectin intermediate-to-low (L-selectin<sup>int/lo</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cells from AT-3-bearing mice (AT-3 CD8<sup>+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Cells were then labeled ex vivo with tracking dye and their adhesive behavior was visualized in real-time by epifluorescence intravital microscopy in LN venules of non-tumor bearing recipients (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2006</a>). For L-selectin<sup>hi</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, tethering and rolling interactions and firm sticking occurred primarily in high-order (III-V) postcapillary venules that constitute the HEV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2006</a>). L-selectin-mediated tethering and slow rolling on HEV ligands termed peripheral LN addressin (PNAd) is a prerequisite for CC-chemokine receptor-7 (CCR7) engagement of CCL21 which, in turn, triggers stable binding of LFA-1 integrin to endothelial ICAM-1/2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Girard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Evans et al., 2015</a>).

For these studies, enriched populations of L-selectin<sup>hi</sup> and L-selectin<sup>int/lo</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from non-tumor bearing mice and AT-3\u2013bearing mice, respectively, were labeled with different tracking dyes ex vivo, co-mixed at a 1:1 ratio, and transferred intravenously into tumor-free recipients. The impact of L-selectin deficits on trafficking was assessed 1 hr later in peripheral LN under homeostatic (control) conditions and under conditions of heightened HEV function as encountered in inflamed lymph nodes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Evans et al., 2015</a>). Homeostatic trafficking of L-selectin<sup>int/lo</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells across LN HEV was strongly inhibited (~80%) when compared to L-selectin<sup>hi</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that successfully extravasated across LN HEV during homeostatic trafficking were uniformly L-selectin<sup>hi</sup> regardless of whether they originated from non-tumor bearing mice or AT-3\u2013bearing mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that a high L-selectin density is necessary to stabilize T cell adhesion during extravasation. In contrast, differential L-selectin expression was maintained on transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recovered from the spleen where trafficking is not dictated by L-selectin status (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). Reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking due to moderate L-selectin loss was also observed in an inflammatory model in which HEV express elevated CCL21 and ICAM-1 in response to\u00a0fever-range whole body hyperthermia (WBH) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Evans et al., 2015</a>).

A rate-limiting step for immune surveillance involves trafficking at HEV which ensures that DC present cognate antigens to a sufficiently diverse repertoire of na\u00efve T cells in order to drive expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cell pools and B cell antibody production (<a href=\"#bib27\">Girard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Evans et al., 2015</a>). Here we provide evidence that tumor-induced MDSC act from remote sites through two independent mechanisms to suppress systemic adaptive immunity in widely dispersed LN. The major findings of the current study establish that MDSC located in anatomically discrete sub-compartments of the spleen and, unexpectedly in the blood, downregulate expression of the L-selectin LN homing receptor in murine CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> na\u00efve T cell subsets and on blood-borne murine B cells. In the case of na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, even moderate L-selectin loss severely limits trafficking across HEV, causing a profound reduction in antigen-driven expansion within the LN stroma. Thus, MDSC-induced L-selectin down-modulation could significantly impair immune surveillance during the early phases of tumor escape as well as compromise immunotherapy regimens dependent on immune cell access to LN. Additionally, our results reveal that T cells can be preconditioned by MDSC in the spleen or blood, resulting in diminished responsiveness to subsequent challenge with cognate antigen. Collectively, these findings lead us to propose that LN are important sites of MDSC suppression which could not be predicted from routine profiling of immune constituents since MDSC are largely excluded from this lymphoid compartment."

                        "text": "Results of the current study expand our understanding of the biological role of splenic and circulating MDSC in repressing immune function in a setting of tumor progression. The spleen is already considered a major reservoir for peripheral MDSC with direct immunosuppressive activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gabrilovich et al., 2012</a>), while the blood is not known to be an active site of MDSC function in situ. In line with prior studies (<a href=\"#bib73\">Ugel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>), we found discrete compartmentalization of MDSC within the splenic marginal zone of tumor-bearing mice. This localization was linked to specific downregulation of L-selectin on T cells but not B cells, consistent with MDSC exclusion from B cell follicles. Whether this restricted spatial distribution of MDSC is a byproduct of their profuse systemic accumulation or reflects preferential trafficking and/or retention is an open question. We initially predicted that splenic MDSC act directly on na\u00efve T cells only within the splenic stroma, which is then reflected in the blood as L-selectin<sup>int/lo</sup> T cells exit the spleen. However, subsequent analysis of splenectomized tumor-bearing mice revealed that the blood is a major site for MDSC-targeted L-selectin downregulation for both T and B cells. Evidence that L-selectin down-modulation is restricted to specific organs as well as sub-anatomical compartments supports a scenario in which MDSC-to-target cell contact is a prerequisite for L-selectin down-modulation, as validated by MDSC-lymphocyte co-cultures in the present study. There is precedent from other systems that biological consequences occur as a result of cell-to-cell interactions within the blood, suggesting that MDSC could also be expected to have contact-dependent intravascular activities. In this regard, leukocyte-leukocyte interactions along vessel walls contribute to recruitment at inflammatory sites (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grailer et al., 2009</a>) while stable aggregates comprised of circulating tumor cells and other cell types (e.g., leukocytes, platelets, stromal cells) function as \u2018traveling niches\u2019 to facilitate metastasis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Krebs et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the high circulating MDSC concentration in tumor-bearing mice shown in the current report and in\u00a0cancer patients (e.g., human MDSC comprise up to 45% of PBMC) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Trellakis et al., 2013</a>) makes serial contact with target lymphocytes plausible either in free-flowing blood, within multicellular aggregates, or in marginated pools within capillaries, sinusoids or intravascular niches in the lung where na\u00efve lymphocytes are transiently retained (<a href=\"#bib22\">Galkina et al., 2005</a>). Regardless of whether the loss occurs in spleen or blood, L-selectin status is a critical determinant of homing potential since lymphocytes emigrating from each of these sites have nearly immediate access to LN HEV (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2006</a>)."

During leukocyte rolling it is estimated that\u00a0~5 microvillous tips are in simultaneous contact with endothelial surfaces, with L-selectin concentration exceeding 90,000 molecules per \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> at a single microvillous tip (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shao and Hochmuth, 1999</a>). Our results suggest that relatively subtle decreases in L-selectin density within these multivalent focal patches increase rolling speed, thus destabilizing adhesion within HEV. These data are reminiscent of similar observations for diminished rolling quality due to intermediate L-selectin downregulation in genetically engineered L-selectin<sup>+/\u2212</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gauguet et al., 2004</a>). Our intravital data demonstrate that L-selectin modulation by MDSC is of primary importance during adhesion on the lumenal surface of HEV prior to extravasation. These findings do not, however, exclude the possibility that MDSC-mediated L-selectin loss also has downstream consequences in light of in vitro studies implicating extended roles for L-selectin in controlling the polarity of monocytes necessary for transendothelial migration (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rzeniewicz et al., 2015</a>) as well as antigen-driven acquisition of cytolytic function by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yang et al., 2011</a>)."

Emerging clinical studies have reported that serum sL-selectin levels are also increased in patients with solid tumors (i.e., bladder and thyroid cancer), although links to MDSC were not explored (<a href=\"#bib12\">Choudhary et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kobawala et al., 2016</a>). Lymphocytes are the primary source of the circulating sL-selectin pool under normal conditions, as demonstrated in studies showing that serum sL-selectin concentrations are reduced\u00a0~70% in lymphocyte-deficient <i>Rag2<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tu et al., 2002</a>). Thus, increased serum sL-selectin in tumor-bearing mice likely reflects MDSC-induced cleavage from lymphocyte surface membranes although MDSC could be an additional source of sL-selectin. Accordingly, two independent but complementary mechanisms are proposed to reduce LN trafficking in cancer: (1) MDSC-directed downregulation of lymphocyte L-selectin which we showed negatively impacts homing in HEV, and (2) elevated circulating sL-selectin which, at the concentrations detected in tumor-bearing mice (1 \u00b5g/mL in tumor-bearing mice compared to\u00a0~0.4 \u00b5g/mL in tumor-free controls), reportedly functions as a competitive antagonist of L-selectin-directed lymphocyte homing in vivo. In this regard, elevation of circulating sL-selectin levels in L-selectin<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice to\u00a0~0.9 and 1.5 \u03bcg/mL by serum infusion reduces lymphocyte trafficking to LN HEV by\u00a0~40% and 65%, respectively, while concentrations of\u00a0~0.6 \u03bcg/mL are not inhibitory (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tu et al., 2002</a>)."

In this regard, evidence that MDSC-induced L-selectin loss occurs in ADAM17-deficient lymphocytes indicates that MDSC do not activate lymphocyte-intrinsic ADAM17 to cleave L-selectin in <i>cis</i>. Nor does ADAM17 present on the surface of MDSC (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hanson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Oh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Parker et al., 2014</a>) act in <i>trans</i> to target L-selectin on juxtaposed lymphocyte membranes since downregulation occurs in the presence of ADAM17-specific inhibitors and in cells expressing a mutated ADAM17 cleavage site (i.e., L(E)-selectin). The mechanism underlying MDSC-induced L-selectin modulation closely parallels in vitro observations for an ADAM17 and ADAM10-independent ecto-protease during constitutive or inducible L-selectin shedding (i.e., triggered by antibody cross-linking of L-selectin and TcR) that is unaffected by mutation of the ADAM17 cleavage site, ADAM17/ADAM10 inhibitors, or ADAM17-deficiency (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stoddart et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jasuja and Mier, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Walcheck et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2006</a>).

Moreover, at least one of these proteins, recombinant stromelysin (MMP3), can function in <i>trans</i> to cleave lymphocyte L-selectin in vitro (<a href=\"#bib59\">Preece et al., 1996</a>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that one of the wide array of MDSC ecto-proteases with different structural substrate requirements from ADAM17 contribute to lymphocyte L-selectin downregulation in cancer."

These findings complement studies in autoimmunity showing that MDSC derived from mice with collagen-induced arthritis directly suppress B cell proliferation and antibody production in vitro (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crook et al., 2015</a>). The nearly complete loss of L-selectin detected on circulating B cells in response to MDSC in our study strongly suggests that B cell homing at HEV would be effectively blocked, especially given the well-established sensitivity of B cells to perturbations in L-selectin density (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gauguet et al., 2004</a>). Thus, antibody responses would be expected to be severely diminished as a result of MDSC-induced suboptimal trafficking of both na\u00efve B cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> precursors of the follicular helper T cells required for T-dependent antibody production in LN. Collectively, our findings could provide an explanation for observations that patients diagnosed with premalignant advanced colonic adenomas who have elevated circulating MDSC failed to produce antibodies in response to vaccination with the MUC-1 tumor-associated antigen (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kimura et al., 2013</a>)."

Presently, there is strong interest in developing ex vivo activation protocols that maintain expression of LN homing receptors on T cell immunotherapeutics. This is founded on recent preclinical studies demonstrating that adoptive transfer of activated L-selectin<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> stem cell memory T cells (T<sub>SCM</sub>) has greater antitumor efficacy than terminally differentiated L-selectin<sup>lo</sup>CCR7<sup>lo</sup> cytolytic effectors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gattinoni et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2011</a>). The superior efficacy of T<sub>SCM</sub> is attributed to the requirement for adoptively-transferred cells to undergo L-selectin-dependent trafficking via HEV to access intranodal growth and survival factors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gattinoni et al., 2005</a>). Of related interest are preclinical data showing that the efficacy of ACT therapy is limited by MDSC (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alizadeh et al., 2014</a>). Our findings suggest that an unexpected outcome of clinical ACT immunotherapy in patients with high MDSC burdens is that a high proportion of transferred T cells will undergo two major MDSC-mediated events that impair T cell responses in LN: (1) reduced LN homing due to rapid L-selectin loss within 24 hr, and (2) immune suppression stemming from T cell preconditioning prior to direct tumor-antigen exposure. These mechanisms would necessitate the transfer of excessive numbers of ex vivo-expanded T cells to achieve therapeutic efficacy."

Briefly, mice were anesthetized (1 mg ml<sup>\u22121</sup> xylazine and 10 mg ml<sup>\u22121</sup> ketamine; 10 ml kg<sup>\u22121</sup>, <i>i.p.</i>) and a catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery for the delivery of adoptively-transferred calcein-labeled (ThermoFisher) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from spleens of non-tumor bearing mice or\u00a0AT-3-bearing C57BL/6 mice. An abdominal skin flap was made to expose the left inguinal lymph node. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell interactions within postcapillary vessel walls were visualized with a customized Olympus BX51WI epi-illumination intravital microscopy system (Spectra Services, Ontario, NY). Rolling fraction, sticking fraction, and rolling velocity were determined as described using off-line measurements (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gauguet et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2006</a>). The rolling fraction was defined as the percentage of total cells that transiently interacted with vessels during the observation period. The sticking fraction was defined as the percentage of rolling cells that adhered to vessel walls for\u00a0\u226530 s.

They provide a very good support for this by showing that in the OVA system, OVA-specific responses are compromised in the presence of MDSCs. The authors show in vitro, that co-culture of T cells with MDSCs leads to the L-selectin low phenotype, which is reversible within 24-48 hours of MDSC depletion."

A very simple experiment that could start the discussion on the mechanism of action, could be an experiment to find out if this MDSC action requires cell to cell contact or only the soluble factors produced by MDSC. They already show that this activity is cross-species but that does not suggest (nor do they imply) a soluble factor.

While the authors have checked CCR7 and LFA-1 surface levels in the supplement to <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, there is some concern on the CCR7 plot. Why would there be a CCR7high population? Furthermore, the presence of CCR7 and LFA-1 receptors on the cell surface does not automatically mean they are functional. This may explain the drastically reduced sticking fraction despite fairly good rolling. Along the same line, does the MDSC-induced L-selectin loss lead to a shift in the absolute numbers of T cells in spleen versus lymph nodes or do these cells also induce apoptosis in T cells?"

This was a common issue raised by all three referees so we have jointly addressed all of the comments related to mechanism below. It is worthwhile noting, however, that up to this point, while a <i>trans</i>-acting MDSC-intrinsic ADAM17 mechanism has been strongly implicated in reducing L-selectin on juxtaposed T cells based on ADAM17 surface expression by this myeloid population (Hanson et al., J Immunol 2009; Oh et al., Breast Cancer Res 15:R79, 2013; Parker et al., Cancer Res 2014), this hypothesis has never been formally investigated. Conversely, there has been substantial evidence that ADAM17, which is the major known L-selectin sheddase, acts in <i>cis</i> to cleave L-selectin and other substrates (i.e., ectoenzyme and substrate located on the same cell membrane). We have clarified these points in our revised report (subsection \u201cMDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17\u201d, second paragraph; Discussion, fifth paragraph). These observations prompted our systematic investigation of the mechanisms underlying MDSC-induced L-selectin loss including the role of ADAM17 in this process both in vitro and in vivo. Our new findings (described in detail below) are consistent with a sheddase-dependent mechanism but definitively rule out ADAM17 in either a <i>trans</i> or <i>cis</i> orientation in reducing lymphocyte L-selectin density. These new mechanistic results are described in the last two paragraphs of the aforementioned subsection and in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the Discussion and we have dedicated one-and-a-half <i>new</i> main figures to these important findings (revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A-E</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Notably, ADAM17 is the major known L-selectin ectosheddase although it reportedly targets substrates including L-selectin in <i>cis</i> as discussed in the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cMDSC cause L-selectin loss through a contact-mediated mechanism independent of ADAM17\u201d. These observations prompted our systematic investigation of the role of ADAM17 in MDSC-induced L-selectin modulation. This investigation involved new collaborations with Drs.

Thus, in agreement with the obligate role of ADAM17 reported for PMA-induced L-selectin shedding, we found that PMA-induced loss in membrane-associated L-selectin was abrogated (1) by a specific pharmacological inhibitor of ADAM17 (PF-5480090) and by a dual ADAM17/10 inhibitor (INCB7839) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>); (2) in cells from transgenic L(E)-selectin mice expressing a mutated ADAM cleavage site due to substitution of the L-selectin membrane-proximal extracellular domain with the shorter E-selectin homologous domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>); and (3) in ADAM17-deficient lymphocytes cultured either alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) or co-mixed with wildtype cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together these findings confirm reports of a strict requirement for <i>cis</i>-acting ADAM17 for PMA-induced L-selectin down-modulation. In contrast, MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation in vitro was unaffected by inhibitors of ADAM17 and ADAM17/10; L(E)-selectin mutation; and lymphocyte-intrinsic ADAM17 deficiency (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Further, while elevated constitutive L-selectin expression in mutant L(E)-selectin lymphocytes or on ADAM17<sup>-/-</sup> T cells was indicative of an ADAM17 mechanism operative in vivo, this pathway was dispensable for MDSC-induced L-selectin downregulation in mutant L(E)-selectin-expressing T and B cells or in ADAM17<sup>-/-</sup> cells following their adoptive transfer into MDSC<sup>hi</sup> 4T1-bearing SCID mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These results established that the MDSC mechanism of action surprisingly does not depend on ADAM17 acting in either a <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i> orientation. Thus, MDSC do not stimulate lymphocyte-intrinsic ADAM17 to cleave L-selectin in <i>cis</i>. Nor do MDSC use their own ADAM17 in <i>trans</i> to target L-selectin for loss on juxtaposed lymphocyte membranes in vitro or in vivo, suggesting the involvement of a different L-selectin sheddase.

Therefore, to address this physiologically relevant question, we used a stringent model of MDSC-induced moderate L-selectin loss (AT-3 tumor system) to identify severe limitations in na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking in lymph nodes via gateway high endothelial venules (HEV) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a> of the original submission; now <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), which in turn causes a profound decrease in antigen-driven T cell expansion within the lymph node stroma (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> of the original submission;now revised <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

In contrast, L-selectin is unchanged in MTAG mice with smaller overall tumor burdens without MDSC expansion. We consider these data to be an important contribution to our study since they provide strong support for conclusions derived from implantable models indicating that the extent of L-selectin loss correlates with MDSC expansion, thereby suggesting that MDSC levels must exceed a threshold. Moreover, they provide a rationale for using a model with moderate L-selectin loss (i.e., the AT-3 mammary model) to interrogate the impact of L-selectin loss on T cell homing or T cell priming in lymph nodes. We have revised the manuscript to more clearly indicate that moderate L-selectin loss would be expected to be highly relevant during the early phases of tumor escape from immune surveillance as well as for immunotherapy regimens where high MDSC burdens could subvert therapy by preventing immune cell access to lymph nodes (Discussion, first paragraph)."

The results from in vitro assays for CCL21/CCR7-driven chemotaxis in transwell assays and PMA-induced LFA-1-dependent homotypic lymphocyte aggregation assays (subsection \u201cL-selectin loss reduces murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell trafficking across LN HEV\u201d, second paragraph) indicate that the function of these trafficking molecules is not compromised in cancer. Thus, L-selectin loss appears to be the primary explanation for our observations of poor trafficking in lymph node high endothelial venules."

These results show that the absolute numbers of na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is diminished selectively in the lymph nodes while we see a compensatory increase in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice. We did not observe any change in the apoptotic fraction of T cells at either of these tissue sites. These findings are in line with our hypothesis that MDSC-induced L-selectin loss contributes to poor overall trafficking of T cells to lymph nodes, thereby compromising immune surveillance in tumor-bearing mice (subsection \u201cSpatiotemporal correlation between L-selectin loss and MDSC co-localization with na\u00efve T cells in the splenic compartment\u201d, third paragraph)."

As discussed in the revised manuscript, these data further support our conclusion that the blood is a prominent site for MDSC-induced L-selectin loss since the lymphocytes analyzed 2 hours after transfer are those that remained in the blood for the duration of the experiment; i.e., this time period is not sufficient for blood-borne na\u00efve lymphocytes to recirculate through tissues and return back to the blood."
