However, understanding this critical embryonic phase has relied upon inference from patient phenotypes and assumptions from in vitro stem cell models and non-human vertebrates. We report an integrated transcriptomic atlas of human organogenesis. By lineage-guided principal components analysis, we uncover novel relatedness of particular developmental genes across different organs and tissues and identified unique transcriptional codes which correctly predicted the cause of many congenital disorders. By inference, our model pinpoints co-enriched genes as new causes of developmental disorders such as cleft palate and congenital heart disease. The data revealed more than 6000 novel transcripts, over 90% of which fulfil criteria as long non-coding RNAs correlated with the protein-coding genome over megabase distances. Taken together, we have uncovered cryptic transcriptional programs used by the human embryo and established a new resource for the molecular understanding of human organogenesis and its associated disorders."

To identify disease associations each gene was entered as a search term in OMIM (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim</a>) and in PubMed. Batch queries were undertaken at Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI, <a href=\"http://www.informatics.jax.org\">www.informatics.jax.org</a>) with 'Mammalian phenotype' as the output.\u00a0(<b>H</b>) LgPCA predictions of causal genes for critical regions in either solved or unsolved developmental disorders.\u00a0Fifty-three developmental disorders (Column A, 'solved') with causally associated transcription factors identified in the appropriate transcriptomic signature of <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a> were originally defined by critical regions (Column C with hyperlink). These critical regions were identified by searching OMIM and usually derived from mapping data on affected families or chromosomal deletions in affected patients. Larger critical regions were preferentially selected to test more meaningfully whether the LgPCA model could have pinpointed the causal gene based solely on transcriptomic signatures that involved an affected organ(s) or tissue(s) (Column B). The average critical region was 13.7\u00a0Mb (Column D) and contained an average of 111 protein-coding genes (Column E; identified from searching BIOMART on ENSEMBL). In 48/53 instances (91%), LgPCA narrowed the field down to three or fewer transcription factors and in 37 instances (73%) excluded all except the correct transcription factor. Therefore, the same approach was applied to 13 unsolved developmental disorders (mostly deletion syndromes) with predictions made in each case for any type of protein-coding gene (Column H) and transcription factor(s) (Column I). In many instances the transcription factor in Column I possesses an appropriate mutant mouse phenotype. (<b>I</b>)\u00a06251 unannotated transcripts identified during human organogenesis.\u00a0These are the 6251 novel and distinct transcripts underlying <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> of the main text, which also describes the transcript classification: Anti-sense (AS), Overlapping (OT), Bidirectional (BI), Long-intergenic non-coding (LINC) and / or Transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) (based on <a href=\"#bib19\">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</a>). Intergenic transcripts are numbered sequentially within each chromosome. Exon lengths and starts (blocks) are recorded here in UCSC BED12 format. Correlations in expression profile were calculated for annotated genes with transcript transcriptional start sites situated within 1\u00a0Mb of the novel transcript TSS; the total number of genes in this window is listed. Columns AF-AT (organs and tissues) represent mean, quantile-normalised read counts across tissue replicates. Correlations (and distance) are shown for the closest, best correlated or best anti-correlated genes and were generated using only embryonic RNA-seq data. The pipeline to generate transcripts, distinguish them from previous annotations, name, characterise and filter is described in the Materials and methods.

However, understanding this critical embryonic phase has relied upon inference from patient phenotypes and assumptions from in vitro stem cell models and non-human vertebrates. We report an integrated transcriptomic atlas of human organogenesis. By lineage-guided principal components analysis, we uncover novel relatedness of particular developmental genes across different organs and tissues and identified unique transcriptional codes which correctly predicted the cause of many congenital disorders. By inference, our model pinpoints co-enriched genes as new causes of developmental disorders such as cleft palate and congenital heart disease. The data revealed more than 6000 novel transcripts, over 90% of which fulfil criteria as long non-coding RNAs correlated with the protein-coding genome over megabase distances. Taken together, we have uncovered cryptic transcriptional programs used by the human embryo and established a new resource for the molecular understanding of human organogenesis and its associated disorders."

(<b>G</b>)\u00a0Transcription factors in the extremes of the LgPCA and their links to developmental morbidity.\u00a0The most extreme 1000 annotated genes (GENCODE 18) of the LgPCA dataset were filtered for transcription factors based on KEGG and PHANTOM5 annotations and for read counts &gt;500. To identify disease associations each gene was entered as a search term in OMIM (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim</a>) and in PubMed. Batch queries were undertaken at Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI, <a href=\"http://www.informatics.jax.org\">www.informatics.jax.org</a>) with 'Mammalian phenotype' as the output.\u00a0(<b>H</b>) LgPCA predictions of causal genes for critical regions in either solved or unsolved developmental disorders.\u00a0Fifty-three developmental disorders (Column A, 'solved') with causally associated transcription factors identified in the appropriate transcriptomic signature of <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a> were originally defined by critical regions (Column C with hyperlink). These critical regions were identified by searching OMIM and usually derived from mapping data on affected families or chromosomal deletions in affected patients. Larger critical regions were preferentially selected to test more meaningfully whether the LgPCA model could have pinpointed the causal gene based solely on transcriptomic signatures that involved an affected organ(s) or tissue(s) (Column B). The average critical region was 13.7\u00a0Mb (Column D) and contained an average of 111 protein-coding genes (Column E; identified from searching BIOMART on ENSEMBL). In 48/53 instances (91%), LgPCA narrowed the field down to three or fewer transcription factors and in 37 instances (73%) excluded all except the correct transcription factor. Therefore, the same approach was applied to 13 unsolved developmental disorders (mostly deletion syndromes) with predictions made in each case for any type of protein-coding gene (Column H) and transcription factor(s) (Column I). In many instances the transcription factor in Column I possesses an appropriate mutant mouse phenotype. (<b>I</b>)\u00a06251 unannotated transcripts identified during human organogenesis.\u00a0These are the 6251 novel and distinct transcripts underlying <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> of the main text, which also describes the transcript classification: Anti-sense (AS), Overlapping (OT), Bidirectional (BI), Long-intergenic non-coding (LINC) and / or Transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) (based on <a href=\"#bib19\">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</a>). Intergenic transcripts are numbered sequentially within each chromosome. Exon lengths and starts (blocks) are recorded here in UCSC BED12 format. Correlations in expression profile were calculated for annotated genes with transcript transcriptional start sites situated within 1\u00a0Mb of the novel transcript TSS; the total number of genes in this window is listed. Columns AF-AT (organs and tissues) represent mean, quantile-normalised read counts across tissue replicates. Correlations (and distance) are shown for the closest, best correlated or best anti-correlated genes and were generated using only embryonic RNA-seq data. The pipeline to generate transcripts, distinguish them from previous annotations, name, characterise and filter is described in the Materials and methods.

Gerrard, Berry et al. developed a new computational model that used the identity of the RNAs to decode the precise patterns of gene activity in the tissues. The model correctly identified many genes that were already known to cause developmental problems when faulty, and identified numerous others that are now predicted to cause developmental defects in humans."

These \u201cnon-coding\u201d RNAs may have other roles in cells, such as switching off genes, and many of them appear to be specific to human embryos. Together, these findings have uncovered new patterns of gene activity that drive development in human embryos and provide a resource for studying how organs and tissues form. Future challenges are to understand what controls these patterns of gene activity, and how the patterns change over time."

Remarkably little is known about this latter phase of assembling organs and tissues in human due to the restricted availability of human embryonic tissue and its tiny size. Previous transcriptomics post-implantation have sampled either the whole embryo by expression microarray (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fang et al., 2010</a>), thus lacking organ-specific resolution and the vast majority of long non-coding (lnc) transcription; or included lnc expression by massively parallel short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) but focussed on single sites such as limb bud (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cotney et al., 2013</a>) or pancreas (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cebola et al., 2015</a>). RNA-seq from NIH Roadmap and other studies during or after the end of the first trimester of pregnancy falls after the embryonic period (which ends at 56\u201358 days post-conception (Carnegie Stage 23)) and commonly reflects near terminal differentiation within heterogeneous fetal organs and tissues (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jaffe et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Roost et al., 2015</a>). As a consequence of these combined deficiencies, we set about compiling global transcriptomic data during the critical phase of human organogenesis, sampling each germ layer and including sites of mixed origin that are subject to major developmental disorders such as cleft palate and limb abnormalities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>)."

                        "text": "Sampling gene expression across multiple sites allowed us to set about deciphering the precise transcriptomic codes responsible for the development of the different human embryonic organs and tissues. While <i>ZNF</i> and <i>ZSCAN</i> family members were broadly expressed discrete site-specific expression was more apparent for individual members of other transcription factor families (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) exemplified by the <i>HOX</i> gene clusters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). User-defined sets of up to five developmental transcription factors characteristic for a particular organ or tissue displayed very high levels of tissue specificity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, while principal components (PC) analysis (PCA) or clustering grouped biological replicates, relationships between different organs and tissues other than the distinctiveness of brain and liver were not resolved (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s4\">4</a>). Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) also allows unbiased clustering of gene expression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010</a>). By setting the parameters such that representative genes were only extracted once, we identified eleven non-overlapping \u2018metagenes\u2019 from the complete expression dataset with clear tissue-specific signals for thyroid, liver, RPE, brain, heart and adrenal gland (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>). We hypothesized that these new signals might allow benchmarking to assess the fidelity of in vitro differentiated stem cells, similar to a previous report (<a href=\"#bib23\">Roost et al., 2015</a>). As an exemplar, we chose hepatocyte differentiation for which RNA-seq data are available including positive (primary adult hepatocytes) and negative (human embryonic fibroblasts) control data (<a href=\"#bib7\">Du et al., 2014</a>). Clear enrichment for the stem cell-derived hepatocytes and the primary hepatocytes (but not the fibroblasts) was apparent in metagene 2, the cluster of 39 genes indicative of human embryonic liver. From this starting point, we wanted to move beyond the\u00a0unique organ-specific signatures to study how patterns of gene expression co-varied across tissues. While relaxing NMF parameters would allow non-exclusive gene selection across metagenes, we also wanted to capture differences in gene expression between organs (e.g. aspects of what is not expressed as a contributing factor to an organ\u2019s identity). Moreover, different embryonic organs are related according to developmental lineage. We reasoned that being able to apply a lineage structure would create natural assemblies of co-regulated genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Accordingly, we adapted a method from spatial ecology and phylogenetics (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jombart et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2010b</a>) to constrain PCA by imposing a hierarchical developmental lineage and termed this approach LgPCA. We also included RNA-seq from undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, 2015</a>) to represent pre-gastrulation human biology. Of the total thirty-one principal components (PCs) arising from LgPCA the first fifteen now identified patterns of gene expression across groups of related tissues in addition to unique organ-specific signatures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) while PCs 16\u201331 sampled heterogeneity within individual organs and tissues (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

PCs 5\u201315 resolved the individual organs and tissues; for instance low PC5 loadings discriminated liver from the other foregut endoderm derivatives. Heatmaps illustrated the composite or tissue-specific signals emanating from the genes with the most extreme PC loadings which also underlay appropriate developmental gene ontology (GO) terms (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E\u2013F</a>)."

We undertook this in two different ways, both based on studying the 1000 genes with the most extreme loadings in PCs 1\u201315 that identified gene co-expression patterns across tissues and within individual organs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). We interrogated these gene sets for regulatory networks based on the enrichment of transcription factor motifs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Janky et al., 2014</a>). Numerous well known master regulators were recovered alongside previously unappreciated factors for either broad tissue groups (e.g. foregut endoderm derivatives) or individual organs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). As proof-of-principle, this also included proven regulators of human pluripotency, NANOG, OCT4 and MYC, at an extreme of PC1. Remarkably, in several instances approaching half of the 1000 genes with the most extreme PC loadings imputed co-regulation by a single transcription factor, such as HNF4A in the liver or SRF in the heart. Alongside NR5A1, the data predicted RUNX and BAD as novel regulators of human adrenal and gonadal development (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). As a second approach to study gene regulation, we extracted the transcription factors (typically <span class=\"underline\">&lt;</span>5%) from amongst the 1000 most extreme genes in PCs 1\u201315 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>). We searched the Mouse Genome Informatics database (MGI) and in 309/594 instances there was a relevant mouse mutation phenotype supporting the notion that the transcription factors identified by LgPCA are key regulators of human organogenesis. At the lowest extreme of PC5 (liver) the twenty-two transcription factors contained all three of those required for reprogramming fibroblasts directly to hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). This suggests novel fate programming roles for transcription factors at the extremes of other PCs (including new potential regulators of pluripotency amongst the sixteen factors containing zinc fingers in PC1). In keeping with these regulatory roles, the extreme PC loadings in the LgPCA data also prioritized those transcription factors responsible for major congenital disorders (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>). Because LgPCA is not limited to individual organs this included a novel ability to predict multisystem abnormalities such as the combined heart and limb defects of Holt-Oram syndrome (OMIM 142900, <i>TBX5</i>, PC13 low) or the palate and limb abnormalities associated with mutations in <i>TP63</i> (OMIM 603543, PC3 high)."

The enrichment of transcription factors with specific disease-associations at the extremes of the LgPCA implicates the co-enriched genes as leading candidates for unanswered clinical syndromes. To test this model we identified some of the earliest chromosomal mapping or patient deletion data for the known disease-associated transcription factors from <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>. 53 disorders were suitable for assessment with an average critical region of 13.7\u00a0Mb each containing an average of 111 protein-coding genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>). Strikingly, in 37 instances (73%) LgPCA uniquely selected the correct transcription factor and in 48 instances (91%) narrowed the field down to three or fewer transcription factors. When applied to 13 syndromes (mostly deletion disorders) where the causative gene remains unresolved clear predictions of causality emerge, for instance in cleft palate (<i>DLX5, DLX6, LHX8</i> and <i>FOXF2</i>) or cerebellar disorders (<i>ZIC1</i> and <i>ZIC4</i>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>). Frequently, there is an appropriate mutant mouse phenotype such as <i>CASZ1</i> in cardiac malformations, part of Chr1p36 deletion syndrome, or <i>SOX10</i> in the 46,XX disorder of sex differentiation (DSD) linked to duplication on Chr22 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>)."

A dedicated programme operating during human organogenesis seemed likely as 81 out of the 1571 genes enriched in embryogenesis compared to the fetal datasets were annotated long intergenic non-coding (LINC) transcripts (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). To look beyond this we assembled strand-specific transcripts not recognized by current genome annotation [GENCODE 18 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harrow et al., 2012</a>)] and systematically named them individually according to recommended criteria (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</a>). 6251 unique loci accounted for in excess of 9\u00a0Mb of novel polyadenylated transcription from the human genome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1I</a>). The vast majority of transcripts fulfilled criteria as lnc RNAs by assessment of coding potential (CPAT score &lt;0.2) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>), length over 200 base pairs (bp) and an absence of reads spanning splice junctions to currently annotated genes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</a>). These lncRNAs were classified as either bidirectional, antisense or overlapping, or by exclusion intergenic, according to orientation and position in relation to the annotated genome (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</a>). Transcripts were most commonly 500\u20131,500 bp but could extend to over 600 Kb (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) and showed high tissue-specificity with the median Tau value (<a href=\"#bib28\">Yanai et al., 2005</a>) of 0.86, much higher than for protein-coding genes (0.63) but consistent with previously annotated non-coding genes (0.89). We investigated the association between this novel human embryonic transcriptome and the annotated genome. Reduced physical distance to expressed annotated genes markedly increased the likelihood of novel transcript co-expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), although the best correlations were by no means always with the closest gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f\u2013g</a>). The median distance to the closest annotated gene was 7.7 Kb (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) while on average the best correlation was at 188 Kb (random prediction was 476 Kb). Over half (3634) of the lnc transcripts were classified positionally as LINC RNAs. While LINC RNAs can harbour important regulatory function, how to forecast their relationship(s) with the protein-coding genome and prioritize the investigation of thousands of new transcripts is immensely challenging (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goff and Rinn, 2015</a>). As a first step, the multi-tissue nature of our dataset allowed intricate correlative patterns to be deciphered implying putative relationships; for instance over a 2 Mb window and across numerous genes on chromosome 7 between <i>HE-LINC-C7T121</i> and <i>TBX20</i>, which encodes a developmental cardiac transcription factor mutated in a wide range of congenital heart disease (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>)."

Subjecting transcription from many sites to a method of analysis that incorporated developmental lineage deciphered novel genetic signatures, predicted causality in many human developmental disorders and associated novel non-coding transcription with expression from the surrounding protein-coding genome. At present, the data arise from a relatively narrow window of embryonic development but set the stage for future longitudinal studies for individual organs over time. The tiny amounts and scarcity of human embryonic tissue also necessitated aspects of pooling across different Carnegie stages for some sites but it is striking that this had no impact on ascertaining organ and tissue-specific transcriptomic signatures by LgPCA. The integrated data are expected to be particularly valuable to stem cell researchers examining the fidelity of PSC differentiation in vitro or searching for transcription factors for direct reprogramming of chosen cell lineages. Finally, the discovery of a major new programme of non-coding transcription adds a fresh layer of detail on the spatiotemporal regulation of the human genome."

The adrenal gland, whole brain, heart, kidney, liver, entire limb buds, lung, stomach, testis, thyroid and anterior two-thirds of the tongue were readily identifiable as discrete organs and tissues. All visible adherent mesenchyme was removed from organs and tissues under a dissecting microscope. For the adrenal gland, this includes the capsule which allowed separation from the kidney. The ureter, emerging from the renal pelvis, was removed separately from the kidney. For the heart, a window of tissue was removed from the lateral wall of the left ventricle. A segment of the liver was dissected from each embryo that avoided the developing gall bladder. The trachea was removed from the lung at its entry point into the lung parenchyma. The stomach was identified between the gastro-oesophageal and pyloric junctions. The testis was dissected free from the attached mesonephros. While the thyroid was readily visualized as a discrete organ in the neck, it unavoidably contained the developing parathyroids and thus this tissue type was referred to throughout as \u2018thyroid/PTH\u2019. The palatal shelves were dissected on either side of the midline. The eye was dissected and the RPE peeled off mechanically from its posterior surface with validation possible under the dissecting microscope because the RPE is very darkly pigmented compared to the other ocular structures.

The \u2018local\u2019 patterns thereafter captured heterogeneity between tissue replicates (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (while PC7 separated the two PSC populations these RNA-seq datasets represent separate\u00a0cell lines from NIH Roadmap). We used the Abouheif distance as implemented in adephylo (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jombart et al., 2010a</a>), which takes into account the topology of the specified tree but does not use branch lengths."

Transcriptomes were combined (\u2018cuffmerge\u2019; -min-isoform-fraction\u00a0=\u00a00.1) and compared with the original GENCODE 18 reference (\u2018cuffcompare\u2019). We filtered out known transcripts using the \u2018Transfrag class codes\u2019 (<a href=\"http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffcompare/#transfrag-class-codes\">http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffcompare/#transfrag-class-codes</a>) to retain only wholly intronic (\u2018i\u2019, of which there were none), unknown (\u2018u\u2019), antisense (x) and overlapping (\u2018o\u2019) transcripts. We discarded all other classes including pre-mRNA (class \u2018e\u2019), novel-isoforms spliced to known exons (class \u2018j\u2019), and 3\u2019 run-ons within 2\u00a0kb of the end of the transcript annotation (class \u2018p\u2019). In addition, some remaining non-spliced transcripts may theoretically represent first or last exon (UTR) extensions; to delimit these, we calculated the distance on the same strand to the closest downstream transcription start site (to consider potential 5\u2019 UTR extension) and upstream transcription termination site (to consider potential 3\u2019 UTR extension). Names were assigned to these novel transcripts following suggested criteria (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mattick and Rinn, 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) with the sole adaptation that bidirectional (BI) transcripts were defined as having their TSS within 1\u00a0Kb of the TSS of the associated annotated gene. No transcripts mapped to the same strand within the introns of any annotated gene excluding the possibility of unspliced transcripts from annotated genes being erroneously defined as novel transcripts. All transcript sequences (annotated and unannotated) were scored for protein-coding potential using CPAT (based on human training data included with CPAT) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). A threshold of &gt;0.2 was used to define \u2018Transcripts of Uncertain Coding Potential\u2019 (TUCP). Where there were multiple transcripts from a single locus, the longest transcript was retained in assembling the final dataset of 6251 novel transcripts. Transcript level read counts for the embryonic samples and NIH Roadmap samples (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1J</a>) were generated for the merged transcriptome using bedtools multicov (vers 2.21.0) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>). The correlations between each of the 6251 transcripts and all annotated genes within 1\u00a0Mb were calculated using only the human embryonic data from this study."

For each of these genes we mined the OMIM database for human developmental disorders (Column G of <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>). To link to mouse developmental biology we mined the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database for each of the 594 genes providing each MGI ID in Column I and consistent mouse phenotypic features (identifiable in 309 instances) in Column J. In addition, each gene was mined in Pubmed; where additional information from mouse models was particularly insightful over and above the MGI data PMIDs are given in Column K. These data reinforce the message that our identified transcription factors are indeed developmental regulators. In addition, it is relevant that the LgPCA led to consistent GO terms (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, \u2018metanephros development\u2019 for the embryonic kidney signature).

This point was made by Mattick &amp; Rinn: \u2018Although these transcripts may be collectively referred to as long \u2018noncoding\u2019 RNAs (i.e. lncRNAs), this is a necessarily vague catch all term that is useful only as a moniker until they are better characterized\u2019. We recognise, agree with and have adopted this initial starting point of using the \u2018catch all term\u2019, lncRNA. In addition, we have gone to great length to build on their suggested nomenclature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1I</a>) rather than pursue the easier option of simple \u2018in-house\u2019 numbering (prevalent in other manuscripts) which lacks reference to genomic structure and location and is less helpful to the community (\u2018Given the enormous numbers of long apparently noncoding transcripts, it is important to have a logical and flexible structure for cataloguing and parsing newly found transcripts, in a way that will foster rather than impede their functional and mechanistic exploration.\u2019)."
