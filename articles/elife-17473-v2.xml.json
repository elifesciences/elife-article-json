Bacteria are not considered among the major factors influencing coccolithophore physiology. Here we show through a laboratory model system that the bacterium <i>Phaeobacter inhibens</i>, a well-studied member of the Roseobacter group, intimately interacts with <i>E. huxleyi.</i> While attached to the algal cell, bacteria initially promote algal growth but ultimately kill their algal host. Both algal growth enhancement and algal death are driven by the bacterially-produced phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Bacterial production of indole-3-acetic acid and attachment to algae are significantly increased by tryptophan, which is exuded from the algal cell. Algal death triggered by bacteria involves activation of pathways unique to oxidative stress response and programmed cell death. Our observations suggest that bacteria greatly influence the physiology and metabolism of <i>E. huxleyi.</i> Coccolithophore-bacteria interactions should be further studied in the environment to determine whether they impact micro-algal population dynamics on a global scale."

Bacteria are not considered among the major factors influencing coccolithophore physiology. Here we show through a laboratory model system that the bacterium <i>Phaeobacter inhibens</i>, a well-studied member of the Roseobacter group, intimately interacts with <i>E. huxleyi.</i> While attached to the algal cell, bacteria initially promote algal growth but ultimately kill their algal host. Both algal growth enhancement and algal death are driven by the bacterially-produced phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Bacterial production of indole-3-acetic acid and attachment to algae are significantly increased by tryptophan, which is exuded from the algal cell. Algal death triggered by bacteria involves activation of pathways unique to oxidative stress response and programmed cell death. Our observations suggest that bacteria greatly influence the physiology and metabolism of <i>E. huxleyi.</i> Coccolithophore-bacteria interactions should be further studied in the environment to determine whether they impact micro-algal population dynamics on a global scale."

Widespread algae \u2013 known as coccolithophores \u2013 surround their little plant-like body with a mineral shell made of a material similar to chalk. These microscopic algae form seasonal blooms. Over several weeks in early summer, the algae grow to enormous numbers and cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometers in the ocean. These blooms become so vast that satellites can detect them. However, suddenly the blooms collapse; the algae die and their chalky shells sink to the bottom of the ocean where they have been accumulating for millions of years."

While the bacteria are attached to their algal host, they enjoy a supply of nutrients that trickles from the algal cell. Unexpectedly, Segev et al. also discovered that the algae grow better in the presence of the bacteria. It turns out that the bacteria use a molecule that they obtain from their algal hosts to produce a small hormone-like molecule that in turn enhances the growth of the algae. However, after three weeks of growing together, the bacteria produce so much of the growth-enhancing molecule \u2013 which is harmful in higher concentrations \u2013 that they actually kill their algal host."

Prime among these are the coccolithophores, a diverse group of unicellular marine algae of the haptophyte division. Because of their high abundance, these micro-algae are fundamental in the global oxygen, carbon, and sulfur cycles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Balch et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Beaufort et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sim\u00f3, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Field et al., 1998</a>). As a consequence of their photosynthetic capacity these algae, together with other phytoplankton, are responsible for nearly half of our planet\u2019s primary production (<a href=\"#bib23\">Field et al., 1998</a>). Coccolithophore cells are usually surrounded by elaborate platelets made of crystalline calcium carbonate (calcite) referred to as coccoliths. During coccolith production, carbon dioxide is released and can escape from the ocean to the atmosphere (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marsh, 2003</a>). More importantly, coccoliths serve as a carbon sink as they accumulate on the bottom of the oceans (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sabine et al., 2004</a>). Coccolith production by <i>E. huxleyi</i> accounts for roughly 1/3 of the total marine calcium carbonate production (<a href=\"#bib36\">Iglesias-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2002</a>). Hence, coccolithophores play a complex role in the global carbon cycle."

The blooms can cover thousands of square kilometers of ocean surfaces and are easily detected by satellites due to the highly reflective nature of the coccoliths (<a href=\"#bib6\">Balch et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Holligan et al., 1983</a>). The blooms also exhibit unique dynamics; they form seasonally over several weeks and then suddenly collapse (<a href=\"#bib8\">Behrenfeld and Boss, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lehahn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Tyrrell and Merico, 2004</a>), a process that has been attributed to viral infection (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bratbak et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lehahn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Vardi et al., 2012</a>). Recent evidence suggests that environmental stresses and viral infection can trigger oxidative stress and a process similar to programmed cell death (PCD) in <i>E. huxleyi</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bidle et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vardi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bidle, 2016</a>).

In addition, the possible role of algicidal bacteria in the ocean has been examined and discussed (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mayali and Azam, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Harvey et al., 2016</a>). It has been previously suggested by our laboratories that bacteria might interact with <i>E. huxleyi</i> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</a>). However, coccolithophore-bacteria interactions have not yet been unambiguously demonstrated. This gap is curious because <i>E. huxleyi</i>'s important role in the global sulfur cycle is in part a consequence of an algal-bacterial interaction. <i>E. huxleyi</i> produces the osmolyte and antioxidant dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sunda et al., 2002</a>). This molecule, when released into the water by leakage or cell lysis, can be used by some bacteria as a source of sulfur and carbon (<a href=\"#bib20\">Curson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1999</a>). During DMSP catabolism, bacteria such as Roseobacters produce the volatile by-product dimethyl sulfide (DMS). <i>E. huxleyi</i> is also a producer of DMS, which is a bioactive gas with possible roles in climate regulation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Charlson et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alcolombri et al., 2015</a>).When DMS enters the atmosphere it is oxidized and serves to form cloud condensation nuclei (<a href=\"#bib20\">Curson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1999</a>). While the DMSP flux from algae to bacteria, and the production of DMS gas by both algae and bacteria have been clearly demonstrated, the role of DMS in climate regulation has been questioned (<a href=\"#bib58\">Quinn and Bates, 2011</a>)."

This bacterium, when grown in a pure culture in the presence of p-coumaric acid, a product released by aging algae, produced novel compounds able to lyse <i>E. huxleyi</i>. The compounds were named roseobacticides and their discovery pointed towards a possible interaction between <i>P. inhibens</i> and <i>E. huxleyi</i> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, we recently showed that lipid metabolism in <i>E. huxleyi</i> is altered in the presence of <i>P. inhibens</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Segev et al., 2016</a>). However, a direct physical interaction between these algae and bacteria had not been previously described and no other details of their interaction were known. Here we describe the establishment of a co-culture model system between <i>E. huxleyi</i> and <i>P. inhibens</i> that allows the examination of the spatiotemporal dynamics of their interaction. We provide evidence that <i>E. huxleyi</i> and <i>P. inhibens</i> associate intimately when co-cultured. We show that bacteria promote algal growth but eventually kill their aging algal hosts. The same bacterial compound, indole-3-acetic acid, mediates stimulation of algal growth as well as algal death. Finally, algal death in the co-culture seems to involve an apoptotic process. Similar <i>E. huxleyi</i> - bacteria interactions might occur in the ocean and could thus affect algal physiology, bloom dynamics and biogeochemical cycles."

To determine if they co-occur in algal blooms we analyzed the bacterial community associated with <i>E. huxleyi</i> blooms using a culture-independent metagenomic approach. Two independent blooms were sampled in the Gulf of Maine during the summer of 2015. The results shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> indicate that <i>P. inhibens</i> was indeed found co-occurring with <i>E. huxleyi</i> in algal blooms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Thus, the suggested interaction between these microorganisms might be ecologically significant. To study the interactions of <i>E. huxleyi</i> and <i>P. inhibens</i>, it was necessary to establish conditions to co-culture these two species. We started by examining pure cultures of each microorganism. Coccolith-forming (i.e. calcifying) <i>E. huxleyi</i> (strain CCMP3266) were inoculated into L1-Si, a seawater based medium supplemented with additional sources of phosphorus (0.04 mM PO<sub>4</sub>), nitrogen (0.9 mM NO<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur (0.08 \u00b5M SO<sub>4</sub>), along with vitamins and trace metals (<a href=\"#bib31\">Guillard and Hargraves, 1993</a>) (see Materials and methods). In this medium, <i>E. huxleyi</i> grows to 3\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cell/ml. Under these conditions <i>E. huxleyi</i> produces calcium carbonate coccoliths that surround the algal cell (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). <i>P. inhibens</i> DSM17395 is normally grown in the rich medium 1/2YTSS (<a href=\"#bib64\">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</a>) (see Materials and methods) where it easily aggregates; it often forms \u2018rosette\u2019 structures through a polysaccharide-containing pole (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Segev et al., 2015</a>). Of note, alone these bacteria do not grow in the L1-Si medium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, grey bars). However, we found that bacteria do grow in co-culture with <i>E. huxleyi</i>. To grow a co-culture, we inoculated algae into L1-Si medium and, after four days, introduced bacteria into the algal culture. In these co-cultures, bacterial numbers increased nearly five orders of magnitude over a period of 14 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, green bars). Microscopic examination of the co-culture revealed that some algae were no longer surrounded by coccoliths (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Rather, naked algal cells were now covered by bacteria attached via their poles. This attachment was evident in both fixed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>) and live (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>) samples. Of note, attachment of <i>P. inhibens</i> to other micro-algae as well as macro-algae has been previously demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib25\">Frank et al., 2015</a>). Using a specific fluorescent lectin to detect the polar polysaccharide (see Materials and methods), it appeared that bacterial attachment onto the algal cell also involves the polar bacterial polysaccharide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). Examination of co-cultures revealed that over time more algae have attached bacteria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>) and each algal cell is associated with increasing numbers of bacteria as the co-culture ages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f,h</a>)."

What do bacteria receive from algae that allows them to grow? Given that L1-Si does not contain significant amounts of organic carbon to permit robust growth of the heterotrophic bacteria, it stands to reason that the key nutrient that algae provide is fixed carbon. If indeed fixed carbon were to be the sole nutrient needed by the bacteria, addition of a utilizable form of carbon to L1-Si should enable bacterial growth. However, addition of 5.5 mM glucose did not lead to significant bacterial growth (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). This was an unexpected result because, as mentioned above, L1-Si in addition to seawater also contains added phosphorus (0.04 mM PO<sub>4</sub>), nitrogen (0.9 mM NO<sub>3</sub>) and sulfur (0.08 \u03bcM SO<sub>4</sub>). In fact, even addition of higher nutrient concentrations in forms shown to be utilizable by <i>P. inhibens</i> (<a href=\"#bib82\">Zech et al., 2009</a>) as individual supplements (nitrogen 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>, phosphorous 2 mM PO<sub>4</sub>, and sulfur 33 mM SO<sub>4</sub>) or in various combinations of two or three of them did not lead to robust bacterial growth (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>).

Because of its ecological importance, we wanted to investigate whether DMSP plays a role in the interaction between <i>E. huxleyi</i> and <i>P. inhibens</i>. First, we examined the ability of bacteria to grow with DMSP as a sole source of sulfur or carbon. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, DMSP can serve as a sulfur source (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, 'CNP + DMSP 30 \u03bcM'). In contrast, DMSP does not supply sufficient carbon to support robust bacterial growth. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a> 'NP + DMSP 30 \u03bcM'). Even when DMSP was added in higher concentrations to supply carbon in a comparable amount to the carbon supplied by the 5.5 mM glucose in the parallel experiments, bacterial growth was not evident (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a> \u2018NP + DMSP 6mM\u2019). Next, we directly monitored DMSP consumption in a growing bacterial culture. Our measurements indicate that all of the added DMSP is rapidly utilized by the growing bacteria whereas in un-inoculated medium the DMSP levels remain relatively stable over time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Based on these observations, we then proceeded to determine whether DMSP is produced and exuded by algae in pure culture and in co-cultures. Indeed, over a period of 17 days, DMSP concentration in the medium of a pure algal culture increased, reaching a concentration of nearly 6 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, black bars). In contrast, in a co-culture of algae and bacteria, DMSP levels in the medium were nearly undetectable, presumably due to its rapid metabolism by the bacteria (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, grey bars). Since bacteria are directly attached to their algal host it is possible that they experience a considerably higher local concentration of DMSP than the concentration measured in the bulk medium. It has been reported that Roseobacters and other bacteria can chemotax towards DMSP and catabolize it and various metabolic pathways for the bacterial use of the DMSP sulfur have been proposed and tracked (<a href=\"#bib44\">Miller and Belas, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miller et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Seymour et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Brock et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). Thus, it is possible that DMSP serves as a chemical cue attracting bacteria to colonize the <i>E. huxleyi</i> host cell. Additional experiments are clearly needed to determine if indeed DMSP serves as an infochemical promoting bacterial colonization. Yet, it has been previously shown that algal DMSP and exudates serve as a strong cue to attract bacteria (<a href=\"#bib65\">Seymour et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Smriga et al., 2016</a>)."

However, due to bacterial attachment and algal clumping, our co-cultures consist of aggregates of cells of varying sizes. Thus, it is challenging to accurately interpret the results of flow cytometry analyses. Therefore, our analyses included traditional flow cytometry as well as validation of our results using imaging cytometry in order to characterize the different particles (see Materials and methods). We found that during the initial 10 days of culturing, there were greater numbers of algae in the co-cultures compared to pure algal cultures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). In the co-culture, algae reach approximately 25% higher numbers in comparison with the maximum reached in the absence of bacteria. In addition, in an algal pure culture the death phase starts after day seven while in a co-culture a significant decrease in population is evident only at day 17. Interestingly, the death phase in an algal pure culture seems more gradual than the rapid demise observed in a co-culture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Thus, it seems that the algal-bacterial interaction is dynamic. Initially the interaction is mutualistic, however over time bacteria may become harmful for their algal hosts."

As many members of the Roseobacter group have multiple metabolic pathways for IAA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Moran et al., 2007</a>), we posited that IAA might be produced by <i>P. inhibens</i> to promote the growth of <i>E. huxleyi</i> in co-culture. To test this, we examined whether IAA is produced by <i>P. inhibens</i>. We were able to detect IAA (0.4 nM) in bacterial pure cultures (see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). A standard of IAA was analyzed by high resolution LC-MS and targeted MS/MS (see Materials and methods).

Interestingly, studies have described microbial signaling pathways taking place in the rhizosphere (the soil immediately surrounding the roots of terrestrial plants) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Spaepen et al., 2007</a>). It is tempting to hypothesize that similar short-circuit processes could take place in the phycosphere (the immediate volume in proximity to the algal cell).

Indeed, addition of 0.1 mM tryptophan resulted in the production of 10.8 nM IAA, approximately 25-fold increase in comparison to conditions with no added tryptophan (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). The increase in IAA production could be the result of two different mechanisms. Added tryptophan could enhance bacterial metabolism, thus resulting in general increase of bacterially-produced metabolites. Alternatively, exogenous tryptophan could be shunted primarily towards IAA production. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we supplemented a bacterial culture with uniformly labeled tryptophan (<sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N). If the labeled tryptophan were taken up and directly shuttled towards IAA production, all IAA should be fully labeled (<i>m/z</i> 187) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). However, if the imported tryptophan participates in other cellular processes, and atoms are exchanged with endogenous pools of carbon and nitrogen, then the resulting IAA will not be fully labeled, thus resulting in a lower mass. The lowest possible mass would be of a fully unlabeled IAA molecule (<i>m/z</i> 176). The results of our experiments indicate that all produced IAA is fully labeled (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>), thus indicating that exogenous tryptophan is directly converted to IAA. Of note, a recent study reported on the production of IAA in the mM range in axenic <i>E. huxleyi</i> cultures supplemented with tryptophan (<a href=\"#bib40\">Labeeuw et al., 2016</a>). As all of our experiments and controls indicated no IAA production by algae, currently we do not understand the source of this apparent contradiction."

If indeed tryptophan is exuded by algal cells, bacteria in the phycosphere could import it and convert it to IAA. Secreted bacterial IAA could be utilized by algae and lead to improved algal yields. Such chemical cross talk will feed into a positive algal-bacterial feedback loop. In line with this idea, in another algal-bacterial interaction it has been shown that tryptophan released by a diatom fuels IAA production by a bacterium (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amin et al., 2015</a>). To monitor bioavailable tryptophan in <i>E. huxleyi</i> exudates, we used an <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain that is a strict tryptophan auxotroph. This bacterial strain relies solely on exogenous tryptophan; in the presence of extracellular tryptophan the strain will grow and in the absence of tryptophan it will not grow. Cultivation of this strain in minimal medium supplemented with filtered algal supernatant resulted in marked bacterial growth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). This indicates that algal exudates contain bioavailable tryptophan. Interestingly, we detected tryptophan (100 nM) in filtered samples of <i>E. huxleyi</i> blooms (see Materials and methods), suggesting that this metabolite may be relevant to environmental interactions."

After 10 days of incubation, no visible difference was apparent between algal pure cultures and co-cultures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,b</a>). However, after 17 days of incubation the color of the co-cultures rapidly changed from green (the color of healthy algae) to white, a process we refer to as \u2018bleaching\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c,d</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). To better understand these algal changes we examined the various cultures under the microscope. This revealed that the algal cells in a bleached co-culture exhibit more coccolith shedding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e,f,g,h</a>, note arrow in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6h</a>). Furthermore, the typical fluorescent crescent shape that is made of the two chloroplasts in each cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i,j,k</a>) is lost in the bleached co-culture and the fluorescent signal emanating from chlorophyll and accessory pigments fills the entire cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6l</a>). In addition, using a viability stain (Sytox green, see Materials and methods) it is evident that the aging co-culture contains mostly dead algal cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6m,n,o,p</a>). One possible explanation for the bleaching observed is that the bacteria simply degrade dying algal cells at day 17 while similarly dying algal cells in the pure culture at the same time point remain intact. However, comparison of the death rates in the algal population in pure and co-cultures reveals a significant difference. At this time point, the vast majority of algal cells in the co-culture are dead (94% as indicated by Sytox staining, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3p</a>) while in the pure culture only 21% are dead by day 17. Thus, the presence of bacteria seems to play a key role in promoting algal death. Taken together, these results suggest that following the mutualistic phase in the algal-bacterial interaction, bacteria become pathogens that cause the bleaching and death of their algal partners."

Out of 50 examined genes representing various functional groups (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), 15 genes exhibited significant up-regulation in algae over time in co-culture (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To test whether this group of 15 genes exhibits expression levels that are significantly higher than the other 35 genes (in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), we first calculated the variance in the two datasets at day 17 using an F-test. The variance was not found to be statistically different and thus a two-tailed Student\u2019s T-test was performed assuming two samples with equal variance. The resulting probability of the T-test was 2.8\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup> indicating that the difference between the two datasets is statistically significant. The highly up-regulated genes encode proteins that are presumed to be involved in various aspects of oxidative stress and programmed cell death (PCD). PCD naturally occurs in an aging algal population and can be triggered by a variety of biotic stresses such as viral infection and abiotic environmental stresses such as nutrient limitation and various light regimes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bidle, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">2016</a>). Our expression data suggest that PCD as well as responses to oxidative stress are more prevalent among algal cells in co-culture. Thus, PCD in <i>E. huxleyi</i> seems to be triggered by bacteria. Of note, the up-regulation of genes encoding proteins that are directly involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as glutathione (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), was previously shown to be essential in viral infection of <i>E. huxleyi</i> (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sheyn et al., 2016</a>). To further investigate if algae in co-culture experience a bacterially-induced process similar to PCD, algal cells from axenic cultures and co-cultures were tested for the presence of degraded DNA, a physiological hallmarks of PCD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gavrieli et al., 1992</a>). The fluorescent Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP nick end-labeling assay (TUNEL) was previously established as a reliable method for in situ identification of DNA fragmentation as a PCD indicator in various phytoplankton species (<a href=\"#bib37\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Segovia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Berman-Frank et al., 2004</a>). Using the TUNEL assay (see Materials and methods) we could detect that 90% of algal cells in 20-day old co-cultures contain highly fragmented DNA in comparison to 35% in axenic algal cultures of the same age (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6q\u2013t</a>)."

We conducted several experiments to examine whether roseobacticides are the killing agents of algae in aging co-cultures. We successfully reproduced the findings of the previous study (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, our results indicate that while roseobacticides from <i>P. inhibens</i> indeed kill the non-calcifying algal strain CCMP372 used in the previous study, they do not kill the calcifying algal strain CCMP3266 used in the current study (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). Importantly, in CCMP3266 cultures no bleaching was seen upon addition of roseobacticides. Moreover, there is no detectable production of roseobacticides in our co-culture conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). Thus, roseobacticides do not appear to play a role in algal death in the co-culture experimental system described here."

At concentrations between 1 and 100 \u00b5M IAA had a positive effect on algal growth, however 1000 \u00b5M proved to be harmful to algae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). The hormetic effect of IAA has been previously described; IAA promotes plant growth at low concentration while acting as a growth inhibitor at high concentrations (<a href=\"#bib53\">Persello-Cartieaux et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xie et al., 1996</a>). Similar effects were observed when increasing concentrations of IAA were added to a culture of diatoms (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amin et al., 2015</a>). In addition, there are morphological similarities between algae that were killed by bacteria in co-culture and algae that were killed by high concentrations of IAA in pure culture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). These observations drove us to hypothesize that IAA can mediate both mutualistic and pathogenic interactions between bacteria and algae.

Our results indicate, that a co-culture that has been supplemented with 0.1 mM tryptophan undergoes accelerated death with bleaching occurring one week earlier than in non-treated co-cultures (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>). Moreover, examination under the microscope of co-cultures that have been treated with tryptophan revealed a remarkable change in bacterial behavior. In cultures supplemented with tryptophan, bacteria became hyper-colonizers and attached to algal cells in significantly higher rates (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>).

It is known that viral infection is key in the blooms\u2019 demise (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bratbak et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lehahn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Vardi et al., 2012</a>). In our model system the presence of one species of bacteria resulted in the sharp demise of the algal population. While further studies are required in order to explore <i>E. huxleyi</i>-bacterial interactions in the ocean, it is possible that bacterial influences act in concert with viruses to drive the termination of the blooms. Environmental stresses such as nutrient depletion as well as viral infection have been shown to enhance PCD in <i>E. huxleyi</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bidle, 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2016</a>). Similarly, we have observed bacterially-induced PCD. While attached bacteria seem to be trapped on their dying host (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), their offspring get access to the nutrients from lysed algae and can then swim away and colonize a younger algal cell. Recently, Smirga and colleagues demonstrated experimentally how planktonic bacteria crowd around a lysing microalga, feeding off the released cellular content (<a href=\"#bib68\">Smriga et al., 2016</a>). Our discovery of chemical crosstalk in the phycosphere and the bacterially-mediated algal death were made possible due to the co-culture experimental system that enables investigation over time."

This growth enhancement is followed by an inevitable death. Clearly IAA exhibits a hormetic effect - it is beneficial in low concentrations and becomes harmful at higher doses. The hormetic nature of IAA has been previously demonstrated in various plant-bacteria interactions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Persello-Cartieaux et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xie et al., 1996</a>).

It is produced to enhance growth of plant tissue while creating tumors. Several similarities between <i>A. tumefaciens</i> and <i>P. inhibens</i> seem to exist; both attach through their pole to their host (<a href=\"#bib34\">Heindl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Xu et al., 2013</a>), both express a polar polysaccharide involved in bacterial attachment (<a href=\"#bib34\">Heindl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Xu et al., 2013</a>) and both utilize IAA to manipulate the growth of their host (<a href=\"#bib70\">Subramoni et al., 2014</a>).

Since all our cultures have been cultivated under the same light regime, changes in light harvesting capabilities would be the result of changes in levels of light harvesting pigments. However, chlorophyll a measurements revealed similar concentrations in algal cells over a period of 17 days, whether in the presence or absence of bacteria (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Only after bleaching, when the majority of the algal population was dead, a marked decrease in chlorophyll a concentration was evident in agreement with the macroscopic phenotype of bleaching (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>) and microscopic phenotype of chloroplast deformation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6l</a>) that are seen in the co-culture at the same time.

In various microorganisms, regulatory circuits lead to growth cessation before resources have been completely exhausted. When such controls are bypassed, growth does not stop and higher yields are obtained. Two examples can be discussed in the context of elevated growth as a consequence of loss of growth control; <i>E. coli</i> mutants in <i>rpoS</i> grow to higher cell numbers than the wild type (<a href=\"#bib76\">Vulic and Kolter, 2001</a>). While the wild type senses the near depletion of essential nutrients and prepares in advance by ceasing growth, the mutant lacks this regulatory ability (<a href=\"#bib76\">Vulic and Kolter, 2001</a>). Another example of growth regulation by microorganisms is the ability of cells to sense their critical density, a process referred to as quorum sensing (QS). This process requires the release and sensing of signal molecules that serve as reporters of the population density. The response to increased cell numbers is often a transition to decreased growth, which promotes survival of the cells under conditions of limited resources. In trypanosomes, perturbed ability to sense signal molecules results in failure to undergo growth arrest and leads to uncontrolled proliferatation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mony and Matthews, 2015</a>). Whether <i>E. huxleyi</i> possesses regulatory circuits to control growth cessation, and whether IAA can influence such regulation, is yet to be explored."

What underlies the specific bacterial attachment to naked algal cells? Roseobacters posses the ability to chemotax (<a href=\"#bib45\">Miller and Belas, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miller et al., 2004</a>), thus it is likely that <i>P. inhibens</i> swims in its planktonic stage specifically towards the naked cells. In turn, this might suggest that naked cells release increased levels of exudates. However, the question still remains whether the algal cells are naked irrespective of bacteria, or whether bacteria encourage coccoliths shedding thus increasing the amount of naked algal cells. In every population of calcified <i>E. huxleyi</i>, a sub-population of naked non-calcified cells is seen. It has been previously demonstrated that microzooplankton display higher growth rates when feeding on naked <i>E. huxleyi</i> cells in comparison to calcified cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Harvey et al., 2015</a>). Thus, bacteria might initially target a pre-existing algal sub-population. Reversible modes of attachment were shown to take place when bacteria such as <i>A. tumefaciens</i> are assessing whether or not to attach to a substrate in a new environment (<a href=\"#bib34\">Heindl et al., 2014</a>). As <i>P. inhibens</i> shares several similarities with this bacterium regarding their mode of attachment (<a href=\"#bib62\">Segev et al., 2015</a>), it is possible that <i>P. inhibens</i> evaluates the algal cells through reversible interactions. In this regard, the physical properties of a naked non-calcified algal cell might be more suitable for bacterial attachment. Similar influences might promote the permanent attachment that persists even after the algal cell has died (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

The key finding is that the signaling molecule is IAA = which is curious. IAA receptors in the algal cell clearly can enhance growth \u2013 but I don't understand why that happens. If the cells actually grew faster at the same irradiance, then the enhancement should alter the quantum yield for growth \u2013 which the authors do not report. One key parameter that appears to be missing to make that calculation is the optical absorption cross section normalized to chlorophyll (so-called a*). If the algal cell reduced the production of chlorophyll at a particular irradiance, the a* value would be higher (less self-absorption) and the cell could actually use light more efficiently. After longer exposure to IAA (or the association), it appears that plastids are becoming disrupted. If the authors have chlorophyll/cell values, the a* can potentially be calculated \u2013 and that would help give some rationale to the stimulation of growth."

Also, there is millimolar sulfur in seawater in the form of sulfate and almost all bacteria (including Phaeobacter) are able to reduce it. So, organic sulfur addition is not an essential component of the seawater medium."

The authors elegantly show using a combination of analytical approaches (that include growth physiology, microscopy, diagnostic staining/labeling, stable isotope labeling, mass spec analysis, manipulative experiments, and the use of auxotrophic mutants) that P. inhibits produces a phytohormone compound (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) that serves as a growth enhancer for co-cultured <i>E. huxleyi</i> cells in this well-defined, cultured model system. IAA, in turn, derives from organic carbon exuded from <i>E. huxleyi</i> cells, and more specifically from tryptophan (the authors nicely use stable isotope labeling combined with mass spec to show this directly), the production of which is able to support growth for established tryptophan auxotrophs."

This has potentially important ecological and climatological impacts, given the role of DMS as a signaling bioactive molecule across orders of magnitude different size scales. Along these lines, the authors try to make this conceptual link by showing that Phaeobacter species are detected in natural <i>E. huxleyi</i> blooms (although the relative% of the Rhodobacteriaceae to other bacterial phyla among the ~2 million sequence reads of metagenomic data is not reported and would be useful to know in this context; see below) and that tryptophan is measured among the dissolved metabolites in natural <i>E. huxleyi</i> blooms."

If the cells actually grew faster at the same irradiance, then the enhancement should alter the quantum yield for growth \u2013 which the authors do not report. One key parameter that appears to be missing to make that calculation is the optical absorption cross section normalized to chlorophyll (so-called a*). If the algal cell reduced the production of chlorophyll at a particular irradiance, the a* value would be higher (less self-absorption) and the cell could actually use light more efficiently. After longer exposure to IAA (or the association), it appears that plastids are becoming disrupted. If the authors have chlorophyll/cell values, the a* can potentially be calculated \u2013 and that would help give some rationale to the stimulation of growth.</i>"

Re. the mechanism of enhancing growth by IAA \u2013 the authors should not use the analogy to higher plants for a single celled micro alga. Why not? Because in a micro alga, an increase in growth rate without some increase in light harvesting (or a decrease in cell carbon) implies an increase in quantum efficiency for growth. That doesn't make sense to me. I don't see what IAA would do to increase the quantum efficiency for growth. I don't think the authors really understand what IAA does that leads to the apparent increase in growth rate \u2013 and they probably should just state that rather than speculate using a model of a multicellular organism (a higher plant) that has roots and shoots, etc.</i>"
