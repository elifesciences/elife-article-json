UHRF1 binds DNA with selectivity towards hemi-methylated CpGs (HeDNA); however, the contribution of HeDNA sensing to UHRF1 function remains elusive. Here, we reveal that the interaction of UHRF1 with HeDNA is required for DNA methylation but is dispensable for chromatin interaction, which is governed by reciprocal positive cooperativity between the UHRF1 histone- and DNA-binding domains. HeDNA recognition activates UHRF1 ubiquitylation towards multiple lysines on the H3 tail adjacent to the UHRF1 histone-binding site. Collectively, our studies are the first demonstrations of a DNA-protein interaction and an epigenetic modification directly regulating E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. They also define an orchestrated epigenetic control mechanism involving modifications both to histones and DNA that facilitate UHRF1 chromatin targeting, H3 ubiquitylation, and DNA methylation inheritance."

UHRF1 binds DNA with selectivity towards hemi-methylated CpGs (HeDNA); however, the contribution of HeDNA sensing to UHRF1 function remains elusive. Here, we reveal that the interaction of UHRF1 with HeDNA is required for DNA methylation but is dispensable for chromatin interaction, which is governed by reciprocal positive cooperativity between the UHRF1 histone- and DNA-binding domains. HeDNA recognition activates UHRF1 ubiquitylation towards multiple lysines on the H3 tail adjacent to the UHRF1 histone-binding site. Collectively, our studies are the first demonstrations of a DNA-protein interaction and an epigenetic modification directly regulating E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. They also define an orchestrated epigenetic control mechanism involving modifications both to histones and DNA that facilitate UHRF1 chromatin targeting, H3 ubiquitylation, and DNA methylation inheritance."

UHRF1 modifies histone H3 by attaching a small protein molecule called ubiquitin to it. This helps to recruit a DNA methylation enzyme to place methyl tags on the newly copied DNA. However, it was not clear how the various properties of UHRF1 allow it to control how DNA methylation is inherited."

The data further suggest that ligand-induced intramolecular rearrangement of UHRF1 domain connectivity results in high-affinity retention of UHRF1 on chromatin through positive regulation of histone- and DNA-binding activities. This model is generally consistent with a recent report published during the preparation of this manuscript (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fang et al., 2016</a>), which shows that HeDNA enhances histone interaction and suggests a closed-to-open conformational change in UHRF1 intramolecular architecture upon ligand binding. However, two key differences between our findings are that we show reciprocal positive allostery between the histone- and DNA-binding domains of UHRF1, and that general DNA interaction (regardless of methylation state) can displace the TTD-PHD domain and enhance histone interaction. We note that the conclusions from Fang <i>et al.</i> relied upon the interpretation of qualitative in-solution pull-down experiments conducted with a 2:1 DNA:UHRF1 ratio (see <a href=\"#bib16\">Fang et al., 2016</a>), whereas we used quantitative FP to measure relative binding affinities and included unlabeled ligands in our experiments at concentrations at least five-fold over their measured K<sub>d</sub> values to ensure saturation."

To begin testing this hypothesis, we <i>in vitro</i> reconstituted UHRF1-mediated ubiquitylation using recombinant UHRF1, H3 peptides, Flag-tagged ubiquitin, and the ubiquitin conjugation enzymes E1 (Uba1) and E2 (UbcH5c) (for a review of the mechanism of ubiquitin activation see <a href=\"#bib47\">Schulman, 2011</a>).

                        "text": "There is a growing appreciation for the role of allosteric regulation of RING E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in the field of ubiquitin biology (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vittal et al., 2015</a>). Most often, the regulation of RING E3 ligases is accomplished through modulation of the E3 affinity for an E2-ub (thioesterified E2-ubiquitin) conjugate. Auto-inhibition release is the primary mechanism observed to date, in which steric occlusion of the RING domain prevents E3 interaction with the E2-ub until the E3 receives an appropriate release signal. Examples of RING auto-inhibition release include neddylation of Cullins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Duda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</a>), phosphorylation of Cbl (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dou et al., 2012</a>), and substrate/peptide mimetic binding to inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dueber et al., 2011</a>). Taking into consideration the above-described allosteric regulatory mechanism of E3 ligase activity, we first sought to determine whether the interaction with HeDNA could affect association with E2-ub. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we monitored the interaction between UHRF1 and E2-N-ub (isopeptide-linked C85K E2-ubiquitin conjugate) or <sup>15</sup>N-E2-O-ub (oxyesterified C85S E2-ubiquitin conjugate), respectively. Surprisingly, neither ITC nor NMR spectrum intensity loss measurements indicated a change in affinity for the E2 conjugates in the absence or presence of HeDNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, we readily observed UHRF1 auto-ubiquitylation in the presence of HeDNA and UnDNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating the RING domain of UHRF1 could productively interact with E2-ub regardless of the methylation status of the bound DNA. Notably, upon E3 binding to the conjugated E2, NMR resonances belonging to the conjugated ubiquitin did not suffer as great a loss in intensity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>), indicating that ubiquitin retained its dynamics when bound to the E3. This observation suggests that UHRF1 binding does not promote closed E2-ub states as strongly as other canonical RING domain E3\u2019s (<a href=\"#bib9\">Christensen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pruneda et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2012</a>)."

This alternative RING conformation stabilizes the E2-ub/RING complex, thereby enhancing ubiquitin discharge from the conjugated E2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">DaRosa et al., 2015</a>). To test whether HeDNA-induced UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity enhanced ubiquitin discharge from the conjugated E2, we performed single turnover ubiquitylation assays where purified E2-ub served as the ubiquitin donor and excess free lysine was present as a proxy ubiquitin substrate. The rate of ubiquitin discharge from E2 in these assays (monitored by the loss of the E2-ub and the appearance of free E2) showed only a modest increase in the reactivity of the conjugate in the presence of HeDNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results suggest that HeDNA-dependent activation of UHRF1 RING activity does not occur through enhancement of the intrinsic rate of ubiquitin discharge from the E2 to non-specific lysine sidechains."

Notably, we also observed a decrease in the amount of free ubiquitin and UHRF1 auto-ubiquitylation formed when peptide was present, presumably because more ubiquitin was being transferred to H3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

We previously demonstrated the interaction of the UHRF1 TTD-PHD with these potential substrates by peptide microarray (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rothbart et al., 2013</a>) and reasoned that the acetylated peptides would maintain interaction with the TTD-PHD but would be unable to accept ubiquitin. Neither the H3<sub>1-20</sub>K14acK18ac nor H3<sub>1-20</sub>K9acK14acK18ac were capable of being modified with ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Additionally, rapid E2-ub depletion was only observed in the sample containing H3<sub>1-20</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), indicating that substrate binding alone does not enhance the E3 ligase activity of UHRF1 in the presence of HeDNA. Consistent with our previous single turnover results (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), reactions that contained unblocked lysines on H3<sub>1-20</sub> accumulated less auto-ubiquitylated UHRF1 and free ubiquitin compared to assays with no peptide or with the acetylated H3 peptides (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), supporting a model where HeDNA alters the substrate specificity of UHRF1 ubiquitylation. It is worth noting that in all single and multiple turnover assays performed, virtually no ubiquitylated species of H3 were observed in assays that lacked HeDNA. Taken together, these data demonstrate that HeDNA stimulates UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity through a novel regulatory mechanism and suggest that HeDNA binding serves as an allosteric switch that directs the TTD-PHD bound H3 substrate to the E2-ub active site for transfer."

We confirmed this epigenetic link by immunoblotting HeLa mononucleosomes ubiquitylated by UHRF1. Ubiquitylated H3 was detected in the presence of HeDNA (but not UnDNA) on nucleosomes marked with H3K9me3, but not on nucleosomes marked with H3K9acK14ac (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In addition, titrating recombinant human histones H3, H2A, and H2B into ubiquitylation assays revealed that while UHRF1 could modify H2A and H2B at concentrations above 5\u2009\u03bcM, H3 could be modified at sub-micromolar concentrations, and H3K9me2 protein (synthesized by native chemical ligation) could be modified at even lower concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Taken together, these findings strongly support the role of H3K9 methylation in directing UHRF1 ubiquitylation to adjacent lysine residues in the presence of HeDNA. Other histone PTMs co-occurring on ubiquitylated peptides were: H3K23ac, also identified in another study (<a href=\"#bib38\">Qin et al., 2015</a>); H3K27me2, which often co-occurs with H3K9me2/me3 and is considered a hallmark of facultative heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boros et al., 2014</a>); H3K36ac, and H3K37me3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>).

While it remains to be seen whether uncoupling UHRF1 from HeDNA recognition changes its residence genome-wide, our studies show HeDNA sensing is not required to target UHRF1 to bulk chromatin. Rather, coordinated recognition of H3 and DNA, independent of HeDNA discrimination, drives chromatin interaction. We propose that the avidity resulting from sub-\u03bcM affinities of UHRF1 for both DNA and H3 peptides through reciprocal positive allostery provides a biochemical basis by which UHRF1 is exclusively localized on chromatin. This may also explain why small perturbations to histone binding affinity through the TTD-PHD (e.g., Linker<sup>mut</sup> and TTD aromatic cage mutation [<a href=\"#bib42\">Rothbart et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2012</a>]) so dramatically affect chromatin targeting of this protein."

RING activity towards H3 may be conformationally restricted when UHRF1 binds SyDNA or UnDNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, structures of the SRA domain from mouse UHRF1 (Np95) show this domain can adopt different conformations bound to UnDNA and HeDNA (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hashimoto et al., 2008</a>). Also the NKR finger of the UHRF1 SRA, which harbors the HeDNA<sup>mut</sup>, adopts a highly ordered conformation upon HeDNA binding (<a href=\"#bib3\">Avvakumov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hashimoto et al., 2008</a>). This allows for pseudo-base pairing to the exposed guanosine nucleotide (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and we hypothesize this stable finger conformation is critical for HeDNA-stimulated H3 ubiquitylation. Unfortunately, efforts to crystallize the enzymatically active conformation of UHRF1 proved unsuccessful.

Ubiquitin itself is a functional protein domain capable of participating a wide variety of protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harrison et al., 2016</a>) and can sterically occlude surfaces, as has been proposed for H2BK120ub in the formation of a productive complex with DOT1L (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2016</a>). Ubiquitin modifications are also dynamic and can be rapidly removed by deubiquitylases. In fact, recent analysis of ubiquitin turnover kinetics showed that the half-life of H2BK123ub in budding yeast is approximately one minute (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yumerefendi et al., 2016</a>). Thus, discovering the identity of the deubiquitylase that removes H3 ubiquitylation may provide key insight into the dynamics of DNA methylation regulation at the level of histone ubiquitylation. The initial study implicating H3 ubiquitylation in the inheritance of DNA methylation indirectly suggested that USP7 may be responsible for this function through interaction with DNMT1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nishiyama et al., 2013</a>). This is notable, as USP7 has also been shown to interact with UHRF1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, recent studies have tied USP7 to DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lecona et al., 2016</a>) and the maintenance of heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mungamuri et al., 2016</a>), providing a biological link to replication-coupled inheritance of DNA methylation.

Unless otherwise indicated, peptide concentrations were 13\u2009\u03bcM, and HeDNA, SyDNA, and UnDNA concentrations were 3\u2009\u03bcM, 10\u2009\u03bcM, and 40\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. Assays were performed at 25\u00b0C and quenched after 20\u2009min with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-Mercaptoethanol, 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue). Reactions were ran on 16% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and visualized using fluorescent imaging of immunoblots probed for FLAG-ubiquitin with FLAG (Sigma #F3165, 1:5000; St. Louis, MO or BioLegends #637304, 1:5000; San Diego, CA) and Alexa Fluor 488 or 647 (Life Technologies 1:5,000;\u00a0Carlsbad,\u00a0CA) antibodies on a Typhoon Trio+ fluorescent scanner (GE Lifesciences). Histone peptide substrates were synthesized as previously described (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rothbart et al., 2013</a>). Recombinant histone proteins and mononucleosomes were obtained commercially from Epicypher (H2A, #15\u20130301; H2B, 15\u20130302; and H3.1, #15\u20130303; mononucleosomes, #16\u20130002; Research Triangle Park, NC). Allosteric activation of UHRF1 ubiquitylation activity towards histone peptides and nucleosomes was observed in more than ten independent experiments, and DNA and UHRF1 titrations were repeated three times. The activities of the mutant proteins were tested in five independent experiments with at least two protein preparations for each mutant. Rate measurements for UHRF1 ubiquitylation activities in the presence of HeDNA vs UnDNA were conducted three times with similar results as <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>."

The full mass scan (300 to 2000\u2009<i>m/z</i>) was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 with a maximum injection time of 500 ms, and MS/MS was performed in a data-dependent manner for the top 15 intense ions in the linear ion trap by collision-induced dissociation. Raw data were converted to mzXML format using ProteoWizard (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kessner et al., 2008</a>) and searched using the Crux pipeline (<a href=\"#bib30\">McIlwain et al., 2014</a>) (version 2.1.16867) against the human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot sequence database (downloaded on 2/20/15) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutet et al., 2007</a>). Search parameters were set as the following: peptides between 6 and 25 amino acids long with a precursor mass tolerance of 0.5 amu, no missed cleavages, fully-enzymatic Arg-C digestion, a static propionyl modification (+56.026215) on lysines, and a maximum of 4 variable modifications consisting of up to 2 lysine ubiquitinations (+58.016716), 2 methylations (+14.01565), 2 dimethylations (\u221227.994915), 2 trimethylations (\u221213.979264), 2 acetylations (\u221214.015644), 1 methionine oxidation (+15.99492), and 1 STY phosphorylation (+79.966331). The mass of propionyl was subtracted from variable lysine modification masses (except methylation) due to the already applied static propionyl modification.

Prior to execution of the Percolator algorithm supplied by Crux, deltaCn scores were re-computed using an alternate definition: deltaCn<sub>i</sub> = 1 \u2013 ((xcorr<sub>1</sub>-xcorr<sub>i</sub>) / xcorr<sub>1</sub>). This adjustment was performed because the similar mass of trimethylation and acetylation results in identical xcorr values for the low mass accuracy MS/MS spectra from linear ion traps, which then led to invalid deltaCn values with the default equation used by Percolator. After application of a 5% FDR threshold, peptides were further filtered by ensuring they had the expected retention time relative to peptides having the identical unmodified sequence. We used the following procedure. First, peptides with the same unmodified sequence were sorted in ascending order by their Percolator PEP (posterior error probability). Then, each peptide (starting from lowest to highest PEP) was accepted if at least one of its MS/MS scan\u2019s retention time was consistent relative to all currently accepted peptides having the same unmodified sequence. The expected relative retention time constraints were: ubiquitin &lt; dimethyl \u2264 trimethyl &lt; acetyl &lt; propionyl &lt; methyl, oxidation &lt; unmodified, and phosphorylation \u2264 unmodified. Peptides expected to have the same retention times were allowed to elute within 2\u2009min of each other. Finally, peptide H3K9me3 + K14ub was accepted after manual inspection of its corresponding MS/MS spectra, isotopic distribution, and its consistent retention time despite being above the 5% FDR threshold. Quantification was performed within Skyline (<a href=\"#bib28\">MacLean et al., 2010</a>) and the results were exported for further visualization and analysis using the R programming language. Proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD003983."

Images were collected in intermittent contact mode (AC mode) using AFM probes from NanoSensor (PPP-FMR, force constant = 2.8\u2009N/m). Images were analyzed using the Asylum Research AFM software package. The images were flattened to a second-degree polynomial to account for surface warping artifacts and volume analysis was performed using built-in particle analysis (a more detailed review of this methodology can be found here <a href=\"#bib40\">Ratcliff and Erie, 2001</a>). Volume distributions were plotted to a peak fit model and visualized using Origin 6.1 (origin labs).

Previous studies have implicated UHRF1binding to HeDNA to be important for the recruitment of UHRF1. However, in this very systematic biochemical study the authors find that HeDNA is an allosteric activator of UHRF1 expanding its lysine targets in histone H3. The work is well done and timely. In general the chromatin field considers protein interactions with epigenetic marks to be the basis for recruitment of chromatin modifiers. This study clearly indicates allosteric activation of chromatin modifiers needs to also be considered."

This protein has a well-established role in recognition of hemi-methylated DNA, association with H3K9me3 and subsequent recruitment of DNMT1 for methylation maintenance. In this paper they advance mechanistic understanding of UHRF1 activity and promote a model whereby hemi-methylated DNA (HeDNA) actively promotes UHRF1-mediated ubiquitylation of H3. First they show that while HeDNA discrimination mutants of UHRF1 are unable to sustain methylation in vivo, they are able to associated with chromatin. Next they provide evidence for positive allostery, showing that UHRF1 association with H3 is promoted by the presence of (He)DNA and visa versa. They provide a mechanism for this positive allostery, showing that the SRA and TTD-PHD domains normally associate with each other but that his interaction is abrogated in the presence of DNA, which presumably allows the free TTD-PHD domain to associate with its known chromatin target, H3K9me3. Next they provide compelling evidence that the presence HeDNA stimulates the ubiquitylation activity of UHRF1 on H3 substrate. To explain the stimulatory effect of HeDNA, they aim to provide evidence for 'lysine prioritization' (weakest part of the manuscript, see below). Finally, they use mass spectroscopy techniques to determine the PTMs associated with HeDNA simulated UHRF1 activity on nucleosomes."

However, I felt that the authors were overly dismissive of the results from the other group, despite their findings being largely complementary. In fact, some of the data presented here could be benefit from interpretation in context of the work of Fang et al. The main concern I have with this manuscript regards their lysine prioritization model, for which I believe their current supporting evidence to be insufficient (see below)."

This protein has a well-established role in recognition of hemi-methylated DNA, association with H3K9me3 and subsequent recruitment of DNMT1 for methylation maintenance. In this paper they advance mechanistic understanding of UHRF1 activity and promote a model whereby hemi-methylated DNA (HeDNA) actively promotes UHRF1-mediated ubiquitylation of H3. First they show that while HeDNA discrimination mutants of UHRF1 are unable to sustain methylation</i> in vivo<i>, they are able to associated with chromatin. Next they provide evidence for positive allostery, showing that UHRF1 association with H3 is promoted by the presence of (He)DNA and visa versa. They provide a mechanism for this positive allostery, showing that the SRA and TTD-PHD domains normally associate with each other but that his interaction is abrogated in the presence of DNA, which presumably allows the free TTD-PHD domain to associate with its known chromatin target, H3K9me3. Next they provide compelling evidence that the presence HeDNA stimulates the ubiquitylation activity of UHRF1 on H3 substrate. To explain the stimulatory effect of HeDNA, they aim to provide evidence for 'lysine prioritization' (weakest part of the manuscript, see below). Finally, they use mass spectroscopy techniques to determine the PTMs associated with HeDNA simulated UHRF1 activity on nucleosomes.</i> "

Importantly, for UnDNA-bound UHRF1, the rate of auto-ubiquitylation is greater than 20-fold faster than the rate of peptide ubiquitylation, while in the presence of HeDNA, peptide ubiquitylation is favored (7-fold over).
