Baboons don't tend to groom baboons from different social groups (much like humans), so social activities within a group act to consolidate shared communities of microbes."

Physical interactions with those we love feels good; hugs, kisses, and even basic skin-to-skin contact have positive influences on our thoughts and feelings. The hand-shake\u2014which is the standard mode of introduction in many societies\u2014represents this concept. But why did these interactions evolve? Are they purely social constructs, or is physical interaction instinctive, driven by some selective advantage? Sharing microbes in this way can be beneficial: for example, bumblebees living in the same hive share bacteria through fecal pellets (<a href=\"#bib3\">Koch and Schmid-Hempel, 2011</a>). This protects the bees from the virulent parasite <i>Crithidia bombi</i>, and therefore gives these bees a selective advantage over other bees that don't share bacteria."

The immune system aims to control the exposure of host tissues to the microbiome, which it does in part by directly interacting with the bacteria. For example, the protein immunoglobulin A is released into the gut, where it binds to certain species of bacteria: this reduces the ability of the bacteria to move and keeps them away from the cells of the intestine (<a href=\"#bib2\">Hooper et al., 2012</a>). It is likely that this mechanism is also used to capture certain beneficial microbes and retain them in the gut."

In fact, in one of the groups examined, a young couple was shown to have much more similar microbiomes on their skin and in their nose than a lodger living with them in their home: however, the lodger had more microbes in common with the couple than he did with anyone else in the study."

The microbiome of individuals living in the same indoor space can be shared through the air and via surfaces because humans are the main source of the microbes, and therefore most of the microbes in the space are readily able to colonize the human occupants."

Wild baboons are exposed to many different sources of microbes in their environment, and\u2014while their physical interactions may indeed help to share beneficial bacteria\u2014these other microbes are also likely to support their physical, immunological and neurological development."
