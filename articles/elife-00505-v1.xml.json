We report that in yeast mutants defective for transcription repression and RNA degradation, hybrid formation requires Rad51p and Rad52p. These proteins normally promote DNA\u2013DNA strand exchange in homologous recombination. We suggest they also directly promote the DNA\u2013RNA strand exchange necessary for hybrid formation since we observed accumulation of Rad51p at a model hybrid-forming locus. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Rad51p mediates hybridization of transcripts to homologous chromosomal loci distinct from their site of synthesis. This hybrid formation in <i>trans</i> amplifies the genome-destabilizing potential of RNA and broadens the exclusive co-transcriptional models that pervade the field. The deleterious hybrid-forming activity of Rad51p is counteracted by Srs2p, a known Rad51p antagonist. Thus Srs2p serves as a novel anti-hybrid mechanism in vivo."

However, Wahba et al. showed that if Rad51p is not properly regulated, it can also trigger the formation of RNA\u2013DNA hybrids; yeast cells that lack the gene for Rad51p showed significantly reduced levels of hybrid formation. Moreover, dysfunctional Rad51p causes RNA sequences to anneal to DNA throughout the genome, rather than just at the site in which the RNA was originally produced. This means that RNA sequences produced during transcription are much more of a threat to genomic stability than previously thought."

Recent studies suggest that these RNA biogenesis factors are not sufficient to prevent transient hybrid formation at some loci in wild-type budding yeast; rather, hybrids form but are removed rapidly by hybrid removal factors, including two endogenous RNase H enzymes, and Sen1p, an RNA\u2013DNA helicase (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mischo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wahba et al., 2011</a>).

The <i>cis</i> mechanism is supported by the co-transcriptional nature of many of the RNA biogenesis steps implicated in preventing hybrid formation.

Furthermore, the deleterious hybrid-forming activity of Rad51p is suppressed in wild-type cells by Srs2p, a Rad51p inhibitor. Additionally, we developed a model locus system that allows us to monitor hybrid-mediated genome instability as a result of transcription.

With the bacterial in vitro experiments in mind, we wondered whether hybrid formation was simply a strand exchange reaction, similar to that mediated by Rad51p during DNA repair and homologous recombination. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of deleting <i>RAD51</i> on hybrid formation and the associated genome instability in RNA biogenesis mutants of budding yeast. We chose a representative set of mutants defective in elongation (<i>leo1\u0394</i>), repression (<i>med12\u0394</i> and <i>sin3</i>\u0394), and degradation (<i>kem1</i>\u0394 and <i>rrp6</i>\u0394). We assayed directly for the presence of RNA\u2013DNA hybrids in wild-type cells and these mutants by staining chromosomes in spread nuclei with S9.6 antibody (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Previously, we demonstrated the specificity of the S9.6 antibody for hybrids by two approaches. First, S9.6 staining in spreads of RNA biogenesis mutants is reduced to that seen in wild-type cells by post treatment of chromosome spreads with RNase H (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wahba et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, spreads of an RNA biogenesis mutant over-expressing RNase H no longer stained with S9.6."

The deletion of <i>RAD51 (rad51\u0394)</i> in these mutants diminished S9.6 staining in nearly all nuclei from the RNA biogenesis mutants threefold to fourfold to near background levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To corroborate our cytological method, we isolated total nucleic acids from wild-type, <i>sin3\u0394</i> (a representative RNA biogenesis mutant), and <i>sin3\u0394 rad51\u0394</i> cells, transferred them to a solid matrix and monitored binding of S9.6. S9.6 binding to <i>sin3\u0394</i> nucleic acids was elevated approximately tenfold relative to <i>sin3\u0394 rad51\u0394</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

To measure hybrid-mediated genome instability, we exploited an assay we developed previously using a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wahba et al., 2011</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The total rate of YAC instability (the sum of chromosome loss and terminal deletions) in wild-type cells was 6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> per division. Notably, <i>rad51\u0394</i> alone caused no increase in YAC instability. In our subset of RNA biogenesis mutants, YAC instability increased fivefold to tenfold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The introduction of <i>rad51</i>\u0394 into the RNA biogenesis mutants completely suppressed the elevated YAC instability, both chromosome loss and terminal deletions, in <i>leo1\u0394</i>, <i>kem1\u0394</i>, <i>rrp6\u0394</i>, and <i>sin3\u0394</i> mutants. In <i>med12\u0394</i>, YAC instability was mostly but not entirely suppressed despite the near complete suppression of hybrid formation as monitored by spreads, indicating that in the <i>med12</i>\u0394 <i>rad51</i>\u0394 strain a subset of the YAC instability was hybrid independent. Overall, the suppression of hybrid-mediated chromosome instability by <i>rad51\u0394</i> corroborates its elimination of RNA\u2013DNA hybrids and associated destabilizing lesions."

Total nucleic acids were isolated from strains containing either the YAC or YAC-GALpr in the presence or absence of galactose. These samples were subjected to DNA immunoprecipitation (DIP) analysis with the S9.6 antibody that should only precipitate DNA in RNA\u2013DNA hybrids (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mischo et al., 2011</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Using primers specific to the YAC region proximal to the GALpr, low DIP signals were observed in YAC-GALpr cultures in the absence of galactose, as well as in cultures with the YAC, with and without the addition of galactose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, hybrids form rarely in the YAC sequences proximal to the GALpr in the absence of their transcription. In contrast, we observed a dramatic increase in the DIP signal for hybrids on the YAC sequences proximal to YAC-GALpr, 2 hr after induction by galactose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The specificity of this increased DIP signal was evident by the fact that no elevation in hybrid signal was detected in two regions of the YAC-GALpr distal to the GALpr (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Additionally, lower DIP signals coincide with the transcriptional start site of the GALpr, where there is little transcript detectable upon addition of galactose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Furthermore, the DIP signal in the YAC-GALpr strains was suppressed when transcription was repressed by the addition of glucose (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Finally, hybrid formation at YAC-GALpr was dependent upon RAD51 (see \u2018Rad51p-dependent hybrid formation can occur in trans\u2019). These data provide molecular evidence for the formation of RAD51-dependent hybrids at the YAC sequences transcribed by induction of GALpr."

Furthermore, this transcription-induced YAC instability was suppressed by over-expression of RNase H or deletion of <i>RAD51</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>). Thus both by DIP and YAC instability, hybrids induced by transcription at the model YAC-GALpr locus, like those induced by RNA biogenesis mutants, required Rad51p for their formation."

To test this prediction we used our YAC-GALpr model locus to assay for the presence of Rad51p binding around the site of hybrid formation. We generated cultures of strains containing the YAC or YAC-GALpr that had been grown in the presence or absence of galactose. These cultures were fixed and assayed for Rad51p binding to the YAC sequences by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). ChIP was performed using two independent antibodies, anti-HA against a C-terminal haemagglutinin (HA) tagged Rad51p and a polyclonal rabbit anti-Rad51p. No Rad51p binding was detected either on YAC-GALpr in the absence of galactose or on the YAC in the presence or absence of galactose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus the level of Rad51p binding to the YAC or vector sequences in the absence of transcription was very low if any. In contrast, using either antibody for ChIP, significant Rad51p binding was detected around the GAL promoter on YAC-GALpr upon the addition of galactose and induction of transcription (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Notably, Rad51p binding appears to extend further than the region of hybrid formation detected by DIP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Rad51p is known to spread from regions of ssDNA into dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zaitsev and Kowalczykowski, 2000</a>), and it is possible that in our model locus Rad51p is spreading from the ssDNA or RNA\u2013DNA hybrid into the neighboring dsDNA. To test further the correlation of transcription and Rad51p binding, we added dextrose to the galactose-treated YAC-GALpr cultures to repress galactose-induced YAC-GALpr transcription (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In these cultures, Rad51p binding disappeared (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taking these findings together, we observe Rad51p binding to the region of the hybrid-forming locus on the YAC-GALpr only when transcripts from this region are induced."

However, hybrids are thought to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs), and Rad51p binds at DSBs to initiate DNA repair through homologous recombination (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sugawara et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Therefore, the presence of Rad51p at the hybrid-forming locus might be due to its function in repair rather than in hybrid formation. To address this alternative explanation for Rad51p binding, we performed molecular and functional tests for the formation of DSBs 2 hr after the induction of transcription. As a molecular assay, we monitored a 20 kb region surrounding the GAL promoter for the accumulation of phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX) by ChIP. This modification is one of the most dramatic and earliest markers of DSB formation, arising within minutes and spanning large regions of chromatin adjacent to the break (<a href=\"#bib27\">Shroff et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). However, we did not detect a ChIP signal for \u03b3-H2AX above background level in the YAC-GALpr strain even under conditions that induced Rad51p binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus by this molecular assay Rad51p binding occurs at the site of hybrid formation prior to hybrid-induced DNA damage."

We reasoned that if Rad51p binding during the 2 hr prior to the addition of dextrose reflected Rad51p association with hybrid-induced DNA damage, then this damage would manifest as increased YAC instability. However, no increase in YAC instability was observed (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), indicating that binding of Rad51p to this locus during the first 2 hr was unlikely to result from DNA damage. Thus neither our molecular nor functional test supports the binding of Rad51p to the model locus prior to hybrid-induced DNA damage, pointing to a direct role of Rad51p in hybrid formation."

The latter fail to persist because of their rapid removal by RNases H and Sen1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mischo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wahba et al., 2011</a>). To test whether these naturally occurring hybrids are also dependent on Rad51p, we monitored hybrid staining and YAC instability in <i>rnh1\u0394rnh201\u0394</i> in the absence of <i>RAD51</i>. Neither hybrid staining nor YAC instability was suppressed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), indicating that the transient hybrids in wild-type cells are not Rad51p dependent.

However, YAC instability increased tenfold upon galactose-induced transcription of the YAC-GALpr module on chromosome III (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, black bars). The transcription-induced YAC instability was dependent on the homology between the YAC and the transcribed YAC sequences from the YAC-GALpr module on chromosome III, as deletion of the corresponding 1 kb of homology from the YAC completely suppressed the transcription-induced YAC instability (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The elevated YAC instability was blocked by RNase H over-expression, indicating the YAC instability was hybrid dependent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, gray bars). YAC instability was also blocked after introduction of the <i>rad51</i>\u0394 in LW7003 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

These DSBs in <i>cis</i> would induce recombination between the YAC sequences on the broken chromosome III and the YAC, resulting in a chromosome III;YAC translocation that has the same genetic phenotype (HIS+ URA\u2212) as YAC terminal deletions (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To determine what fraction of rearrangements may have occurred by this indirect mechanism, we performed pulse-field gel and Southern analysis on DNA isolated from 10 independent HIS+ URA\u2212 colonies of LW7003. Amongst the 10 YAC rearrangements analyzed, nine were shorter than the existing YAC, consistent with the formation of YAC terminal deletions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Only one rearrangement was the size expected if a chromosome III;YAC translocation had occurred. Thus the structure of most rearranged YACs in LW7003 is consistent with the formation of terminal deletions through the formation of hybrids in <i>trans</i>. These results further support our hypothesis that hybrids can form in <i>trans</i> by a Rad51p mechanism, causing chromosome instability at sites distinct from the site of hybrid RNA transcription."

First, cytological detection of RNA\u2013DNA hybrids in RNA biogenesis mutants is dramatically suppressed when <i>RAD51</i> is deleted. Second, Rad51p is required for the associated hybrid-mediated instability of a YAC in the RNA biogenesis mutants. Third, Rad51p is required for the hybrid formation and YAC instability that results from galactose-induced transcription of specific YAC sequences in our hybrid model locus. Fourth, cofactors canonically known to regulate Rad51p binding and function also modulate hybrid formation. Removal of Rad52p, a positive regulator of Rad51p, blocks hybrid formation. Conversely, the removal of Srs2p, a negative regulator of Rad51 filament formation, increases both hybrid formation and genome instability in a Rad51p-dependent manner. Finally, Rad51p binds to the YAC at the site of hybrid formation proximal to the galactose promoter, in a transcription-dependent manner, prior to any evidence that DSBs have formed. Taken together these results strongly suggest that Rad51p plays a direct role in RNA\u2013DNA hybrid formation."

Indications that a strand-exchange mechanism is important for hybrid formation were suggested by in vitro work on RecA, where RecA catalyzes assimilation of complementary RNA into a homologous region in duplex DNA (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kasahara et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Zaitsev and Kowalczykowski, 2000</a>). Interestingly, previous in vivo studies showed that over-expressing Rad51p can compromise genome integrity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Richardson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Shah et al., 2010</a>). We suggest that this instability may result in part from the ability of Rad51p to promote RNA\u2013DNA hybrid formation. This deleterious activity of Rad51p is also intriguing because a number of studies have shown that <i>RAD51</i> expression is up-regulated in tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Klein, 2008</a>). The increased expression is part of a coordinated up-regulation of DNA repair proteins in response to increased damage in cancerous cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Zhou and Elledge, 2000</a>). These high levels of Rad51p have been interpreted as evidence for Rad51p acting as a tumor suppressor by ensuring non-faulty repair of DNA damage. However, our results are consistent with a different interpretation: high levels of Rad51p may be oncogenic, driving hybrid-mediated genomic instability that promotes carcinogenesis."

In the forward reaction, the conventional mechanism for Rad51p action, it forms a filament on ssDNA, finds a homologous region of dsDNA, and then catalyzes a strand exchange (<a href=\"#bib31\">Sung, 1994</a>)<b>.</b> By analogy, Rad51p may form a filament on RNA and promote its invasion of dsDNA. However, the bacterial studies of RecA suggest an alternative mechanism in which Rad51 catalyzes RNA\u2013DNA hybrid formation through an inverse strand exchange reaction. In this case, RecA first binds to ssDNA in a gap, forms a filament on adjacent dsDNA, and then promotes pairing and exchange with complementary RNA. Each of these mechanisms has strengths and weaknesses to explain our current findings. For example, the forward reaction but not the inverse strand exchange predicts the association of Rad51p with the hybrid locus should depend upon the induction of the hybrid forming RNA, as we observe. Conversely, the DNA-based inverse strand reaction more easily explains the role of DNA-dependent Rad51p cofactors like Rad52p. Furthermore, in vitro RecA is unable to catalyze the forward reaction with RNA. Clearly an exciting future direction will be to determine the biochemical nature of Rad51p-mediated hybrid formation by either of these mechanisms or an alternative mechanism like stabilization of the R-loop by binding to the RNA\u2013DNA hybrid or the extruded DNA strand (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>)."

Thus RNA molecules, with the aid of Rad51p can invade duplex DNA to form RNA\u2013DNA hybrids at sites distinct from the site of hybrid RNA transcription. The ability of hybrids to form in <i>trans</i> forces a broadening of previous in vivo models for hybrid formation that only considered co-transcriptional mechanisms. The lower level of instability observed in <i>trans</i> compared to in <i>cis</i> implies that hybrid formation occurs less efficiently in <i>trans</i>. A lower efficiency might be expected since the RNA concentration at a <i>cis</i> site of hybrid formation will invariably be higher than at a <i>trans</i> site of hybrid formation. Indeed, an effect for RNA concentration on hybrid formation has been documented in the in vitro reactions with RecA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zaitsev and Kowalczykowski, 2000</a>). While we show that Rad51p is clearly required to mediate hybrid formation in <i>trans</i>, it is likely also important for hybrid formation in <i>cis</i>. However, the fact that <i>rad51\u0394</i> has no effect on hybrid formation in the <i>rnh1\u0394rnh201\u0394</i> mutant implies that alternative mechanisms for hybrid formation, presumably in <i>cis</i>, exist. Notably, hybrid formation in <i>trans</i> might be a more potent promoter of genome instability than hybrid formation in <i>cis</i>, particularly for hybrid RNA generated from a highly repetitive element, which in <i>trans</i> can cause instability at a plethora of targets."

It is unknown how the guide RNA finds and hybridizes to its homologous DNA region. From our work, it is clear that these two steps could be mediated through Rad51p.

The fact that hybrids form when any one of these anti-hybrid pathways is abrogated clearly indicates that they are not completely functionally redundant. The increased propensity for hybrids to form and cause instability at the rDNA locus in <i>srs2\u0394</i> cells is particularly intriguing, as it may be that the abundance of rRNA, as well as homologous rDNA loci, makes this region a particularly good substrate for Rad51p-mediated hybrid formation. When Rad51p activity is no longer limiting because of inactivation of Srs2p, hybrid formation may overwhelm the anti-hybrid activities of RNases H or Sen1p. Alternatively, the RNases H or Sen1 may be occluded from the nucleolus, making the rDNA locus more susceptible to hybrid formation by elevated Rad51p activity. It will be exciting to map where hybrids form in RNase H, <i>sen1-1</i> and <i>srs2\u0394</i> mutants to elucidate whether these different anti-hybrid systems are dedicated to protect different regions of the genome."

Briefly, 5 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cells were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Chromatin was sheared 20 times for 45 s each (settings at duty cycle: 20%, intensity: 10, cycles/burst: 200) with 30 s of rest in between using a Covaris S2. Immunoprecipitation of Rad51-HA or untagged Rad51p was done with anti-HA antibody (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) or anti-Rad51p polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX). Immunoprecipitation of \u03b3-H2a.X was done with anti-\u03b3-H2AX (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). A no primary antibody control is also run to ensure specificity. Appropriate dilutions of input and immunoprecipitated DNA samples were used for PCR analysis to ensure linearity of the PCR signal. PCR and data analysis was carried out as described previously (<a href=\"#bib33\">Unal et al., 2004</a>). With the exception of the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> which was carried out once, all experiments were done at least twice and a representative data set is shown.

Thus while in wt cells loss of Rad51 has no effect on hybrid formation (visualised by immunofluorescence using RNA:DNA hybrid specific antibody), in various mutant cells loss of Rad51 causes loss of hybrid signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This data is then complemented by use of an integrated human YAC from which recombination rates can be measured (based on a previous paper from Wahba et al, Mol Cell 2011)."

Induction by galactose growth promotes bidirectional transcription that correlates with YAC instability, an effect lost by deletion of RAD51 or RNase H over expression. Rad51 is shown to specifically localize to the YAC GAL1 promoter region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). A case is made that this localization is hybrid dependent but not caused by recruitment to DNA damage sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Another important result (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) is that these hybrid-induced DNA damage effects can be caused <i>in trans</i> by placing the GAL1 promoter plus adjacent human sequence on a yeast chromosome and then showing instability of the YAC (lacking GAL1 promoter). Finally a gene known to antagonise Rad51, Srs2, is also shown to cause hybrid formation in wt cells when deleted, presumably because Rad51 is more active."

The specificity of the antibody to RNA-DNA hybrids in chromatin spreads was demonstrated in our first paper (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wahba et al., 2011</a>) by showing that both in vivo over-expression as well as treatment of slides with RNase H reduces the signal to near background levels. Note that in the chromatin spreads, all cellular components with the exception of the chromatin is removed, and so the signal observed in the spreads are nuclear-specific. Furthermore, for a representative mutant we corroborated our results using the antibody to probe total nucleic acid on a membrane. Additionally, sensitivity of the S9.6 signal to RNase H treatment in ChIP/DIP was previously established by other labs (Hage et al., 2010 and <a href=\"#bib19\">Mischo et al., 2011</a>). Given the specificity of the antibody for RNA-DNA hybrids in our assays, the signal must be transcription dependent; otherwise, how does one make the RNA component of the hybrid? Furthermore, using our model locus assay, we also show transcription dependence of the elevated S9.6 signal as it occurs only upon galactose induction of transcription in the region."

The purpose of the RNA analysis is to define the domain of transcription that serves as a basis to evaluate the DIP and Rad51p ChIP. Importantly, the RNA analysis predicts hybrid formation and Rad51p binding on both sides of the GALpr, as we observe. Hybrids are confined to the region of transcription as expected, while interestingly Rad51p extends beyond the transcript/hybrid domain. The latter is not unprecedented as both in vitro and in vivo results indicate that Rad51p can polymerize into double stranded DNA from gaps, supporting the possibility that Rad51p during the formation or stabilization of R loops polymerizes onto adjacent DNA."
