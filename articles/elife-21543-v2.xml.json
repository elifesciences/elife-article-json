We sought to dissociate functionally the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex (LEC and MEC, respectively) in visual scene-dependent tasks by temporarily inactivating the LEC and MEC in the same rat. When the rat made spatial choices in a T-maze using visual scenes displayed on LCD screens, the inactivation of the MEC but not the LEC produced severe deficits in performance. However, when the task required the animal to push a jar or to dig in the sand in the jar using the same scene stimuli, the LEC but not the MEC became important. Our findings suggest that the entorhinal cortex is critical for scene-dependent mnemonic behavior, and the response modality may interact with a sensory modality to determine the involvement of the LEC and MEC in scene-based memory tasks."

Memory for the visual scene may function as the linchpin for explaining the involvement of the hippocampus in various cognitive tasks requiring spatial navigation, episodic memory, and imagining future events [see <a href=\"#bib37\">Maguire and Mullally (2013)</a> for review]. In our earlier studies, we confirmed that this involvement was also true in rats by showing that rats were impaired in making behavioral choices using background visual scenes when the dorsal hippocampus was inactivated by a GABA-A receptor agonist, muscimol (MUS) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Delcasso et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2014</a>).

                        "text": "Despite the significant involvement of the hippocampus in visual scene-dependent memory, the functional significance of its upstream structures, that is, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), is unclear. Because the entorhinal cortex (EC) provides major inputs to the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lavenex and Amaral, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Witter et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Knierim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kerr et al., 2007</a>), the EC is expected to play key roles in scene memory. However, the visual scene has not been considered a key factor in most theories for understanding information processing in the hippocampal system (but see <a href=\"#bib27\">Knierim et al., 2014</a>). Specifically, a majority of recent studies have been guided by a theory that proposed differential functions of the LEC and MEC for nonspatial and spatial memory, respectively (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hargreaves et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Knierim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Henriksen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ito and Schuman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Van Cauter et al., 2013</a>). According to the theory, the LEC receives more projections from the perirhinal cortex (PER), an area that is well known for its role in object recognition memory, and the LEC projects to the hippocampus and subiculum. The MEC receives most of the projections from the postrhinal cortex (POR), the rodent homolog of the parahippocampal cortex in primates and humans, and projects to the hippocampus and subiculum. It has been hypothesized that LEC-dependent nonspatial memory and MEC-dependent spatial memory are combined as an integrative memory representation within the hippocampus. Physiological studies that have reported differential functions between the LEC and MEC in recent years seemingly support this theoretical framework (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hargreaves et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Henriksen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ito and Schuman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsao et al., 2013</a>). For example, the presence of grid cells in the MEC is believed to provide key evidence in support of the spatial functions of the MEC (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>), and the cells in the LEC fire in a nonspatial manner (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hargreaves et al., 2005</a>)."

That is, the POR is characterized as receiving \u2018visuospatial\u2019 sensory information, and the visual scene may belong to this information category (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</a>). Because nonspatial information is often characterized based on individual sensory attributes (e.g., olfactory, tactile, and auditory information) from the unimodal and polymodal sensory areas (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</a>) that may be associated more with individual objects than scenes, the existing theory may predict that visual scene-dependent memory is uniquely processed by the spatial information-processing stream involving the POR and MEC, but not the PER and LEC. Although this idea might be supported indirectly by behavioral studies testing animals with spatial or contextual memory tasks (<a href=\"#bib38\">Majchrzak et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hunsaker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Van Cauter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Morrissey and Takehara-Nishiuchi, 2014</a>), visual scene has hardly been systematically controlled in prior studies that examined the functions of the LEC and MEC."

For example, if one makes lesions in the POR or MEC and obtains performance deficits in a behavioral task (usually a spatial navigation task), it is difficult to know whether the animal made errors because visuospatial sensory information processing was impaired or because the lesions damaged the response component associated with making spatial choices. The dominant theory seemingly divides the spatial and nonspatial information-processing streams based on the characteristics of sensory information (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burwell and Amaral, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Witter et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eichenbaum et al., 2012</a>), but this division may be an oversimplification of how the brain works. Examining this issue requires testing animals in various memory tasks that share the same sensory stimuli but require different motor responses (e.g., spatial versus nonspatial responses)."

We used a scene-dependent spatial choice (SSC) task and a scene-dependent nonspatial choice (SNSC) task because, based on our prior studies (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Delcasso et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2014</a>), both tasks are hippocampal-dependent but they require spatial and nonspatial responses, respectively. If visual scene memory is exclusively processed in the MEC, inactivating the MEC, but not the LEC, should result in severe deficits in performance in both SSC and SNSC tasks. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we report a functional double dissociation between the LEC and MEC in visual scene memory. Our results suggest that visual scene information is not uniquely processed in the MEC, and the type of motor response also seems to be important in determining the involvement of entorhinal subdivisions in scene memory tasks."

When MUS was injected into the LEC (LEC-MUS) on the next day, performance did not significantly change. However, MUS injections into the MEC (MEC-MUS) on the following day significantly impaired rats\u2019 performance. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of the drug (F<sub>(2,14)</sub> = 19.3, p&lt;0.0001). A Bonferroni-Dunn <i>post-hoc</i> test revealed significant differences in performance between animals in the vehicle group and the MEC-MUS group (p&lt;0.0001), as well as between the LEC-MUS and MEC-MUS groups (p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in choice latency among the drug conditions (F<sub>(2,14)</sub> = 0.2, p=0.8; repeated-measures ANOVA), suggesting that the impairment in performance in the MEC-MUS condition was not attributable to generic sensory-motor deficits. Furthermore, the MEC-MUS did not disrupt the rat\u2019s capability of associating spatial responses with any type of sensory stimulus because the same rats were able to make spatial choices (i.e., left and right turns) normally under the MUS conditions when tactile cues (wire mesh or sandpaper) were used as cues instead of visual scenes (F<sub>(2,18)</sub> = 1.39, p=0.27; repeated-measures ANOVA) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>)."

Because several studies have described the roles of the LEC in item-based memory (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hunsaker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Keene et al., 2016</a>), the performance deficits of the animals in the LEC-MUS group during the SNSC task might be attributable to the involvement of the object, but not necessarily to the involvement of visual scene-based memory. Therefore, to test whether the object factor alone (without scenes) could result in performance deficit, we tested subsets of rats from both tasks (n\u00a0=\u00a06 from the SSC task and n\u00a0=\u00a03 from the SNSC task) in an object-based nonspatial choice task (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In this task, rats were required to push or dig the sand-filled jar after sampling an object cue attached to the jar. The task thus required the rats to use the same response type (i.e., digging and pushing responses) used in the SNSC task, but instead of using background visual scenes, rats made choices using only objects as cues."

These results clearly demonstrate that neither subdivision of the EC was necessary when rats used a single object to make a digging versus pushing response to the jar. The performance level under aCSF (mean\u00a0=\u00a092.9%) in the object memory task was equivalent to the performance levels of the control conditions in the SSC (mean\u00a0=\u00a092.8%) and SNSC (mean\u00a0=\u00a091.7%) tasks (F<sub>(2,23)</sub> = 0.13, p=0.88; ANOVA), suggesting that the null effect of MUS in the object memory task was not attributable to the ceiling effect for performance in the control condition. The results also demonstrate that the digging and pushing behaviors themselves were not necessarily affected by MUS injections into the LEC or MEC. Our findings thus suggest that the performance impairment observed in animals that received the MUS injection into the LEC in the SNSC task may not be solely based on the presence of the object variable compared to the SSC task."

However, the MEC-MUS rats were normal in making spatial choices in response to tactile cues. These findings strongly suggest that the MEC is critically involved in using background <i>visual scenes</i> for making spatial responses (e.g., left or right turn response). It is possible that the rodent POR is uniquely involved in scene information processing, as in the parahippocampal cortex in humans (<a href=\"#bib12\">Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998</a>), and the MEC, a downstream structure of the POR, is also heavily involved in processing scene representations. However, because MEC-MUS rats were not impaired on the SNSC task, the MEC may not be responsible for simply processing visual scenes in any type of behavior. Instead, our SSC task required the rat to associate external visual scene information with an egocentric spatial response (left or right turn). Considering that the MEC is connected to a number of areas in the brain that process idiothetic spatial information (e.g., the parasubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, etc.) (<a href=\"#bib40\">McNaughton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Knierim et al., 2014</a>), the performance deficits observed in the current study with MEC-MUS in the SSC task might be related to the roles of the MEC in associating egocentric spatial information with visual scenes. Our experimental data from the tactile memory task suggest that such associative function of the MEC is uniquely related to visual scenes because the MEC was not involved in associating tactile cues with egocentric responses. By contrast, the LEC is not connected to those egocentric spatial areas, which may explain why the LEC was not significantly involved in the SSC task. Our results suggest that the hippocampus relies heavily on MEC inputs in order for the rat to perform the SSC task normally."

The significant decrease in performance in the SNSC task after MUS injections in the LEC (but not in the MEC) may support those previous findings because the rat should make discrete choices when facing the common (thus ambiguous) object in the current task, and only the visual scene information disambiguated which response was appropriate. The presence of the object by itself may not explain the MUS-induced deficits in the LEC because, as shown in prior studies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Van Cauter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wilson et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2013b</a>), using an object alone as a cue did not produce a significant impairment in performance in the LEC-MUS group in our object memory task. It is possible that the LEC becomes critical when object-associated ambiguity should be reduced using scene or contextual information. In a spontaneous object exploration paradigm, object ambiguity may increase as an animal experiences more objects in the same environment (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hunsaker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Van Cauter et al., 2013</a>). In our study, the object-associated ambiguity may stem from the task demand that two different behavioral responses should be conditionally emitted to the same object."

It is possible that the inactivating agent injected through the laterally implanted cannulae near the cortical surface may have been leaked partially to the cortical surface instead of being fully injected into the LEC. It is also possible that the deeper layers of the LEC play more important roles in the SNSC task than the superficial layers of the LEC, possibly because the deeper layers of the LEC receive the inputs from the distal CA1 and thus may have access to both object and place information, which may in\u00a0turn\u00a0play critical roles in contextually responding to an object in different contexts."

However, visual cortices were mostly spared. For MEC cannulae, visual cortices were partially damaged. Despite the cortical damage, however, rats performed the tasks very well when aCSF was injected, and this normal performance in the control condition strongly argues against the possibility that MUS effects might be due to the damage in the overlying cortices. Attention and visual capabilities were apparently normal based on the performance data from the control conditions. We also saw no relationships between the amount of damage and the severity of the MUS effects in our study."

Permanently damaging a region in the brain by using these methods may induce plastic changes in the functionally related neural circuits, and therefore, the results from these studies may not reflect the normal functions of a brain selectively devoid of the target region (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ramirez and Stein, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cassel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lavenex et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Braun et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Otchy et al., 2015</a>). The temporary inactivation of a brain region with the use of an inactivating agent, such as MUS or lidocaine, is relatively free from such caveats because normal circuits are preserved during testing. More importantly, the reversible inactivation method allows for the comparison of the normal mode of operation of the circuit (by injecting vehicle solution) with its inactivated mode within the same animal, as opposed to the between-group comparisons that can only be performed in lesion studies. Surprisingly, to our knowledge, no experimental study has used the reversible inactivation for either the LEC or MEC to examine spatial versus nonspatial memory functions in those regions, although some studies have used the methods to test the roles of the LEC in the eye-blink conditioning paradigm (<a href=\"#bib42\">Morrissey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tanninen et al., 2013</a>)."

The results of the current study largely verified experimental findings separately reported in prior studies and imply that a significant portion of the MEC-dependent deficits previously reported could be attributed to the roles of the MEC in the association of external visual contextual information with egocentric or path-integrative information (<a href=\"#bib46\">Parron et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hargreaves et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brun et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Van Cauter et al., 2013</a>). Our findings also indicate that the LEC may play an important role in contextual response to an object using background visual scene or context. This conjecture may find support in the literature because lesions targeting the LEC did not appear to produce memory deficits when objects and places had to be remembered independently from each other, but produced deficits when objects were required to be recognized in association with places or context (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hunsaker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Van Cauter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wilson et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2013b</a>)."

The unique contribution of the hippocampus may come from other cognitive processes instead, including pattern completion and separation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Marr, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>), temporal processing of events (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eichenbaum, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2016</a>), and value-based decision making (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mizumori and Tryon, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Palombo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schumacher et al., 2016</a>), when receiving inputs from upstream structures.

Our study suggests that, instead of representing \u2018what\u2019 information, the LEC may process \u2018what should I do to this object in this context?', whereas the MEC may represent \u2018where should I go from here in this context?'"

The activity of the sensor led to a visual scene display (e.g., pebbles or zebra stripes) on the LCD monitors. Rats were trained to choose the right arm for the pebbles scene and the left arm for the zebra stripes scene. A correct choice resulted in a piece of cereal available in the food well (when displaced by the rat). The rat was trained to consume the reward in the start box after being guided back into the start box. A wrong choice resulted in the rat being returned to the start box without a reward. Each scene appeared, in a pseudo-randomly intermixed fashion for 20 trials in a daily session. The rat was trained until its performance level reached greater than 80% correct responses per scene or above 75% correct responses on average for all scenes, with a response bias of less than 0.15. The response bias was calculated by first subtracting the number of right response-associated trials from left response-associated trials and then dividing the difference by the sum of the trials. When the rat reached the performance criterion for the first pair of scene stimuli for two consecutive days, the animal was trained with the second pair of scene stimuli, e.g., mountain and bamboo patterns, until it reached the same criterion level with the first pair of scene stimuli. Then, when the rat reached the performance criteria for both the first and the second scene pairs, all four scenes were pseudo-randomly presented across trials to train the rat until it reached greater than 80% correct responses for each scene."

The 3D complex was composed of four stainless steel guide cannulae targeting both the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) bilaterally. First, the rat was deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, 65 mg/kg), and its head was fixed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, USA). Anesthesia was then maintained by isoflurane inhalation (0.5\u20132% isoflurane mixed with 100% O<sub>2</sub>) throughout the surgery. An incision was made along the midline of the scalp and the skull was exposed. The skull surface was leveled after adjusting the levels of bregma and lambda on the same horizontal plane. Six small burr holes were made on the skull to place anchoring skull screws to hold the 3D-printed cannula complex with dental cement. Four burr holes were also drilled to insert the guide cannulae of the cannula complex into the LEC and the MEC at the following coordinates: 5.9 mm posterior to bregma, 6.8 mm lateral to midline, 6.4 mm ventral from dura for the LEC, and 7.8 mm posterior to bregma, 4.8 mm lateral to midline, 5.9 mm ventral from dura. Following insertion of the guide cannulae into the target areas, medical grade silicone (Kwik-Sil, World Precision Instruments, USA) was applied to fill the burr holes to block the influx of dental cement into the exposed area of the brain during the cementing procedures. Dental cement was then applied to the skull surface to firmly hold the 3D-printed cannula complex. The rat was allowed to recover for 7 days before behavioral testing began."

Then, on the next day, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) was injected into the EC (i.e., both the LEC and the MEC, 0.3 \u03bcL per site) 20 m before behavioral testing. The vehicle solution was injected into both the LEC and MEC in the current study because our prior pilot studies showed no difference in performance between the two conditions. More importantly, prolonging the testing period with aCSF might carry the risk of overtraining the rats, which we wanted to avoid to properly test the functions of the LEC and MEC while those areas were engaged in the normal performance of the task. Over the next two days, the same animal received an injection of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol (MUS) into the LEC and then into the MEC (0.3 \u03bcL per site), or vice versa (the injection sequence was counterbalanced among the rats)."

The brain was extracted from the skull and was soaked in 4% v/v formaldehyde-30% sucrose solution at 4\u00b0C until it completely sank. The brain was then gelatin-coated and soaked again in a 4% v/v formaldehyde solution-30% sucrose solution at 4\u00b0C until it completely sank.

In the first (spatial) task, the visual scene told the rat whether to turn right or left in a T-maze. In the second task, the visual scene told the rat whether to push a jar or to dig in that jar. The results revealed that MEC inactivations induced a strong deficit in the first task, but not in the second task and that LEC inactivations induced a relatively smaller deficit in the second task, but no deficit in the first task.

One of the rats was not usable because the rat\u2019s cannula in the left LEC was blocked by a broken dummy cannula, but three rats\u2019 data were successfully obtained and their cannula positions were located in the LEC correctly (Rats# 455, 457, and 458 in our raw data summary table). Adding these rats\u2019 data to the original data set made the statistical results more significant compared to our original manuscript. That is, a repeated-measures ANOVA showed highly significant effects of the drug condition (F<sub>(2,16)</sub>=10.1, p = 0.001; improved from p = 0.02 in the original manuscript) and there were significant differences in performance between aCSF and LEC-MUS conditions (p &lt; 0.001; improved from p &lt; 0.01 in the original manuscript) and also between LEC-MUS and MEC-MUS conditions (p &lt; 0.01; improved from p = 0.05 in the original manuscript).

Specifically, two of the rats (rat# 455, 457) in these rats showed severe performance deficits, but one rat (rat# 458) showed only a mild deficit in the SNSC task although all three rats had their LEC cannulae implanted in the LEC. We observed this pattern repeatedly, where some rats were severely impaired while other rats were only mildly affected by MUS in the LEC in both the original experimental period and the additional data-collecting period. The large individual difference underlies the greatest variability in performance data in the LEC-MUS condition in the current study (revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Therefore, we checked whether cannula positions in different rats might have affected the amount of severity in performance deficit. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> of our revised manuscript shows the LEC cannula tip positions in all the rats (n=9). Comparing the cannula positions together with the summary table for the raw data suggests that the rats (rat# 362,404,417,458) showing seemingly mild or no deficits in the LEC-MUS condition compared to the aCSF condition had their LEC cannulae implanted mostly in the lateral edges of the LEC along the superficial layers. However, the LEC cannula-tips of the rats (rat# 341,361,403,455,457) that showed relatively severe deficits with LEC-MUS compared to the aCSF condition were located more medially targeting deeper layers in the LEC (revised <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Confirming these observations, when we compared the performance levels of the rats with medially vs. laterally placed LEC cannulae, there was no significant difference in performance between the two groups in aCSF conditions (t<sub>(<a href=\"#bib7\">7</a>)</sub> = 0.3, p = 0.77) (revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, MUS injections into the LEC induced a significant difference in performance between the medial and lateral cannula groups (t<sub>(<a href=\"#bib7\">7</a>)</sub> = -4.35, p &lt; 0.01) (revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

First of all, in our response above, we verified the originally reported results by showing that adding more rats (n=3) to the original data set made our statistical results more compelling compared to the original manuscript (with p-values improved from 0.02 to 0.001 in repeated-measures ANOVA). Second, we also showed in our revised manuscript that the rats showing seemingly intact performance in the LEC-MUS condition had their cannulae mostly in the lateral edges of the LEC along more superficial layers. In contrast, the rats showing more severe performance deficits in the same drug conditions had their cannula tips placed more medially along deeper layers of the LEC. Based on our histological results, we think it is unlikely that our LEC-MUS impaired performance through other unknown areas because LEC cannula tips were all within the LEC region. Third, regarding the comments of R.E. that the spread of fluorescent MUS (f-MUS) might be underestimating the real diffusion range of MUS, we completely agree with the comment, and this has been shown by the Brown group (Allen et al., 2008). However, for the suggestion of running additional rats with f-MUS injected in the LEC, our prior experience with prolonged injections of f-MUS in rats in this type of behavioral paradigm (i.e., injecting MUS and testing rats for multiple days) taught us that such protocol sometimes caused health problems in rats for unknown reasons. In that case, it is difficult to attribute resulting performance deficits specifically to inactivation of the local area. Furthermore, injecting f-MUS for behavioral testing requires usually 40 min of diffusion time (which is twice longer than the MUS injection protocol), compared to 20 min with regular MUS in the current study, and the lipophilic nature of f-MUS makes drug spread uneven (Allen et al., 2008). Our experience is also that f-MUS appears to show bigger upward spread along the cannula track compared to regular MUS and thus may require larger injection quantity compared to regular MUS. With these known caveats of using f-MUS in behavioral testing, we decided not to run our rats with f-MUS injections. Since the fluorescent photomicrographs might underrepresent the real diffusion range of MUS (and this is visible in our histological data) and the cannula tracks are clearly visible in the photomicrographs of the Nissl-stained sections, we removed the fluorescent photomicrographs in our revised manuscript."

That is, in the SSC task, the rat\u2019s response is purely spatial, but not in the SNSC task. Once trained, the rat does not stop at the choice point of the T-maze before making a choice in the SSC task, but it does pause briefly in front of the sand-filled jar before making a response in the SNSC task. When one observes the error trials in the SNSC task in the video (starting from 43s in the video), compared to the normal trials, the rat injected with MUS in the LEC appeared to make hesitating or up/down responses in front of the jar. In the zebra-stripe trial (starting from 53s in the video), the rat even correctly chose to dig in the sand initially but then came down and push the jar to make an error (which suggests that the rats were not using olfactory cues from the reward buried in the sand in our task). This behavior is observed when the rats were injected with MUS in the LEC and may suggest that LEC inactivation may play critical roles when an animal chooses a response to an object in a contextual manner. Our study suggests that the digging-pushing behavior itself is not LEC-dependent because the LEC was not required when the same behavioral responses were cued by an object, but not visual context, in the object-based choice task (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

The box plot of the LEC-MUS condition made the large variance in the data more visible, and this turned out to be attributable to the fact that performance levels of some rats were severely affected by LEC-MUS than those of other rats. This discrepancy was related to their LEC cannula positions based on our additional analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). See details in our response to the Reviewing Editor above. Power analysis might not tell us much information regarding this issue mainly because our study used a within-subject testing paradigm. Specifically, based on our power analysis with the following parameters (effect size f=5.505; \u03b1 error probability=0.05; power=0.95; the <i>number of group=1</i>; the number of measurements=3; correlation among representative measures=0.360; non-sphericity correction=1), one could obtain the actual power of 0.99 with only the sample size of 2. Our extensive experience with behaviorally testing rats with within-subject testing designs has taught us that n of 6 to 8 is usually sufficient to draw firm conclusion when using behavioral tasks in which rats were pre-trained to criterion across many days before being tested with drug injections (Lee &amp; Solivan, 2008; Jo &amp; Lee, 2010; Kim &amp; Lee, 2011; Yoon et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012; Lee &amp; Shin, 2012; Lee et al., 2014).

Regarding reviewer 2\u2019s comment on the possibility that the object memory task might be easier than the scene-based tasks, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer\u2019s comment. First of all, reviewer 2 mentioned that performance was much higher in the object task, but we do not understand what this comment was based on. Specifically, when comparing aCSF performance across the tasks, we see no significant differences among the tasks; the mean performance was 92.8% for SSC, 91.7% for SNSC, and 92.9% for the object task (F<sub>(2,23)</sub>=0.13, p = 0.88; ANOVA). So, normal performance was not much higher in the object task compared to the SSC and SNSC tasks. More importantly, in our recent study using the same object task for testing the differential roles of the perirhinal cortex and postrhinal cortex, there was dissociation in performance under MUS infusions in the object memory task (Park et al., 2016, SFN); MUS significantly impaired performance when injected into the perirhinal cortex, but not in the postrhinal cortex. These results may argue against the comment of the reviewer (i.e., ceiling effect-based null effect), and we have added these contents in our revised manuscript (subsection 2 No involvement of the LEC and MEC when an object alone cued choice behavior\u201d, last paragraph)."

Specifically, based on our surgical coordinates, the LEC cannulae inevitably damaged some of the auditory cortices, the TE, and the perirhinal cortex. Visual cortices were mostly spared. For MEC cannulae, some visual cortices were damaged. Importantly, despite the cortical damage, rats performed the tasks very well when aCSF was injected, and this normal performance in the control condition strongly argues against the possibility that MUS effects were due to the overlying cortical damage. Attention and visual capabilities were obviously normal based on the performance data from the control conditions. We also see no relationships between the amount of cortical damage and the severity of the MUS effects in our study.

Since our lab has shown that the dorsal hippocampus is critical for using a visual scene to make a spatial or nonspatial choice conditionally, we wanted to test whether its upstream input regions also played critical roles. We\u2019d like to emphasize that visual scene has never been systematically used in rodent literature for testing the entorhinal functions and our study is the first one that systematically used the visual scene as the major variable for testing the differential functions of the LEC and MEC. Prior studies assumed that visual scene could be used during spatial navigation, but this has never been directly tested."

We originally tested the rats in a tactile-version of the T-maze task and confirmed that the rats with the MEC inactivated with MUS were normal compared to the aCSF condition in making spatial choices in the T-maze by using a tactile cue (wire mesh or sandpaper in the stem of the maze). Considering the reviewer\u2019s comment, these results are important to show that the MEC\u2019s involvement is specific to the condition where visual scenes should be associated with spatial responses and we added the results from the tactile memory task in our revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and subsection \u201cDouble dissociation between the LEC and MEC in visual scene-based choice behavior\u201d, first paragraph). Then, our question became whether the MEC was also important when visual scene should be associated with nonspatial choice behavior. So we tested rats in a different scene-based task (i.e., SNSC task) that had relatively little spatial response component. We used the SNSC task specifically because we knew through our previous study that inactivating the dorsal hippocampus prevented rats from exhibiting normal performance in that task. As a result, we saw that the LEC-MUS impaired performance in the SNSC task, whereas no impairment was seen with the MEC-MUS in the same rats."
