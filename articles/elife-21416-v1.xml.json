In a mouse model of chronic social isolation, a known risk factor for depressive illness, we show that 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus are less responsive to stimulation. Probing the responsible cellular mechanisms pinpoints a disturbance in the expression and function of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels and reveals an important role for both SK2 and SK3 channels in normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability. Chronic social isolation renders 5-HT neurons insensitive to SK2 blockade, however inhibition of the upregulated SK3 channels restores normal excitability. In vivo, we demonstrate that inhibiting SK channels normalizes chronic social isolation-induced anxiety/depressive-like behaviors. Our experiments reveal a causal link for the first time between SK channel dysregulation and 5-HT neuron activity in a lifelong stress paradigm, suggesting these channels as targets for the development of novel therapies for mood disorders."

In a mouse model of chronic social isolation, a known risk factor for depressive illness, we show that 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus are less responsive to stimulation. Probing the responsible cellular mechanisms pinpoints a disturbance in the expression and function of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels and reveals an important role for both SK2 and SK3 channels in normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability. Chronic social isolation renders 5-HT neurons insensitive to SK2 blockade, however inhibition of the upregulated SK3 channels restores normal excitability. In vivo, we demonstrate that inhibiting SK channels normalizes chronic social isolation-induced anxiety/depressive-like behaviors. Our experiments reveal a causal link for the first time between SK channel dysregulation and 5-HT neuron activity in a lifelong stress paradigm, suggesting these channels as targets for the development of novel therapies for mood disorders."

When active, these nerve cells release serotonin; this in turn controls the cells\u2019 own activity as well as the activity of a large number of connected nerve cells located throughout the brain. Any disruption in this system will have a widespread impact and can potentially increase the risk of disturbed moods. However, it was not exactly clear what alters the activity of serotonin-producing nerve cells in depression."

Keeping mice isolated for a prolonged period elicits the symptoms of depression. Sargin et al. found that serotonin-producing nerve cells were dramatically less active in isolated mice and that a specific type of ion channel protein (the SK3 channel) was more abundant in these nerve cells.

Blocking these inhibitory SK3 channels (using a drug that can be obtained from bee venom) restored normal activity in the serotonin-producing cells. Moreover, this treatment alleviated the depressive symptoms of the isolated mice."

Social isolation has long been implicated as a risk factor for depression in humans (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cacioppo et al., 2002</a><a href=\"#bib12\">,2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010</a>) and induces anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in rodents (<a href=\"#bib31\">Koike et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wallace et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shimizu et al., 2016</a>; for review see <a href=\"#bib23\">Fone and Porkess, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lukkes et al., 2009</a>). The most frequently prescribed medications for depression and anxiety disorders target the serotonin (5-HT) producing neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blier et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nutt, 2005</a>), the majority of which are located in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Descarries et al., 1982</a>). The activity of 5-HT neurons is highly vulnerable to stress (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lira et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bambico et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Espallergues et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Challis et al., 2013</a>) and is critical for depressive-like, anxiogenic, and reward-associated behaviors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Teissier et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Urban et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, social isolation in rodents has been shown to affect endogenous 5-HT release and 5-HT turnover in postsynaptic areas (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heidbreder et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Muchimapura et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2003</a>). However, it is unknown how social isolation affects the activity of DRN 5-HT neurons themselves. Identification of changes in the activity of these neurons may uncover novel therapeutic targets for depression and anxiety disorders."

Their firing activity to optical, electrophysiological, and neuromodulatory stimulation are all reduced after social isolation.

Furthermore, inhibition of SK channels normalizes the activity of 5-HT neurons and restores the behavioral deficits observed after chronic social isolation."

Mice were single-housed after weaning for \u22657 weeks and group-housed littermates were used as controls. A striking difference was observed in 5-HT neuronal excitability to depolarizing current steps, with significantly fewer action potentials generated in 5-HT neurons from single-housed mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). This difference did not arise from altered membrane characteristics (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>) nor altered GABA tone, as probed with picrotoxin and CGP52432 used to block GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The inhibitory current responses to the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist 5-CT were comparable between the groups (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B</a>). Furthermore, the social isolation-induced difference in the intrinsic excitability of 5-HT neurons persisted in the presence of\u00a05-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor blockade with WAY100635, indicating that this change does not result from altered serotonergic tone nor altered 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E</a>)."

Furthermore, the pacemaker activity of 5-HT neurons in vivo as well as their firing activity on slice is largely dependent on noradrenergic tone (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baraban et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2005</a>). To examine whether chronic social isolation perturbs the firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons in response to excitatory neuromodulation, we investigated the effects of orexinB and phenylephrine, which act respectively on hypocretin2 and \u03b11-adrenergic receptors. Application of orexinB or phenylephrine on slice depolarized the majority of 5-HT neurons to threshold and elicited action potentials. Quantification of spike frequency revealed a significant suppression in the peak orexinB (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>) and the peak phenylephrine effect (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B,D</a>) in 5-HT neurons of single-housed mice. These differences in neuromodulator-elicited excitability do not appear to reflect altered efficacy of the receptors nor channel effectors, since upon voltage-clamp examination both neuromodulators produced robust inward excitatory currents comparable between groups (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E\u2013H</a>). Taken together, 5-HT neurons from single-housed mice generated significantly reduced action potential frequency in response to stimulation of typical excitatory neuromodulator receptors, suggesting a disturbance in modulation and firing activity in response to excitatory inputs."

Both subtypes are sensitive to apamin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al., 2012</a>); but SK2 can be blocked selectively with a novel toxin Lei-Dab7 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shakkottai et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aidi-Knani et al., 2015</a>).

We demonstrate that inhibiting SK channels, critical regulators of AHP in these cells, can reverse the reduced excitability. This work provides the first direct link between a chronic social isolation paradigm and functional alterations in 5-HT neurons themselves. We also reveal that SK2 contributes to normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability but ceases to modulate these neurons significantly after chronic stress. Behavioral analysis showed that chronic social isolation increases anxiety/depression-like behaviors, which can be normalized upon inhibition of SK channels by acute systemic apamin."

Administration of the SK channel blocker apamin in mice and rats reduced immobility in a forced swim test (<a href=\"#bib24\">Galeotti et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van der Staay et al., 1999</a>), a measure of depressive-like behavior in rodents (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cryan and Slattery, 2007</a>). Consistent with these reports, SK3 null mice show enhanced hippocampal 5-HT release and reduced immobility in forced swim and tail suspension tests, indicative of an antidepressant like phenotype (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jacobsen et al., 2008</a>). Our work demonstrates for the first time that social isolation, a major risk factor for depression and anxiety, results in reduced 5-HT neuronal activity due to upregulated SK3 channel function in the DRN. Moreover, we show that systemic treatment with apamin, an inhibitor of SK channels improves behavioral deficits induced by chronic social isolation. Consistent with studies that have implicated SK channel function in neuropsychiatric conditions, our current findings suggest that SK channel modulation is a promising therapeutic target for disorders of emotional disturbance such as depression and anxiety. Apamin however has been reported to have adverse side effects in rats (<a href=\"#bib54\">van der Staay et al., 1999</a>) close to the beneficial dose in the current mouse study. The diverse expression of SK channels in different tissue types and the lack of tissue/subtype specific modulators or inhibitors are currently the limiting factors for therapeutic interventions targeting SK channels. Further research focused on understanding the differential regulation, modulation and function of SK channel subtypes may shed light on the development of effective disease treatment strategies. Importantly, development of more specific drugs targeted at inhibiting SK3 function may have significant implications for treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders."

In order to assess the drinking amount, group-housed mice were housed in pairs or singles for a period of 3 days. Mice were given a choice of 2% sucrose or water in their homecage for 2 days. Water and sucrose intake were measured daily and the position of the bottles were changed after the first day. Drugs were administered on both days of the test. Data were expressed as the ratio of sucrose to water consumed and the average of both days were taken."

Spike frequencies for input-output curves were measured by counting the number of spikes in response to 500 ms depolarizing current steps. Spike frequencies for optogenetic and electrophysiological stimulations were determined by counting the number of spikes over a 2 s stimulation period. For illustrative purposes, averaged traces showing current responses and AHPs were compiled using Axograph software. Quantification of AHP potentials was performed by detecting action potentials automatically with a derivative threshold of 20 mV/ms by Axograph software. AHP area (mVxs) is measured as the area under the AHP between the midpoint of each spike (taken as time=0) and the 100 ms time point corresponding to the medium AHP (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sah, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Faber and Sah, 2003</a>). The maximum negative value of the AHP within this time window is determined as the peak AHP (mV). Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5 software. For electrophysiology experiments, the numbers (n) that represent the number of neurons were obtained from at least 3 mice per group. For western blots, numbers (n) represent the number of mice (averages of 2 replicates per mouse). Data were analyzed using unpaired student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test, two-way ANOVA or repeated-measures two-way ANOVA. Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was performed when appropriate. Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. and evaluated at a significance level of 0.05."

For example, one reviewer noted (during the reviewer discussion) that \"a more recent paper used a somewhat similar model in mice (Neuropsychopharmacology. 2014 Dec; 39(13):2928-37. doi: 10.1038/npp.2014.162) and doesn't seem to see much on the anxiety tests; they did voltammetry measures of 5-HT release in different conditions, and rather see a trend for increased rather than decreased 5-HT release (see their table1). \" While it would be feasible with significant additional work to shore up the present results with additional behavioral studies (e.g. demonstrating that social isolation produces specific behavioral effects which can be normalized by normalizing the excitability of DRN neurons), this would likely take several months to complete and it is the journal policy to reject manuscripts which cannot be accepted without work that could be completed in 1-2 months at most. In this case, however, we would be willing to consider a new manuscript on the same topic, provided it addressed the issue of behavioral relevance.

SK3 expression is reported to be predominantly in serotonergic neurons of dorsal raphe (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000). Serotonergic neurons characteristically have a prominent medium duration apamin-sensitive AHPs (Scuv\u00e9e-Moreau et al., 2004) that do not exist to the same extent in other neuronal subtypes such as GABAergic neurons in dorsal raphe. Moreover, systemic apamin injections were shown to increase the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in vivo and resulted in a subsequent increase in 5-HT release in postsynaptic regions (Crespi, 2009) suggesting that serotonergic neurons are specifically sensitive to apamin. SK channel blockade in vivo has also been shown to increase burst firing specifically in serotonergic neurons (Rouchet et al., 2008; Crespi, 2009). These effects of apamin persisted in the presence of GABAA and GABAB receptor blockers (Rouchet et al., 2008). Together with our work, these experiments suggest that serotonergic neurons would contribute disproportionately and be most sensitive to alterations in the expression of SK channels in this region."
