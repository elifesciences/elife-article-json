The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altmetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u201cMelanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET\u201d by Peinado and colleagues, published in Nature Medicine in 2012 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Peinado et al., 2012</a>). The key experiments being replicated are from Figures 4E, as well as Supplementary Figures 1C and 5A. In these experiments, Peinado and colleagues show tumor exosomes enhance metastasis to bones and lungs, which is diminished by reducing <i>Met</i> expression in exosomes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Peinado et al., 2012</a>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a> and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/\">citations and Altmetric scores</a> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Errington et al., 2014</a>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u201cMelanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET\u201d by Peinado and colleagues, published in Nature Medicine in 2012 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Peinado et al., 2012</a>). The key experiments being replicated are from Figures 4E, as well as Supplementary Figures 1C and 5A. In these experiments, Peinado and colleagues show tumor exosomes enhance metastasis to bones and lungs, which is diminished by reducing <i>Met</i> expression in exosomes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Peinado et al., 2012</a>). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a> and the results of the replications will be published in <i>eLife</i>."

They contain a wide array of cargo including proteins, cytokines, and nucleic acids (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kharaziha et al., 2012</a>). Recently, exosomes have been shown to play multiple roles in promoting carcinogenesis, including the regulation of metastatic niche formation, regulation of tumor immune response, and chemotherapeutic resistance (<a href=\"#bib9\">Tickner et al., 2014</a>). Peinado and colleagues reported that exosomes derived from melanoma cells promoted metastasis through education of bone marrow-derived cells in order to prime the pre-metastatic niche and increase vascularization. They further showed that exosome-mediated metastasis was dependent on expression of MET in exosomes, and that MET protein was increased in exosomes found in patients with advanced melanoma (<a href=\"#bib7\">Peinado et al., 2012</a>). MET is an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase that promotes proliferation, motility, and migration, and is often aberrantly activated in tumors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Gherardi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Trusolino et al., 2010</a>). These findings indicate that exosomal MET may be a potential therapeutic target or biomarker for metastatic disease."

Supplementary Figure 5A further characterizes these exosomes by assessing the levels of MET and pMET after shRNA-mediated depletion of <i>MET</i> in B16-F10 cells. These figures are essential to reproduce as they validate the expression of key proteins in exosomes that will subsequently be used to replicate Figure 4E. These experiments will be replicated in Protocols 1 and 2."

(2012)</a> reported that reduction of MET protein in melanoma exosomes reduced metastasis of B16-F10 melanoma cells to lung and bone (<a href=\"#bib7\">Peinado et al., 2012</a>). Mice were pre-treated with exosomes isolated from B16-F10 melanoma cells expressing shRNAs directed against <i>Met</i> or control shRNAs, and then B16-F10 cells were injected subcutaneously. Primary tumor growth and metastasis to lungs and bone were assessed by luciferase imaging. This key experiment tests one of the central findings of the paper, namely that MET is necessary for melanoma exosome-mediated promotion of metastasis. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 3."

The original protocol for selecting GFP-positive cells included a step to perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of the population to achieve a 95\u201399% GFP-positive population prior to puromycin selection (information provided by authors). The replication attempt will not include the FACS sorting step and instead will select the stable cells for at least 28 d before further analysis and will maintain the cell lines when not used in experimental procedures under puromycin selection. All known differences are listed in the Materials and reagents section above with the originally used item listed in the Comments section. All differences have the same capabilities as the original and are not expected to alter the experimental design."

In particular, there are some critical differences in the experimental procedures of the proposed study that may lead to big differences in the results compared to the original Peinado et al. study. First and foremost, the method proposed to isolate exosomes for western blot and functional studies, as well as for the depletion of exosomes from FBS is based on ExoQuick extraction rather than sequential ultracentrifugation as in the original publication. This is a major issue that can hinder the reproducibility of the data, as during exosome isolation using ExoQuick, contaminants (e.g. VEGF) are trapped by ExoQuick, therefore education would not be strictly and solely due to exosomes. Clearly the authors are aware of this issue, as they have highlighted this difference. The main problem is that 1 \u03bcg of exosomal protein from ExoQuick-isolated exosomes would be the equivalent of 0.1-0.5 \u03bcg of exosomes isolated by classical ultracentrifugation (UC), as in the Peinado et al. study. This 10-fold difference in the amount of exosome protein delivered in education studies would lead to \"under-education\". Since in the Peinado et al. study the exosomal preparations were free of contaminants, as demonstrated by electron microscopy and western blot, and the authors' likely carry significant contaminants, a side by side comparison of ExoQuick and ultracentrifugation would be required to determine the amount of ExoQuick exosomal preparation equivalent to 10 \u03bcg of exosomes. A reference is not sufficient, actual data needs to be presented for this comparison, including quantitation and electron microscopy studies. The authors would have to measure the yield of exosomes, proteins and contaminants from both methods in parallel."

A recent study provides electron microscopy pictures that demonstrate that the higher protein yield obtained with the ExoQuick precipitation method compared to the UC gold standard is due to contaminants such as large protein aggregates (S\u00e1enz-Cuesta M et al., Front Immunol, 2015, 6:50, PMID: 25762995)."

Freezing could also affect the functionality of exosomes. The original Peinado et al. study had performed the education studies with fresh exosomes."

It is highly recommended that a scrambled short hairpin control (shScramble) be used, as it is widely known that infection and puromycin treatment of cells may alter the cell population and the appropriate scrambled control in the same vector is available from the same company that produces the shMET. Importantly, the authors plan to rely solely on puromycin resistance to select the knockdown clones, but this is not sufficient to isolate a pure population of transduced cells that maintains high levels of vector integration and expression. In addition to verifying knockdown of MET, the authors also need to show that Met knockdown did not affect the growth of the cells (every integration event is unique and you never know where the lentivirus integrated)."

However, the new experiment (protocol 3) added to the manuscript proposing to compare ExoQuick extraction with the sequential ultracentrifugation presented in the original publication, is not appropriate for the \"Reproducibility project\". This is a new experiment that can be the focus of a new manuscript. Even for such a method comparison manuscript, to indeed validate their side-by-side comparison of ExoQuick and ultracentrifugation, the authors should perform unbiased analyses, specifically proteomic analysis of exosomes by mass spectrometry, not just western blot analyses. For the purpose of reproducing the data in the original Peinado et al. publication, the original exosome purification method should be used. Despite the fact that the differences from the original study are clearly stated for each protocol, for Protocols 2 and 4, the authors are still relying ONLY on ExoQuick for exosome purification.

In particular, there are some critical differences in the experimental procedures of the proposed study that may lead to big differences in the results compared to the original Peinado et al. study. First and foremost, the method proposed to isolate exosomes for western blot and functional studies, as well as for the depletion of exosomes from FBS is based on ExoQuick extraction rather than sequential ultracentrifugation as in the original publication. This is a major issue that can hinder the reproducibility of the data, as during exosome isolation using ExoQuick, contaminants (e.g. VEGF) are trapped by ExoQuick, therefore education would not be strictly and solely due to exosomes. Clearly the authors are aware of this issue, as they have highlighted this difference. The main problem is that 1 \u03bcg of exosomal protein from ExoQuick-isolated exosomes would be the equivalent of 0.1-0.5 \u03bcg of exosomes isolated by classical ultracentrifugation (UC), as in the Peinado et al. study. This 10-fold difference in the amount of exosome protein delivered in education studies would lead to \"under-education\". Since in the Peinado et al. study the exosomal preparations were free of contaminants, as demonstrated by electron microscopy and western blot, and the authors' likely carry significant contaminants, a side by side comparison of ExoQuick and ultracentrifugation would be required to determine the amount of ExoQuick exosomal preparation equivalent to 10 \u03bcg of exosomes. A reference is not sufficient, actual data needs to be presented for this comparison, including quantitation and electron microscopy studies. The authors would have to measure the yield of exosomes, proteins and contaminants from both methods in parallel.</i>"

We agree with the reviewers comment on the use of a correction, such as Bonferroni or the modification of LSD by Hayter, as ways to control for the MFWER, however as Hayter describes in his 1986 paper, this applies in situations where the ANOVA is unbalanced or with a balanced design with four or more populations. Since the proposed analysis is balanced with three population groups, the LSD is sufficiently conservative and powerful to account for the multiple comparisons in this specific situation.
