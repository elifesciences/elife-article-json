This suggests, that contrary to what was expected, CLAG3 and RhopH2 are not needed for the invasion process. Instead, the experiments revealed that RhopH3 serves a major role in invasion, either by helping the parasite to interact with or enter the new red blood cell. After the parasite has invaded the cell, this complex of three proteins is shuttled to the red blood cell\u2019s membrane, where it inserts to help form the nutrient channel."

Its name recognizes that it is a high-molecular weight complex localizing to rhoptries, which\u00a0are\u00a0specialized organelles at the apical end of the merozoite (<a href=\"#bib19\">Holder et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cooper et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kaneko et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ling et al., 2003</a>). Each of the three member proteins, termed CLAG (or RhopH1), RhopH2, and RhopH3, are synthesized in mature intracellular parasites known as schizonts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaneko et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2005</a>). Upon egress, these proteins are secreted, along with other rhoptry contents, onto the erythrocyte targeted for invasion. It has therefore been assumed that the RhopH complex serves a role in invasion; because a fraction of this complex is transferred to the new host cell, another proposal has been that these proteins contribute to formation of the parasitophorous vacuole that\u00a0surrounds the internalized parasite (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kaneko, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ocampo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ranjan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cort\u00e9s et al., 2007</a>)."

Subsequent studies with transport mutants and specific inhibitors have strengthened the evidence for CLAG3 and possibly CLAG2 in channel activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pillai et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sharma et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mira-Martinez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sharma et al., 2015</a>). Although conservation of both the RhopH complex and PSAC activity in all examined <i>Plasmodia</i> spp. suggests a causal link (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lisk and Desai, 2005</a>), the precise contribution of these proteins to either the\u00a0activation of channels or the\u00a0formation of the nutrient pore is unclear (<a href=\"#bib13\">Desai, 2012</a>). Growth defects in a reported CLAG3 knockout are consistent with a role in nutrient uptake, but could also result from the\u00a0loss of other activities (<a href=\"#bib5\">Comeaux et al., 2011</a>).

Our studies show that both proteins are essential for parasite survival. RhopH3, but not RhopH2 or CLAG3, contributes to erythrocyte invasion. Because the\u00a0formation and functional properties of the parasitophorous vacuole are preserved in our knockdowns, these three proteins do not appear to serve long-assumed roles in vacuole biogenesis. Instead, organic solute uptake and electrophysiological studies reveal that both RhopH2 and RhopH3 are required for successful PSAC formation; loss of channel activity leads to rapid parasite demise. These critical functions and the elaborate stage-specific trafficking we report makes the RhopH complex an attractive therapeutic target."

While RhopH2 was still detected in the <i>R3glmS</i> knockdown, it did not fully colocalize with RAP1 but instead had a more diffuse distribution; this suggests that\u00a0RhopH2 may be retained in the parasite endoplasmic reticulum if it fails to interact with RhopH3. By contrast, RhopH3 appeared to traffic normally in GlcN-treated <i>R2glmS</i> parasites, as indicated by its\u00a0apical colocalization with RAP1 in merozoites. Thus, CLAG3, RhopH2 and RhopH3 assemble into a complex either during or immediately after translation. RhopH3 reaches rhoptries in the absence of RhopH2, but the other two components are either rendered unstable or mis-trafficked in each knockdown.

We applied a nonsaturating 1 mM GlcN during gene transcription to allow direct comparison of parasite expansion rates when nutrient availability is altered. After invasion, matched numbers of ring-stage infected cells were collected and used for cultivation without GlcN in either standard RPMI 1640-based medium containing high nutrient concentrations or PGIM (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pillai et al., 2012</a>); this modified medium follows the RPMI 1640 formulation but has reduced, more physiological concentrations of key nutrients that\u00a0are\u00a0acquired via PSAC.

To overcome this limitation and to\u00a0achieve stage-specific knockdown, we tagged RhopH2 and RhopH3 with the <i>Escherichia coli</i> DHFR destabilization domain (DDD, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The DDD epitope conditionally interferes with target protein function as the fusion can be denatured by removal of trimethoprim (TMP), a stabilizing small molecule (<a href=\"#bib23\">Iwamoto et al., 2010</a>); kinetic studies reveal that this approach permits post-translational knockdown in malaria parasites, but it is limited by a half-time of 6 hr for protein destabilization (<a href=\"#bib36\">Muralidharan et al., 2011</a>).

Using synchronized cultures, we removed TMP either after RhopH complex trafficking to rhoptries in late schizonts (\u2018LS\u2019, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) or immediately after erythrocyte invasion (early ring or \u2018ER\u2019). A second stringent synchronization prior to TMP removal ensured that this ER culture did not undergo RhopH2 destabilization until after host cell invasion (\u2018sync all\u2019, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Subsequent harvest at the mid-trophozoite stage revealed reduced permeability in both cultures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a>), with a greater reduction when TMP was removed before invasion (LS). As also seen with the <i>glmS</i> knockdowns, TMP removal before merozoite egress led to reduced delivery of CLAG3 and RhopH3 upon invasion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, LS), demonstrating that RhopH complex integrity is important for faithful transfer during invasion. Importantly, TMP removal after invasion preserved CLAG3 and RhopH3 levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, ER). Nevertheless, these cells exhibited significantly reduced permeability (p=0.02, n=3), indicating that RhopH2 serves a role in channel formation beyond simply delivering the other RhopH components to invaded erythrocytes. The more modest effect on PSAC when TMP washout is performed after invasion may be conservatively accounted for\u00a0by the relatively slow kinetics of DDD domain destabilization (<a href=\"#bib36\">Muralidharan et al., 2011</a>)."

The RhopH complex appears to be secreted into the PV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), suggesting that its member proteins must cross the bounding PVM to enter host cytosol and eventually reach the erythrocyte surface. Most exported proteins cross this membrane via the <i>Plasmodium</i> translocon of exported proteins (PTEX), but a recent study reported that CLAG3 export is unaffected by conditional knockdown of HSP101 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2014</a>), an essential PTEX component. As PSAC activity was curtailed in the PTEX knockdown, other exported proteins may also be required to form the nutrient channel. Using the 13F10 HSP101-DDD clone (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2014</a>), we confirmed that PTEX knockdown abolishes the\u00a0development of PSAC-mediated uptake (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and we\u00a0then examined RhopH protein export (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Remarkably, export of RhopH2 and of\u00a0RhopH3 were both fully blocked in trophozoite-stage parasites grown for 48 hr without TMP. Colocalization with HRP2, a parasite protein carrying the canonical PEXEL export signal (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2014</a>), showed that\u00a0both proteins were\u00a0trapped in the vacuole upon PTEX knockdown. In contrast to the earlier study, we also found that CLAG3 export requires PTEX activity as TMP removal prevented its movement out of the PV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> bottom row; colocalization with SBP1, another PTEX substrate; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2014</a>). Because these results depend on fixation and imaging conditions that may be aggravated by residual PTEX activity in the knockdown, we then used extracellular protease susceptibility to evaluate CLAG3 export. This revealed complete loss of CLAG3 protease susceptibility upon TMP removal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), sidestepping concerns about imaging conditions and indicating that CLAG3 fails to reach the host membrane upon PTEX block. Thus, RhopH proteins are delivered to the PV upon invasion and then require PTEX for export at the PVM."

As two effective sgRNAs targeting each gene could not produce knockouts, we employed both transcription- and protein-level conditional knockdown to dissect the trafficking requirements and stage-specific roles of the least well studied components, RhopH2 and RhopH3. Our studies implicate cotranslational assembly of a complex that also contains CLAG3. Subsequent trafficking of CLAG3 and RhopH2 to rhoptries depends on\u00a0the formation of a complete and stable complex, but RhopH3 can reach this organelle in isolation. Upon merozoite egress, RhopH3 alone contributes to host-cell invasion, either by contributing to ligand interactions with erythrocyte receptors or by\u00a0facilitating parasite internalization (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Fully formed complexes, but not individual components, can then be transferred to the invaded erythrocyte and deposited into the nascent PV. These proteins then utilize PTEX to access erythrocyte cytosol. Subsequent trafficking via the Maurer\u2019s clefts, an organelle thought to facilitate onward protein export (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tilley et al., 2008</a>), eventually inserts the complex into the host membrane. At the erythrocyte surface, this complex defines PSAC (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), a nutrient and ion channel that accounts for long-known increases in infected cell permeability (<a href=\"#bib40\">Overman, 1948</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kutner et al., 1982</a>)."

Early studies predicted that parasite proteins that\u00a0are\u00a0involved in\u00a0the PSAC would be translated in ring- or trophozoite-stage parasites, just prior to\u00a0the onset of solute uptake (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kutner et al., 1982</a>). Genetic mapping identified CLAG3 as a\u00a0PSAC determinant and contradicted these predictions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nguitragool et al., 2011</a>); production of CLAG3 in the prior cycle and packaging into rhoptries seemed to be inconsistent with a primary role for\u00a0CLAG3\u00a0in channel formation. Molecular evidence for a RhopH3 role in erythrocyte invasion, as we now provide, suggests that this unexpectedly early synthesis and complicated trafficking evolved to enable two distinct functions at separate points in the parasite cycle. Whether the role in invasion or in nutrient uptake arose first and how the second function was added is unclear as all three members of the RhopH complex are conserved in plasmodia but have no clear orthologs in other apicomplexan parasites. The RhopH complex presumably acquired both functions early in adaption to erythrocytes as both are essential for survival in the vertebrate bloodstream."

How might loss of this protein interfere with successful erythrocyte invasion? As <i>P. falciparum</i> utilizes multiple receptor-ligand interactions for invasion, one possibility is that RhopH3 interacts directly with an erythrocyte receptor. A yeast-two hybrid screen and binding studies with a recombinant C-terminal fragment of RhopH3 suggest\u00a0that the anion exchanger Band3 protein might be the receptor (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baldwin et al., 2014</a>), a proposal supported by the\u00a0inhibitory effects of specific RhopH3 antibodies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ranjan et al., 2011</a>).

Immunofluorescence microscopy implicated the parasite-derived translocon termed PTEX in this process as all three RhopH complex members were blocked in the HSP101-DDD knockdown. Because our observations contradicted the original report involving this knockdown (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2014</a>), we explored whether the timing of TMP withdrawal or subsequent cell harvest and fixation could account for this discrepancy, but found that a range of withdrawal times (late trophozoite- to mature schizont-stage cultures) and harvest times (24\u201336 hr after egress and invasion) produced indistinguishable results (not shown). Because we were unable to address this discrepancy, we also examined PTEX dependence by\u00a0looking\u00a0at CLAG3 protease susceptibility, an approach that revealed quantitative failure of CLAG3 delivery to the host membrane upon PTEX knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

Do all three proteins require passage through the translocon? As subsequent trafficking and insertion at the host membrane depend on an intact RhopH complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), models that require only a single RhopH protein to pass through the translocon may also yield the observed loss of export with PTEX knockdown. Is the complex disassembled by HSP101, a proposed unfoldase with an AAA+ ATPase domain, only to be reassembled after crossing the membrane? Because alkaline extraction suggests that RhopH proteins exist as both peripheral and integral membrane proteins within trophozoite-infected cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we speculate that passage through the translocon may also serve to fold and insert transmembrane domains into the bilayer. Indeed, most integral proteins in other organisms require translocons for faithful insertion into membranes; bacterial SecYEG and eukaryotic Sec61-type translocons achieve this by allowing correctly folded proteins to exit directly into the bilayer through a lateral gate (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rapoport, 2007</a>). Whether this lateral translocation of integral proteins is possible in PTEX is unknown and requires study."

Where used, the membrane pellet was subjected to carbonate extraction by resuspension in 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 11 at 4\u00b0C for 30 min before a second ultracentrifugation to separate peripheral from integral membrane proteins. Samples were solubilized and reduced in a modified Laemmli sample buffer containing a final 6% SDS concentration. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 4\u201315% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gel (Bio-RAD) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking (using\u00a03% skim milk powder in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4 with 0.1% Tween20), primary antibodies were applied at 1:1000 to 1:3000 dilution in blocking buffer.

Much of this lack of clarity comes from trying to provide a comprehensive list of a lot of experiments without regard to providing a clearly discernible story line.

There is no clear and systematic definition of phenotypes and that coupled with different reverse genetic approaches contribute to the lack of clarity.

This explanation implies that RhopH3 is not being degraded by the DDD domain, and therefore active RhopH3 remains. However, the authors do not show that active RhopH3 is abundant in R3-DDD without TMP. I believe this should be an easy experiment to perform (the same style of blots they performed for the R2-DDD case should be sufficient). And this experiment would serve as great confirmation of their model that the minimal affect of R3-DDD is due simply to the method not working well to degrade RhopH3. If instead they observe substantial degradation of RhopH3, then the DDD domain likely degrades RhopH3 to a significant degree before the proteolytic processing removes the DDD domain. Then the authors would need to propose another explanation for why the removal of RhopH3 has minimal impact on PSAC function."

This explanation implies that RhopH3 is not being degraded by the DDD domain, and therefore active RhopH3 remains. However, the authors do not show that active RhopH3 is abundant in R3-DDD without TMP. I believe this should be an easy experiment to perform (the same style of blots they performed for the R2-DDD case should be sufficient). And this experiment would serve as great confirmation of their model that the minimal affect of R3-DDD is due simply to the method not working well to degrade RhopH3. If instead they observe substantial degradation of RhopH3, then the DDD domain likely degrades RhopH3 to a significant degree before the proteolytic processing removes the DDD domain. Then the authors would need to propose another explanation for why the removal of RhopH3 has minimal impact on PSAC function.</i>"
