Blood flow to the affected tissue must be restored quickly if viability and function are to be preserved. We report that disruption of the mixed-lineage protein kinase (MLK) - cJun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in endothelial cells causes severe blockade of blood flow and failure to recover in the murine femoral artery ligation model of hindlimb ischemia. We show that the MLK-JNK pathway is required for the formation of native collateral arteries that can restore circulation following arterial occlusion. Disruption of the MLK-JNK pathway causes decreased Dll4/Notch signaling, excessive sprouting angiogenesis, and defects in developmental vascular morphogenesis. Our analysis demonstrates that the MLK-JNK signaling pathway is a key regulatory mechanism that protects against ischemia in arterial occlusive disease."

Blood flow to the affected tissue must be restored quickly if viability and function are to be preserved. We report that disruption of the mixed-lineage protein kinase (MLK) - cJun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in endothelial cells causes severe blockade of blood flow and failure to recover in the murine femoral artery ligation model of hindlimb ischemia. We show that the MLK-JNK pathway is required for the formation of native collateral arteries that can restore circulation following arterial occlusion. Disruption of the MLK-JNK pathway causes decreased Dll4/Notch signaling, excessive sprouting angiogenesis, and defects in developmental vascular morphogenesis. Our analysis demonstrates that the MLK-JNK signaling pathway is a key regulatory mechanism that protects against ischemia in arterial occlusive disease."

Artery blockages are harmful because tissues and organs are supplied with oxygen carried in blood cells and without adequate oxygen they may suffer damage or even die. The body has back up arteries or collateral arteries that help to mitigate the damage caused by a blood flow blockage. These arteries normally do not deliver blood to tissues. However, if an artery becomes blocked, these arteries can provide new and efficient routes of blood flow that can bypass the blockage."

Now, Ramo et al. show that while JNK is essential for the formation of collateral arteries during development, it is not required for the formation of blood vessels in adults. In the experiments, mice were genetically engineered to lack genes encoding two types of JNK in the cells that line the blood vessels. When these mice became adults they were still able to produce new blood vessels, just like normal mice. But the genetically engineered mice were missing the healthy collateral arteries that mice normally have in their muscles."

Further experiments showed that JNK helps to regulate genes that control blood vessel formation during early development. Without JNK, developing blood vessels grow into poorly organized networks instead of forming normal collateral arteries. The experiments suggest that humans who have mutations in the genes for JNK or related genes may be more susceptible to the harmful effects of artery blockages in the muscles. More studies are now needed to test this hypothesis."

To prevent loss of tissue viability and function, blood flow to the affected tissue must be restored quickly. Collaterals are artery-to-artery or arteriole-to-arteriole interconnections that can bypass an occlusion by providing an alternative route for blood flow to the affected tissue that restores tissue homeostasis and limits tissue damage (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antoniucci et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schaper, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Faber et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Simons and Eichmann, 2015</a>). Indeed, clinical outcome in patients with arterial occlusion depends on the presence of an adequate collateral circulation and animal models of arterial occlusion provide strong evidence for the critical importance of the extent of the native (pre-existing) collateral circulation in restoring blood perfusion and limiting ischemic sequelae following arterial occlusion."

Following arterial occlusion, more blood flow is diverted to the collateral circulation and this increased flow and sheer stress in collateral arteries initiates a number of processes that result in the outward remodeling (arteriogenesis) of these vessels into efficient conductance arteries (<a href=\"#bib31\">Heil et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schaper, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">van Royen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Simons and Eichmann, 2015</a>). Collateral artery remodeling involves multiple cellular processes, including endothelial cell activation and proliferation, monocyte/macrophage recruitment and smooth muscle cell proliferation, all of which contribute to increased collateral artery diameter, including increased thickness of the tunica media. These structural and functional adaptations depend on the presence of the native collateral circulation."

                        "text": "Although the collateral circulation is crucially important for the protective response to arterial occlusive diseases, little is known about the cellular and morphogenetic processes, or the molecular factors and mechanisms, that contribute to native collateral artery formation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antoniucci et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schaper, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Faber et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Simons and Eichmann, 2015</a>). However, studies of leptomenengial (or pial) collateral arteries in the brain have provided significant insight. Murine pial collaterals are established during embryonic development with some remodeling and maturation continuing postnatally. The process of native collateral artery formation during embryogenesis has been termed collaterogenesis and involves a number of molecules including, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2010</a>), gap junction protein, connexin37 (Cx37) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fang et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2012</a>), prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Takeda et al., 2011</a>), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dai and Faber, 2010</a>), chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chalothorn et al., 2009</a>), and Synectin (<a href=\"#bib51\">Moraes et al., 2013</a>). Signaling pathways that have been reported to contribute to collaterogenesis include NF-\u03baB (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tirziu et al., 2012</a>), VEGF (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chalothorn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lucitti et al., 2012</a>), and the Dll4 \u2013 Notch pathway (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cristofaro et al., 2013</a>)."

Our approach was to study the effect of compound gene disruption in endothelial cells to prevent JNK signaling in mice. We did not find that JNK signaling was required for angiogenesis in vitro or in adult mice, but JNK signaling is required for proper vascular morphogenesis and the normal formation of collateral arteries in muscle."

This procedure causes hypoxia in the calf muscles that stimulates angiogenesis, but the proximal adductor muscles experience little or no hypoxia because of blood flow redistribution by the native collateral circulation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Deindl et al., 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We ligated the femoral artery (FA) between the proximal caudal femoral artery (PCFA) and the popliteal artery (PA) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kochi et al., 2013</a>); this is a mild version of the FAL procedure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Laser Doppler imaging revealed ~80% decreased blood perfusion to the ligated limbs of control mice; blood perfusion was restored to ~60% of the contralateral limbs by day 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). These mice did not exhibit major hallmarks of ischemia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). In contrast, E<sup>3KO</sup> mice showed complete blockade of blood flow following occlusion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) leading to severe necrosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). Ligation of the FA more proximally at its origin (a more severe form of FAL) also demonstrated increased blood flow blockade and failure to recover in both E<sup>2KO</sup> and E<sup>3KO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A\u2013C</a>). In contrast, no post-FAL phenotype was detected in mice with JNK1 or JNK2-deficiency alone (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6D</a>) or in mice with JNK1 plus JNK2-deficiency in hematopoietic cells or muscle (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6G\u2013I</a>). These data suggest that JNK1/2 in endothelial cells play a key role in the response to arterial occlusion. Consistent with this conclusion, coronary artery occlusion caused significantly greater mortality of E<sup>3KO</sup> mice compared with control mice (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6E,F</a>)."

In contrast, these arteries were abnormal in E<sup>3KO</sup> mice; arteries emerged from the PCFA and SA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), but were thin and branched into multiple smaller vessels forming a disorganized network (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) analysis confirmed reduced collateral artery size and continuity in the limbs of E<sup>3KO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8A</a>). These collateral artery defects may contribute to decreased blood flow and increased hypoxia in post-FAL E<sup>3KO</sup> mice, despite no overall reduction in muscle vascularization or macrophage recruitment (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8B\u2013E</a>)."

The MLK group of MAP3K causes activation of the JNK pathway by a Rac1/Cdc42-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gallo and Johnson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kant et al., 2011</a>). Gene expression analysis demonstrated that <i>Map3k10</i> and <i>Map3k11</i> were the most highly expressed members of this group in endothelial cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Indeed, <i>Map3k10<sup>-/-</sup> Map3k11<sup>-/-</sup></i> MLEC exhibited reduced phosphorylation of the JNK substrate cJun compared with control MLEC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We therefore examined the post-FAL response of <i>Map3k10<sup>-/-</sup> Map3k11<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Similar to E<sup>3KO</sup> mice, MLK-deficient mice showed increased blood flow blockade, failure of blood flow restoration by day 3 post-FAL, and necrosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013G</a>). Moreover, we found abnormal gracilis collateral arteries in <i>Map3k10<sup>-/-</sup> Map3k11<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>).

We found that the gracilis collaterals in post-natal day 6 (P6) and P0 control mice interconnected the PCFA and the SA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Dil perfusion analysis demonstrated that the arteries had lumens (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) and were fully covered by smooth muscle cells at P6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; SMA), but not at P0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; SMA). In contrast, gracilis collaterals in E<sup>3KO</sup> mice were not formed at P6 or P0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Individual vessels did emerge from the PCFA and the SA, but instead of interconnecting to form collaterals, these vessels branched off into multiple smaller caliber vessels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>; Dil Perfusion) that lacked smooth muscle coverage at P6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; SMA) and appeared to continue into the capillary circulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>; Dil Perfusion). Similarly, analysis of the abdominal muscle arterial circulation in P0 pups revealed numerous arteriolar arcades (direct arteriole-to-arteriole interconnections) in control mice, but this arterial patterning was significantly reduced in E<sup>3KO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These defects in gracilis collateral and abdominal arteriolar arcade development were also detected in MLK-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>)."

While large caliber vessels, including the FA/SA and PCFA, were established (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>), distinct collaterals directly interconnecting the PCFA and SA were not formed at E16.5 and the gracilis muscle was covered by a capillary plexus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Prominent vessels do emerge from the PCFA and the SA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), but did not extend along the gracilis muscle as distinct collaterals; instead, these vessels branched and appeared to continue into the capillary plexus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Gracilis collaterals may therefore form through a plexus intermediate. Remodeling of vessels within this plexus likely leads to the formation of collateral arteries in close apposition to nerve fibres (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This process of maturation appears to start at the two distal ends, where the future gracilis collaterals emerge from the PCFA and the SA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, arrowheads) and continue toward the middle of the muscle; a pattern of remodeling that likely reflects the blood flow characteristics of these vessels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Meisner et al., 2013</a>). Studies of E16.5 E<sup>3KO</sup> embryos demonstrated that the gracilis muscle capillary plexus was hyperbranched, denser, and disorganized with vessels of variable width that elaborated more filopodia than control embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). This observation suggests that the failure of collateral artery formation in E<sup>3KO</sup> mice may be caused by defective sprouting angiogenesis that initially generates a hyperbranched, denser, and more chaotically organized plexus that fails to properly remodel."

Analysis of retinal flatmounts from P6 E<sup>3KO</sup> mice demonstrated significantly reduced radial extension of the vascular plexus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C,L</a>). Closer examination demonstrated higher vascular density in the growing angiogenic front of the mutant retinas compared to littermate control mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013G,H,J,M</a>). Vascular extension in the retina occurs through the coordinated interaction, migration, and proliferation of endothelial tip and stalk cells together with non-endothelial cells, including pericytes, that stabilize the vascular plexus. We found no differences in vessel pericyte coverage (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); however, the angiogenic front of the mutant retinas included larger numbers of tip cells and a larger number of filopodia (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H\u2013K,N,O</a>).

                                "text": "To examine the molecular mechanisms that contribute to hypersprouting caused by defects in the MLK-JNK pathway, we examined gene expression by primary endothelial cells isolated from control and E<sup>3KO</sup> mice. We found 781 genes that were differentially expressed between E<sup>3KO</sup> and control endothelial cells. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for several biological processes, including vascular development and morphogenesis, and we identified 64 differentially expressed genes that might contribute to vascular defects (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These genes included components of the Notch signaling pathway; for example, <i>Dll4, Hey1, Hes1,</i> and <i>Lfng</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). This may be significant because the Notch pathway plays a major role during developmental angiogenesis, including tip/stalk cell specification and endothelial cell sprouting (<a href=\"#bib56\">Roca and Adams, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>). Indeed, the hypersprouting defects observed in E<sup>2KO</sup>, E<sup>3KO</sup> and <i>Map3k10<sup>-/-</sup> Map3k11<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice resemble those previously reported for mice with reduced Dll4/Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Suchting et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Benedito et al., 2009</a>), including <i>Lfng<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benedito et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, <i>Dll4<sup>-/+</sup></i> mice display perturbations in collateral artery formation and, like <i>Notch1<sup>-/+</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib64\">Takeshita et al., 2007</a>), show reduced recovery of blood perfusion in models of vascular occlusion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cristofaro et al., 2013</a>). To test whether JNK-deficiency regulates Notch signaling in endothelial cells, we examined the effect of angiogenic cytokines that can induce expression of the Notch ligand Dll4 and engage the Notch signaling pathway. Treatment of endothelial cells with VEGF or bFGF caused increased expression of Dll4 protein and promoted accumulation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). However, these responses were suppressed in JNK-deficient endothelial cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). Indeed, reduced Dll4 protein expression by E<sup>3KO</sup> endothelial cells was observed in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013E</a>). These data indicate that JNK can promote Notch signaling in endothelial cells by regulating Dll4 expression."

We found that JNK is not required for angiogenesis or arteriogenesis in adult mice. However, JNK plays an essential role during developmental vascular morphogenesis, including the formation of native collateral arteries that provide an alternate route for blood flow and serve to protect against ischemic tissue damage. This action of JNK is mediated by the MLK signaling pathway. Defects in the MLK-JNK pathway result in the loss of muscle collateral circulation and profoundly suppress protective responses to arterial occlusion."

These nascent vessels appear to course above the pial capillary plexus and fuse with an arteriole from an adjacent arterial tree (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lucitti et al., 2012</a>). By E15.5, a portion of these collaterals have acquired expression of the arterial marker EphrinB2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chalothorn and Faber, 2010</a>).

Similar defects were observed in the developing retinal vasculature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). At P0, continuous and distinct gracillis collateral vessels interconnecting the PCFA to the SA were fully formed in control mice, but the analogous vessels in the gracillis muscle of JNK-deficient mice were defective with extensive branching into smaller vessels that appeared to enter the capillary circulation. These observations indicated that an endothelial cell patterning defect may account for the absence of gracillis collateral arteries in the JNK-deficient mice. Hypersprouting represents one aspect of this patterning defect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and reduced Dll4 \u2013 Notch signaling may significantly contribute to this phenotype (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

These interactions between VEGF and Notch signaling underly the specification of endothelial cell phenotypes during angiogenesis, including highly motile tip cells that extend numerous filopodia and trailing stalk cells with low motility that form the lumen of nascent tubules (<a href=\"#bib56\">Roca and Adams, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eilken and Adams, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jakobsson et al., 2010</a>).

Excessive sprouting angiogenesis may contribute to the critical requirement for MLK \u2013 JNK signaling during native collateral artery development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and this phenotype may result from promotion of Dll4 expression by MLK \u2013 JNK signaling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

Our study provides insight into the mechanism that controls muscle collaterogenesis, which is critically important for the response to arterial occlusive disease. Moreover, our analysis suggests that human germ-line mutations in JNK pathway genes may contribute to an increased risk for poor outcomes in patients following exposure to an ischemic insult."

To visualize large areas of the vasculature on the confocal microscope, a tile-scanning technique was employed whereby multiple overlapping (20\u201330% overlap) maximum projection images were acquired with a 10x or 20x objective and a composite image was constructed by arraying the individual images in Photoshop. Quantification of vascularized area in whole mount retinas was done from fluorescence stereomicroscopic images using ZEN software (Zeiss). Retinal angiogenic front vascular density, endothelial sprouts and filopodia were quantitated using ImageJ and maximum projection confocal images acquired with a 10x, 20x and 63x objective respectively.

The authors perform a number of in vivo experiments focusing on the loss of <i>JNK</i> (1/2 &amp; 1/2/3) as well as upstream MAP kinases, MLK1 and 2, to determine the necessity of proper compensatory angiogenic responses. While it is initially shown that <i>JNK</i> and MLK loss results in improper collateral circulation in the adult (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 &amp; 2</a>), it is later demonstrated to be induced by developmental defects during vascular development (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), causing the study to pivot to a focus on vessel sprouting in developmental angiogenesis. Using a model of retinal angiogenesis, the authors demonstrate that loss of <i>JNK</i> signaling leads to increases in filopodia and tip cells with no differences in pericyte coverage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), and follow-up gene expression studies of primary endothelial <i>JNK</i> knockouts point to defects in Dll4/Notch signaling as the primary mechanism for alterations in sprouting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The investigation of <i>JNK</i> signaling in vascular development is thorough and provides various outstanding technical approaches."

We note that most studies of endothelial progenitor cells (relevant to revascularization) have been done in adult animals rather than embryos. Moreover, the identity of Cdh5+ Flt4+ VEGFR2+ cells as endothelial progenitors or monocytoid cells that can adopt an endothelial-like phenotype is controversial. Given this background, we believe that it is beyond the scope of the present study to define roles for endothelial progenitor cells and mature endothelial cells during embryonic development of collateral vessels in muscle.

We also examined macrophages in endothelial cell specific <i>JNK</i> knockout mice that fail to recover after hind limb ischemia.
