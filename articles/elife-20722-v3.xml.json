Their inhibition is predicted to have pleiotropic effects, but it is unclear whether this will impact on the clinical utility of CDK8/19 inhibitors. We discovered two series of potent chemical probes with high selectivity for CDK8/19. Despite pharmacodynamic evidence for robust on-target activity, the compounds exhibited modest, though significant, efficacy against human tumor lines and patient-derived xenografts. Altered gene expression was consistent with CDK8/19 inhibition, including profiles associated with super-enhancers, immune and inflammatory responses and stem cell function. In a mouse model expressing oncogenic beta-catenin, treatment shifted cells within hyperplastic intestinal crypts from a stem cell to a transit amplifying phenotype. In two species, neither probe was tolerated at therapeutically-relevant exposures. The complex nature of the toxicity observed with two structurally-differentiated chemical series is consistent with on-target effects posing significant challenges to the clinical development of CDK8/19 inhibitors."

In Germany the animal work was carried out in accordance with the German Law on the Protection of Animals (Article 8a) and the pertaining files at the at the local animal welfare authorities in Darmstadt and Freiburg bear the references DA/375, DA4/1003, DA4/1004 and G13/13 respectively. The studies were designed in accordance with presently valid international study guidelines (e.g. ICH guideline M3 R2) and performed in compliance with animal health and welfare guidelines. The Institute of Cancer Research does not use non-rodent species in research and, where this is deemed essential, requires ethical approval for use by organizations with whom we collaborate. Pharmacokinetic and tolerability analysis of compounds in dogs, necessary for prediction of human pharmacokinetics, was approved by the ICR Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board.

Their inhibition is predicted to have pleiotropic effects, but it is unclear whether this will impact on the clinical utility of CDK8/19 inhibitors. We discovered two series of potent chemical probes with high selectivity for CDK8/19. Despite pharmacodynamic evidence for robust on-target activity, the compounds exhibited modest, though significant, efficacy against human tumor lines and patient-derived xenografts. Altered gene expression was consistent with CDK8/19 inhibition, including profiles associated with super-enhancers, immune and inflammatory responses and stem cell function. In a mouse model expressing oncogenic beta-catenin, treatment shifted cells within hyperplastic intestinal crypts from a stem cell to a transit amplifying phenotype. In two species, neither probe was tolerated at therapeutically-relevant exposures. The complex nature of the toxicity observed with two structurally-differentiated chemical series is consistent with on-target effects posing significant challenges to the clinical development of CDK8/19 inhibitors."

In Germany the animal work was carried out in accordance with the German Law on the Protection of Animals (Article 8a) and the pertaining files at the at the local animal welfare authorities in Darmstadt and Freiburg bear the references DA/375, DA4/1003, DA4/1004 and G13/13 respectively. The studies were designed in accordance with presently valid international study guidelines (e.g. ICH guideline M3 R2) and performed in compliance with animal health and welfare guidelines. The Institute of Cancer Research does not use non-rodent species in research and, where this is deemed essential, requires ethical approval for use by organizations with whom we collaborate. Pharmacokinetic and tolerability analysis of compounds in dogs, necessary for prediction of human pharmacokinetics, was approved by the ICR Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board.

CDK8 is essential for the WNT signaling pathway \u2013 which enables cells to communicate with one another \u2013 and has been extensively studied in various cancers. Previous studies indicate that this protein can either promote or inhibit the growth of tumors, depending on the type and stage of the cancer. Furthermore, CDK8 regulates a type of molecular switch called a \u201csuper-enhancer\u201d, which controls the activity of many genes. In contrast, the role of CDK19 in cells was not as well understood. Here Clarke, Ortiz-Ruiz et al. investigated whether two different classes of small molecules that target CDK8 and CDK19 (referred to as \u201cprototype CDK8/19 drugs\u201d) could inhibit the growth of cancers, and whether they have any harmful side effects on healthy cells."

Treating these mice with prototype CDK8/19 drugs inhibited the activity of CDK8 and CDK19 in the cancer cells and slowed the growth of colorectal tumors. A type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia was particularly sensitive to the drugs. However, Clarke, Ortiz-Ruiz et al. also observed that the prototype drugs altered the activity of many genes with roles in healthy tissues such as immune, bone and stem cells. Further experiments in mice and cells grown in the laboratory confirmed that these prototype drugs have adverse effects on healthy intestinal and bone marrow stem cells and trigger changes to immune cells. These concerning side effects were also evident when the prototype drugs were tested in rats and dogs. Furthermore, the experiments indicate that there is not a suitable range of doses of these drugs in which the therapeutic benefits outweigh the toxic side effects."

It also has a role in transcription elongation and pausing, and can influence chromatin structure, where it facilitates the formation of enhancer-promoter gene loops and is enriched at \u2018super-enhancer\u2019 regions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Poss et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Whyte, 2013</a>). Mediator activity is regulated by the association with a four-subunit kinase module containing cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), cyclin C (CCNC) and Mediator subunits MED12 and MED13 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Poss et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Taatjes et al., 2002</a>). As a kinase that reversibly associates with the\u00a0Mediator, CDK8 is thought to regulate gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors and Mediator subunits (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rzymski et al., 2015</a>). Phosphorylation by CDK8 can directly alter transcription factor activity (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bancerek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Morris et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>) or mark factors for degradation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fryer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alarc\u00f3n et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>).

This is particularly true in cancer, where <i>CDK8</i> may function not only as an oncogene, but also as a tumor-suppressor depending on the cellular context (<a href=\"#bib30\">McCleland et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mitra et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chattopadhyay et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Firestein et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Seo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 2012</a>). <i>CDK8</i> may act as an oncogene in colorectal cancer where <i>CDK8</i> is amplified, with copy number gains observed in ~60% of tumors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Firestein et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Seo et al., 2010</a>), and shRNA knockdown can reduce the growth of human colorectal cancer xenografts harbouring <i>CDK8</i> gene amplification (<a href=\"#bib14\">Firestein et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Starr et al., 2009</a>).

Importantly, <i>CDK8</i> expression transforms fibroblasts into a malignant phenotype, whereas expression of a kinase-dead mutant does not (<a href=\"#bib14\">Firestein et al., 2008</a>). An shRNA screen has also demonstrated a requirement for CDK8 in the activation of WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Firestein et al., 2008</a>), suggesting that CDK8 and the Mediator kinase module may promote oncogenesis through activation of the canonical WNT pathway."

Compound 3 binds in a twisted conformation, as previously described for 1, with the indazole substituent at C5 of the pyridine ring forming a pi-cation interaction with Arg356 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallinger et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2016a</a>). Compound 4 forms similar interactions with the hinge region and with the catalytic Lys52 to those observed for compound 3, and its <i>p</i>-chlorophenyl substituent occupies the same region as the indazole subsituent of compound 3; however, the scaffold architecture of the two compounds is entirely different (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Throughout our studies on both chemical series, we observed a strong correlation between the compounds\u2019 affinities for both CDK8 and CDK19, suggesting that selective inhibition of CDK8 versus CDK19 is likely to be a significant challenge (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dale et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mallinger et al., 2016a</a>). This reflects the high sequence similarity between CDK8 and CDK19 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We also tested selected compounds from a further three chemical series that we identified from the literature and again could not detect any substantial selectivity for CDK8 versus CDK19 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>)."

All four compounds potently inhibited a WNT-dependent reporter in all of the cell lines tested, but did not inhibit a WNT-independent housekeeping <i>EEF1A1</i> promoter-reporter construct in the negative control RKO colorectal cancer cell line, which expresses low levels of beta-catenin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallinger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dale et al., 2015</a>). Weakly-active negative-control compounds from the 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine and 3-methyl-1<i>H</i>-pyrazolo[3,4-<i>b</i>]pyridine series (compounds 5 and 6 respectively) did not inhibit reporter gene expression or STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Given the potent inhibition of reporter activity we were surprised by the lack of effect of our potent inhibitors on tumor cell proliferation after standard 4 d continuous exposure conditions (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). However, this was consistent with a reported lack of antiproliferative effects for a different chemical series in a single colorectal cancer cell line (<a href=\"#bib23\">Koehler et al., 2016</a>). Silencing of <i>CDK8</i> and/or <i>CDK19</i> by shRNA in <i>CDK8</i>-amplified COLO205 cells also had no effect on viability, despite evidence for inhibition of reporter output or target gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Knockdown was more effective when we used <i>CDK8</i> and/or <i>CDK19</i> siRNA in <i>CDK8</i>-amplified HT29 cells, but again we saw no significant effect on viability after 5 d exposure to siRNA, despite near complete inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation by the <i>CDK8</i> siRNA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). In contrast, a 14 d colony growth assay revealed a significantly similar antiproliferative effect for the lead compounds from both chemical series (p&lt;0.001 for all comparisons with 1, 3 and 4; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which was not observed for the negative-control compounds 5 and 6. However, no compounds showed colony growth inhibition in the negative control RKO colorectal cancer cell line (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallinger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dale et al., 2015</a>). In this assay, we found three beta-catenin mutant (LS513, LS180, LS174T) and an APC mutant (SW620) colorectal cell lines to be most sensitive to treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The association between beta-catenin mutation and sensitivity to compound treatment in the colony assay did not reach significance (p&gt;0.05). The lack of response of the RKO cells suggested that colony growth in this line did not require beta-catenin or CDK8 and contrasted with the APC or beta-catenin mutant lines where colony growth appeared to be dependent on beta-catenin-regulated transcription that also required CDK8/19. Overall, there was no significant correlation between compound activity in TCF-reporter, phospho-biomarker, colony growth assays and either CDK8/19 protein levels or gene copy number (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Previously, we demonstrated that compound 1 inhibited TCF/LEF-reporter gene expression and reduced STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation by &gt;80%. This translated into tumor growth inhibition following oral dosing of 1 in mice bearing established COLO205 or SW620 colorectal cancer cell xenografts (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallinger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dale et al., 2015</a>). We also found evidence for a significant, dose-dependent, reduction in tumor growth in HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell line xenografts as well as significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI = 81%; p&lt;0.001) at 70\u00a0mg/kg in an LS513 human colorectal cancer xenograft model with concomitant reduction of p-STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> at 6 hr (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>)."

                                "text": "For the lead compounds 3 and 4, we modelled the inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation using multiple sets of experimentally-derived data from HCT116 and SW620 human tumor xenografts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). Detailed analysis, initially in HCT116 tumor xenografts, showed that maximal inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation required treatment with \u22655 mg/kg compound 3 and that higher concentrations prolonged the period of maximal inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). In SW620 tumor xenografts biomarker inhibition was rapidly achieved following treatment with 3 or 4 and could be maintained for approximately 10 hr after a single treatment with 30 mg/kg of 3, while 30 or 100 mg/kg of 4 prolonged the period of inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation so that, unlike 3, multiple dosing with 4 prevented recovery of biomarker to control levels between treatments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A</a>,<a href=\"#fig3\">3D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Both lead compounds 3 and 4 exhibited reproducible, dose-dependent antitumor activity in SW620 tumor xenografts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) and also in an additional LS1034 colorectal tumor model that responded to our compounds in the in vitro clonogenic assay (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). While 5 mg/kg compound 3 induced maximal inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation in SW620 human tumor xenografts, its effects were short-lived, and were not sufficient to translate into antitumor activity (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). However, higher 30 mg/kg doses of compound 3 prolonged the maximal inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation and had a significant (p&lt;0.01) antitumor effect (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). As with 3, 10 mg/kg of 4 inhibited the pathway biomarker for 6 hr, but was not sufficient for antitumor activity in SW620 xenografts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). However, repeated dosing of 4 at 50 or 100\u00a0mg/kg prolonged the inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation and gave evidence of antitumor activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Hence, the antitumor activity of 3 and 4 against colorectal cancer xenografts showed clear dose-dependence, with a requirement for prolonged pathway inhibition in order to significantly reduce tumor growth."

Firstly, we determined if our compounds were active in in vitro soft agar clonogenic assays, using cells derived from 89 distinct PDX models from different tissue types. In this assay, colony growth was inhibited, but only by up to 50%, in one-third of PDX cell cultures treated with tool compound 2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). Six of the more sensitive colorectal PDX tumor models were selected for in vivo monotherapy either with the lead compound 3 alone, or combined with a standard of care drug (irinotecan or oxaliplatin). Only two of these colorectal cancer PDX tumor<strike>s</strike> models, CFX 883 and CFX 1753, responded to monotherapy with 3 (p&lt;0.0001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

In 12 single or co-culture in vitro tissue models we assayed 163 clinically relevant extracellular biomarkers including cytokines, chemokines, membrane receptors, matrix components, and proteases (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berg et al., 2010</a>). All four compounds (1\u20134) elicited a similar biomarker response across the cell line panel (median r = 0.812; range: 0.630 \u2013 0.924), indicating that the observed changes were the result of CDK8/19 inhibition rather than off-target effects. Comparing the effects of our compounds with a proprietary database of &gt;3000 approved drugs and experimental agents failed to find any close matches (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berg et al., 2010</a>). The levels of interleukin 17A and 17F usually rise and fall together (<a href=\"#bib31\">Melton et al., 2013</a>), but treatment with our compounds elicited an unusual split response, with an increase in IL-17A and a corresponding decrease in IL-17F (BT condition: <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Overall, the pattern observed across the biomarkers was consistent with the\u00a0effects of our compounds on inflammation (VCAM-1, sPGE2 and IL-8), immunomodulation (IL-17A, IL-17F, HLA-DR and IgG) and tissue remodelling (uPAR)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). In additional studies in rats treated with 3 we measured the levels of ten plasma cytokines associated with the Th1/Th2 immune response.

However, there was some evidence for body weight loss that sometimes necessitated short dosing breaks (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Given this sporadic body weight loss in mice and our evidence that the compounds had effects on bone development, altered immune/inflammatory profiles and stem cell differentiation in vitro or in vivo experimental models, we carried out detailed toleration studies. Our aim was to determine if there was a therapeutic window for the compounds, using PK/PD and efficacy data determined in our mouse models as a guide. Following daily doses of compound 3 or 4 for 14 days in rats we detected significant, adverse alterations in multiple organ systems and tissues (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In these toleration studies, we demonstrated extensive (80%) inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation 6 hr post-treatment at all doses of 3 tested (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The lowest doses administered resulted in plasma concentrations below or equivalent to the plasma exposures achieved at efficacious doses in our experimental human tumor xenograft efficacy models, suggesting the lack of a clear therapeutic window (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Consistent with our in vitro observations of the\u00a0effects on bone maturation, the rat studies revealed two different, paradoxical effects on bone: an inhibitory effect resulting in dysplasia of the growth plate, a decrease in the proliferative zone and false endochondral ossification, and an activating effect resulting in proliferation of irregular woven bone in the bone cavity and below the periosteum (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Other adverse pathomorphological findings included necrotic and apoptotic cell lesions in the exocrine pancreas, gastrointestinal mucosa (stomach and duodenum), male reproductive tract (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), mammary gland, skin (hair follicle), heart (valvular interstitial cells) and lymphatic tissues (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes). Proliferative lesions were found in the lungs (bronchiolar epithelium and smooth muscle cells), liver (bile ducts and smooth muscle cells of hepatic arteries), thymus (epithelium free areas), mammary gland, male reproductive system and heart (valvular interstitial cells) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The potential difference between loss of protein and inhibition of enzymatic activity is highlighted by a recent study with the natural product CDK8/19 inhibitor cortistatin A that found a treatment-induced gene expression profile distinct from the profile resulting from CDK8/19 shRNA knockouts in the same cell line (<a href=\"#bib35\">Poss et al., 2016</a>). Also conscious of the potentially opposing context-dependent roles of CDK8 in tumor development, we set out to clarify the therapeutic potential of targeting CDK8/19. Using two structurally-distinct series of potent and highly selective ligands that we discovered, we explored the consequences of CDK8/19 targeting in vitro and in vivo and investigated tolerability to determine if there was a\u00a0therapeutic window (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallinger et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Czodrowski et al., 2016</a>). Despite reproducible inhibition of TCF/LEF reporter activity and STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation by both series of compounds, we were only able to detect modest, though generally significant, antiproliferative or antitumor effects in vitro or in vivo. In follow-up studies on cell cultures derived from PDX tumors, and selected PDXs in vivo, we found that compounds from the 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine series had only modest effects in vitro and little effect in vivo despite maximal inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation. The pleiotropic nature of CDK8/19 function, influencing the activity of multiple specific transcription factors and also super-enhancers, may make identification of biomarkers for particular cancer cell types that are especially sensitive to CDK8/19 inhibitors challenging; despite this both series of compounds did show greater potency in a systemic or subcutaneous model of human AML, similar to that reported for the natural product inhibitor of CDK8/19, cortistatin A (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>)."

Moreover, Pelish and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>) recently demonstrated that in AML cells CDK8 is associated with gene super-enhancers and that pharmacological inhibition of CDK8 activated super-enhancer output. Here, we also found that pharmacological inhibition of CDK8 with our potent and selective chemical probes in colorectal cancer models resulted in gene expression profiles consistent with increased super-enhancer activity. Genes whose expression were altered by the compounds included those encoding products associated with bone development, stem cell biology, immunology and inflammation. Extensive follow up experiments in in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated effects on bone, stem cell differentiation and response of immune cells to different stimuli. Some of the effects were unique, for example concentration-dependent stimulation or inhibition of bone matrix production by osteoprogenitor cells in vitro that was not observed with a WNT-pathway inhibitor."

We found that complete inhibition of CDK8/19 in the presence of activated oncogenic beta-catenin mimicked the effect of reducing, rather than completely abrogating, WNT-signaling. CDK8/19 inhibition resulted in a shift from a stem cell to a predominantly TA cell phenotype. This response may also be linked to super-enhancer activation, as\u00a0expression of <i>Myc</i>, a super-enhancer-regulated gene (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013</a>), was repressed in the stem cell population, but elevated in the TA cell population following compound treatment. The example of <i>Myc</i> illustrates the potential complexity of the response to CDK8 inhibition, as <i>Myc</i> expression will potentially be repressed through loss of CDK8 activity required by beta-catenin, but <i>Myc</i> expression may also be promoted through super-enhancer activation. This suggests that cellular context will have a major impact on the transcriptional response to CDK8 inhibition."

In rat and dog tolerability studies, we found that 3 and 4 produced unusually extensive, but similar, adverse effects in a wide range of tissues. Given our observations, that are consistent with the reported role of CDK8 in repressing super-enhancer activity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>), and the potentially key roles of super-enhancers as master controllers of cell identity and function\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Whyte et al., 2013</a>), the breadth, degree and depth of adverse effects is perhaps not surprising. We detected elevation of the mainly proinflammatory and proimmunestimulatory associated cytokine, IL-12, in rats treated with 3. Elevated IL-12 may result from decreased STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> following CDK8 inhibition, as bone marrow macrophages from STAT1<sup>S727A</sup> mutant mice exhibit elevated IL-12 and Cox-2 expression following activation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schroder et al., 2007</a>). Cox-2 induction is associated with an increased production of PGE2, which we detected in vitro, that may also explain the unusual split response of increased IL-17A and decreased IL-17F observed in our in vitro experiments, since PGE2, or agonists of the EP receptor for PGE2 are among the few stimuli that induce this split effect (<a href=\"#bib31\">Melton et al., 2013</a>)."

Our data strongly suggest that the adverse effects are target related as they are detected with two chemically distinct series of potent and selective CDK8/19 ligands and indicate that dual pharmacological CDK8/19 inhibition is not tolerated in rats or dogs at exposure levels that correspond to therapeutically relevant exposures. Even in the more sensitive xenograft models of AML, there was no clear therapeutic window, as these tumors responded only when STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation was continuously inhibited and equivalent exposures were not tolerated in our\u00a0<i>in vivo</i> rat and dog toleration\u00a0studies. Protein kinase inhibitors in clinical development or approved often have off-target activity or in some cases can be intentionally multi-targeted to have inhibitory activity against multiple protein kinases. Our observations are important for both scenarios as we identify CDK8/19 as potential \u2018anti-targets\u2019 to be avoided and we recommend screening against these protein kinases when establishing the safety profile of lead compounds and development candidates as well as assessing the quality of chemical probes."

Here, we employed two different series of potent and selective CDK8/19 inhibitors, with paired negative controls, that are much less challenging to synthesise compared to cortistatin A (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>). Our synthetic compounds have optimal pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties with single digit nM affinities for CDK8/19 and low nanomolar activity against promoter and STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> reporter assays and are as potent as cortistatin A, as well as exhibiting very high selectivity in broad kinome profiling. As described by Pelish and colleagues for cortistatin A, we found similar induction of super-enhancer-regulated genes with our compounds, although note that in our case we profiled gene expression in tumours treated in vivo rather than in vitro (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>). Similar to cortistatin A our compounds were also tolerated in mice and likewise we also found AMLs to be highly sensitive in vivo models (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>). However, in our study we also evaluated our two series in dedicated tolerability studies in rat and dog that revealed toxicity not apparent in mouse studies. The detailed toxicity profile of cortistatin A was not reported by Pelish and colleagues, but given the similarities in the results from in vitro and in vivo studies between cortistatin A and our two series we predict that cortistatin A and other CDK8/19 inhibitors would exhibit similar toxicity."

For example, CDK8/19 inhibitors might modulate antitumor immunotherapy by inactivating STAT1 and stimulating tumor surveillance by NK cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Putz et al., 2013</a>). It is also unclear if toxicity could be avoided by selectively targeting CDK8 or CDK19 alone. During the optimisation of both the 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine and 3-methyl-1<i>H</i>-pyrazolo[3,4-<i>b</i>]pyridine series, we were unable to separate CDK8 from CDK19 affinity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mallinger et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Czodrowski et al., 2016</a>). This is also true for two additional distinct chemical series that we identified (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schiemann et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mallinger et al., 2016b</a>), and also for a further three chemotypes we profiled from the literature, all of which demonstrated balanced CDK8 and CDK19 affinity in our hands. Similarly, the natural product cortistatin A cannot selectively distinguish between CDK8 and 19 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>). The inability to selectively target CDK8 or CDK19 is likely due to the very high degree of sequence similarity around the active site of these two kinases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), suggesting that strategies to selectively target either of these paralogs will require a different approach, such as allosteric modulation or selective degradation."

This is of relevance\u00a0here as inhibition of these kinases has also been reported to affect super-enhancer-associated gene expression in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, MYCN-driven tumours, small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer models where anti-tumour activity is observed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Christensen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chipumuro et al., 2014</a>). In adult CDK7 conditional knockout mice, effects were seen in tissues with a high cell turnover that were at least in part due to a depleted stem cell population resulting from a loss of CDK1 and CDK2 activation or reduced super-enhancer-associated gene expression (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ganuza et al., 2012</a>). Super-enhancers are frequently found associated with genes whose products control the pluripotent state or define cell identity and this may make stem cell populations particularly vulnerable to therapeutic interventions that interfere with super-enhancer associated gene expression, including inhibitors of the transcription-regulating CDKs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Whyte et al., 2013</a>). In an in vivo mouse model of an oncogenically-activated stem cell compartment we found our CDK8/19 inhibitors altered the proportion of stem cells to proliferative TA cells that may in part be due to super-enhancer activation. This raises the hypothetical possibility that, similar to AML cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pelish et al., 2015</a>), the stem cell compartment requires a precise \u2018dosage\u2019 of super-enhancer activity and that activation or inhibition of super-enhancer activity will negatively impact the stem cell compartment. The selective CDK7 tool inhibitors are reported to be tolerated in mice and so predicted to be non-toxic (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Christensen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chipumuro et al., 2014</a>); however, our CDK8/19 inhibitors were also tolerated in mice and the toxicity was not revealed until detailed tolerability studies were performed in other species. Thus the true toxicity profile of other transcriptional CDK inhibitors may not be revealed until dedicated tolerability studies are performed using selective compounds with optimised pharmaceutical properties."

However, on the basis of the complex toxicological profile and an inability to define a clear therapeutic window, we have decided against the further clinical development of our compounds and suggest caution when considering the clinical applicability of other CDK8/19 inhibitors.

A great deal of interest in targeting super-enhancers in oncology has emerged from the work of Young, Gray, Shair, and others including Clarke et al. The natural product corticostatin A which targets CDK8/19 highly selectively was shown by Shair (Nature, 2015) to activate super enhancer gene sets which include tumor suppressive genes. The Clarke et al. team previously (Nature Chem. Bio., 2015) came across CDK8/19 as the relevant target in a hit from a Wnt-cell based screen. Thus, having identified a new chemical series for inhibition of CDK8/19, they asked whether using a panel of different structurally distinct CDK8/19 inhibitors could be employed to further test CDK8/19 as a target in oncology. In short, through careful pathway readouts (Stat phosphorylation) and cell killing assays in tumor cell lines as well as patient derived xenografts, they show that inhibition of CDK8/19 and by extension, activation of mediator, has complex effects in multiple organ systems, bone and immune cells in both ex vivo and <i>in vivo</i> settings. The most sensitive cancer cell type appears to be AML, which is consistent with the previously described CDK8/19 inhibitor corticostatin, suggesting that the compounds which are claimed to be CDK8/19 inhibitors provide the same biological effects. Even in AML, there appears to be little or no therapeutic window, which is relevant since this would likely be the most attractive clinical indication."

However, in the broader context of contributing to our understanding of complex biology of mediator kinases and the potential for therapeutic benefit, I think it does warrant publication in a high profile/general interest journal. As I cited above, many of the papers in this area in the last two years have appeared in similar general interest journals, highlighting the impact this manuscript could have. One always wonders if the authors of such a paper have an \"axe\" to grind in some way. However, since these authors previously were pursuing this same target class independently, I think they were not initially hoping to invalidate the targets. As the community recently saw with MTH1 \"inhibitors\" reported by two groups in Nature and then followed up by high quality on target molecules invalidating MTH1, with better tool compounds, it is critical to publish results from testing of second/third generation tool compounds as these clarify the real outcome if such agents would be put in the clinic."

In their Nature paper, Pelish and colleagues (Pelish et al. 2015. Nature 526:273-276) noted that AML cell growth was sensitive to cortistatin A and also a BRD4 inhibitor, I-BET151, that had opposing effects on super-enhancer associated gene expression. They suggested that AML cells are dependent on a \u2018precise dosage\u2019 of super-enhancer associated gene expression for survival. Importantly, even though the two compounds have opposing effects, combined treatment showed that I-BET151 had a dominant effect over cortistatin A.

Super-enhancers are frequently found associated with genes whose products control the pluripotent state or define cell identity. Therefore targeting transcriptional CDKs such as 7, 12 and 13 may deplete the stem cell compartment, as detected in conditional CDK7 knockouts in adult mice described above. In an <i>in vivo</i> model of an oncogenically activated stem cell compartment signalling we report that our CDK8/19 inhibitors altered the proportion of stem cells to proliferative TA cells in the hyperplastic crypt that may in part be due to super-enhancer activation. This raises the hypothetical possibility that similar to AML cells, the stem cell compartment requires a precise \u2018dosage\u2019 of super-enhancer activity and that activation or inhibition of super-enhancer activity will have a negative impact on the stem cell compartment. The selective CDK7 tool inhibitors are reported to be tolerated in mice and so are predicted to be non-toxic; however, as we reported, our CDK8/19 inhibitors were also tolerated in mice and the toxicity was not revealed until detailed tolerability studies were performed in higher species. This suggests that the true toxicity profile of inhibitors of the other transcriptional CDKs may not be revealed until dedicated tolerability studies are performed in higher species using selective compounds with optimised pharmaceutical properties. We have added a short paragraph to the Discussion to cover these points (eighth paragraph)."

Nature 526:273-276) found AML cells were particularly sensitive to cortistatin A treatment and demonstrated corresponding CDK8/19 inhibition with STAT1<sup>SER727</sup>, a target engagement biomarker for CDK8/19 inhibition. They also demonstrated that Cortistatin A inhibited the CDK8 kinase module, but did not inhibit other transcriptional CDKs and did not bind to ROCK1 or 2, the other described targets for cortistatin A, in MOLM-4 AML cell lysates. In addition they showed that Cortistatin A was orally bioavailable, well tolerated in mice and efficacious against AML solid tumor xenograft or systemic disease models. The authors concluded that \u2018The specificity, potency, favorable pharmacokinetics and long residence time of CA make it a useful <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> probe of Mediator kinases and a promising lead for development of therapeutics.\u2019 In our paper we employed two different and chemically distinct series of potent and selective CDK8/19 modulators s that are much less challenging to synthesise compared to cortistatin A. These compounds had optimal pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties with single digit nM affinities for CDK8/19 and low nanomolar activity in promoter and STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> reporter assays and are as potent as cortistatin A. As described by Pelish and colleagues for cortistatin A, we found similar induction of super-enhancer-regulated genes, although we carried out gene expression profiling of xenograft tumors treated <i>in vivo</i> rather than <i>in vitro</i> culture. Our compounds were similarly tolerated in mice and we also independently found AML to be a highly sensitive tumor type for our compounds. However, in our study we also tested our two series in dedicated tolerability studies in higher species that revealed toxicity not apparent in mouse studies. Given the similarities in the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies between cortistatin A and our own two series, we predict that cortistatin A will exhibit similar toxicity."
