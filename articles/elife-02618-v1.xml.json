To duplicate a molecule of double-stranded DNA within a cell, an \u2018initiation factor\u2019 recognises a stretch of DNA called an origin of replication and then recruits an enzyme called a helicase that goes on to unwind the double helix. This process exposes the two strands of DNA and allows them to act as templates to guide the synthesis of two new strands of DNA\u2014which are called the leading and lagging strands. The end result is two identical molecules of double-stranded DNA."

Now, in <i>eLife</i>, researchers at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) show how the leading strand template becomes selected as the \u2018translocation strand\u2019 by a helicase at a molecular level (<a href=\"#bib4\">Froelich et al., 2014</a>)."

The Enemark lab determined the three-dimensional structure of a single-stranded fragment of DNA bound to a helicase ring from a species of archaea that lives in deep ocean vents. This helicase, called MCM, is the archaeal equivalent of the eukaryotic Mcm2-7 complex, and is easier to study because it is made of six identical protein subunits, whereas Mcm2-7 is made of six different protein subunits. Nevertheless, the two complexes are thought to be similar enough that general conclusions might be translated from one complex to the other."

This suggests that the new MCM-DNA crystal structure reported by Froelich, Kang et al. might have captured an intermediate form of DNA that exists when the origin of replication melts at the onset of DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This notion is also compatible with the results of in vitro experiments with related proteins from yeast, which were conducted in the Bell lab at MIT (<a href=\"#bib4\">Froelich et al. 2014</a>)."

Remarkably, all these residues are close to one another and constitute an extended single-stranded-binding surface on the Mcm2-7 that is proposed to function in DNA melting and strand selection. A combined mutant of these three subunits can, in fact, still be loaded onto double-stranded DNA, albeit with low efficiency. However, the mutant cannot bind single stranded DNA, does not recruit some of the factors that are essential for origin activation, and it cannot support DNA replication and cell division."

Froelich, Kang et al. propose that the two Mcm2-7 motor domains must play an important function in the early stages of origin activation, pumping duplex DNA towards the centre of the complex, and hence promoting duplex melting and the subsequent capture of the leading strand by the helicase. Determining how the Mcm2-7 motor domain engages with DNA is an important challenge for future studies."
