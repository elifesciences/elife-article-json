How context is communicated within the cortical network in sensory and mnemonic forms is unknown due to the lack of methods for high-resolution, brain-wide neuronal recording and analysis. Here, we report the comprehensive architecture of a cortical network for context processing. Using hemisphere-wide, high-density electrocorticography, we measured large-scale neuronal activity from monkeys observing videos of agents interacting in situations with different contexts. We extracted five context-related network structures including a bottom-up network during encoding and, seconds later, cue-dependent retrieval of the same network with the opposite top-down connectivity. These findings show that context is represented in the cortical network as distributed communication structures with dynamic information flows. This study provides a general methodology for recording and analyzing cortical network neuronal communication during cognition."

Implantation surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. No animal was sacrificed in this study. Overall care was managed by the Division of Research Resource Center at RIKEN Brain Science Institute. The animal was housed in a large individual enclosure with other animals visible in the room, and maintained on a 12:12-hr light:dark cycle. The animal was given food (PS-A; Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and water ad libitum, and also daily fruit/dry treats as a means of enrichment and novelty. The animal was occasionally provided toys in the cage. The in-house veterinary doctor checked the animal and updated daily feedings in order to maintain weight. We have attempted to offer as humane treatment of our subject as possible."

Afterwards, the video monkey either displays a frightened expression or a neutral one.

How these monkeys shifted their gaze depended on the context, but this behavior was absent when the video monkey gave a neutral expression."

The monkeys' brains sent information from a region called the temporal cortex (which is involved in processing sensory and social information), to another region called the prefrontal cortex (which is involved in functions such as reasoning, attention, and memory). Seconds later, the flow of information was reversed as the monkeys utilized information about the context to guide their behavior."

Different contexts can dramatically alter perception, cognition, or emotional reactions and decision-making, and in the brain network context can be represented during sensory encoding or mnemonic retrieval. The study of context is important for understanding the link between perception and cognition, in terms of both behavioral and neural processing, and the neural mechanisms underlying contextual information processing have been studied in a variety of domains including visual perception (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bar, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schwartz et al., 2007</a>), emotion (<a href=\"#bib21\">De Gelder, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barrett et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barrett and Kensinger, 2010</a>), language (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hagoort, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aravena et al., 2010</a>), and social cognition (<a href=\"#bib39\">Iba\u00f1ez and Manes, 2012</a>). In the brain, context is proposed to require an interplay between bottom-up and top-down information processing in distributed neural networks (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tononi and Edelman, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Friston, 2005</a>). However, a comprehensive functional view of the brain circuits that mediate contextual processing remains unknown because bottom-up and top-down processes are often concurrent and interdependent, making the temporal and spatial resolution of their neural network organization difficult to separate."

The approach combines broadband neural recording of brain activity at high spatial and temporal resolution with big data analytical techniques to enable the computational extraction of latent structure in functional network dynamics. We employed this novel methodological pipeline to identify functional network structures underlying fast, internal, concurrent, and interdependent cognitive processes during context processing in monkeys watching video clips with sequentially staged contextual scenarios. Each scenario contained a conspecific showing emotional responses preceded by different situational contexts. With specific combinations of context and response stimuli, this paradigm allowed an examination of context-dependent brain activity and behavior by isolating context processing as a single variable in the task."

The five network structures we identified reveal how contextual information can be encoded and retrieved to modulate behavior with different bottom-up or top-down configurations.

Thus, we believe that the network structures we observed represent a module of modules, or \u2018meta-module\u2019 for brain communication connectivity. Further investigation of this meta-structure organization for brain network communication could help determine how deficits in context processing in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barch et al., 2003</a>) and post-traumatic stress disorder (<a href=\"#bib45\">Milad et al., 2009</a>) could contribute to their etiology."

The non-negativity constraint was introduced mainly for a more simple visualization of the results. The convergence criterion, that is, the relative change in fit for which the algorithm stops, was set to be 1e-6. The initialization method was set to be DTLD (direct trilinear decomposition) or GRAM (generalized rank annihilation method), which was considered the most accurate method (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cichocki et al., 2009</a>). Initialization with random orthogonalized values (repeated 100 times, each time with different random values) was also shown for comparison."

A new tensor was formed and we estimated how the five spectrotemporal connectivity structures identified from the original data contributed in the shuffled data, by performing PARAFAC on the tensor from the shuffled data with the last two tensor dimensions (Time-Frequency and Connection-Subject) fixed with the values acquired from the original data. Trial shuffling was performed 50 times. The loading from the original data that was significantly different than the loadings from the shuffled data is identified as the significant loading (\u03b1 = 0.05). The comparisons with significant loadings showed the context and response dependencies of each structure, and further revealed the activation levels of each structure in different scenarios."

One impediment to understanding how these circuits interact to translate sensory perception into behavior is that the methods typically applied suffer from either poor temporal resolution (fMRI in humans), poor spatial resolution (EEG), or limited coverage (single unit recording in animals). The current paper uses wide-scale recordings from intracranial EEG (ECoG) system to simultaneously assess interactions amongst cortical areas during social information processing. Importantly, the authors apply sophisticated, data-driven analytical tools to derive the information flow between and amongst these areas. This is an important advance."

The paper is unique in two respects. First, the dataset contains whole-hemisphere ECoG is collected whilst three non-human primates perform a social task (although the authors have published several papers with similar ECoG data previously). Second, the analysis approach is novel and innovative. dDTF is used to identify connections between regions, and then factor analysis is used to isolate how these vary as a function of different task conditions. Using this approach, the authors identify five separate networks (\u2018structures\u2019). These superficially have similarities in terms of their connectional structure (e.g. structures 1/2, and structures 3/4), but differ in terms of their temporal dynamics and their activation across conditions. Intriguingly, some of the networks contain classic \u2018social\u2019 regions, such as the superior temporal sulcus. By examining how these networks evolve through time, the authors attempt to reveal the chain of events underlying different forms of social observation."

Upon reaching the Results, there were some clearly interesting findings, but many of the interpretations were dependent upon a reverse inference from the brain regions activated (Poldrack <span class=\"underline\">RA, TiCS 2006</span>), as opposed to an inference based on the task manipulation.

That brain regions are activated sequentially in response to a task, and that different brain areas will be recruited depending upon the cognitive function? On the one hand, this seems to be something that we already know from many years of MEG and EEG research in humans. On the other, it is clear that the spatial resolution of the ECoG data far surpasses this research, and the extraction of network structure is very different from what has gone before. Nevertheless, I still very much struggled to understand whether this extraction of network structure was (a) valid or (b) important. In terms of validity, if I were reviewing this paper at a methods journal, I'd expect a set of examples in simulated data to convince me that the method works well and robustly.
