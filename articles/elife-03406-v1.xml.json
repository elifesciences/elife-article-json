Such measurements have so far remained elusive and, thus, little is known about the relation between force and translocation and how this reflects on its mechanism and regulation. Here, we address these questions using optical tweezers to follow translation by individual ribosomes along single mRNA molecules, against an applied force. We find that translocation rates depend exponentially on the force, with a characteristic distance close to the one-codon step, ruling out the existence of sub-steps and showing that the ribosome likely functions as a Brownian ratchet. We show that the ribosome generates \u223c13 pN of force, barely sufficient to unwind the most stable structures in mRNAs, thus providing a basis for their regulatory role. Our assay opens the way to characterizing the ribosome's full mechano\u2013chemical cycle."

Such measurements have so far remained elusive and, thus, little is known about the relation between force and translocation and how this reflects on its mechanism and regulation. Here, we address these questions using optical tweezers to follow translation by individual ribosomes along single mRNA molecules, against an applied force. We find that translocation rates depend exponentially on the force, with a characteristic distance close to the one-codon step, ruling out the existence of sub-steps and showing that the ribosome likely functions as a Brownian ratchet. We show that the ribosome generates \u223c13 pN of force, barely sufficient to unwind the most stable structures in mRNAs, thus providing a basis for their regulatory role. Our assay opens the way to characterizing the ribosome's full mechano\u2013chemical cycle."

First, Liu, Kaplan et al. found that ribosomes jump directly from one triplet to the next in the mRNA sequence, rather than moving there in a series of smaller steps. Next, the results indicate that translocation occurs spontaneously, driven by thermal energy, while chemical reactions prevent the reverse movement, in a mechanism known as a \u2018Brownian Ratchet\u2019."

Following codon recognition and peptide bond formation, the ribosome has a deacylated tRNA in the P site and a peptidyl-tRNA in the A site. In order to start a new elongation cycle, the A site must be emptied to allow binding of the next aminoacyl-tRNA. To this end, the tRNAs and mRNA must move relative to the ribosome. This movement occurs in two steps (<a href=\"#bib21\">Moazed and Noller, 1989b</a>): first, the 3\u2032 ends of the tRNAs in the A and P sites move, with respect to the 50S subunit, into hybrid A/P and P/E states, respectively.

In the second step, which is irreversible and EF-G-dependent (<a href=\"#bib21\">Moazed and Noller, 1989b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Savelsbergh et al., 2003</a>), the mRNA is translocated by one codon, along with movement of the associated anticodon ends of the tRNAs to the classical P and E sites, coupled to an orthogonal rotation of the 30S subunit head domain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ratje et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dunkle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ermolenko and Noller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guo and Noller, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). The translocation process also involves other large-scale conformational changes in the ribosome, including reverse rotational movements of the 30S subunit body and head (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ermolenko and Noller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Guo and Noller, 2012</a>), and movement of the large subunit L1 stalk into the intersubunit space (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fei et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cornish et al., 2009</a>). Translocation is therefore a highly coordinated and complex process composed of inter- and intra-molecular, force-generating mechanical movements."

In the presence of initiation factors, initiator tRNA and GTP, a biotinylated ribosome is assembled at the AUG start site of an mRNA, whose 3\u2032 end had been previously annealed to a complementary DNA handle harboring a 5\u2032 digoxigenin. The complex is then tethered between a pair of 2.1 \u00b5m diameter polystyrene beads: a streptavidin-coated bead, which binds to the ribosome and is held by suction on the end of a micropipette, and an anti-digoxigenin antibody-coated bead, which binds to the DNA handle and is held in an optical trap. Next, a mixture containing elongation factors, aminoacyl-tRNAs and GTP is introduced into the experimental chamber. The tension in the tether, stabilized by an automated feedback routine, produces a constant opposing force as translocation proceeds. Translation is followed in real time as a decrease in the tether length between the beads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As in all single-molecule experiments, there is a distribution of the noise level in the different single ribosome trajectories. As a result, some of the trajectories observed during translation bursts exhibit a particularly low noise level, and clearly show that the ribosome moves in periods of stationary dwells that are followed by translocation events corresponding to single codon steps (three nucleotides) along the mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in most trajectories the noise prevents us from unambiguously identifying the individual steps, and we therefore base our analysis on the average properties of the translation bursts. We separate these pauses from active translation bursts using a velocity threshold (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), and calculate the \u2018pause-free\u2019 velocity of the ribosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Note that the applied force acts between the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA and the small 30S subunit; there is no directly applied force between the mRNA and the large 50S subunit or between the 30S and the 50S subunits. In addition, the position of the attachment point (protein S16, in the \u2018back\u2019 of the 30S subunit) was chosen because it is remote of any known functional site and is not known to exhibit conformational dynamics during translocation. As a result, force only affects directly the mechanical step in which the anticodon loops of the tRNAs move from the A and P sites to the canonical P and E sites of the 30S subunit, respectively, together with the concomitant movement of the mRNA with respect to the ribosome. Hence, the position of the ribosome relative to the mRNA provides a convenient reaction coordinate to follow the translocation reaction during translational elongation.

Clearly, at the end of translocation the mRNA has moved by this distance from its pre-translocation position; however, this value can either reflect a single, one-codon mechanical movement (a single barrier crossing in the free energy surface landscape) or successive smaller substeps (multiple barrier crossings) that sum to one codon, for example, three one-nucleotide substeps. Directly observing these potential substeps requires a temporal and spatial resolution that is not possible in our present experiment because the flexible nature of the mRNA and the relatively low forces involved give rise to high levels of thermally-induced fluctuations. However, because the distance <math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>x</mi><mo>\u02dc</mo></mover></mrow></math> determined here is similar to the measured one-codon translocation step, we can rule out one- and two-nucleotide translocation substeps and conclude that codon translocation is performed by the ribosome in a single step."

Mechano-enzymes in general act by coupling a mechanical task (translocation, force generation, work) to a downhill chemical reaction (i.e., a reaction that lowers the total free energy of the system) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bustamante et al., 2004</a>). Clearly, given the diversity of conformational changes and chemical events associated with translocation by the ribosome, a complete description of the process should involve diffusion on a free-energy hypersurface with high dimensionality. However, given that our attachment geometry ensures that we affect and probe a single and well-defined mechanical coordinate, we can reduce this description to a simplified two-dimensional picture. In this two-dimensional free energy landscape one axis represents the mechanical coordinate that describes the movement of the mRNA relative to the 30S subunit, and the other axis the chemical coordinate that describes all binding, hydrolysis and dissociation processes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and, for the sake of simplicity, also conformational changes that have a reaction coordinate orthogonal to the reaction coordinate probed in our experiments. The most likely path for the reaction occurs along a minimum energy channel on this surface and the different events involved in translocation can now be described as diffusive transitions between minima of this (reduced) energy surface. Thus, for example, the classical-to-hybrid transitions and the associated ribosomal intersubunit rotations are assigned as movements along the chemical coordinate over a rather shallow activation energy that accounts for their reversible nature (<a href=\"#bib22\">Munro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cornish et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fei et al., 2008</a>). The three-dimensional energy surface depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> naturally explains how transition rates are affected when a mechanical force is applied. The effect is equivalent to tilting the potential energy surface by rotating the diagram around its chemical axis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bustamante et al., 2004</a>), hence affecting the rate and equilibrium constants of reactions along the mechanical coordinate, for example making translocation more (force applied in the aiding or \u2018pushing\u2019 direction) or less (force applied in the opposing or \u2018pulling\u2019 direction) favorable."

Fundamentally, there are two ways in which this coupling can occur: one possibility is that the energy released by the \u2018chemical\u2019 transition is directly harnessed to produce the change. In this case, usually called a \u2018Power Stroke (PS)\u2019 mechanism, the system moves diagonally in the energy landscape. Alternatively, it is possible that the system moves back-and-forth spontaneously, driven by thermal energy, along the mechanical coordinate, until a chemical transition, that occurs when the system is in the post-translocated state, prevents the back-translocation and \u2018rectifies\u2019 this random motion into directed motion. This second mechanism, in which the system moves on the energy landscape in two orthogonal steps, is called a \u2018Brownian Ratchet (BR)\u2019.

While these are two idealized cases and a real system is likely to combine features of these two models, the distance determined here (1.4 nm) is very close to the full 1.48 nm step size and indicates that, while we cannot fully rule out a PS mechanism, the ribosome likely functions as a BR during translocation. Notably, recent crystallographic studies of the ribosome bound to EF-G in a translocation intermediate (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pulk and Cate, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tourigny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>), and a previous structure of the ribosome bound to EF-G in the post-translocation state (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gao et al., 2009</a>) can lend support for this result and help clarify the identity of the reaction that rectifies translocation in this ratchet mechanism: the structures suggest that domain IV of EF-G could prevent back-translocation of the P-site tRNA by occupying the A-site, and that intercalation of two highly conserved bases of 16S rRNA into mRNA could prevent its back-translocation. These conformational changes could thus act as \u2018pawls\u2019 in the BR mechanism. Interestingly, the fact that both tRNA and mRNA movements would be locked could contribute to prevent frame shifting."

Our results indicate that the ribosome can generate forces as high as 13 \u00b1 2 pN. Remarkably, the ribosome stall force is very close to that required to unwind the strongest secondary structure motifs typically present in mRNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Tinoco et al., 2004</a>). The comparable magnitude between the mechanical strengths of RNAs and the stall force of the ribosome indicates that RNA secondary structures can have a strong effect on the rate of translation (and hence on phenomena such as frameshifting and cotranslational folding of the protein) and explains how these structures, while not being insurmountable barriers, can fulfill a regulatory role in the cell."

What is the energetic source for this mechanical work? The free-energy difference between peptide bond and ester bond hydrolysis is approximately \u22123.7 \u00b1 1.2 kcal/mol, equivalent to 6.3 \u00b1 2 kBT per bond exchange in our experimental conditions (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Hence, the maximal mechanical work that can be generated by the ribosome is \u223c80% of the total energy available from transpeptidation and, in principle, it is possible to power translocation from this energy without the need to invoke an energetic contribution from the hydrolysis of GTP. In fact, studies have shown that the ribosome can translocate in the absence of EF-G (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gavrilova et al., 1976</a>) or in the absence of GTP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pestka, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rodnina et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fredrick and Noller, 2003</a>). However, spontaneous forward translocation is unfavorable in many contexts (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shoji et al., 2006</a>), and efficient and rapid translocation does require EF-G and GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, 80% thermodynamic efficiency for conversion of chemical energy to mechanical motion is higher than occurs in most molecular motors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bustamante et al., 2004</a>), and, moreover, it is not clear how the energy available from peptide bond formation could be stored and transmitted from the 50S to the 30S subunit. Instead, in view of our results, a mechanism in which EF-G binding and GTP hydrolysis account for the energy of translocation and resetting (including EF-G\u2013GDP dissociation) appears to be more likely."

                        "text": "Not surprisingly, the mechanism of action of the ribosome as a mechano-enzyme during translocation is more complicated than that of a typical molecular motor. One possible scenario that emerges from this and previous studies is that translocation is achieved by two consecutive BRs: during the first step, the ribosomal subunits rotate back and forth relative to each other along an axis perpendicular to the subunits interface. This process, reversible and thermally activated, is accompanied by the repositioning of the 3\u2032-acceptor ends of the tRNAs initially in the classical A and P states into the hybrid A/P and P/E states and movement of the L1 stalk. Binding of EF-G\u2013GTP stabilizes the tRNAs in their hybrid states and the counter-clockwise rotation of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit. Hence, binding of EF-G functions as a rectifying reaction for the first BR. The ribosome acts as a GTPase activator for EF-G, and rapid GTP hydrolysis catalyzes conformational changes in the ribosome (e.g., swiveling of the head, which opens the way for the passage of the P-site tRNA anti-codon stem-loop to the E site) that result in allowing spontaneous and thermally activated transitions between the pre- and post-translocation state. This second BR is likely to be rectified by the movement of domain IV of EF-G into the A-site and the intercalation of two conserved bases of 16S rRNA into mRNA. Pi release then induces a relaxation of EF-G, destabilizing the contacts between domains III and V and the ribosome and resulting in EF-G dissociation."

It is well known that translating ribosomes tend to pause at specific secondary structure motifs (such as hairpins and pseudoknots). However, if that were the case for the observed pauses, their occurrence would be correlated with the position on the template (which we do not observe) and their density would depend strongly on the applied force, as this force will destabilize the secondary structure ahead of the ribosome in the geometry used in these experiments. Thus, the force independence of the entry and exit rates rules out this possibility. Hence, we favor a model in which these pauses represent events that are off-pathway from the main incorporation and translocation cycle. The rate limiting transitions into these off-pathway states are steps along a non-mechanical reaction coordinate, or alternatively a mechanical coordinate that is orthogonal to the translocation movement, and hence not affected by the externally applied force. Interestingly, the pause entry and exit rates are very similar, indicating that in the conditions of our experiments the time spent by the ribosome in the productive translation states and the unproductive paused state are nearly the same."

During this step, initiation complex attach to the beads through recognition between the complementary DNA handle (harboring a 5\u2032 digoxigenin) that has been annealed to the mRNA and the anti-digoxigenin antibody coated on the beads. The initiation complex beads were then flowed into the chamber of the optical tweezers. After trapping one initiation complex bead in the optical trap, a streptavidin-coated bead, which binds to the ribosome and is held by suction on the end of a micropipette was moved to approach to the initiation complex bead. Binding of the biotinylated ribosome on the initiation complex to the streptavidin bead, results in an initiation complex tethered between two beads. Next, the translation mixture is flown into the chamber, and translation is followed in real time as a decrease in the tether length between the beads. No translation signals were detected before the introduction of the mixture."

(2003)</a>, but with an improved design that allows for better spatial and temporal resolution. Briefly, the two counter-propagating, orthogonally polarized laser beams that form the trap are coupled into two single-mode optical fibers and focused by two high numerical aperture objectives at a common position. The location of the optical trap can be controlled by tilting the tips of the optical fibers using two piezoelectric crystals, controlled by a feedback loop that maintains the respective focal points at a common position. The position of the trap is measured by a pair of position sensitive detectors (PSDs) that measure the tilting of the beams before entering the objectives, and the force is assessed from a second pair of PSDs to which the light distribution at the back focal planes of the objectives is imaged. All signals are sampled at 1 kHz."

Then, instantaneous velocities were calculated using the averaged data. We further calculated the standard deviation of the instantaneous velocities for the part of the tether extension before elongation factors were injected into the chamber, and noted it as \u03c3<sub>pause</sub>. To distinguish between pausing and translocation, we use 2.5 \u03c3<sub>pause</sub> as a threshold. All the absolute instantaneous velocities that are smaller than the threshold are attributed to pauses. All the absolute instantaneous velocities that are greater than or equal to the threshold are attributed to ribosome translocation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). The mean pause-free translocation velocity and translocation distance were calculated for each ribosome that actively translated the mRNA at constant forces. The mean translocation velocity for all the ribosomes that translate at specific constant forces was weighted by the total distance translocated by each ribosome. The mean translation velocities in nm/s were then converted to codon/s using the worm-like chain (WLC) model with a rise-per-base for ssRNA of 0.59 nm and a persistence length of 1 nm (<a href=\"#bib19\">Liphardt et al., 2001</a>)."

Using the fitted exponential dependence parameters, this results in F<sub>stall</sub> = 13 \u00b1 2 pN."

They found that translocation rates depend exponentially on the applied apposing force. From the translocation rate vs. force curve, the authors determine the characteristic distance of the translocation or the distance between the transition state and the pre-translocation state and found the distance to be roughly one-codon length. From this result, the authors suggested that the translocation does not have sub-codon sub-steps. The authors further found that the translocation stalling force to be \u223c13 pN, which is comparable to the force needed to unwind the most stable hairpin structures in mRNA, suggesting that the mRNA structure could be an efficient regulatory mechanism for translation. The translocation was also found to be interrupted by frequent pauses, with the pause-entry and pause-exit rates both being independent of the applied force."

As with any chemical reaction, which takes place when an intermediate, high-energy state is thermally reached, the time required for a single translocation step is a stochastic variable. Averaging over many such steps should result in a well-defined translocation rate. Most translation bursts observed in our experiments, however, are composed of a small number of such steps and, therefore, the stochastic nature of the basic step is still evident, resulting in bursts of different apparent rates. Note, that bursts containing a larger number of codons (such as the first and last in Figure. 1B, first panel) tend to be more uniform in their rates as a result of averaging."

Second, by choosing S16, in the \u201cback\u201d of the small subunit, which is far from any known functional site and not known to exhibit conformational dynamics during translocation, we ensure that the mechanical force affects and detects only movements between mRNA and the small subunit.

We believe this is the most likely scenario because our best estimation of xbar (1.4) is extremely close to the step size (1.48).
