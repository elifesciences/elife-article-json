We report here the structure of the intact functional assembly responsible for regulating and executing a site-specific DNA recombination reaction. The assembly is a 240-bp Holliday junction (HJ) bound specifically by 11 protein subunits. This higher-order complex is a key intermediate in the tightly regulated pathway for the excision of bacteriophage \u03bb viral DNA out of the <i>E. coli</i> host chromosome, an extensively studied paradigmatic model system for the regulated rearrangement of DNA. Our results provide a structural basis for pre-existing data describing the excisive and integrative recombination pathways, and they help explain their regulation."

We report here the structure of the intact functional assembly responsible for regulating and executing a site-specific DNA recombination reaction. The assembly is a 240-bp Holliday junction (HJ) bound specifically by 11 protein subunits. This higher-order complex is a key intermediate in the tightly regulated pathway for the excision of bacteriophage \u03bb viral DNA out of the <i>E. coli</i> host chromosome, an extensively studied paradigmatic model system for the regulated rearrangement of DNA. Our results provide a structural basis for pre-existing data describing the excisive and integrative recombination pathways, and they help explain their regulation."

Certain signals can later trigger the viral DNA to be removed from the bacterial chromosome, often after many generations, so that it can replicate and make new copies of the virus. Specific sites on the viral and bacterial DNA earmark where the virus\u2019s genetic information will insert and how it will be removed.

The structure was obtained using electron microscopy of complexes frozen in ice. The structure answers many of the long-standing questions about the removal and insertion reactions. For example, it shows how the DNA-bending proteins and enzymes assemble into a large complex to carry out the removal reaction, which is different from the complex that carries out the insertion reaction. It also shows that the removal and insertion reactions are each prevented from acting in the opposite direction because the two complexes have different requirements."

In those infected cells where the decision has been made not to replicate the viral DNA, the circularized supercoiled viral DNA (black lines) is inserted into the bacterial chromosome (curly red lines) at a specific site (called <i>att</i>B or BOB\u2019) located between the gal and bio genes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell, 1963</a>). This insertion, integrative recombination, involves cutting the viral DNA at a specific site (called <i>att</i>P or P\u2019C\u2019OCP) and joining these cut ends to the cut ends of the bacterial chromosome in <i>att</i>B. The cutting, recombining, and resealing of viral and bacterial DNA generates new DNA sequences forming the junctions between bacterial and integrated viral DNA. These junction sequences, called <i>att</i>L (BOC\u2019P\u2019) and <i>att</i>R (PCOB\u2019) on the left and right respectively, are themselves substrates for the cutting, recombining, and resealing reactions that will, sometime in the future, remove (excise) the viral DNA from the host chromosome and thereby regenerate the viral <i>att</i>P and bacterial <i>att</i>B sequences. The integrated provirus chromosome is stably inherited, with almost all of its genes repressed, for many bacterial generations. Upon instigation by the appropriate physiological signals, the viral chromosome is excised, replicated, and inserted into viral particles which are released into the environment. The integrative reaction requires the virally-encoded integrase protein (Int) and the bacterial accessory protein Integration Host Factor (IHF). The excisive reaction additionally requires the virally encoded accessory protein Xis (which also inhibits the integrative reactions). Both reactions are stimulated by the bacterial accessory protein Fis. (See Panel <b>C</b> for DNA binding sites of all the proteins and their respective roles in each reaction). Both reactions proceed through a four-way DNA junction called a Holliday junction\u00a0(HJ) (see Panel <b>B</b> for details of these DNA strand exchanges) (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib28\">Landy, 2015</a>]). (<b>B</b>) The Holliday junction intermediate. Cutting, recombining, and resealing DNA during recombination proceeds by two pairs of sequential single-strand DNA exchanges that are staggered by seven base pairs that are identical in all four <i>att</i> sites; they are referred to as the 'overlap' region (O). The molecular details of this recombination are common to all reactions catalyzed by the large family of tyrosine recombinases (except for the size of the O regions and the order of strand exchanges), as first characterized for \u03bb Int, Cre, Flp, and XerC/D (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib60\">Van Duyne, 2015</a>]). It proceeds in the absence of exogenous energy via the formation of high-energy covalent 3\u2019phospho-tyrosine intermediates in the active site of each Int protein. Illustrated here is the pathway for integrative recombination; it would be identical for the excisive reaction but the substrates (left panel) would be <i>att</i>L and <i>att</i>R, leading to <i>att</i>P and <i>att</i>B products (right panel). Viral and bacterial DNAs are denoted as in panel <b>A</b>. (i) The <i>att</i>P (C\u2019OC) and <i>att</i>B (BOB\u2019) sites are aligned anti-parallel with respect to their identical overlap sequences. (ii) The first pair of exchanges, always at the <b>C</b> (green) and <b>B</b> (blue) core sites, is initiated by formation of 3\u2019 phospho-tyrosine linkages (with Tyr342) and 5\u2019 OH termini. (iii) The 5\u2019 OH terminus generated by the cleavage at C attacks the phospho-tyrosine linkage at B to regenerate a new <b>B</b>\u2013<b>C\u2019</b> strand (orange arrow head). Concomitantly, the 5\u2019 OH from the cleavage at C attacks the phospho-tyrosine linkage at B to regenerate a new <b>B'</b>\u2013<b>C</b> strand (orange arrow head). Together, this pair of single strand exchanges, at one boundary of the overlap region, forms the four-way DNA (HJ) intermediate. (iv) A similar pair of single strand cleavage, exchange, and resealing reactions is executed by the Ints at <b>C\u2019</b> (brown) and <b>B\u2019</b> (purple) on the other side of the overlap region. (v) As a result of the two sequential pairs of single-strand exchanges, all four DNA strands have new junction sequences and the HJ is resolved to recombinant products <i>att</i>L (C\u2019OB) and <i>att</i>R (COB\u2019). <b>C</b>) Additional complexity, in the P\u2019 and P arms, confers regulation and directionality to the \u03bb Int reaction. In contrast to the 'simple' Cre and Flp tyrosine recombinases, \u03bb Int (and more than a thousand viral cousins in the public data bases) has two DNA binding domains, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. The carboxy-terminal domain of Int (CTD) binds at the four sites of DNA cleavage (called core-type sites; blue boxes) and catalyzes the chemistry of DNA cleavage and rejoining; this domain and the core-type sites (<b>B</b>, <b>B\u2019</b>, <b>C\u2019</b> and <b>C</b>) are analogous, and very similar, to the Cre and Flp enzymes and their respective DNA targets sites (see panel <b>B</b>). In \u03bb Int an additional small DNA binding domain at the amino terminus (NTD) binds with high affinity to a different family of DNA sequences (arm-type sites) (green boxes) distant from the sites of DNA cleavage and located in the P\u2019 and P arms of viral DNA (adjacent to <b>C\u2019</b> and <b>C</b>, respectively). To enable the ('hetero-bivalent') Int to bind simultaneously to both of its DNA targets the core- and arm-type DNA sites are interposed by binding sites for the accessory DNA bending proteins, IHF (yellow boxes, H1, H2, and H\u2019), Xis (gold boxes, X1, X1.5, X2), and Fis (magenta). The DNA bending proteins bring the core- and arm-type sites into close proximity and also serve as essential elements in forming the large multi-protein recombination complexes. Two distinct but overlapping ensembles of binding sites are employed (solid boxes) to generate either the integrative or excisive recombinogenic complexes (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib28\">Landy, 2015</a>]). (For the patterns of Int bridging between core- and arm-type sites in each of the complexes see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Following visual inspection of the class averages, we selected 52 classes that showed clear features, such as DNA loops and crosses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and calculated initial maps using EMAN2 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). The highest-scoring map was used to initialize particle alignment and three-dimensional (3D) classification in FREALIGN (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lyumkis et al., 2013</a>). All particles were aligned against the EMAN2 map using data limited to 60\u2009\u00c5 resolution. Starting with reconstructions calculated from six randomly selected subsets of the data, particles were 3D-classified into six classes and their alignments refined in 40 iterations in which the resolution limit was increased in regular steps to a final limit of 20\u2009\u00c5. The reconstruction with the highest average particle score was then used to initialize a second round of alignment and 3D classification, starting again with a resolution limit of 60\u2009\u00c5 and increasing the limit in steps to a final 20\u2009\u00c5. Due to the substantial heterogeneity of the sample \u2013 only 17% of the particles ended up in the final reconstruction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) \u2013 we performed six such refinement/classification rounds, always initializing the next round with the reconstruction of the previous round that had the highest average particle score. The highest scoring reconstructions from each round, as well as the initial and final maps are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. Lower-scoring reconstructions showed some of the features of the highest-scoring reconstruction but were missing density in the DNA loop and/or the Int tetramer regions. This suggests that the heterogeneity is the result of particle distortions and instabilities that often arise during the grid preparation procedure, for example when particles interact with the air/water interface (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>). For the final map, we performed an additional 50 iterations of refinement and 3D classification using a resolution limit of 18\u2009\u00c5. The last three iterations used data with an effective pixel size of 2.8\u2009\u00c5.

This core complex was derived from a crystal structure of full-length integrase bound to HJ DNA and short oligonucleotides containing arm site sequences (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biswas et al., 2005</a>). The assembly fit well as a rigid body, indicating that the EM and crystal structures are similar in this region. Structural models for the protein-bound P and P' arms were assembled as previously described (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seah et al., 2014</a>), except that the Fis dimer (which is not present in the purified HJ complex used here) was omitted from the P arm model. Details of the arm constructions are provided in Materials and methods. The pre-assembled P and P' arms were spliced onto the core Int-HJ complex while maintaining standard B-DNA twist and fit into the EM envelope by applying small DNA roll angles ( \u00b1 1\u00b0) in the regions outside of the IHF, Xis, and Int-NTD footprints. Flexibility in the IHF-induced DNA bends at H' and H2 was also allowed by testing small in-plane and out of plane deviations from the IHF/H'-DNA crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rice et al., 1996</a>)."

The linkers connecting the NTD and CB domains of Int adopt distinct and partially extended conformations, a situation quite different from the compact and symmetric arrangement of linkers observed in the crystal structures of Int bound to short oligonucleotide DNAs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biswas et al., 2005</a>). In addition, the central base-pairs of the HJ DNA were not well-defined in the Int-HJ crystal structure. To obtain low-energy conformations for these regions within the EM envelope and to regularize the stereochemistry of the DNA splice junctions and sites of bending, we performed molecular dynamics refinement using dynamic elastic network (DEN) restraints (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schr\u00f6der et al., 2007</a>). The protein\u2022DNA sub-complexes derived from crystal structures were tightly restrained to adopt their experimental conformations, whereas the Int NTD-CB linkers and central HJ DNA base-pairs were allowed flexibility. To restrain flexible regions of the model to remain within the EM envelope, we included an energy term for agreement with the Fourier coefficients of the EM density. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, the final structure agrees well with the EM envelope. There are no major features lacking density and only one small region of density that was not fit by the model (discussed below). The P and P' arm trajectories are particularly well defined by the EM envelope (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), as is the core Int-HJ tetramer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

Rather than being directed towards the NTDs of Int, the H2 bend causes the P arm to run alongside the Int tetramer. Three Xis subunits provide a second change in direction of the P arm, directing it across the top of the Int tetramer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As a result of the IHF and Xis-induced bends, the P2 site is positioned where it can be engaged by the Int subunit bound to the B' core site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and C</a>). The B'-P2 bridge is the third bivalent interaction required for excisive recombination\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure\u00a02C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Tong et al., 2014</a>). Remarkably, the DNA bend observed in the Xis\u2022DNA crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abbani et al., 2007</a>) fits well into the EM envelope, which has strong density for both the DNA and the Xis subunits. The P arm trajectory is also aided by an intrinsic A-tract sequence found in the Fis binding site. Fis was not present in the complexes analyzed by EM and as expected, there is no density corresponding to Fis at this site.

In that work, 12 DNA sites were labeled with fluorophores and 28 inter-site distances were estimated using in-gel fluorescence measurements. These distances, combined with knowledge of the Int bridging interactions and crystal structures of the component sub-complexes, were used to construct a model of the excisive HJ complex. The overall architecture of our EM structure is in broad agreement with the FRET-based model. As might be expected from the small number of structural restraints available, the FRET model is largely schematic in nature. For example, the tight, parallel paths of the P and P' arms were not predicted in the FRET model, nor was the extensive Xis-Int interface that links the two arms together (see below). Indeed, the details that emerge from the EM structure provide important new insights that could not have been predicted based on distance measurements alone."

Six of the locations appear to have been good choices, since they are largely free from steric interference that would compromise free rotation and/or the volumes accessible to the fluorophores. The EM structure is in good agreement with all of the distance estimates involving these sites. Two of the sites, <i>att</i>P<i>-</i> (-118) and <i>att</i>P<i>-</i> (+79), have serious steric conflicts based on the EM structure. The <i>att</i>P<i>-</i> (-118) dye on the P arm is directed into the path of the <i>P' arm</i>, possibly explaining why the arms diverge in the FRET model. The dye at <i>att</i>P<i>-</i> (+79) is on the P' arm and is directed into the Int-NTD bound at P2. Thus, the distances involving these sites are expected to be compromised and indeed, we see much poorer agreement with the EM structure for the distances involving these locations. The remaining four sites used for the FRET study are located on extensions of the P and P' arms that were not included in the constructs used for EM.

In contrast, the P' arm in the EM structure follows a relatively straight path after the H' bend, resulting in an upwards trajectory as it passes over the Int tetramer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Consequently, Int-C' and Int-B linkers must adopt extended and distinct conformations in order to bridge the P' arm and the Int CB domains. Int bridge formation at P'1 and P'2 of <i>att</i>L therefore does not require bending of the P' arm after the IHF-directed U-turn at H'.

Int binds only weakly to the core sites of <i>att</i>L and <i>att</i>R and the Int-bound core sites do not form stable synaptic complexes that undergo recombination (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bushman et al., 1985</a>). What provides the interactions that stabilize the <i>att</i>L x <i>att</i>R synaptic complex to initiate excisive recombination? Crystal structures of Int bound to core and a symmetrized mimic of arm DNA fragments suggested that the Int NTDs, along with their associated linkers, could play this role (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biswas et al., 2005</a>). However, earlier experiments with a Cre-Int chimeric recombinase (<a href=\"#bib61\">Warren et al., 2008</a>) and the present EM structure indicate that this is unlikely. The three Int NTDs in the excisive complex are arranged in a linear manner, where the NTD bound at P2 makes no contact with the NTDs bound at P'1 or P'2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Instead, Xis-NTD, and possibly Xis-linker interactions provide the additional glue required to hold <i>att</i>L and <i>att</i>R together and allow the initial strand exchange to take place."

The C-termini of the Xis domains bound at the X1.5 and X2 sites extend into the gap between the P and P' arms (i.e., towards the viewer in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Six of the eighteen missing residues are arginine or lysine, suggesting that the basic C-terminal tails of Xis could interact with P and/or P' arm DNA, further stabilizing a synaptic interface. The C-terminus of Xis bound at X1 is instead directed at the Int-B NTD bound at P2, consistent with the observed cooperativity of Xis and Int binding to <i>att</i>R arm DNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bushman et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Numrych et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sarkar et al., 2002</a>).

The sites that are active for cleavage form the closer diagonal pair; those that are inactive are farther apart. Isomerization of the HJ intermediate between a top-strand cleavage configuration and a bottom-strand cleavage configuration involves exchanging angles within the scissile phosphate parallelogram (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). In the Cre system, isomerization is coupled to changes in the angles between the core site duplexes that converge at the center of the junction.

In the absence of structural models, it has been difficult to rationalize how the arms could accommodate, or perhaps even direct the changes in quaternary structure expected from a Cre-like isomerization. In contrast to Cre, however, the core HJ structure observed in the EM and crystal structures of the \u03bb intermediate indicates that isomerization could occur with relatively little impact on the flanking DNA segments. We suggest that small changes in position and torsion of the C and C' core sites can be accommodated by the in-plane and out of plane bending modes of IHF, with little impact on the Xis\u2022Int interface assembled between the P and P' arms as they cross the Int tetramer. In other words, the EM structure implies that isomerization of the HJ intermediate can occur in the absence of large changes in quaternary structure and therefore does not require coupling to large changes in the P and P' arm positions. This type of overall isosteric isomerization may be facilitated by the odd-numbered 7-bp crossover region that is found in essentially all tyrosine integrases, e.g. (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hakimi and Scocca, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kolot and Yagil, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pe\u00f1a et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Williams, 2002</a>).

While many features of the distinct but overlapping protein ensembles responsible for each reaction (and its regulation) have been worked out, the present study finally allows us to consolidate and incorporate these features into the structure of a fully functional reaction intermediate. As discussed above, the structure reveals an important new role for Xis, clarifies the role of the Int linker regions, defines the paths of the arms as they embrace the enzymatically active core region, and suggests that HJ isomerization occurs with only minor changes in quaternary structure. Equally important, the good fit between the present structure and the large body of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical data that exists (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib28\">Landy, 2015</a>]) makes it relatively straightforward to extend the present structure to informative models for the other intermediates involved in excisive and integrative recombination.

The gradient was fractionated into 100\u2009\u03bcL slices which were examined on a 5% native PAGE to analyze the purity of the fractions. Pure fractions that were devoid of any secondary bands or aggregations were selected. They were further concentrated using Amicon ultracell 50K filters (Merck Millipore) to a volume of 30\u201340\u2009\u03bcL and were buffer-exchanged into 10\u2009mM Tris, 50\u2009mM NaCl buffer using prewashed Micro Biospin P-30 columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The concentration of the buffer-exchanged sample was determined to be about 2 mg/mL by UV absorption using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE).

We carried out 2D classification using the ISAC procedure (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yang et al., 2012</a>) implemented in the image processing package SPARX (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hohn et al., 2007</a>). Image defocus was determined with CTFFIND3 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</a>). We selected 52 good class averages to calculate initial maps with EMAN2 (e2initialmodel.py, [<a href=\"#bib55\">Tang et al., 2007</a>]). The highest scoring map was used to initialize refinement and 3D classification in FREALIGN (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lyumkis et al., 2013</a>), as described in the main text and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. The resolution was limited to 18\u2009\u00c5 throughout this refinement. The final reconstruction was calculated using 2x binned data (pixel size on the specimen: 2.8\u2009\u00c5) and had a resolution of about 11\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), as indicated by the FSC = 0.143 threshold criterion (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>). For this estimate, the two 3D reconstructions obtained from half the data and used to calculate the FSC curve were masked with a tight mask that added a margin of about 15\u2009\u00c5 around the reconstructed density of the Holliday junction complex. To assess how the mask affected the FSC curve, the 3D reconstructions were recalculated with particle images with randomized phases beyond 18\u2009\u00c5 resolution and used to correct the FSC curve obtained from the masked reconstructions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2013</a>).

The core complex consists of the catalytic and CB domains of Int (residues 75\u2013356) and a 4-way DNA junction containing the C, C', B, and B' core half-sites. A P' arm complex containing IHF bound at H' and Int NTDs (residues 1\u201355) bound at P'1 and P'2 was constructed essentially as described (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seah et al., 2014</a>), except that the NTD\u2022DNA segments were derived from the NMR structure of an NTD\u2022P'2 DNA complex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fadeev et al., 2009</a>). A P arm complex was also constructed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seah et al., 2014</a>), except for the use of the NMR-based model for the NTD\u2022P2 segment. The assembled P' arm was joined to the C' half-site and the P arm was joined to the\u00a0C half-site to generate the initial excisive complex model. During all construction steps, DNA segments were joined by superimposing the flanking duplexes on an idealized B-DNA splint fragment, ensuring smooth continuity of DNA twist. DNA segments were extended by superposition of idealized B-DNA fragments of the appropriate length, using a similar overlap."

Excellent agreement with the core complex was readily obtained, but the P and P' arms were not well-positioned in the envelope. The P and P' arms were fit into density by iterative testing of small ( \u00b1 1\u00b0) roll angles in the protein-free regions and by varying the IHF-mediated DNA bends. Changes in bending and torsion of IHF\u2022DNA complexes (&lt;10\u00b0) were made by rotating the DNA duplexes about the existing kinks (in-plane) or rotating the DNA arms about an axis connecting the two kink positions (torsion). The phosphate backbones of spliced, extended, and bent DNA segments were regularized to correct small deformations by highly restrained refinement in CNS (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brunger, 2007</a>). To complete the model, the NTD-CB linker segments (residues 56\u201374) for the C', B, and B' subunits were fit into the EM envelope with essentially arbitrary conformations. The final model was refined with CNS using dynamic elastic network (DEN) restraints and torsion angle dynamics to obtain reasonable linker geometries and good overall stereochemistry (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schr\u00f6der et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">2010</a>). To restrain flexible regions of the model to remain within the EM envelope and to optimize the final model fit to density, we included an energy term for agreement with the Fourier coefficients of the EM density."

Binding of the C', C, and B' NTDs to the P' arm could be readily accommodated by changing the NTD-CB linker conformations; no change in the P' arm was required. A new P arm was assembled in the absence of Xis as previously described (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seah et al., 2014</a>), using the NMR-based model for Int B-NTD binding to the P1 site. The initial model, lacking the phased bend induced by Xis, clearly indicated that the P arm must pass over P', with IHF bending at the H1 site responsible for re-directing the P1 site towards the Int tetramer. Small roll angle changes and bending at H1 and H2 (&lt; 10\u00b0) were used to obtain a P arm geometry that avoids steric clashes and positions the Int NTD bound at P1 close to the Int B CB domain. A small amount of bending of the P' site was found to better accommodate the P arm crossing. After insertion of CB-NTD linkers for each of the Int subunits (arbitrary conformations), the model was optimized using CNS to obtain reasonable linker geometries and good stereochemistry elsewhere."

Lambda phage is one of the classic systems for understanding site-specific recombination-its enzymology, regulation and topology. Many structures have been reported for components of the system, as well as complexes between the integrase (Int) and shorter DNA fragments, but this is the first structure of the entire assembly and, as such, is a landmark for the field. This structure will be of interest to a broad audience, as generations of biologists grew up on the molecular biology of lambda, and one of the reviewers referred to the structure as an \"Ah moment\" for those in the site-specific recombination-transposition field. Therefore, there was general agreement that this paper would make an excellent contribution to <i>eLife</i>, and the suggestions for improvement below are all relatively minor."

Also this was discussed online, and the conclusion was that most likely this was caused by the relatively low-resolution of the map combined with either the manual building or the molecular dynamics procedure that was used to refine the final model. Given the relatively low-resolution of the map, reliable atomic model building is expected to be very difficult. Perhaps the authors could include a cautionary note in their revision, where the perhaps less structurally-inclined reader is warned against interpretations of the atomic model in too much detail? In addition, the limited resolution of the reconstruction probably stems from structural variability in the sample, probably in particular from flexibility in the DNA, so that the proposed model would at best be one out of many possible structures. Therefore, the addition of a local resolution map to inform about the most flexible parts of the structure was deemed informative."

Given how complicated the structure is and that many readers (particularly those not familiar with the \u03bb system or not that structurally inclined) will have a hard time translating the cartoons shown in the figures into 3D structures, this movie could be the one point where all these complexities can be made accessible. If nothing else, the structure should rotate around both the vertical and horizontal axes. But why not go further? After introducing the entire structure, the authors could strip all the proteins out to show the path of the DNA, then add each protein component one at a time, then remove it and go to the next. (For example, show the IHFs, remove them, show the different Int monomers, remove them, show the Xis's, etc. Proteins could also be shown in pairs to highlight their interactions.) It would further help if the structure rotated while those components are displayed. The movie could end by slowly adding, and keeping, the protein components, to build back the entire complex.

The result is that we are very confident of the P' arm trajectory and the general path of the P arm trajectory. There is obviously a lot of flexibility in the P arm, given the long stretch of naked DNA between H2 and H1, so the conformation we have modeled as it crosses over the complex is one of many possibilities that all look quite similar and lead to the same conclusions."

It is likely that the reviewer is seeing the bending that occurs outside of the H2 site, where the DNA has indeed been bent to follow the clear path outlined by the EM envelope. To measure the out-of-plane bending of DNA in the IHF-DNA modules, we calculate the A-B-C-D dihedral angle where A, B, C, and D refer to the centers of the i-15, i-3, i+3, i+15 base pairs, respectively, and the base pair centers are the midpoints of C1' atoms. The index i refers to the central base-pair in the site. For the IHF-DNA crystal structure, this angle is -30 degrees, corresponding to bending of each arm ~15 degrees out of the best plane through the DNA. This is similar to the small out of plane bending noted by Phoebe and Howard in their paper, where they pointed out that the sign of the angle is appropriate for negative supercoiled DNA. In the modeled H2 bend, the angle is -39 degrees. Thus, we have increased the out-of-plane component by ~4.5 degrees for each arm. For the H' bend, the angle is -25 degrees, where we have decreased each arm by ~2.5 degrees. These small changes appear to be easily accommodated by the IHF heterodimer. At 11 \u00c5 resolution, we of course cannot visualize what types of corresponding small changes might occur in the IHF protein in response."

We have also added a reference to the fact that Int binds the P1 site with higher affinity than all of the other arm sites, consistent with the suggested model for synapsis.
