                    "text": "Direct lineage conversion of adult cells is a promising approach for regenerative medicine. A major challenge of lineage conversion is to generate specific cell subtypes. The pancreatic islets contain three major hormone-secreting endocrine subtypes: insulin<sup>+</sup> \u03b2-cells, glucagon<sup>+</sup> \u03b1-cells, and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> \u03b4-cells. We previously reported that a combination of three transcription factors, Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1, directly reprograms pancreatic acinar cells to \u03b2-cells. We now show that acinar cells can be converted to \u03b4-like and \u03b1-like cells by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. Thus, three major islet endocrine subtypes can be derived by acinar reprogramming. Ngn3 promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells, and also promotes \u03b4-specification in the absence of other factors. \u03b4-specification is in turn suppressed by Mafa and Pdx1 during \u03b1- and \u03b2-cell induction. These studies identify a set of defined factors whose combinatorial actions reprogram acinar cells to distinct islet endocrine subtypes in vivo."

The pancreatic islets contain three major hormone-secreting endocrine subtypes: insulin<sup>+</sup> \u03b2-cells, glucagon<sup>+</sup> \u03b1-cells, and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> \u03b4-cells. We previously reported that a combination of three transcription factors, Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1, directly reprograms pancreatic acinar cells to \u03b2-cells. We now show that acinar cells can be converted to \u03b4-like and \u03b1-like cells by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. Thus, three major islet endocrine subtypes can be derived by acinar reprogramming. Ngn3 promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells, and also promotes \u03b4-specification in the absence of other factors. \u03b4-specification is in turn suppressed by Mafa and Pdx1 during \u03b1- and \u03b2-cell induction. These studies identify a set of defined factors whose combinatorial actions reprogram acinar cells to distinct islet endocrine subtypes in vivo."

Now, Li et al. show that the Ngn3 transcription factor on its own appears to suppress certain genes that are usually expressed in acinar cells, and goes on to cause the acinar cells to become \u03b4-cells. However, a combination of Ngn3 and Mafa produces a mixture of \u03b1- and \u03b4-cells.

With suitable reprogramming factors, adult cells can be instructively converted to induced pluripotent stem cells (pluripotent reprogramming) or other types of adult cells (lineage reprogramming) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gurdon and Melton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Graf and Enver, 2009</a>). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) can be differentiated into many cell types in the body. However, the generation of iPS cells and their subsequent differentiation is a lengthy and technically demanding process. Lineage conversion between adult cell types offers a promising alternative, directly producing defined cell types in vitro or even in vivo that may be used for disease modeling and cellular therapies (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhou and Melton, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Vierbuchen and Wernig, 2011</a>). Recent examples of lineage reprogramming include the conversion of pre-B cells to macrophages, pancreatic acinar, \u03b1-cells, and gut cells to insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells, cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells, amniotic cells to endothelial cells, and skin fibroblasts to neurons, oligodendrocytes, neural precursors, or blood progenitors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xie et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ieda et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Szabo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thorel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Caiazzo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ginsberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Song et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Talchai et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Thier et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Najm et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 2013</a>)."

The most extensive subtype diversification can be found in the mammalian central nervous system, where hundreds of neuronal subtypes exist. A few mammalian neuronal subtypes, including dopaminergic-like and motoneuron-like cells, have been produced from fibroblast conversion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Caiazzo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Son et al., 2011</a>); methods to generate many others remain to be defined. To study subtype specification in lineage reprogramming, it is necessary to first establish models, where a defined set of factors promote formation of distinct subtypes. A recent study in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> provided such an example, where removal of a chromatin factor confers neurogenic competence to germ cells, which can be subsequently converted to different neuronal subtypes by neuron selector genes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tursun et al., 2011</a>)."

We now report that acinar cells can also be converted to the other endocrine subtypes, namely, somatostatin<sup>+</sup> \u03b4-like cells and glucagon<sup>+</sup> \u03b1-like cells, by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. A defined set of factors can therefore reprogram acinar cells to the three major islet endocrine subtypes. Further studies indicate that Ngn3, but not Mafa and Pdx1, promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells at the onset of reprogramming by suppressing acinar fate-regulators and activating pan-endocrine genes. Ngn3 also promotes \u03b4-subtype specification in the absence of other factors. Mafa and Ngn3 in turn suppress \u03b4-specification in \u03b1- and \u03b2-cell formation, thus ensuring creation of singular endocrine subtypes. Our studies establish a series of models where combinatorial functions of defined factors convert pancreatic acinar cells to three distinct endocrine subtypes in vivo. These models provide a powerful system to gain mechanistic understanding of the lineage reprogramming process."

Employing the same experimental system of adenoviral expression in adult mouse pancreas, which specifically targets acinar cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we examined the role of individual M3 factors in endocrine reprogramming. Surprisingly, Ngn3 alone induced formation of somatostatin<sup>+</sup> (Sst) cells in approximately 40% of infected cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>), whereas Mafa or Pdx1 alone did not induce any hormone positive cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, co-infection of Ngn3- and Mafa-induced formation of both glucagon<sup>+</sup> (Gcg) and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> cells, which are distinct from each other (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1E,F</a>). The other two-factor combinations, Ngn3 with Pdx1 and Pdx1 with Mafa, did not yield hormone positive cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Somatostatin and glucagon are the principle hormones of endocrine \u03b4- and \u03b1-cells. These data suggest that different combinations of three reprogramming factors could convert pancreatic acinar cells in vivo to the three major islet endocrine cell types: \u03b4-, \u03b1- and \u03b2-cells. The expression of reprogramming factors in \u03b4- and \u03b1-cell induction is transient (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), similar to \u03b2-cell induction using the same experimental approach (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>).

In particular, the secretory granules of each islet subtype have characteristic morphology (<a href=\"#bib22\">Larsson et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Leiter et al., 1979</a>). Electron microscopy analysis revealed that the secretory granules of induced \u03b4-cells are spherical or ellipsoidal with matrix filling the entire granule space (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,E\u2032</a>). This morphology is typical of endogenous \u03b4-cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,D\u2032</a>) and distinct from that of \u03b1-or \u03b2-granules (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, we observed that the induced \u03b4-cells were embedded among acinar cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, arrow points to dense assembly of endoplasmic reticulum in a neighboring acinar cell), consistent with their origins from acinar cells.

Cherry<sup>+</sup> cells contain approximately 40% induced \u03b4-cells. Gene profiling with illumina arrays yielded 1283 genes enriched in the induced \u03b4-cells (30 days after induction) relative to acinar cells (GEO: GSE52522). Because there is currently no method available that allows purification of endogenous \u03b4-cells, we compared their expression profile with that of whole islets, which are comprised largely of \u03b2-cells. 632 of the induced genes (49%) overlapped with the islet-enriched gene set that we previously reported (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>) (GEO: GSE12025). Given that \u03b4-cells represent a minor fraction of total mouse islet cells (5.5% as determined by FACS, see <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), the non-overlapping genes (651) may contain \u03b4-cell-enriched factors that are under-represented in the whole-islet samples. Indeed, among the top 30 most highly induced genes in the \u03b4-like cells, many show low expression in whole islet samples (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We detected up-regulation of <i>Hhex</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), a gene recently implicated in \u03b4-cell biology (72nd ADA abstract, Klaus Kaestner lab).

These genes included <i>Somatostatin</i> (\u03b4-cells), <i>Amylase2</i> (acinar cells), and <i>Insulin2</i> (\u03b2-cells). Studies have shown that insulin2 gene expression is regulated by DNA sequences located within approximately 400 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hay and Docherty, 2006</a>). Similarly, approximately 200 bp of the <i>Amylase 2</i> promoter is sufficient to direct acinar-specific expression (<a href=\"#bib25\">Minami et al., 2005</a>). We therefore assayed CpGs located in these critical promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). There are very limited studies on the <i>Somatostatin</i> promoter so we assayed seven CpGs that fall within a highly conversed promoter region (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We adapted an intracellular FACS protocol to purify endogenous and induced \u03b4-cells after staining with somatostatin (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pechhold et al., 2009</a>).

In contrast, the induced \u03b4-cells showed strong methylation in this promoter similar to islet \u03b4-cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The <i>Insulin2</i> promoter was fully methylated in acinar cells but partially demethylated in both endogenous and induced \u03b4-cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). For both amylase and Insulin promoters, the methylation differences of acinar/islet \u03b4-cell and acinar/induced \u03b4-cell are statistically highly significant (p&lt;0.001) whereas there is no significant difference between islet \u03b4-cells and induced \u03b4-cells (p=0.23 and 0.30 for amylase and insulin promoter respectively). These studies suggest that substantial DNA methylation changes occurred during acinar to \u03b4-cell conversion in the promoters we studied. It is notable that not all cell fate conversion events are associated with DNA methylation changes. For example, no significant DNA methylation was observed in the conversion of pre-B cells to macrophages (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rodriguez-Ubreva et al., 2012</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) Our studies suggest that there are two main processes in pancreatic acinar to endocrine reprogramming. Ngn3 plays a critical role in establishing a generic endocrine state in acinar cells by suppressing acinar fate regulators (Ptf1a, Nr5a2, Mist1) and activating pan-endocrine factors (Pax6, Islet1, etc) (upper panel). Down-regulation of acinar regulators is critical as they can block reprogramming. In endocrine subtype-specification (lower panel), Ngn3 promotes \u03b4-fate in the absence of other factors. Mafa and Pdx1 act in concert with Ngn3 to promote \u03b1- and \u03b2-specification. Both Mafa and Pdx1 can suppress \u03b4-subtype specification, whereas \u03b1-specification is also suppressed in \u03b2-induction. Combinatorial actions of the three reprogramming factors therefore led to formation of distinct endocrine subtypes. (<b>C</b>) A summary table of reprogramming factor functions.

It is likely that the main function of Mafa and Pdx1 is to collaborate with Ngn3 to activate subtype-specific genes such as Arx in \u03b1-induction (this study) and Nkx6.1 in \u03b2-induction (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). Another important function of Mafa and Pdx1 is to suppress \u03b4-specification, thus ensuring formation of singular \u03b1- and \u03b2-subtypes, and preventing hybrid cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>, lower panel). Our data together suggest that each of the three factors possesses both activator and suppressor functions (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>).

A recent study showed that ectopic expression of Ngn3 in embryonic pancreas suppressed exocrine fate specification (<a href=\"#bib34\">Qu et al., 2013</a>). Thus, Ngn3 can suppress exocrine fate and promote endocrine fate during both embryogenesis in progenitor cells and during adulthood in differentiated acinar cells. The function of Pdx1 has also been extensively studied and demonstrated to be critical in early pancreatic fate determination, as well as a later role in beta cell biology (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murtaugh, 2007</a>). It is not clear, however, exactly what role Pdx1 plays in \u03b4- and \u03b1-cell specification in embryogenesis. Mafa is expressed in pancreatic \u03b2-cells during development and plays a role in controlling \u03b2-cell gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hang and Stein, 2011</a>). The ability of Mafa to induce \u03b1-cell formation in collaboration with Ngn3 from acinar is nevertheless not entirely surprising. Its close homologue Mafb is expressed during pancreas development in a subset of endocrine progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nishimura et al., 2006</a>). Mafb deletion leads to decreased \u03b1- and \u03b2-cell numbers, suggesting a role for Maf factor in \u03b1-cell formation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Artner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nishimura et al., 2008</a>). Taken together, there are clear similarities in the function of Ngn3, Mafa, and Pdx1 in normal endocrine development and endocrine reprogramming from acinar cells. Nevertheless, the epigenetic landscape of pancreatic progenitors and adult acinar cells in which these factors operate is presumably very different. Further, the \u2018generic endocrine state\u2019 established by Ngn3 in acinar cells is not equivalent to an endocrine progenitor in pancreas development. For example, expression of pancreatic progenitor genes such as <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Hnf6</i> was not detected during the reprogramming process (data not shown)."

Among the pancreatic endocrine subtypes, relatively little is known about the \u03b4-cells. No genetic factors have been discovered that specify \u03b4-cell fate in pancreas development. The molecular details of how Ngn3 functions to specify \u03b4-subtype remains to be determined."

The optimal method to induce Gcg<sup>+</sup> \u03b1-like cells is by co-expression of Ngn3 and Mafa from two separate viruses at a 1:1 ratio. Varying the ratio of the two viruses or polycistronic co-expression of both factors led to reduced \u03b1-cell formation. These results are reminiscent of induced pluripotent reprogramming from fibroblasts where polycistronic co-expression of OSKM factors led to substantially reduced efficiency of iPS formation compared with random infection by OSKM factors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 2009</a>). This difference has been suggested to result from a need for appropriate reprogramming factor stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carey et al., 2011</a>). We speculate that the induction of \u03b1-like cells may similarly require optimized Ngn3/Mafa stoichiometry along with other conditions such as specific expression level and dynamics of the factors, which can be met at the more \u2018flexible\u2019 co-injection system with each cell expressing variable levels of Ngn3/Mafa, compared with the more \u2018fixed\u2019 polycistronic expression system.

The mammalian system is far more complex, but similar principles may well apply. It is hoped that insight from lineage reprogramming studies will lead to informed design and improved technology, thereby helping to unlock the tremendous therapeutic potential of this approach."

What was not so clear was whether and how this regulatory hierarchy works during normal development of the pancreas.

Such a fixation step was performed in the intracellular FACS experiments and depending on the fixation time, the strength of the Cherry signal could vary significantly. A fixation time that differs by a few minutes made a difference in Cherry signal. In contrast, staining for hormones (somatostatin or glucagon) was performed after fixation and their fluorescence was unaffected by fixation length. Our records show that the original i-\u03b4 FACS data were collected from cells that went through longer fixation, thus the cherry fluorescence was weak.

Our studies also showed excellent co-localization of the 3-factors when expressed polycistronically (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>).

The studies on using different vectors to assess the hierarchy of activation and repression of the different cell fates are nicely done and do provide a model of how this set of transcription factors can control cell fate conversion. What was not so clear was whether and how this regulatory hierarchy works during normal development of the pancreas. It is stated that the Ngn-induced state is not the same as that of an early pancreatic progenitor, but is Ngn normally involved in repressing acinar cell fate? More discussion on the similarities and differences between the induced state and the normal cell fate controls would be useful</i>."
