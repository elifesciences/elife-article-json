We discovered that when we were preparing Figure 1\u2014source data 5 we transposed some lines of data from Figure 1\u2014source data 3. Thus, because of the transposition, some p-values in Figure 1\u2014source data 5 were calculated incorrectly (a side-by-side comparison is shown in Supplementary file 1, file held on figshare under <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1409445\">http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1409445</a>). We have now corrected all errors in Figure 1\u2014source data 5. The correction does not change any of the conclusions that we drew from these data, which were \u2018Imprinting calls based on whole-genome mRNA-seq were validated by sequencing or performing CAPs digestion on RT-PCR amplicons of 29 genes from independently isolated embryo and endosperm RNA samples (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2, Figure 1\u2014source data 5); results were mostly consistent with the mRNA-seq data\u2019. We apologize for the mistake."
