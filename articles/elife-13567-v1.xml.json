                    "text": "Viral mRNA sequences with a type IV IRES are able to initiate translation without any host initiation factors. Initial recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit as well as two translocation steps before the first peptidyl transfer are essential for the initiation of translation by these mRNAs. Using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) we have structurally characterized at high resolution how the Cricket Paralysis Virus <span class=\"underline\">I</span>nternal <span class=\"underline\">R</span>ibosomal <span class=\"underline\">E</span>ntry <span class=\"underline\">S</span>ite (CrPV-IRES) binds the small ribosomal subunit (40S) and the translocation intermediate stabilized by elongation factor 2 (eEF2). The CrPV-IRES restricts tvhe otherwise flexible 40S head to a conformation compatible with binding the large ribosomal subunit (60S). Once the 60S is recruited, the binary CrPV-IRES/80S complex oscillates between canonical and rotated states (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koh et al., 2014</a>), as seen for pre-translocation complexes with tRNAs. Elongation factor eEF2 with a GTP analog stabilizes the ribosome-IRES complex in a rotated state with an extra ~3 degrees of rotation. Key residues in domain IV of eEF2 interact with pseudoknot I (PKI) of the CrPV-IRES stabilizing it in a conformation reminiscent of a hybrid tRNA state. The structure explains how diphthamide, a eukaryotic and archaeal specific post-translational modification of a histidine residue of eEF2, is involved in translocation."

Initial recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit as well as two translocation steps before the first peptidyl transfer are essential for the initiation of translation by these mRNAs. Using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) we have structurally characterized at high resolution how the Cricket Paralysis Virus <span class=\"underline\">I</span>nternal <span class=\"underline\">R</span>ibosomal <span class=\"underline\">E</span>ntry <span class=\"underline\">S</span>ite (CrPV-IRES) binds the small ribosomal subunit (40S) and the translocation intermediate stabilized by elongation factor 2 (eEF2). The CrPV-IRES restricts tvhe otherwise flexible 40S head to a conformation compatible with binding the large ribosomal subunit (60S). Once the 60S is recruited, the binary CrPV-IRES/80S complex oscillates between canonical and rotated states (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koh et al., 2014</a>), as seen for pre-translocation complexes with tRNAs. Elongation factor eEF2 with a GTP analog stabilizes the ribosome-IRES complex in a rotated state with an extra ~3 degrees of rotation. Key residues in domain IV of eEF2 interact with pseudoknot I (PKI) of the CrPV-IRES stabilizing it in a conformation reminiscent of a hybrid tRNA state. The structure explains how diphthamide, a eukaryotic and archaeal specific post-translational modification of a histidine residue of eEF2, is involved in translocation."

In eukaryotes, initiation involves almost a dozen protein initiation factors (IFs), several of which are large multi-subunit complexes. A subset of IFs bind to the capped 5\u2019 end of a mRNA followed by recruitment of a 43S complex of the small subunit (with additional IFs). Subsequently, the resulting 48S complex scans along the mRNA to reach the start codon (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hinnebusch, 2014</a>). The complexity of initiation in eukaryotes is used by cells to regulate translation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>). However, viruses, which rely on the host machinery to translate their genomes, often target initiation to hijack host ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jackson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Walsh and Mohr, 2011</a>). One strategy employed by viruses relies on the use of structured sequences in their mRNA that allow them to bypass many or all aspects of canonical initiation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wilson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kieft, 2009</a>). These structured RNA sequences, termed IRES (for <span class=\"underline\">I</span>nternal <span class=\"underline\">R</span>ibosomal <span class=\"underline\">E</span>ntry <span class=\"underline\">S</span>ite) elements, play a critical role in translation of their messages (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jackson, 2005</a>)."

                        "type": "paragraph", 
                        "text": "Viral IRES sequences can be classified according to their level of dependence on IFs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Filbin and Kieft, 2009</a>). Type IV IRESs form a homogenous class of viral RNAs, which completely dispense with the requirement for any IFs and thus are able to directly recruit and assemble a translating 80S ribosome by themselves. These IRESs are typically found in the intergenic region (IGR) of a family of + sense RNA viruses called <i>Dicistroviridae</i> hence they are also known as IGR-IRES (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wilson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sasaki and Nakashima, 1999</a>). Extensive biochemical and structural characterization of these IRES sequences has provided a detailed picture on how they work at a molecular level. The approximately 190 nucleotide sequence folds into a compact, well-defined three-dimensional structure making use of three internal pseudoknots (PKI-III, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pestova et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sch\u00fcler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pestova and Hellen, 2003</a>). Two of these pseudoknots (PKII and PKIII) and accessory sequences, fold into a compact domain following a scheme also seen in other structured RNAs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kieft, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Au et al., 2015</a>). As a result, two stem loops (SL-IV and SL-V) are exposed and are responsible for the bulk of interactions with the small ribosomal subunit (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sch\u00fcler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Spahn et al., 2004a</a>). Two additional regions of the IGR-IRES are functionally relevant: the L1.1 region, responsible for the interaction with the L1 stalk of the large ribosomal subunit and PKI. This latter pseudoknot, a structural mimic of a canonical tRNA-mRNA interaction, is responsible for the correct positioning of the viral RNA in the decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit, and is recognized by the ribosome in the same way as a cognate mRNA-tRNA pair (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and D</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>)."

More recent higher-resolution cryo-EM studies showed that the IRES coexists in equilibrium between canonical and rotated states of the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koh et al., 2014</a>). The presence of PKI in the A site is consistent with evidence that translocation of the IRES is required to bring the first codon of the mRNA into the A site and allow delivery of the first animoacyl tRNA (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yamamoto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). It also implies that translation of these mRNAs begins in the middle of what is normally the elongation cycle, thus bypassing normal initiation completely and avoiding any regulation over initiation."

Upon the acceptance of a cognate tRNA on the A site, peptidyl transfer from the peptidyl tRNA in the P site to the newly accepted aminoacyl tRNA on the A site occurs spontaneously and allows the ribosome to reach an intermediate state of translocation characterized by hybrid A/P and P/E states of the tRNAs and intersubunit rotation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moazed and Noller, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Frank and Agrawal, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agirrezabala et al., 2008</a>). This intermediate state is in equilibrium with the original canonical conformation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blanchard et al., 2004</a>). The GTPase elongation factor EF-G in bacteria stabilizes the intermediate state and catalyzes the next step of the process, which involves movement of the mRNA and tRNAs with respect to the small subunit (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moazed and Noller, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rodnina et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Spiegel et al., 2007</a>). Both EF-G and its eukaryotic counterpart eEF2 exhibit a high degree of sequence homology and hydrolyze one molecule of GTP into GDP per translocation cycle. The result of translocation is the movement of the A-site tRNA to the P site and the P-site tRNA to the E site and its subsequent dissociation from the ribosome. Translocation results in an empty A site that can bind the next incoming aminoacyl tRNA. Frameshifting is avoided by coordinate movement of mRNA and tRNAs, which is facilitated by the maintenance of base-pairing interactions between the anticodon stem loops (ASL) of the tRNAs and the mRNA codons during translocation."

These structures reveal how bacterial EF-G binds to a rotated state of the ribosome, inducing an extra degree of rotation while domain IV of EF-G contacts the tRNA in a hybrid ap/P configuration. In this hybrid state, the tRNA has its anticodon at a position intermediate between the canonical A and P sites in the small subunit while its aminoacyl end is in the P site of the peptidyl transferase center in the large subunit (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ratje et al., 2010</a>)."

The diphthamide modification, which requires the activity of seven gene products, is conserved in eukaryotes and archaea (<a href=\"#bib61\">Schaffrath et al., 2014</a>), but its precise function is unclear. To date, the key feature of diphthamide is that it renders eEF2 susceptible to mono-ADP ribosylation and inactivation by diphtheria toxin, <i>Pseudomonas</i> exotoxin A, and cholera toxin (<a href=\"#bib61\">Schaffrath et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Passador and Iglewski, 1994</a>). Despite uncertainty regarding the cellular function of diphthamide, yeast strains lacking the diphthamide modification enzyme DPH2 display altered levels of frameshifting on the programmed -1 frameshift site from the yeast L-A virus, indicating that diphthamide contributes to fidelity of translation elongation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ortiz et al., 2006</a>)."

A precise understanding of how eEF2 works in the context of a ribosome programmed with a type IV IRES is thus needed to fully understand how these IRESs function. Because the IRES mimics tRNAs in the ribosome, such an understanding will also shed light on the role of eEF2 in canonical translocation with tRNAs."

Previous data at low resolution had shown the stability of this binary complex (<a href=\"#bib65\">Spahn et al., 2004a</a>). A full dataset was collected on a Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Falcon-II direct detector. Given the high degree of compositional as well as conformational heterogeneity present in the sample, extensive classification using a new sorting procedure involving masking and background subtraction (doi: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/025890\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/025890</a>) was essential to classify homogenous populations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. A final subset of 54,561 particles produced a homogenous map with an overall resolution of 3.8\u00a0\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); however, as previously noted (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sch\u00fcler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>), many CrPV-IRES elements have a lower local resolution because they are more dynamic (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Careful analysis of the local resolution (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</a>) also showed a high degree of flexibility in regions of the IRES not directly involved in interactions with the 40S, such as L1.1 and L1.2. However, good density could be observed for the functionally relevant regions of the IRES responsible for its binding to the 40S (SL-IV and SL-V) as well as for PKI in the decoding center (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

While the PKI contacts show marked similarity with canonical decoding, additional features distinguish PKI. Previous mutagenesis studies established the essential role of the correct base pairing of the tRNA/mRNA mimicry domain of type IV IRESs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kanamori and Nakashima, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>). Watson-Crick geometry between these bases of PKI is therefore essential to induce a conformation of the decoding center similar to that in decoding with tRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C and D</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Ogle and Ramakrishnan, 2005</a>). Briefly, the conserved adenines 1753 and 1754 (1492 and 1493 in <i>E. coli</i>) project outwards from helix 44 (h44) to interact through A-minor motifs with the nucleotides forming base pairs (BP) 1 and 2 of the codon/anticodon minihelix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Accessory elements from other ribosomal components including G576 (G530 in <i>E. coli</i>), C564 (C518 in <i>E. coli</i>) and residues from uS12 (P64 and S66, [P48 and S50 in <i>E. coli</i>]) assist in monitoring the shape of BP1 and BP2, and less stringently of BP3 (the wobble position, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and E</a>). We also observed an additional base pair between position 1 of the first translated codon and the ribosomal base C1273 (C1054 in <i>E. coli</i>; termed BP4, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D and E</a>). In standard decoding, this ribosomal base interacts with the anticodon nucleotide of BP3, whereas here a rotation of the base about its glycosidic bond allows for a tight stacking interaction with one of the CrPV-IRES bases, redirecting C1273 towards the first base of the first coding codon of the CrPV RNA. All IGR-IRES sequences obtained to date encode a guanine residue at this position with the only exception being the PSIV-IRES (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kieft, 2009</a>). This conservation suggests an important role of the additional base pair."

Although originally discovered and characterized in Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and Solenopsis invicta virus (SINV-1), ORFx translation was also recently reported for the CrPV-IRES sequence (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wang and Jan, 2014</a>). In order to select an open reading frame, PKI actively assists in presenting the adjacent first codon in a proper conformation in the A site to the first incoming aminoacyl-tRNA. Given the dynamic nature of PKI, its ability to direct initiation of ORF2 or alternatively ORFx could be linked to interactions with ribosomal elements present in the A site. Thus, C1273 may represent an important regulatory element in the ribosomal A site that helps direct frame selection by type IV IRES elements."

However, in the context of the 40S subunit, partial density for the VRL can be observed (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Several studies have explored the structural and functional requirements of the VRL in type IV IRES-mediated translation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ren et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ruehle et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, both the length and sequence of the VRL seem to be essential for the correct positioning of PKI in a productive conformation in the ribosomal A site, as well as for the translocation steps delivering PKI to the P-site (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ruehle et al., 2015</a>). We speculate the VRL may have an important role in the initial stages of 40S recruitment by type IV IRESs, perhaps contributing additional anchoring points to the small subunit in the initial steps that could help in proper positioning of PKI. Whether this initial placement of PKI (assisted by the VRL) is related to the early events of frame selection by type IV IRESs will require further investigation."

In this state, PKI remains anchored to the A site of the small subunit and the L1.1 segment couples the rotation of the small subunit with the movement of the L1 stalk of the 60S. In order to allow the first aminoacyl tRNA to be delivered to the A site, PKI has to be translocated to the P site, in a step catalyzed by eEF2. To gain insight into this process, we assembled a pre-translocation complex with CrPV-IRES and 80S, which was subsequently incubated with eEF2 complexed with the non-hydrolysable GTP analog 5'-guanylyl-methylene-bis-phosphonate (GDPCP). This enabled us to trap the pre-translocation complex without the use of any antibiotics."

Structural studies by cryo-EM as well as X-ray crystallography have identified translocation intermediates where the small subunit can be found in several different degrees of rotation along with distinct conformations of the head (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pulk and Cate, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ratje et al., 2010</a>). These movements are coupled to the movements of the tRNAs from the A to the P and finally to the E site, with intermediate 'hybrid' states along the way. A useful nomenclature has been coined in order to reflect the diversity of states (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ratje et al., 2010</a>). Thus, an ap/P state specifies a tRNA in transit from a canonical A/A state to a canonical P/P state with its anticodon stem-loop (ASL) between the A and P sites in the small subunit, while the CCA-peptidyl end has reached the P-site on the large subunit. This state was described by cryo-EM at ~8\u2009\u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brilot et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ramrath et al., 2013</a>). Subsequently a tRNA that is intermediate in both the small and large subunits was seen by X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). Because PKI mimics an A-site tRNA, the structure here allows us to observe high-resolution details of eEF2 in the A site of the small subunit before translocation."

The ASL-like element of PKI is pushed into a position in-between the A and P sites of the small subunit, reminiscent of an ap/P state (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Additionally, a superposition of the CrPV-IRES in the ternary CrPV-IRES/eEF2-GDPCP/80S complex with the conformation adopted in the canonical, CrPV-IRES/80S binary complex (excluding PKI in the superposition) reveals a displacement of the ASL-like element of PKI of approximately 10\u00a0\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). A comparison of the position of PKI in the CrPV-IRES/40S complex described previously with the position adopted by this pseudoknot in the pre-translocated state, in the CrPV-IRES/eEF2-GDPCP/80S complex described here as well as in the final post-translocated state (<a href=\"#bib41\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>) is shown from a top view in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>.

In our structure, H694 interacts with PKI while the diphthamide moiety (DPH) on H699 is closely packed against the sugar of nucleotide 6189 in the CrPV-IRES. The diphthamide appears to sterically prevent the rRNA decoding bases A1753 and A1754 from interacting with BP1 and BP2 of PKI, whose conformations were otherwise not altered upon binding of eEF2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>). The interaction between bases A1753 and A1754 and PKI, was seen in the binary CrPV-IRES/40S complex described above, and was maintained during recruitment of the 60S and the induction of the rotated state in the binary CrPV-IRES/80S complex before eEF2 binding. However, this interaction must be broken in order for PKI to translocate from the A to the P site of the 40S. In our structure of the eEF2-bound complex, clear density for these decoding bases was seen in a retracted position in helix 44 (\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a> ). This suggests that H699, by competing for the binding to PKI with these bases, breaks their decoding interaction with BP1 and BP2. Diphthamide, by making additional stabilizing interactions with PKI facilitates this step. The disruption of the decoding interaction of the ribosomal bases by eEF2 provides an explanation for the well known inhibitory effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics on the action of EF-G and translocation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rodnina et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Studer et al., 2003</a>). The binding of these antibiotics displaces the ribosomal decoding bases out from helix 44 (h44) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carter et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ogle et al., 2001</a>). The antibiotics would thus prevent retraction of the bases into helix 44 upon EF-G or eEF2 binding, thereby precluding interactions of the factors required for their function as well as preventing the disruption of the decoding interactions that is a pre-requisite for translocation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>)."

Whereas the CrPV-IRES initiates translation with Ala, a minimal CrPV-IRES RNA, encompassing residues 6027 to 6216, was designed to initiate translation with Met (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) to facilitate detection of peptide products using [<sup>35</sup>S]Met and to enable direct comparison to peptide synthesis directed by the normal translation initiation pathway. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, the WT CrPV-IRES readily directed the synthesis of MFK tripeptide (left panel). Previous studies using mammalian factors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jan et al., 2003</a>) or yeast or mammalian <i>in vivo</i> assays\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib82\">Wilson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Thompson et al., 2001</a>) established the critical importance of BP1 and BP2 in PKI for IRES-directed translation. Mutation of CC to GG disrupting BP1 and BP2 likewise abolished peptide synthesis in our assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, second panel). As an additional control, a model unstructured mRNA that avoids the requirement for translation factors that promote mRNA recruitment was used to assemble a canonical 80S initiation complex. Notably, assembly of this complex required initiation factors eIF1, eIF1A, eIF2, eIF5 and eIF5B\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Gutierrez et al., 2013</a>). These 80S complexes readily synthesized MFK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, fourth panel) with faster kinetics than observed with the CrPV-IRES (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, right panel). When this same model mRNA was substituted for the CrPV-IRES RNA in reactions lacking initiation factors no peptide synthesis was observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, third panel), confirming the unique property of the IRES to carry out initiation factor-independent translation."

Three eEF2 mutant proteins were purified for these assays. First, eEF2 lacking diphthamide was prepared from yeast lacking the <i>DPH2</i> gene required for the first step in diphthamide synthesis (<a href=\"#bib61\">Schaffrath et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ortiz et al., 2006</a>). Second, eEF2-P580H was designed to disrupt the first loop at the tip of domain IV (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>). Third, eEF2-H699N was designed to eliminate the diphthamide modification of this residue and because previous studies indicated a role for this residue in translation elongation fidelity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ortiz et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with the negligible growth defects under normal conditions in yeast strains lacking <i>DPH2</i> or expressing eEF2-H699N (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ortiz et al., 2006</a>), the eEF2 mutants functioned like WT eEF2 to promote MFK formation in reactions using 80S initiation complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, lack of diphthamide does not significantly impair eEF2 function in normal translation including the translocation events required for MFK formation. In contrast, unmodified eEF2 and the eEF2-P580H and eEF2-H699N mutants exhibited marked defects in MFK synthesis in assays directed by the CrPV-IRES (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Since the translocation events prior to the first peptidyl transfer represent key differences between the IRES and canonical pathways for MFK synthesis, diphthamide appears to be important for the non-canonical translocation of the CrPV-IRES prior to first peptide bond formation. The interaction of diphthamide with G6189 of BP1 in the codon-anticodon mimicking element of PKI and the steric obstruction of the rRNA decoding bases by diphthamide suggest that its primary function during normal translation may be to optimize efficiency and fidelity during translocation. Testing this idea will require detailed kinetic studies in a eukaryotic translation system using eEF2 with and without the diphthamide modification."

All of these factors bind to the ribosome in an active conformation as a complex with GTP. Their binding to the ribosome is followed by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and subsequent release of the factors from the ribosome. GTP hydrolysis is induced by conformational changes in the ribosome, which position the catalytic site of the factor close to the sarcin-ricin-loop (SRL) in the large subunit. Recent structures of the ribosome in complex with EF-Tu or EF-G bound to GDPCP during decoding or translocation, respectively, have shed light on the molecular details of GTPase activation (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tourigny et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pulk and Cate, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Voorhees et al., 2010</a>). In these structures, three flexible loops (P-loop, switch-I and switch-II) of the GTPase are organized around the GTP (GDPCP) molecule and a highly conserved histidine residue from the switch-II loop (H84 in <i>E. coli</i> EF-G) is coordinated to a water molecule close to the \u03b3 phosphate (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib77\">Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013</a>]). The conformation of the histidine is stabilized by a universally conserved nucleotide in the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL). Recent biochemical and molecular dynamics studies support the idea that the catalytic center observed in these structures represents a GTPase-activated state (<a href=\"#bib38\">Maracci et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adamczyk and Warshel, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">\u00c5qvist and Kamerlin, 2015</a>). However, in structures of both bacterial RF-3 and EF-G with the GTP analog GDPNP, the conserved histidine was observed in a conformation away from both the SRL and the \u03b3 phosphate of the GTP molecule (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that not all GTP analogs behave in the same way and that some may resemble the GTP state less than others."

Their tertiary structure allows crucial elements of the IRES to interact with the small ribosomal subunit via a cluster of specific ribosomal proteins (eS25, S28, uS7 and uS11) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>). This cluster is strategically located in the cleft between the head and body of the 40S. By placing the IRES elements SL-IV and SL-V in that cleft (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the IRES is able to restrict the otherwise highly dynamic head of the small ribosomal subunit. The restriction on the mobility of the 40S head upon CrPV-IRES binding involves an entropic cost, which is likely balanced by the binding energy from interactions between the CrPV-IRES and the small subunit. This stabilization of the head is accompanied by the insertion of IRES element PKI into the decoding site of the small subunit. The tRNA/mRNA mimicry of this domain induces conformational changes similar to those in decoding, thereby anchoring PKI to the A site. The VRL element of PKI seems to be involved in this early event, as ordered density for a segment of this highly dynamic loop can be distinguished in our reconstruction. The stabilization of the head in an appropriate conformation for 60S binding provides a rationale for how the IRES promotes recruitment of the 60S subunit to form the 80S ribosome. By contrast, those elements of the CrPV-IRES not directly interacting with the 40S (for example, L1.1 and L1.2) are very flexible, and thus, could only be visualized at low resolution in our 40S reconstruction (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). In contrast, these elements, especially L1.1, become ordered upon recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit due to specific contacts, primarily with the L1-stalk (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>)."

Thus, type IV IRESs seem to exploit a feature of ribosomes that is also used in canonical initiation. Other IRESs, such as the type III HCV-IRES, seem to target the same cluster of small subunit ribosomal proteins as the CrPV-IRES (<a href=\"#bib52\">Quade et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that this may be a general mode of action of IRES sequences."

                        "text": "PKI is an independent domain of the type IV IRESs that mimics a tRNA anticodon stem-loop interacting with a codon (<a href=\"#bib15\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>). This domain is not essential for the binding of the IRES to the small subunit, but it is required for priming the ribosome for elongation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>). Previous structural studies in the context of the full (80S) ribosome have unambiguously established the positioning of this PKI in the decoding center in the A site of the small subunit (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koh et al., 2014</a>). Following recruitment of the 60S, the resulting IRES/80S complex oscillates between ratcheted and canonical configurations. This ratcheting of the ribosome involves the classic anti-clockwise rotation of the 40S by approximately 5\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, top). In this rotated state, which is similar to a canonical pre-translocation complex, the IRES mimics the hybrid states of tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agirrezabala et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Julian et al., 2008</a>). During these fluctuations, PKI remains anchored to the decoding center of the A site of the 40S and SL-IV and V remain anchored to the ribosomal protein cluster previously described. GTP hydrolysis by eEF2 catalyzes translocation of PKI to the P site (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, right). Subsequent dissociation of eEF2 results in a vacant A site (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, bottom right) that can accept the first aminoacyl tRNA. A conformation of the IRES with PKI translocated into the P site has recently been characterized using a release factor bound to a stop codon in the A site (<a href=\"#bib41\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>). In the translocated state, PKI occupies the P site, as expected, but critically, the connections of SL-IV and V with the cluster of ribosomal proteins in the small subunit are lost, leaving these IRES elements solvent exposed. In contrast, the other major anchoring point of the IRES to the ribosome, the L1.1 element (which interacts with the L1-stalk of the 60S), remains solidly in place; however, the stalk is displaced even further compared to its position in the rotated state of the binary IRES-80S complex. The post-translocated conformation of the IRES is characterized by PKI in the P site, SL-IV and V detached from the 40S, and the L1 stalk pushed further away. The entire IRES is rotated around its longitudinal axis when compared to the pre-translocated state (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, bottom-right). Interestingly, in the post-translocated state Muhs <i>et al</i> report partial density for the VRL, which is stabilized by interactions with the small subunit\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>). No density for this loop could be identified in our previous reconstruction of the pre-translocated state (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>) or in the intermediate state of translocation with eEF2-GPCP presented here. However, partial density could be identified in the CrPV-40S complex. Thus, it seems the VRL alternates between ordered/disordered conformations, possibly regulating the affinities of the compact folds of the IRES, like PKI, as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ruehle et al., 2015</a>)"

This interaction restricts the flexibility of the 40S-head in a conformation that both allows decoding of PKI and recruitment of the 60S subunit. Top: once the 60S subunit is recruited, the binary CrPV-IRES/80S complex oscillates between canonical and rotated states mimicking the hybrid states of tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koh et al., 2014</a>). Right: eEF2 in its GTP form binds to the rotated state and induces an extra ~3 degree of rotation of the 40S. This extra rotation results in the IRES interacting with the L1 stalk of the 60S in a wider conformation. Domain IV of eEF2 contacts PKI of the IRES and stabilizes it in an intermediate ap/P-like state. Bottom, post-translocated state (<a href=\"#bib41\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>): GTP hydrolysis results in conformational changes in eEF2 and the ribosome, the translocation of PKI in the P site, breaking of the original contacts of the IRES elements SL-IV and V with the 40S, and release of eEF2. In order for the IRES to adopt such a conformation, a rotation along its longitudinal axes is necessary."

                        "text": "To reach the post-translocated conformation, the IRES has to go through the intermediate state described here, which is stabilized by interaction with eEF2. In the complex with eEF2 and GDPCP, PKI makes a tight interaction with the tip of domain IV of eEF2 and is displaced towards the P site of the ribosome. The ASL-like segment of PKI is in a position and orientation reminiscent of a hybrid ap/P state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The whole ribosome adopts a rotated configuration with an additional ~3\u00ba anti-clockwise rotation of the small subunit when compared with the rotated state of the binary IRES-80S complex. This extra rotation caused by the binding of eEF2 is also a feature of canonical translocation with tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brilot et al., 2013</a>). However, unlike the case of canonical translocation, L1 is not stabilized in an inward conformation but instead is displaced outward compared to the binary IRES-80S complex and is very similar to the post-translocated state. Thus, the additional rotation of the 40S subunit, induced by the binding of eEF2 in its active state, forces the IRES to 'push' the L1-stalk to its widest displacement while maintaining the interactions of SL-IV and V with the small subunit. The displaced location of the L1-stalk seems to be compatible with a post-translocated state of the IRES as well as with a fully rotated conformation of the 40S in the presence of CrPV-IRES and eEF2-GPDCP. Whether these wide conformations of the L1-stalk are available for normal translocation with tRNAs or they represent a specific state induced solely by IRES sequences remains an open question to be further investigated. Presumably, after GTP hydrolysis and the accompanying conformational changes (namely swiveling of the 40S head plus back-rotation of the 40S subunit (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ratje et al., 2010</a>), PKI reaches the P site. Thus, hydrolysis of GTP by eEF2 enables disruption of the interactions of SL-IV and V with the small subunit allowing PKI to reach the P-site. Following this initial translocation, the ribosome is in a state primed for elongation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Previous cryo-EM studies of yeast eEF2/80S complexes have suggested alternate roles for diphthamide. Based on the structure of an eEF2/80S complex with modeled tRNAs in the A and P sites, Spahn <i>et al.</i> proposed that diphthamide was positioned near the codon:anticodon duplex of the A-site tRNA, and that it might functionally replace the decoding bases (<i>E. coli</i> A1492/A1493) to stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing during translocation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Spahn et al., 2004b</a>). In a subsequent study employing ADP-ribosylated eEF2, it was proposed that domain movements in eEF2 that accompany GTP hydrolysis cause release of the codon:anticodon duplex from the decoding bases during translocation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Taylor et al., 2007</a>). More recent structures of eEF2/80S ribosome complexes from humans and <i>Drosophila</i> lacked A- and P-site tRNAs and instead contained the yeast Stm1-like serpine 1 mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) snaking through the mRNA channel and A and P sites of the ribosome. In these latter structures diphthamide adopted two positions: either engaging helix 44 near the decoding bases or engaging SERBP1 in the mRNA channel (<a href=\"#bib5\">Anger et al., 2013</a>). Diphthamide is not essential for yeast cell growth. However, the structure suggests that it additionally stabilizes the interaction of the tip of domain IV with the codon-anticodon interaction, which is presumably maintained during translocation from the A to the P site. This interaction of domain IV would compete with the interaction of the ribosomal decoding bases that also interact with the codon:anticodon duplex in the A site, suggesting how it would facilitate breaking the decoding interactions as a prelude to translocation. A reduction in the strength of the interaction of domain IV with the codon-anticodon helix could explain the enhanced -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting observed in yeast or mammalian cells when eEF2 lacks the diphthamide modification (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ortiz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). We propose that the diphthamide modification enhances the fidelity or efficiency of ribosomal translocation and that the unique translocation steps of CrPV-IRES translation, which are uncoupled from peptide synthesis, renders CrPV-IRES translation hypersensitive to the loss of diphthamide (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

                        "text": "The conformational dynamics of ribosomes play an essential functional role in normal translation. These include the inter-subunit rotation (also known as ratcheting), the swiveling of the head about the long axis of the small subunit, and the fluctuations of the L1-stalk correlated with tRNA in the E site. It has been proposed that these movements are part of the mechanism to harness the thermal energy of the environment and channel it towards the production of useful work (<a href=\"#bib68\">Spirin, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Frank and Gonzalez, 2010</a>). Type IV IRES sequences are able to use the intrinsic dynamic nature of the ribosome to assemble a translating 80S on their mRNA while avoiding the highly regulated step of normal initiation. We were able to visualize at high resolution an intermediate state of translocation in the CrPV-IRES/eEF2-GDPCP/80S complex. The binding of eEF2 in its active state stabilizes a distorted conformation of the IRES and an additional 3 degrees of rotation of the small subunit. Subsequently, the energy stored in this state could be used along with GTP hydrolysis to enable disruption of interactions present in the initial binding of the IRES to the small subunit, thereby allowing progression of PKI to the P site. The vacated A site is then able to bind the first aminoacyl-tRNA. In conclusion, this work sheds light on various aspects of type IV IRES and eEF2 structure and function during translocation, and provides further evidence for a universal mechanism for GTP hydrolysis by translational GTPases (<a href=\"#bib76\">Voorhees et al., 2010</a>)."

In the first manuscript, Fernandez et al. determined the structure of the yeast 80S ribosome bound to the CrPV-IRES, finding that it exists in a dynamic equilibrium between \"canonical\" and \"rotated\" conformations. In this second manuscript, Murray et al. determined the structure of the yeast 40S ribosomal subunit bound to CrPV-IRES and the structure of the full 80S complex bound to eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). The 80S/CrPV-IRES/eEF2 (with the GTP analog GDPCP) represents a step further along the elongation translocation cycle of the ribosome, just prior to the \"post-translocated\" state. Overall, the authors have revealed two new structures that offer unique insights into the structure and function of the ribosome during the translocation cycle."

The authors suggest that the diphthamide on allows IRES-specific manipulation of the translation machinery that promotes translocation. But the region of the IRES that diphthamide contacts is the <i>most</i> similar to a canonical ribosome substrate in the entire IRES, begging the question of why there would need to be an IRES-specific solution there. Furthermore, there is no discussion regarding what is known about how eEF2 contacts canonical tRNA substrates using this modification. Because ribosomal contacts must release the codon:anticodon minihelix in canonical initiation, and they can do so independently of the diphthamide modification (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), it suggests the ribosome already has mechanisms in place to do this that the IRES should be able to harness as well. If the authors are correct that the modification permits the first noncanonical translocation, would this suggest that there are other, endogenous messages that specifically need to use the diphthamide in a similar way (given its conservation energetic expense for the cell, 8 enzymes)?"

In this 2006 reconstruction, the density for the PKI is highly disordered and the authors placed it \u201caround the P and A sites\u201d. It is important to note that this reconstruction represents a pre-translocated, binary 80S/CrPV-IRES state. In contrast to the Schuler et al. 2006 paper, we and others (Fernandez-Cell-2014, Koh-PNAS-2014) have shown that in the pre-translocated complex, PKI is placed in the A site. It is only upon the action of eEF2 (as in this manuscript) that it occupies a well-defined intermediate state between A and P sites. It is thus our opinion that crediting Schuler-NSMB-2006 as the first reference where PKI was suggested or observed in-between the A and P sites would be misleading.

The authors suggest that the diphthamide on allows IRES-specific manipulation of the translation machinery that promotes translocation. But the region of the IRES that diphthamide contacts is the most similar to a canonical ribosome substrate in the entire IRES, begging the question of why there would need to be an IRES-specific solution there. Furthermore, there is no discussion regarding what is known about how eEF2 contacts canonical tRNA substrates using this modification. Because ribosomal contacts must release the codon:anticodon minihelix in canonical initiation, and they can do so independently of the diphthamide modification (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), it suggests the ribosome already has mechanisms in place to do this that the IRES should be able to harness as well. If the authors are correct that the modification permits the first noncanonical translocation, would this suggest that there are other, endogenous messages that specifically need to use the diphthamide in a similar way (given its conservation energetic expense for the cell, 8 enzymes)?</i> We agree that the insights gained from the CrPV-IRES structures has relevance to the function of eEF2 in canonical translation. We propose that diphthamide aids in the similar re-orientation of the decoding bases A1753 and A1754 during canonical translation. While canonical translation can proceed efficiently in the absence of diphthamide, we propose that unique features of PKI and the unusual translocation required for CrPV IRES-mediated translation initiation makes the IRES translation more sensitive than canonical translation to loss of diphthamide. Rather than suggesting, as the reviewers do, that certain cellular mRNAs might use diphthamide in the same way as the CrPV-IRES, we prefer a model in which diphthamide enhances fidelity at all translocation steps and that the unique features of the CrPV-IRES and its translocation confer a heightened requirement for diphthamide. In accord with this line of thinking, we prefer to not speculate that some cellular mRNAs might be translated in a manner similar to the translocation mechanism employed by the CrPV IRES."

Christian Spahn and Joachim Frank published a low-resolution structure of eEF2 on the 80S ribosome (EMBO J 23:1008-1019 (2004)). Notably, the structure did not contain tRNAs, and instead tRNAs were modeled in. In the model, diphthamide was positioned near the codon:anticodon duplex, and the authors speculated that diphthamide might functionally replace A1492/A1493 to stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing during translocation (they did not consider the idea that diphtamide might help break the decoding interaction). In a follow-up paper by Derek Taylor (EMBO J 26:2421-2431 (2007)), the structure of ADP-ribosylated eEF2 on the 80S was examined. This second paper focused on the impact of GTP hydrolysis by eEF2 and on eEF2 and ribosome conformations. The interaction of eEF2 and diphthamide with tRNA was not discussed; however, it was proposed that movement of the tip of domain IV of eEF2 during GTP hydrolysis might disrupt the interaction of the decoding center with the mRNA-tRNA duplex. Finally, Beckmann and colleagues reported the structure eEF2 bound to <i>Drosophila</i> and human ribosomes. Notably, these complexes contained an E-site tRNA and the protein SERBP1 (similar to Stm1 of yeast) snaking through the mRNA channel and the A and P sites of the 80S. The diphthamide moiety on eEF2 adopted two positions in these structures: 1) engaging helix 44 near the decoding bases, or 2) engaging SERBP1 in the mRNA channel. As these structures lack A- and P-site tRNAs, they do not provide insights into how diphthamide interacts with the translocation substrate. Thus, our structure provides the first image of eEF2 and diphthamide interacting with an authentic substrate on the ribosome."

The superposition of the blue and red curves highlights the absence of over-fitting of the refined model as explained in Brown et al., ActaCrystD (2015). We have expanded the figure legend to make this explicit. In the expanded figure legend we also explain that the vertical line represents the maximum resolution included in the refinement."
