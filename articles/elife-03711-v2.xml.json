Female and estrogen-treated male mice show greater resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia, seen as greater bacterial clearance, diminished lung inflammation, and better survival. In vitro, lung macrophages from female mice and humans show better killing of ingested bacteria. Inhibitors and genetically altered mice identify a critical role for estrogen-mediated activation of lung macrophage nitric oxide synthase-3 (NOS3). Epidemiologic data show decreased hospitalization for pneumonia in women receiving estrogen or statins (known to activate NOS3). Pharmacologic targeting of NOS3 with statins or another small-molecule compound (AVE3085) enhanced macrophage bacterial killing, improved bacterial clearance, and increased host survival in both primary and secondary (post-influenza) pneumonia. The data identify a novel mechanism for host defense via NOS3 and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza."

Female and estrogen-treated male mice show greater resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia, seen as greater bacterial clearance, diminished lung inflammation, and better survival. In vitro, lung macrophages from female mice and humans show better killing of ingested bacteria. Inhibitors and genetically altered mice identify a critical role for estrogen-mediated activation of lung macrophage nitric oxide synthase-3 (NOS3). Epidemiologic data show decreased hospitalization for pneumonia in women receiving estrogen or statins (known to activate NOS3). Pharmacologic targeting of NOS3 with statins or another small-molecule compound (AVE3085) enhanced macrophage bacterial killing, improved bacterial clearance, and increased host survival in both primary and secondary (post-influenza) pneumonia. The data identify a novel mechanism for host defense via NOS3 and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza."

One approach to the problem might be to enhance innate immunity to infection. Normal host defenses are already quite robust, albeit imperfect, as they keep the incidence of pneumonia much lower than possible given the normal nocturnal aspiration of nasopharyngeal bacteria, example <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gleeson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dockrell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Donkor, 2013</a>).

As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, the non-selective NOS blocker nitro-l-arginine (NLA) caused substantial inhibition of female AM killing, while its stereoisomer controls NDA and the inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS2)-specific inhibitor 1400W had no effect. This suggested a role for another NOS isoform, namely the constitutively expressed endothelial type NOS3 found in alveolar and other macrophages (<a href=\"#bib30\">Miles et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">van Straaten et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Connelly et al., 2003</a>). This postulate was directly tested using mice genetically deficient in NOS3. In vitro, deficiency in NOS3 did not alter the killing by male macrophages, but completely abolished the female advantage in bacterial killing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In vivo, absence of NOS3 had minimal effects on male clearance of bacteria, but reduced the female advantage by \u223c50% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Genetic deletion of NOS3 greatly reduced survival in female mice with pneumonia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), and transgenic overexpression of NOS3 increased bacterial clearance in male mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), supporting the functional importance of this pathway. The 24 hr in vivo bacterial clearance assay provides enough time for induction of NOS2, which is known to mediate macrophage antimicrobial function in rodents (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nathan and Shiloh, 2000</a>). To test the contribution of this isoform, we measured bacterial clearance in NOS2-deficient mice and in mice treated with the NOS2 inhibitor 1400W. The data show that male mice do rely on NOS2, since clearance of pneumococci was markedly worse in NOS2-deficient or 1400W-treated mice compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). In contrast, female mice showed a trend for improved clearance when <i>Nos2</i> was genetically deleted (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>); similar results were seen in wild-type female mice after pharmacologic inhibition of NOS2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Since NO itself can inhibit NOS3 function (<a href=\"#bib3\">Buga et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Erwin et al., 2005</a>), the data suggest that low-level basal NOS2 or NOS2 induction actually hampers the beneficial activity of NOS3 in females."

We conclude that estrogen mediates greater host resistance to pneumonia in female mice via effects on the constitutively expressed NOS3 in lung macrophages. The basis for this conclusion includes data in mouse cells or models using pharmacologic agents, inhibitors, and genetically deficient animals. A similar advantage is seen in female human primary AMs and estrogen-treated human macrophages. These observations identify a novel host defense mechanism and a function for the main NOS isoform found in normal human macrophages. Pharmacologic targeting of NOS3 with one type of drug already in clinical use (statins) and another small-molecule lead compound (AVE3085) led to improved bacterial clearance and improved survival from secondary pneumococcal pneumonia."

The very low amounts of NO generated by macrophage NOS3 prompt the speculation that additional mechanisms act to amplify its contribution to bacterial killing. These may include increased trafficking of NOS3 after estrogen-mediated phosphorylation to phagosomes, selective triggering of calcium-dependent NOS3 production of NO around bacteria by phagocytosis-associated calcium fluxes, and combination of NO with superoxide to generate peroxynitrite, a potent microbicidal agent (<a href=\"#bib7\">Darrah et al., 2000</a>). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. The data also show an interesting but unresolved finding of incomplete concordance between in vitro and in vivo results using NOS3-deficient mice. Specifically, NOS3 deficiency eliminated the female advantage entirely in studies of bacterial killing by AMs in vitro. In contrast, the female advantage in vivo was diminished by approximately half in NOS3-deficient mice. The mechanism(s) and significance of this persistent component of gender difference in mice are unknown and need further study."

However, the quantity and composition of bacteria that enter the lungs during nocturnal aspiration is unknown.

There are also interesting reports of association of NOS3 polymorphisms with risk of community-acquired pneumonia (<a href=\"#bib37\">Salnikova et al., 2013</a>). However, we consider that the translational potential of these findings may be most relevant for the problem of secondary pneumonia, specifically the increased susceptibility to bacterial lung infections that follows influenza. Using pre-treatment before the bacterial challenge is arguably a limitation of our studies in the primary pneumonia model; this approach is useful for proof-of-principle but does not mirror likely clinical usage. In contrast, pre-treatment in the secondary pneumonia model does represent a realistic scenario for short-term, prophylactic immunomodulatory therapy. This approach could boost resistance to prevent bacterial pneumonias during intervals of increased susceptibility. This could well benefit patients who are identified to be at high risk of secondary pneumonia, example hospitalized individuals with severe seasonal or pandemic influenza."

A murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia was used to compare male and female bacterial clearance, lung inflammation, and survival in vivo. In vitro assays of macrophage antibacterial function were used to identify killing of internalized bacteria as a critical difference. Pharmacologic inhibitors, genetic mouse models, and in vitro macrophage studies were used to investigate the role of oxidant-generating enzyme systems and estrogen. After identification of NOS3 as an important mediator, we tested pharmacologic agents with translational potential for ability to improve outcomes in primary and post-influenza secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. For in vivo studies, we used male and female mice of the same age, and the studies were not blinded. Sample sizes for all of the experiments were sufficient to detect statistically significant differences between treatment groups, with all measurements included in analyses. To explore whether the effects of estrogen and statins that were observed in the murine models also occur in people, we studied incidence of hospitalized pneumonia associated with the use of estrogen and statins in a population-based case-control study based on medical databases in Denmark. Cases of pneumonia were identified as all women who received a first-time principal hospital diagnosis of pneumonia in the former North Jutland and Aarhus Counties, Northern Denmark (1.2 million inhabitants) between 1997 and 2012. Using the Danish Civil Registration System, each case subject was matched with five population control subjects with same age, female gender, and residence in Northern Denmark on the pneumonia index date. We ascertained use of estrogen and statins in all individuals from population-based prescription databases. To control for confounding by other conditions potentially associated with both estrogen and statin use and pneumonia risk, we retrieved individual-level data on 19 major comorbid disease categories as evidenced in the Charlson comorbidity index, as well as on alcoholism-related conditions, recent antibiotic use, and marital status as a marker of socioeconomic status. We then computed odds ratios (ORs) for a first-time pneumonia admission among women with and without estrogen and statin use, using conditional logistic regression analysis to control for confounders."

Hence, the dose delivered is stated as \u223c10<sup>5</sup> CFU. For analysis at 4 or 24 hr post-infection, mice were sacrificed with/by lethal overdose of intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (FatalPlus, Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) or by excess inhaled isoflurane. To measure total lung bacteria counts (CFU), whole lungs were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml sterile water with a tissue homogenizer (Omni International, Warrenton, VA). Serial 10-fold dilutions in sterile water were made from these homogenates, and 100 \u00b5l volumes were plated onto sheep-blood agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C.

For analysis of lung inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in situ with a 22-gauge catheter inserted into the proximal trachea, flushing the lower airways six times with 0.7 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The fluid retrieved from the first lavage was kept for ELISA assays. The BAL cells were separated from the BAL fluid by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS and counted.

The appropriate dilution was prepared in sterile PBS to be administered to mice, and this estimate was checked in parallel by CFU assay to determine the precise concentration."

Macrophages (1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells/1.5 ml HBSS<sup>+</sup>) were mixed with bacteria (15 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> CFU: 10 bacteria per 1 macrophage) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. After centrifugation the cell pellet was re-suspended and an aliquot taken to measure the total cell-associated CFU (bound and internalized). After brief incubation of the cell suspension with gentamicin (200 \u00b5g/ml, 15 min at 37\u00b0C) to kill external, bound bacteria, the macrophages were washed and an aliquot taken for lysis and CFU assay to quantitate the number of internalized, live bacteria. The macrophages were then incubated an additional hour to allow killing of internalized bacteria and aliquots taken again for CFU quantitation. The CFU data obtained at various time points allow calculation of the number of bacteria bound, internalized, and killed. Effects of pharmacologic inhibitors or hormones were tested by including agents or their vehicles in the assay buffers. Respiratory burst function in normal mouse AMs was measured by quantitation of the H2O2-catalyzed oxidation of Amplex Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to a fluorescent product after stimulation with adsorbed antibodies (anti-FcR, CD18) or PMA (100 nM) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib26\">J\u00f3zefowski and Kobzik, 2004</a>)."

Several post-translational mechanisms have been described increasing or decreasing NOS3 activity, primarily from studies of vascular endothelium (for a review see Qian and Fulton, Front Physiol; 2013, 4, 347). Although we have not investigated such posttranslational mechanisms in lung macrophages so far, we speculate that similar signals might be involved, e.g. physical signals analogous to shear stress, such as generated by macrophage movement within the alveolus or cyclic stretch of the lung during breathing, or activation signals generated during the act of phagocytosis. In addition, uptake of certain bacteria is associated with activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway (e.g. for Staph. aureus, Infect Immun. 2011 Nov;79(11):4569-77; for Shigella, Sci Signal. 2011 Sep 20;4(191):ra61). However, a short and accurate answer is that we don\u2019t know the mechanism. This would need to be addressed by future studies."

As a measure of overall comorbidity, we computed the Charlson comorbidity index score for each subject (Charlson ME, J Chronic Dis 1987). The Charlson comorbidity index was originally validated for prediction of mortality, but has the advantage of including almost all known major risk factors for pneumonia (Thomsen RW, Diabetes Care 2004), such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary diseases, previous cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, chronic heart failure, diabetes, cancer, renal and liver disease, dementia, and HIV/AIDS (Mor A et al, Clinical Epidemiology 2013). Many of these chronic diseases are related to age, unhealthy lifestyle, and socioeconomic status (Barnett K, Lancet 2012). As other markers of health consciousness and socioeconomic status, we therefore retrieved data on alcoholism-related conditions, recent antibiotic use, and marital status, which are also known risk factors for pneumonia (Kornum JB, Eur Resp J 2012; Mor A, Clinical Epidemiology 2013). People who use preventive medications such as estrogen and statins may be more \u201chealthy\u201d, that is, have higher health consciousness and a healthier lifestyle and thus fewer lifestyle related diseases than other people (Brookhart A, Am J Epidemiol 2007; Shrank WH, J Gen Intern Med 2011). On the other hand, medical indications for these drugs during the study period included comorbidities that may have been already present in the patient (e.g. osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease). Since the above factors are a priori expected to be skewed both according to risk of pneumonia and chance of being drug exposed - which our analyses of 2 x 2 tables confirmed (Table S1 shows association with pneumonia case status) \u2013 we included them as potential confounders. To evaluate the actual confounding caused by the above factors, we calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for a first-time pneumonia admission among women with and without estrogen and statin use, while using conditional logistic regression analysis to control for the confounders: Charlson comorbidity index level (19 different comorbidities), alcoholism-related conditions, antibiotics before admission, and marital status). The changes in risk estimates, e.g. from a crude pneumonia OR in estrogen users of 0.99 (0.95-1.04) to a confounder-adjusted pneumonia OR in estrogen users of 0.82 (0.78-0.86) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), show that these factors confounded the association between estrogen use and pneumonia risk. In other words, estrogen users and non-users appeared to have similar pneumonia risk in crude analyses. When adjusting for differences in prevalence of confounding factors, estrogen users had a decreased pneumonia risk. We have added a few explanatory comments on this in the revised manuscript, Results section."
