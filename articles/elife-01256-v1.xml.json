                    "text": "In mammals, numerous autosomal genes are subject to mitotically stable monoallelic expression (MAE), including genes that play critical roles in a variety of human diseases. Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. In this study, we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in \u223c20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation."

Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. In this study, we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in \u223c20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation."

These processes underpin the development of a fertilized egg into a complex organism, and they can also lead to life-threatening diseases when they go wrong. There are two copies of each gene in a human cell, a maternal copy and a paternal copy, and it is thought that both copies are usually regulated together. However, there are exceptions to this rule: for certain genes only the maternal copy is expressed as a protein in some cells, whereas the paternal copy is expressed in other cells."

In addition to cis- and trans-regulatory variation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gilad et al., 2008</a>), there are at least three major kinds of non-Mendelian phenomena that control allele-specific expression in mammals. One is the X chromosome inactivation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lyon, 1961</a>): in female embryos, around the time of implantation, about half of the cells choose to inactivate the maternal X, and the rest inactivate the paternal X, affecting most of the X-linked genes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carrel and Willard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berletch et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yang et al., 2010</a>).

The only existing, large-scale sets of data are collected in clonal lymphocyte cell lines in vitro. The limited number of analyzed clones is insufficient to generate a complete catalog of MAE genes in that cell type, and little is known about the prevalence of MAE in other cell types. Virtually nothing is understood about the establishment of MAE during development and differentiation. Mechanistically, allelic choice has been linked to changes in chromatin states in some special cases: imprinting (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wen et al., 2008</a>), olfactory receptor gene choice (<a href=\"#bib35\">Magklara et al., 2011</a>), and immunoglobulin-kappa gene rearrangement (<a href=\"#bib14\">Farago et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, for hundreds of other autosomal MAE genes, no molecular features have been associated with establishment and maintenance of allelic choice.

Like X inactivation, MAE is masked in polyclonal samples, and obtaining monoclonal cell populations is challenging for most tissue types, particularly so in vivo. Moreover, genome-wide methods are limited by the availability of polymorphisms. In this study, we report a fundamentally new approach to the detection of monoallelic expression. In contrast to other methods, it does not require any allele-specific information, instead relying on a specific chromatin pattern as a proxy for MAE. We use this approach to address questions about MAE\u2019s prevalence, development, and function."

Therefore, we used equivalence testing (<a href=\"#bib32\">Limentani et al., 2005</a>), with equivalence boundaries corresponding to the two-fold imbalance; genes that failed both tests were called indeterminate.

Insufficient coverage depth leaves an overwhelming majority of genes as \u2018indeterminate\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This results in underestimation of both the true positive and the true negative rates. Furthermore, a large majority of known MAE genes (about 85%) show biallelic expression in some clonal lineages (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zwemer et al., 2012</a>). This is highly important when considering any validation experiments, since even exhaustive analysis of just two independent clones would miss monoallelic expression in many such genes that would happen to show biallelic expression in the two assessed clones. To validate MAE predictions more conclusively, we measured allelic bias in a greater number of independent clones. To simultaneously increase both coverage depth and the number of biological samples, we designed a targeted extra-deep RNA-Seq assay (allele-specific targeted sequencing; AST-Seq) that allowed us to precisely quantify allele-specific expression of a subset of genes in an increased number of clones (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

In addition, the number of clones we assayed, while higher than in the first experiment, is not sufficient to establish at high level of certainty that these are truly biallelic genes.

In this and the following analyses we applied the classifier to all genes with evidence of transcription (excluding only genes that were not expressed; with RPKM&lt;0.1), to achieve the most comprehensive possible coverage (\u2018Method note 1\u2019). The overall distribution of genes in the DT2F phase space was very similar in cells in vitro and in vivo, with two principal clusters at high H3K36me3 and high H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Predicted genes in PBMC largely overlapped with our predictions for LCLs: out of 2057 genes showing the MAE chromatin signature in PBMC, and called in GM12878 cells, 83% (1712) were also predicted MAE there. This is particularly striking since the experimental data for these two related cell types were collected in two different laboratories. This suggests that the genes with MAE signature in lymphoblasts are quite similar to those in the related ex vivo cells."

Interestingly, the promoter signal carried very little additional information relative to the gene-body features (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This could be due to some combination of biological reasons with much lower noise associated with gene body features due to their much greater length. It should also be noted that we focused on promoters and gene bodies because they are unequivocally associated with particular genes. It might be informative to study the involvement of other regulatory elements, such as enhancers. Upon applying this approach to a variety of cell types, we estimate that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE. Since detection of the MAE signature does not rely on SNPs or on sample clonality, we expect that this approach will make feasible the analysis of MAE in primary samples, including systematic comparisons of normal and diseased tissue."

In the promoters of bivalent genes, both active and inactive modifications are simultaneously present on both alleles (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, direct evidence showed individual nucleosomes carrying H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 along with H3K27me3, albeit on the opposite histone H3 tails (<a href=\"#bib48\">Voigt et al., 2012</a>). At the same time, asymmetric distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 within the gene body of MAE genes is consistent with a very simple asymmetric model: H3K27me3 is known to be associated with transcriptionally silenced chromatin, and H3K36me3 is associated with gene bodies of the actively transcribed genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Black et al., 2012</a>). This leads us to speculate that transition of the bivalent genes from transcriptionally silent state with \u2018poised\u2019 chromatin into an active state often happens independently for the two alleles. In that scenario, either allele can become stably inactive, with gene body chromatin enriched with H3K27me3, while the other becomes active and enriched with H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Once the poised state has resolved into active or inactive state, it locks in that state; with some probability, both alleles become active, and the biallelic state is locked. While the molecular details of this process remain unclear, this model makes testable prediction that for bivalent genes, MAE is established during lineage commitment events, such as ES cell differentiation."

This RNA was DNase treated followed by first strand synthesis in the presence of Actinomycin D and second strand synthesis in the presence of dUTP instead of dTTP. Sheared cDNA (Covaris Inc, Woburn, MA) was end-repaired and subsequently adenylated. Adapters were ligated and ran on gel to cut and elute the pieces of desired size. The eluted DNA was subjected to a treatment by USER enzyme (NEB, Ipswich, MA) to remove the second strand. The resulting mixture was PCR amplified (using primers recommended by Illumina but synthesized by IDT, Coralville, IA) using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) for 15 cycles followed by agarose gel purification of the band.

Second round of PCR used these universal tails to introduce unique combinations of 6-nucleotide \u2018barcode\u2019 sequences. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using Qiagen Blood kit. RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) using standard protocol. DNase-treated (Turbo, Ambion, Life Technologies) RNA was used to prepare cDNA using SuperScriptIII (Life Technologies). PCR was performed using Klear Taq (KBioscience, UK) (95\u00b0C, 15 min enzyme activation followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C, 30 s denaturation; 62\u00b0C, 30 s annealing; 68\u00b0C, 90 s extension; and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 5 min). After two rounds of PCR, barcoded amplicons were mixed in equal amount for preparation of the single library. The mixed amplicons were size-selected on agarose gel, end repaired, adenylated, and finally adapters were ligated. The resulting DNA fragments of desired size range were purified on agarose gel, and pre-amplified for 15 cycles. The library was mixed with high-complexity libraries (20\u201330%) and subjected to paired-end or single-end sequencing for 100 cycles on Illumina HiSeq 2000.

We based our gene expression cutoff of 0.1 RPKM for expressed genes on several considerations: our experimental cell lines are lymphoblastoid, which are smaller than average sized cells. While 100 ng of RNA of cells used by (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mortazavi et al., 2008</a>) correspond to approximately 10<sup>3</sup> cells, we require between 1\u20133 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> cells, to obtain the same amount of RNA. Hence, if (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mortazavi et al., 2008</a>) calculate that RPKM = 1 corresponds to approximately one transcript per cell based on their spike-in data, we adjust the empirical curve by a factor of 10 to obtain 0.1 RPKM to stand for approximately one transcript per cell. In addition, we note that while only 9% of genes with RPKM of 0 in the data for the polyclonal line are detected in our clonal lines, 50% of the genes with 0.1 RPKM are detected (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rozowsky et al., 2011</a>). This means that we have direct evidence that at least half of the genes at that level are represented at one transcript per every two (clonal) cells. Given that detection is not perfect, we believe this to be a very conservative estimate. Last but not least, 0.1 RPKM as a detection threshold for whole transcriptome analysis is a widely accepted method (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lundberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Uhlen et al., 2010</a>)."

Analysis in nonclonal cell populations (such as the ENCODE cell lines or isolated <i>ex vivo</i> cells) has been mostly restricted to single-cell techniques such as the fluorescent in situ hybridization approach which we have used in PBMCs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gimelbrant et al., 2007</a>). Until a more general study is completed, it remains formally possible that the chromatin signature does not reflect MAE in some or many cell types.
