Recent work has shown that gain-of-function mutations in mechanically activated Piezo1 cation channels are associated with the dehydrating RBC disease xerocytosis, implicating a role of mechanotransduction in RBC volume regulation. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations result in RBC dehydration are unknown. In this study, we show that RBCs exhibit robust calcium entry in response to mechanical stretch and that this entry is dependent on Piezo1 expression. Furthermore, RBCs from blood-cell-specific Piezo1 conditional knockout mice are overhydrated and exhibit increased fragility both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Yoda1, a chemical activator of Piezo1, causes calcium influx and subsequent dehydration of RBCs via downstream activation of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, directly implicating Piezo1 signaling in RBC volume control. Therefore, mechanically activated Piezo1 plays an essential role in RBC volume homeostasis."

Recent work has shown that gain-of-function mutations in mechanically activated Piezo1 cation channels are associated with the dehydrating RBC disease xerocytosis, implicating a role of mechanotransduction in RBC volume regulation. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations result in RBC dehydration are unknown. In this study, we show that RBCs exhibit robust calcium entry in response to mechanical stretch and that this entry is dependent on Piezo1 expression. Furthermore, RBCs from blood-cell-specific Piezo1 conditional knockout mice are overhydrated and exhibit increased fragility both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Yoda1, a chemical activator of Piezo1, causes calcium influx and subsequent dehydration of RBCs via downstream activation of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, directly implicating Piezo1 signaling in RBC volume control. Therefore, mechanically activated Piezo1 plays an essential role in RBC volume homeostasis."

This compound was shown in a separate study by Syeda et al. to activate Piezo1 channels. Activating Piezo1 caused a second type of ion channel to open up as well, which allowed potassium ions and water molecules to leave the cell. This resulted in the cell becoming dehydrated."

RBCs experience significant mechanical forces while recirculating that influence their physiology in many ways, including changes in deformability (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chien, 1987</a>), ATP release (<a href=\"#bib23\">Sprague et al., 2001</a>), NO release (<a href=\"#bib28\">Yalcin et al., 2008</a>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<a href=\"#bib13\">Larsen et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dyrda and et al., 2010</a>), the latter of which can influence RBC volume. Changes in RBC volume can affect their membrane integrity and ability to travel through capillaries with diameters smaller than the RBCs themselves. The critical importance of RBC volume regulation is demonstrated by several pathologies resulting from either overhydration or dehydration of RBCs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gallagher, 2013</a>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which RBCs sense mechanical forces and the effects of these forces on volume homeostasis have remained unclear."

Piezo1 responds to a wide array of mechanical forces, including poking, stretching, and shear stress, and is essential for proper vascular development in mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nilius and Honore, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ranade et al., 2014</a>). The potential role of Piezo1 in RBC physiology is most clearly demonstrated by many gain-of-function mutations in Piezo1 that have been identified in patients with the RBC disease xerocytosis, also called dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Zarychanski et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albuisson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andolfo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2013</a>). In addition, whole body treatment of zebrafish with Piezo1 morpholino affects RBC volume homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Faucherre et al., 2014</a>). Finally, the Piezo1 locus has also been implicated in a genome-wide association screen for affecting the RBC mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in humans (<a href=\"#bib26\">van der Harst et al., 2012</a>). However, whether any of these effects are due to Piezo1 expression on the RBCs themselves is not understood nor is the normal role of Piezo1 in mammalian RBC physiology."

Both peripheral blood RBCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and developing bone marrow pro-RBCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) from <i>Piezo1</i><sup><i>P1-tdTomato</i></sup> mice exhibited increased tdTomato fluorescence by flow cytometry compared to those from <i>Piezo1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> mice. Peripheral RBCs from <i>Piezo1</i><sup><i>P1-tdTomato</i></sup> mice had clear expression of a \u223c320 kDa Piezo1-tdTomato fusion protein by Western blot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To further investigate the role of Piezo1 in RBC physiology, we set out to genetically ablate it. Mice deficient in Piezo1 die in utero, so we deleted Piezo1 specifically in the hematopoietic system. We bred Vav1-iCre mice, which express Cre recombinase early in hematopoiesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Shimshek et al., 2002</a>), to mice where exons 20\u201323 of <i>Piezo1</i> are flanked by loxP sites (P1<sup>f</sup>), thus generating viable, fertile Vav1-iCre P1<sup>f/f</sup> (Vav1-P1cKO) mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Vav1-P1cKO lymphocytes exhibited &gt;95% deletion of <i>piezo1</i> transcript, demonstrating efficient Cre-mediated excision (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Hematological analysis of blood from Vav1-P1cKO mice revealed significant changes in RBC physiology without significant anemia (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Notably, compared to WT mice, Vav1-P1cKO mice had elevated (% of WT \u00b1 SEM) mean corpuscular volume (MCV, 109.51 \u00b1 1.51) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH, 103.14 \u00b1 0.48) and reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC, 94.37 \u00b1 1.08), suggesting that Piezo1-deficient RBCs were overhydrated. Since increased MCV can also be observed in the dehydrated RBCs in xerocytosis, we further tested whether Piezo1-deficient RBCs were actually overhydrated. Overhydrated RBCs exhibit increased osmotic fragility and increased size as measured by forward scatter using flow cytometry. Blood from Vav1-P1cKO mice exhibited both of these characteristics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), demonstrating that Piezo1-deficient RBCs are overhydrated. While Vav1-P1cKO RBCs were overhydrated, scanning electron microscopy of WT and Vav1-P1cKO RBCs revealed that Vav1-P1cKO RBCs had relatively normal discoid morphology, unlike more severe overhydration pathologies such as spherocytosis (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Although they appeared visibly darker and redder following H&amp;E; staining, spleens from Vav1-P1cKO mice exhibited normal formation of both red and white pulp without an evident expansion of red pulp or increased iron deposition (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). However, flow cytometric analysis of splenic RBC subpopulations revealed an increased number of fully mature Ter119<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>\u2212</sup> RBCs, but not immature Ter119<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> RBCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), suggesting that the darker splenic color is due in part to retention of overhydrated circulating mature RBCs. Consistent with this, immature splenic RBCs had similar forward scatter in WT and Vav1-P1cKO mice, indicating that they were of similar size, while fully mature RBCs in Vav1-P1cKO exhibited increased forward scatter indicative of increased size (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We also found that Vav1-P1cKO mice exhibited significantly lower plasma haptoglobin concentrations, indicative of intravascular hemolysis in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Thus, Piezo1-deficient RBCs have increased fragility and are aberrantly retained within the spleen, suggesting that Piezo1 helps maintain RBC integrity and normal recirculation."

RBCs experience significant mechanical forces during circulation; we, therefore, sought to determine whether acute application of mechanical force could cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and whether any Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx observed was dependent on Piezo1. However, many of the existing methods of mechanical stimulation available to us proved unsuitable for this purpose. Patch-clamp experiments proved impractical as conditions that allowed the formation of gigaohm seals in a cell-attached setting resulted in cell rupture upon application of negative pressure. Additionally, RBCs were also too small and fragile for indentation using a glass probe with or without simultaneous electrophysiological recording. Calcium imaging studies using shear stress in laminar flow chambers did not yield detectable increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

We used micropipettes with a long, tapered tip and optimized their size and shape (tip diameter \u223c1\u20131.5 \u03bcm) so that RBCs could only partially enter into the pipette (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the presence of 0.05% BSA, mechanical stimulation of these cells was possible without causing cell rupture by applying negative pipette pressure using a high-speed pressure clamp device (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This method allowed for quantitative and reproducible application of force while detecting changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Application of negative pressure induced a rapid rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in Fluo-4-loaded WT RBCs with a threshold of \u223c \u22125 mmHg and a P<sub>50</sub> of \u22129.72 \u00b1 0.51 mmHg (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). As seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, repeated applications of negative pressure induced a mild rundown in the calcium response. To account for this, we normalized all responses in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> to the average of two maximal (\u221225 mmHg) stimuli flanking each test pulse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Following removal of a half-maximal \u221210 mmHg stimulus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels declined to baseline with an average t<sub>1/2</sub> of 21 \u00b1 1.8 s. This increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration must be a result of influx rather than receptor-mediated store release as RBCs do not possess intracellular stores. To conclusively determine whether this Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was Piezo1-mediated, we subjected Vav1-P1cKO RBCs to similar negative pressure stimulation. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was not detectable in any Vav1-P1cKO RBCs, even at pressures up to \u221235 mmHg (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Experiments using Vav1-P1cKO RBCs were conducted using the same pipettes that previously elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in WT RBCs, allowing for equivalent mechanical stimulation between genotypes. These results demonstrate that RBCs can respond to mechanical force by allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cell and that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is dependent on Piezo1."

In fact, RBCs from one strain of mice lacking KCa3.1 exhibit increased size and osmotic fragility similar to what is seen in Vav1-P1cKO mice (<a href=\"#bib12\">Grgic et al., 2009</a>). We tested whether Yoda1 could cause RBC dehydration, and whether any possible dehydration was mediated through KCa3.1 activation by Piezo1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Treatment of WT RBCs, but not Vav1-P1cKO RBCs, with 15 \u03bcM Yoda1 led to a rapid change in their shape, progressing from discocytes to echinocytes to spherocytes, similar to what has been demonstrated for treatment with A23187 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Steffen et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

Here, we have shown that these forces have a significant effect on RBC physiology by activating the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. Our findings suggest a link between mechanical forces and RBC volume via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Piezo1. The ability of RBCs to reduce their volume in response to mechanical forces could improve their ability to traverse through small-diameter capillaries and splenic sinusoids. Additionally, it is possible that this reduction in volume could aid in oxygen/CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the periphery by concentrating hemoglobin within RBCs, which may promote release of oxygen from hemoglobin; in fact, mechanical stimulation of RBCs via optical tweezers has been shown to cause such a release of oxygen (<a href=\"#bib21\">Rao et al., 2009</a>)."

We have demonstrated that genetic deletion of Piezo1 in blood cells leads to overhydrated, fragile RBCs. We have also shown that mechanical force can cause calcium influx into RBCs that is dependent on Piezo1 expression. We cannot exclude the possibility that deletion of Piezo1 alters RBC membrane properties, resulting in decreased activity of a separate mechanosensitive ion channel rather than calcium entering the cell through Piezo1 itself. We find this unlikely given the relatively mild overhydration of Vav1-P1cKO RBCs and the complete absence of any mechanically induced calcium influx in these cells. Finally, using the first identified selective small molecule activator of Piezo1, we have shown that calcium influx through Piezo1 dehydrates RBCs via the actions of KCa3.1. These findings are consistent with the observation of dehydrated RBCs from DHS patients with gain-of-function Piezo1 mutations (<a href=\"#bib29\">Zarychanski et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albuisson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andolfo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bae et al., 2013</a>), further supporting that the dehydration seen in DHS patients is due to increased Piezo1-mediated calcium influx in response to mechanical forces in RBCs themselves."

Generation of mice containing conditional deletion of Piezo1 in blood cells combined with full replacement of normal murine hemoglobin genes with sickling human hemoglobin genes could help determine whether Piezo1 mediates both P<sub>Sickle</sub> and the pathology of SCD.

Vav1-iCre mice on C57Bl/6J background (Stock # 008610) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice were genotyped using the following primers: P1 F: CTT GAC CTG TCC CCT TCC CCA TCA AG, P1 WT/fl R: CAG TCA CTG CTC TTA ACC ATT GAG CCA TCT C, P1 KO R: AGG TTG CAG GGT GGC ATG GCT CTT TTT using Phire II polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with the following cycling conditions: Initial denaturation 98\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 31 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 5 s, 65\u00b0C for 5 s, 72\u00b0C for 5 s, followed by a final hold of 72\u00b0C for 2 min. Vav1-iCre was genotyped using protocols as described by Jackson Laboratory. Reactions were separated on 2% agarose gels yielding the following band sizes: P1<sup>+</sup>: 160 bp, P1<sup>f</sup>: 330 bp, P1<sup>\u2212</sup>: 230 bp.

Cells were then placed in an imaging chamber and washed via whole-chamber perfusion for removal of excess extracellular dye. Mechanical stimulation of erythrocytes was achieved by capturing individual RBCs in the \u223c1 \u03bcm aperture of custom-made micropipettes (as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and subsequently applying pulses of negative pressure to the pipette compartment using a High-Speed Pressure-Clamp (HSPC) device (ALA scientific, Farmingdale, NY). Micropipettes were pulled using 1.5/0.85-mm (OD/ID) borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) with a P-97 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments). The electrical resistance of such micropipettes varied in the range of 15\u201320 M\u2126. Following expulsion of the erythrocyte after each measurement using positive pipette pressures, individual pipettes were reused for subsequent measurements (approx. 6\u201310 measurements possible with single pipettes before clogging), allowing for reliable comparison of the applied mechanical stimuli across experimental groups."

In the present manuscript, they report that Piezo1 plays a major role in regulating the volume of red blood cells (RBCs). Opening of Piezo1 in response to mechanical stress is responsible for a calcium influx in RBCs. Increasing intracellular calcium leads to the opening of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, loss of K<sup>+</sup> ions and dehydration. Deletion of Piezo1 specifically in hematopoietic cells caused RBC fragility and sequestration in the spleen. By contrast, Piezo1 opening with the newly discovered opener Obi1 (see companion paper), results in RBC dehydration. Importantly, this effect is absent when Piezo1 is deleted in RBCs. It is concluded that Piezo1 may contribute to Psickle."

A well designed and executed study, I have but one very minor question they might be able to comment toward. While they do note that combining interventions affecting sickle cell hemoglobin and Piezo 1 might provide novel and important information toward novel treatment of sickle cell disease, I was wondering if there is anything known about the role of mechanical forces, including swelling and shrinking, on oxygen exchange, as the major force change they are studying would occur at the site of oxygen exchange.

While they do note that combining interventions affecting sickle cell hemoglobin and Piezo 1 might provide novel and important information toward novel treatment of sickle cell disease, I was wondering if there is anything known about the role of mechanical forces, including swelling and shrinking, on oxygen exchange, as the major force change they are studying would occur at the site of oxygen exchange.

For now, we have added the following sentence in Discussion section: \u201cAdditionally, it is possible that this reduction in volume could aid in oxygen/CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the periphery by concentrating hemoglobin within RBCs, which may promote release of oxygen from hemoglobin; in fact, mechanical stimulation of RBCs via optical tweezers has been shown to cause such a release of oxygen.\u201d"
