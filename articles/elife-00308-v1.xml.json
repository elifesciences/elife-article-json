Problems can occur if a ribosome stalls while translating the mRNA transcript, or if the mRNA transcript is defective. For example, most mRNA transcripts contain a stop codon, but some do not, and these non-stop mRNA transcripts result in a non-stop polypeptide that remains tethered to the ribosome. It is important that the cell identifies and removes these faulty polypeptides so as to leave the ribosome free to translate other (non-faulty) mRNA transcripts. A regulatory protein called ubiquitin is responsible for marking and sending proteins that are faulty, or are no longer needed by the cell, to a molecular machine called the proteasome, where they are degraded by a process called proteolysis. In 2010 researchers identified Ltn1 as the enzyme that attaches ubiquitin to non-stop proteins in yeast."

Verma et al. also show that the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is involved in other aspects of quality control of newly synthesized proteins within cells.

Depending upon the relative rate at which malfolded sequences that comprise degrons form and bind their Ub ligase receptors vs the rate at which translation is completed, ubiquitination and degradation of misfolding proteins may initiate on the ribosome. It has been shown, for instance, that the acetylated N-terminus recognized by the Ub ligase Doa10 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hwang et al., 2010</a>) is generated co-translationally (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gautschi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Polevoda et al., 2008</a>), and that the Ub ligase Ubr1 can initiate degradation of an N-end rule substrate prior to completion of its translation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Turner and Varshavsky, 2000</a>)."

This can occur because the mRNA is defective or the ribosome stalls due to either irresolvable structures in the mRNA or interactions between the nascent peptide and the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu and Deutsch, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kramer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). Defective mRNAs are recognized by a cytosolic mRNA surveillance machinery that mediates their destruction. There are at least three pathways: no-go decay (NGD) targets mRNAs with strong stalls in translation elongation leading to endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets messages containing premature termination codons (PTC), and non-stop decay (NSD) targets mRNAs that lack a stop codon. Within this broad scheme, there are many variations by which aberrant mRNAs are generated (<a href=\"#bib37\">Parker, 2012</a>). Interestingly, recent data suggest an intimate coupling between QC of defective mRNAs and the nascent peptides they produce (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</a>). For example, Upf1 is a positive effector of NMD that is also needed for proteasome-mediated degradation of the prematurely terminated products (<a href=\"#bib49\">Takahashi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kuroha et al., 2009</a>)."

Notably, the mRNA may be processed by multiple pathways (e.g., NSD and NGD) because absence of a stop codon can cause translation to stall either because the end of the message is encountered or polylysine encoded by the poly(A) tail interacts with the negatively charged exit tunnel of the ribosome. Non-stop mRNAs can arise naturally through premature termination or polyadenylation within ORFs, which are estimated to occur for up to 10% of all transcriptional events (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</a>). Proteins encoded by these messages could potentially impose a considerable burden on QC pathways. Thus, disposal of proteins produced from non-stop messages is likely to be of general significance to understanding human diseases that result from defects in protein homeostasis."

Dom34\u2013Hbs1 works in concert with a member of the ABC family of ATPases, known as ABCE1 in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pisareva et al., 2011</a>) or Rli1 in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shoemaker et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</a>), to disassemble stalled ribosomes for subsequent reuse. Additionally, the translational GTPase Ski7, which is closely related to Hbs1 (and thus to eRF3), has been proposed to recognize ribosomes stalled at the 3\u2032 end of non-stop messages (<a href=\"#bib53\">van Hoof et al., 2002</a>). However, no Dom34/eRF1-like molecule has been identified to date that can interact with Ski7 specifically so it remains unknown if it can promote recycling of ribosome subunits. Following dissociation of subunits, the mechanism by which the associated nascent peptide is extricated remains poorly understood. What has been shown so far is that the Ub ligase Ltn1 can bind the ribosome and ubiquitinate NSD substrates that contain a polylysine tract (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>). Ltn1 belongs to the RING domain family of E3 Ub ligases that ubiquitinate substrates targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Finley, 2009</a>). However, the mechanism by which the nascent non-stop peptide is released from the ribosome and degraded remains unknown. Nevertheless, the underlying biochemistry is likely to be important for human health, because point mutations in mouse Ltn1 result in neurodegeneration and a null allele is lethal (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chu et al., 2009</a>)."

Cdc48 has intrinsic Ub-binding affinity that is greatly enhanced by the binding of UBX domain proteins or the Ufd1\u2013Npl4 heterodimer to its N-terminus and Ufd2 to its C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ye, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>). Cdc48/p97 is widely believed to function as a \u2018segregase\u2019 that uses the free energy released upon ATP hydrolysis to remodel ubiquitinated substrate complexes, usually, but not always, as a prelude to their degradation by the 26S proteasome (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jentsch and Rumpf, 2007</a>). In the work reported here, we show that Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 promotes the release of tRNA-linked ubiquitinated nascent chains as well as aberrant non-stop and prematurely terminated polypeptides from the ribosome.

All mutants were insensitive to anisomycin, an inhibitor that blocks the peptidyl transferase reaction on ribosomes (not shown). However, low concentrations of hygromycin B and paromomycin inhibited growth of multiple <i>cdc48</i> mutants and the adaptor mutants <i>npl4-1, ufd1, ubx1\u0394, and ubx2\u0394</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> and data not shown).

Deletion of <i>LTN1</i> leads to hygromycin-sensitivity and since Ltn1 is involved in QC of NSD pathway substrates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>), we explored the possibility that Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 and one or more Ubx proteins also function in this pathway."

Coomassie blue staining of purified ribosomes confirmed that Cdc48 activity was not required for their assembly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, lane 3), a conclusion that was further validated by sucrose gradient fractionation of ribosomes from wildtype, <i>cdc48-3</i>, and <i>ufd1-2</i> whole cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, the mutants do appear to have a slightly lower ratio of polysomes:80S monosomes. Immunoblotting for Ub revealed strong accumulation of Ub conjugates on ribosomes affinity-purified from <i>cdc48-3</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To ascertain if the epitope tag on the ribosome subunit was exacerbating the effect of the <i>cdc48-3</i> mutation, we isolated ribosomes from untagged cells by pelleting through a sucrose cushion (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halbeisen and Gerber, 2009</a>). Again, Ub conjugates were observed to accumulate on ribosomes in <i>cdc48-3</i> and <i>npl4-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Because the proteolytic defects of <i>npl4-1</i> are manifested at the semi-permissive temperature of 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bays et al., 2001</a>), we carried out the experiment in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> at 30\u00b0C. The data indicate that <i>cdc48-3</i> does not have to be shifted to the fully non-permissive temperature to observe Ub conjugate accumulation at the ribosome. Additionally, conjugate accumulation on <i>cdc48-3</i> and <i>npl4-1</i> ribosomes exceeded that observed for ribosomes isolated from cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, a result that will be further discussed below."

Consistent with the idea that Cdc48 ATPase functions at the ribosome to mediate release of ubiquitinated nascent peptides, both Cdc48 and Ufd1 were found to cofractionate with affinity-purified ribosomes isolated under stringent conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Magnetic beads containing bound ribosomes from wildtype or <i>cdc48-3</i> cells were treated with TEV protease, which cleaves between Rpl18B and the TAP tag. The TEV cleavage was carried out in the presence or absence of puromycin. Puromycin causes premature termination of translation by binding in the A-site of the ribosome and reacting with peptidyl-tRNA in the P-site, yielding a peptide-puromycin conjugate (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nathans, 1964</a>). Thus, we expected that puromycin would induce the release of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome as a peptide-puromycin conjugate. The supernatants were then bound to UBA Sepharose resin to enrich for Ub conjugates. The rationale behind this step was that ribosome-associated Ub conjugates that remained bound to the ribosome would bind poorly to UBA beads because ribosomes do not efficiently penetrate the pores of a Sepharose resin, whereas Ub conjugates released from the ribosome by puromycin would be able to bind more efficiently to UBA beads. Puromycin treatment of ribosomes from <i>cdc48-3</i> but not wildtype cells released ubiquitinated proteins that were enriched on the UBA resin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, top panel). A similar result was obtained with ribosomes isolated from <i>npl4-1</i> and <i>ufd1-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The conjugates observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> were indeed linked to puromycin because they cross-reacted with an antibody specific for puromycin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, bottom panel). The same was true for Ub conjugates released from <i>npl4-1</i> and <i>ufd1-2</i> ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The fact that no Ub immunoreactivity was recovered from mutant ribosomes in the absence of puromycin treatment validated our assumption that the UBA resin largely excluded mega-complexes. This experiment also suggests that at least some of the Ub conjugates that accumulated on <i>cdc48</i> and <i>npl4</i> ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) must be ubiquitinated nascent proteins linked to tRNA."

Ribosomes were affinity-purified from cells sampled at different times of chase and treated with puromycin to release tRNA-linked nascent chains. This material was then fractionated on UBA resin to enrich for discharged Ub conjugates. Strikingly, ribosomes from both <i>cdc48-3</i> and <i>ufd1-2</i> cells contained far higher levels of radiolabeled high MW Ub conjugates than wildtype ribosomes, and a substantial portion of this signal persisted on ribosomes for 10\u201320 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), which is considerably longer than the time required to synthesize a protein. Importantly, the low signal on wildtype ribosomes was not due to inefficient incorporation, because the WT inputs for the UBA fractionation step actually contained slightly more total pulse-labeled species (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Taken together, the experiments described thus far indicate that Cdc48 and its cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4 prevent accumulation of ubiquitinated, tRNA-linked nascent chains on the ribosome. For simplicity, we hereafter refer to these species as tUNPs (<span class=\"underline\">t</span>RNA-linked, <span class=\"underline\">u</span>biquitinated <span class=\"underline\">n</span>ascent <span class=\"underline\">p</span>olypeptides). Notably, other Cdc48 cofactors including Ubx2, Ubx4, Ubx6, and Ufd2 did not appear to contribute to clearance of tUNPs from the ribosome (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These cofactors were tested because they had scored positively in the hygromycin-sensitivity assay whereas <i>ubx3\u0394</i>, <i>ubx5\u0394</i>, and <i>ubx7\u0394</i> were hygromycin-insensitive, and therefore not pursued further.

One possibility is a class of aberrant proteins arising from translation of mRNAs that lack stop codons (\u2018non-stop mRNA\u2019). Translation through the poly(A) tail of these mRNAs can result in a ribosome that stalls either because it reaches the end of the message, or the polylysine encoded by the poly(A) tail interacts with the negatively charged exit tunnel of the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dimitrova et al., 2009</a>). Prior work has demonstrated that the Ub ligase Ltn1 targets proteins translated from mRNAs that lack a stop codon or that contain polylysine stretches (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>). We therefore employed the puromycin release/UBA bead capture protocol to test whether deletion of <i>LTN1</i> diminished the accumulation of tUNPs on ribosomes in <i>cdc48-3</i> cells. We also tested the impact of <i>ubr1\u0394</i>, because of prior reports that Ubr1 promotes co-translational ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib52\">Turner and Varshavsky, 2000</a>), and because <i>ubr1\u0394</i> mutants, like <i>ltn1\u0394</i>, are hygromycin-sensitive (not shown, but see below). The data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> demonstrate that additional loss of <i>LTN1</i> or <i>UBR1</i> resulted in a marked decrease in the level of tUNPs on <i>cdc48-3</i> ribosomes. This result encouraged us to evaluate the steady state levels of the Gfp-FLAG-His3Non-Stop (GFH<sup>NS</sup>) fusion protein shown earlier to be an Ltn1 substrate at the ribosome that is degraded by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>). Amongst the Cdc48 pathway mutants examined, GFH<sup>NS</sup> accumulated maximally in <i>ufd1</i> mutants (similar to levels observed for <i>ltn1\u0394</i>), and also exhibited significant accumulation in <i>npl4-1</i> and <i>cdc48-3</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Cycloheximide chase analysis in <i>ufd1-2</i> cells indicated that accumulation resulted from stabilization of the non-stop reporter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). As observed in earlier studies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>), the same reporter containing a stop codon was not degraded and accumulated at a much higher level than the NS reporter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; amounts loaded were adjusted to yield signals of equal intensity at 0 min)."

Ribosomes isolated from cells with inhibited proteasomes contained far less tUNPs than ribosomes from <i>cdc48-3</i> and <i>npl4-1</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; the input lysates and ribosome pellets for this experiment are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

To determine if the role of Cdc48 is limited to the non-stop pathway or whether it plays a more global role in degradation of proteins encoded by aberrant messages, we also assessed the stability of endogenous phosphogluconate dehydrogenase truncated by a premature termination codon (Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup>) in the middle of a folded domain at residue 368. Over-produced Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> was shown to be a substrate of the Ubr1 cytosolic quality control pathway in a prior study (<a href=\"#bib18\">Heck et al., 2010</a>). The data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> confirmed stabilization of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> in <i>ubr1\u0394</i>. Notably, <i>cdc48-3</i> and <i>ufd1-2</i> mutations also stabilized Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup>, but <i>ltn1\u0394</i> was without effect (equivalent loading confirmed in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> was also stabilized in <i>upf1\u0394.</i> Upf1 is a RING domain Ub ligase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Takahashi et al., 2008</a>) that plays a crucial role in NMD and stimulates the degradation of aberrant PTC translation products (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kuroha et al., 2009</a>). The dependence of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> degradation on Cdc48 and Upf1 suggested that tRNA-linked Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> might become stuck on ribosomes, as observed for the non-stop reporters. To test this possibility we used the sucrose cushion method to isolate ribosomes from various mutants, and evaluated the ribosomal pellets for their content of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup>. Analysis of total cell lysates revealed strong accumulation of Gnd1<sup>PTC</sup> in <i>cdc48-3</i>, <i>ubr1\u0394</i>, and <i>upf1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

Some proteins encoded by non-stop mRNAs, including the reporter proteins used here (GFH<sup>NS</sup> and PrA<sup>NS</sup>), are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wilson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>). The Ub ligase Ltn1 binds 60S ribosomes and promotes ubiquitination of stalled GFH<sup>NS</sup> (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>). Our data suggest that Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 acts downstream of Ltn1 to promote release of the non-stop peptide from the ribosome, so that it can be degraded by the proteasome. How Ltn1 and the Cdc48 complex does this remains unknown. Indeed, this remains unknown for any NSD or NGD pathway substrate; the Dom34-Hbs1 complex lacks the residues necessary for hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond, and the two budding yeast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases, Pth1 and Pth2, are non-essential mitochondrial proteins whose transmembrane configurations are currently unknown (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rosas-Sandoval et al., 2002</a>). An interesting question for the future will be to determine whether Ltn1 and Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 act together with, or in a redundant pathway parallel to Ski7 or Dom34\u2013Hbs1-Rli1."

This interaction was highly specific, because Cdc48 and Ufd1 did not bind the same substrate when it was translated from a message that includes a stop codon. While this manuscript was in revision, it was reported that Cdc48, Ufd1, and Npl4 are components of the newly identified Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) complex, which also contains Ltn1, Rqc1 and Tae2 and associates with the 60S ribosomal subunit. The latter two proteins, like Ltn1 and Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4, are highly conserved and have mammalian homologs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>). Both Ltn1 and Rqc1 help link Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 to RQC. Rqc1 associates with and is required for the degradation of an Ltn1 substrate that contains an internal polyarginine sequence, but a functional role for Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 in RQC was not established by <a href=\"#bib4\">Brandman et al.

However, in <i>ltn1\u0394</i> cells, GFH<sup>NS</sup> accumulates on 80S monosomes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>). Likewise, we report here that tRNA-linked PrA<sup>NS</sup> appeared to be concentrated in monosomes in <i>ltn1\u0394</i>. By contrast, tRNA-linked PrA<sup>NS</sup> was spread more broadly across 60S and 80S fractions in extracts from <i>cdc48-3</i> cells. The different fractionation behavior of tRNA-linked PrA<sup>NS</sup> in <i>ltn1\u0394</i> and <i>cdc48</i> mutants may reflect leakiness of the <i>cdc48</i> mutation (the experiment was done at the semi-permissive temperature of 30\u00b0C) or Cdc48-independent ribosome splitting.

These tUNPs could potentially arise from multiple sources including misfolded domains (<a href=\"#bib52\">Turner and Varshavsky, 2000</a>), mRNAs whose transcription was prematurely terminated, mRNAs or nascent peptides containing sequences that cause ribosome pausing (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>) or mRNAs that encode premature termination codons (e.g., <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Thus it is perhaps not surprising that at least two Ub ligases (Ltn1 and Ubr1) contributed to their accumulation. In any event, we believe it is unlikely that there is a single pathway or mechanism for disposing of tUNPs. Even in the seemingly simple case of a ribosome that translates into the poly(A) tail of an mRNA that is prematurely polyadenylated within the coding sequence, the 3\u2032-most ribosome may be stalled because it reached the end of the message, or because polylysine encoded by the poly(A) tail bound the exit channel of the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ito-Harashima et al., 2007</a>). Because stalls in translation elongation lead to endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA upstream of the 3\u2032-most ribosome (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tsuboi et al., 2012</a>), each trailing ribosome will present a unique substrate to the UPS, and may be processed by a different mechanism."

An equal volume of glass beads (Sigma, St Louis, MO; 425\u2013600 \u03bcm, acid washed) was added and the cell pellets were immersed in boiling water for 3 min. They were then suspended in 1\u00d7 SDS buffer (37.5 \u00b5l/O.D. unit) and cells were lysed by vortexing in Fast Prep-24 (MP) for 45 s at a setting of 6.5, and boiled again for 4 min. Boiled lysates were centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 1 min. Aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE. In some instances, particularly when tRNA-linked substrate was being detected, washed cell pellets were brought up in 1\u00d7 SDS buffer containing 1\u00d7 Secure (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA), heated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min, lysed by glass beads as described above, and loaded on NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For immunoblot detection, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and filters were stained with Ponceau S to determine equivalent loading of protein extracts. If loading was not equivalent, the experiment was repeated. The nitrocellulose filters were immunoblotted with desired antibody and developed by ECL or Super Signal (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Exponential cultures were grown at either 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 1.5 hr before being harvested by filtration using 0.2 \u00b5m Nalgene filters. In some experiments 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide was added during filtration, and was omitted when no difference was observed in the experimental outcome. Cells were washed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM NEM, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were ground in liquid nitrogen.

The main conclusion is that the Cdc48 complex plays a role in disassembling tRNA-peptide-ubiquitin conjugates from the ribosome. Cdc48 has been previously characterized as a \u201cseggregase\u201d to remodel certain ubiquitinated substrate complexes prior to their proteasomal degradation, but these findings are relevant because they describe a new role for Cdc48 in ribosome-associated protein quality control pathways. All of the reviewers have credited the quality of the work but they also indicated that mechanistic understanding of this new pathway is missing. For example, no evidence is presented that the Cdc48 role in this process is direct and it remains possible that Cdc48 affects other aspects of the cell that indirectly lead to this phenotype. Further detailed analyses of the pathway and a better mechanistic understanding of the process are needed for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The main criticism of the original submission was that there was not sufficient mechanistic insight into how Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 promotes degradation of tUNCs and non-stop decay (NSD) pathway substrates that are translated from messages that lack a stop codon. In particular, we provided no evidence to indicate that the role of Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 in this process is direct. In a series of email and telephone discussions with the editors, we were advised that providing evidence to support a direct role for Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 in RAD might suffice to address the concern that the reviewers raised about mechanism. We have addressed this criticism by showing in the revised manuscript that Cdc48 and Ufd1 were associated specifically with stringently-washed, affinity-purified ribosomes (Figure 1D). We also show that Cdc48 and Ufd1 bound the NSD substrate GFH<sup>NS</sup>, but not the control GFH<sup>Stop</sup> (Figure 3E), despite the latter being present at much higher levels than the NS reporter."

                    "text": "One week prior to the submission of this revised manuscript, a paper was published by Jonathan Weissman's group (Brandman et. al. 2012 Cell 151, 1042-54; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178123\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178123</a>; doi:10.1016/j.cell.2012.10.044) that partially overlaps with our own work in a complementary manner. Weissman's group was studying the heat shock response in yeast, which is mediated by the transcription factor HSF1. This led them to discover the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) protein complex, which contains Rqc1, Tea2, Ltn1, Cdc48, Ufd1, and Npl4, as well as subunits of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Brandman et al show that Rqc1 and Ltn1 are required for association of Cdc48 with RQC, and hence they propose that Rqc1 and Ltn1 help recruit Cdc48 to the ribosome. Mutant <i>rqc1\u0394</i> cells accumulate a model substrate (GFP\u2013Arg12\u2013RFP) with an internal polybasic tract that is designed to mimic an NSD pathway substrate, and Rqc1 and Cdc48 are shown to co-immunoprecipitate with this substrate. Although Weissman and colleagues propose that Cdc48 is involved in degradation of RQC substrates, no evidence is provided that Cdc48, Ufd1, or Npl4 are required for RQC function. This leaves open several possible interpretations. As but one example, their data are also consistent with the possibility that Cdc48\u2013Ufd1\u2013Npl4 serves as a negative regulator of RQC that blocks RQC from targeting inappropriate substrates, thereby determining the specificity of RQC action. In that sense, the two papers provide a nice complement to each other \u2013 Brandman et al describe a mechanism for how Cdc48 is recruited to NSD pathway substrates, whereas our work establishes that Cdc48, Ufd1, and Npl4 are required to release these substrates from the ribosome so that they can be degraded by the proteasome. We have modified our Discussion to incorporate the findings of Brandman et al and how they relate to our own."
