Despite their importance, our knowledge of these two protein families is largely based on analysis of stabilized forms of the Aux/IAAs, and studies of a subgroup of ARFs that function as transcriptional activators. To understand how auxin regulates gene expression we generated a <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> line that completely lacks Aux/IAAs. Loss of the repressors causes massive changes in transcription with misregulation of over a third of the annotated genes. Further, we find that the <i>aux/iaa</i> mutant is blind to auxin indicating that auxin regulation of transcription occurs exclusively through Aux/IAA function. We used the <i>aux/iaa</i> mutant as a simplified platform for studies of ARF function and demonstrate that repressing ARFs regulate auxin-induced genes and fine-tune their expression. Further the repressing ARFs coordinate gene induction jointly with activating ARFs and the Aux/IAAs."

Despite their importance, our knowledge of these two protein families is largely based on analysis of stabilized forms of the Aux/IAAs, and studies of a subgroup of ARFs that function as transcriptional activators. To understand how auxin regulates gene expression we generated a <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> line that completely lacks Aux/IAAs. Loss of the repressors causes massive changes in transcription with misregulation of over a third of the annotated genes. Further, we find that the <i>aux/iaa</i> mutant is blind to auxin indicating that auxin regulation of transcription occurs exclusively through Aux/IAA function. We used the <i>aux/iaa</i> mutant as a simplified platform for studies of ARF function and demonstrate that repressing ARFs regulate auxin-induced genes and fine-tune their expression. Further the repressing ARFs coordinate gene induction jointly with activating ARFs and the Aux/IAAs."

These proteins normally act to keep genes switched off by interacting with another family of proteins called ARFs that can bind directly to the genes. Some ARFs activate genes, while others repress gene activity. In most plants, large families of genes encode Aux/IAA and ARF proteins and individual members often have overlapping roles, which makes it more difficult to study how they work."

The experiments show that the loss of all three Aux/IAA proteins results in the plants becoming completely insensitive to auxin. Furthermore, over a third of known moss genes had altered activity in the mutant plants compared to normal moss. These findings suggest that the Aux/IAA proteins have a bigger role in regulating the activities of genes than previously thought."

However, repression of gene activity by the ARFs is weaker than the effect of the Aux/IAAs. Unexpectedly, the loss of repressive ARFs causes moss plants to become less sensitive to auxin, which Lavy et al. suggest is due to the recruitment of additional Aux/IAA proteins to the genes. Thus these findings demonstrate that control of gene activity by auxin involves the coordinated action of both types of ARFs and the Aux/IAAs. Future challenges are to find out which genes directly bind ARFs and the Aux/IAAs, and to use computational approaches to create models of how auxin regulates gene activity in the moss."

Depending on the context, the cellular response to auxin can be very different, including changes in cell division, cell expansion, and differentiation. The hormone acts by regulating the transcription of auxin responsive genes. Strikingly, auxin-regulated gene sets can vary significantly between different cell types consistent with cell specific cellular responses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bargmann et al., 2013</a>). In the absence of auxin, transcription of auxin-regulated genes is repressed by members of a family of repressors called Auxin/INDOLE-3-ACETIC-ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins. The Aux/IAAs are recruited to promoters through an interaction with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors. Repression is relieved when auxin binds to a co-receptor complex consisting of a TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT 1/AUXIN F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) F-box protein and an Aux/IAA protein. The Aux/IAA protein is degraded, permitting ARF-dependent transcription to occur [(<a href=\"#bib7\">Calderon Villalobos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dharmasiri et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2007</a>) reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib47\">Salehin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang and Estelle, 2014</a>)]. The elucidation of the auxin co-receptor mechanism provided the molecular link between auxin perception at the cellular level and subsequent changes in gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which the interactions between TIR1/AFBs, ARFs and Aux/IAAs results in the induction of specific gene sets, as well as the establishment of gene regulatory networks, are not known."

Genetic studies of these genes have relied almost entirely on gain-of-function mutations in the degron motif (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prigge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mockaitis and Estelle, 2008</a>). These dominant mutations prevent interaction between the Aux/IAA and the TIR1/AFB co-receptors resulting in stabilization of the affected Aux/IAA and reduced sensitivity to auxin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Very few loss-of-function mutants have been described in flowering plants, presumably because of gene redundancy and a plant completely lacking the entire <i>Aux/IAA</i> family is not available. In a recent study, the single <i>Aux/IAA</i> gene in the early diverging Liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha)</i> was knocked down using an artificial microRNA(<a href=\"#bib17\">Flores-Sandoval et al., 2015</a>). The resulting lines were auxin hypersensitive. However, because these plants retained some auxin responsiveness, there are unlikely to be nulls. The genome of <i>P. patens</i> encodes only three <i>Aux/IAA</i> genes: <i>IAA1A, IAA1B</i>, and <i>IAA2</i>. To study the role of these genes in auxin response and plant development, and to simplify the study of auxin response mechanisms, we generated a mutant lacking all three genes. To generate the triple mutant, we replaced the <i>IAA1B</i> coding region with a \u03b2<i>-glucuronidase (GUS</i>) marker gene, followed by deletion of the <i>IAA1A</i> and <i>IAA2</i> coding regions (<i>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS aux/iaa\u0394</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because expression of the <i>IAA1B</i> gene is induced by auxin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lavy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prigge et al., 2010</a>), we could use the <i>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS</i> gene as an auxin reporter. Following auxin treatment, very low levels of GUS staining was detected in the <i>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS</i> line, whereas GUS staining was high in the <i>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS aux/iaa\u0394</i> line both in the absence and presence of applied auxin, indicating that this line displays a constitutive auxin response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Phylogenetic analyses reported that the <i>P. patens</i> ARF protein family consists of three clades (<a href=\"#bib43\">Plavskin and Timmermans, 2012</a>) shared between all land plants and a fourth, non-seed-plant-specific clade characterized by the lack of the DNA binding domain [(<a href=\"#bib41\">Paponov et al., 2009</a>), <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>]. One of the clades, comprising four proteins, groups with Arabidopsis repressing ARFs, whereas another clade, comprising seven ARF proteins, groups with Arabidopsis activating ARFs. The <i>M. polymorpha</i> ARF proteins were recently shown to affect transcription in a transient expression assay in accordance with their phylogenetic classification (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kato et al., 2015</a>) strongly suggesting that ARF function is conserved in land plants. Furthermore, in <i>P. patens</i>, higher levels of putative repressing ARFs resulted in decreased auxin response (<a href=\"#bib42\">Plavskin et al., 2016</a>). We selected <i>ARFb4</i> as a representative repressing ARF, and overexpressed an ARFb4 c-Myc fusion in the <i>aux/iaa\u0394</i> mutant background (<i>ARFb4OE_aux/iaa\u0394</i>). We found that overexpression of ARFb4 suppressed the constitutive auxin phenotype of the <i>aux/iaa\u0394</i> mutant including the formation of green chloronemal-like filaments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In fact, in a high expressing transgenic line (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> #1 and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), the phenotype was quite similar to that of dominant auxin-resistant <i>aux/iaa</i> mutants [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a> and (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prigge et al., 2010</a>)]. This result demonstrates that repressing ARFs do function as repressors in plants and that this activity does not require the Aux/IAAs. It is worth noting that ARFb4, as well ARFb2 and ARFb3 do not contain any of the known motifs that are thought to recruit TPL and therefore may not affect chromatin remodeling directly. To define the mechanism underlying the suppression of the <i>aux/iaa\u0394</i> phenotype we assessed the expression of the <i>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS</i> marker and other auxin-responsive genes. The GUS marker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), as well as the additional reporter genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) had dramatically lower expression levels compared to the <i>aux/iaa\u0394</i> mutant indicating that activating ARFs and the repressing ARFs can affect, either directly or indirectly the same target genes. Further, the auxin response genes did not respond to auxin in the <i>ARFb4OE_aux/iaa\u0394</i> line confirming that overexpression of the repressing ARF converted the constitutive auxin response line to an auxin resistant line. Overexpression of Arabidopsis ARF1 resulted in similar effects, indicating that the role of repressing ARFs is conserved between <i>P. patens</i> and Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Following dexamethasone (DEX) treatment these lines developed gametophores with ectopic rhizoids indicative of auxin hypersensitivity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

                                "text": "Our results demonstrate that both the repressing ARFs and Aux/IAAs are capable of gene repression, albeit to different extents. To learn more about these two types of repression, we determined the effects of loss of repressing ARFs either in the presence or absence of the <i>Aux/IAAs</i>. The coding regions of <i>ARFb2</i> and <i>ARFb4</i> were deleted in WT as well as in the <i>iaa1b iaa2\u0394</i> double and <i>aux/iaa\u0394</i> triple mutants (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The loss of <i>ARFb2</i> and <i>ARFb4</i> in the <i>aux/iaa\u0394</i> line (<i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394\u00a0aux/iaa\u0394</i>) did not result in any morphological changes or a clear trend with respect to changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Conversely and surprisingly, the <i>arfb2 arfb4</i> knockout in both the WT and the <i>iaa1b iaa2\u0394</i> double mutant (<i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394 and arfb2 arfb4\u0394\u00a0iaa1b iaa2\u0394</i>, respectively) resulted in lower expression levels of some of the upregulated auxin responsive genes, and higher levels of downregulated genes compared to their backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Although the expression of these genes in both untreated and auxin-treated <i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394</i> plants was reduced, the fold change was either similar or even higher compared to the WT and <i>iaa1b iaa2\u0394</i> backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <i>RSL4</i>: 7\u20133 fold higher and <i>Dox</i>: 2\u20131.4, respectively). Phenotypic analysis of the <i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394</i> revealed developmental defects including shorter filaments and fewer leafy gametophores consistent with reduced auxin response (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These findings further support our hypothesis that repressing ARFs can affect the same genes as activating ARFs. However, they revealed an unexpected trend in which the loss of repressing ARFs affects transcription in the same direction as their overexpression. To further confirm these contradictory results we also used transient RNAi (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bezanilla et al., 2005</a>) targeting the four repressing ARFs (<i>arfb1-4</i>). The RNAi construct was expressed in a transgenic plant expressing the synthetic auxin-responsive reporter <i>DR5:DsRED</i>. In agreement with the analysis of the <i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394</i> stable lines the resulting transformants displayed a lower expression level of the <i>DR5:DsRED</i> reporter compared to the control plants when treated with auxin, indicative of reduced auxin sensitivity of the <i>arfb1-4</i> RNAi knockdown lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

The expression level of an auxin responsive gene is determined by the interplay between the Aux/IAAs, the repressing ARFs, and the activating ARFs. At low auxin levels the Aux/IAAs provide stringent repression. At high auxin levels, the Aux/IAAs are degraded resulting in increased transcription through the action of the activating ARFs. The repressing ARFs act to buffer gene expression by attenuating the activity of the activating ARFs. The interplay between the three protein groups results in a wide range of gene expression levels that contribute to a dynamic and context specific auxin response."

However, this possibility does not appear to explain the phenotype of <i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394</i> lines, as the transcript levels of <i>IAA1A</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>-<i>IAA1A</i>) are low. Alternatively, it is possible that both activating and repressing ARFs as well as the Aux/IAAs jointly coordinate gene induction. This hypothesis is consistent with our analysis of the <i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394</i> lines. In the presence of the Aux/IAAs, loss of ARFB2 and ARFB4 results in reduced auxin response. However, this effect is suppressed by the deletion of the <i>Aux/IAA</i> genes in the <i>arfb2 arfb4\u0394 aux/iaa\u0394</i> line (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> compared to <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Since the activating and repressing ARFs can target the same genes, loss of the repressing ARFs may result in increased levels of activating ARFs on the auxin-responsive promoters. This may have the unexpected effect of recruiting more Aux/IAA repressors to these promoters. To test this idea we overexpressed the activating ARFa8, in WT plants (<i>ARFa8OE</i>). The resulting lines displayed a phenotype characteristic of auxin-resistant plants and exhibited reduced expression of auxin responsive genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), which supports our hypothesis. Collectively, our results support a model in which repressing ARFs can affect the occupancy of activating ARFs and Aux/IAAs on auxin responsive promoters. These interactions may provide buffering capacity that allows fine-scale regulation of auxin responsive genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

The Aux/IAA proteins have a central role in auxin signaling, serving as both auxin co-receptors and transcriptional repressors. However, genetic analysis of these genes has been limited in flowering plants because of genetic redundancy. By deleting all three <i>Aux/IAAs</i> in moss we have determined the effects of the complete absence of Aux/IAA function on plant growth and auxin response. Remarkably, we found that the Aux/IAAs have a broad impact on the expression levels of a great number of genes, the majority of which do not respond to auxin treatment of moss protonemata. Thus our analysis demonstrates that existing transcriptomic studies conducted in flowering plants may significantly underestimate the effects of auxin on the genome and illustrates the central role\u00a0of the TIR-Aux/IAA pathway on plant growth and development. While our work highlights the remarkably broad impact of the Aux/IAA proteins on gene expression, it also demonstrates an absolute requirement for the Aux/IAAs in auxin-responsive transcription. Some auxin-mediated signaling pathways have been proposed to affect transcription independently of the TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA signaling cascade. These include a negative role of Mitogen-Activating Protein Kinase (MAPK) activity on auxin-regulated genes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2009</a>), and the effect of the F-box protein SKP2A on the stability of cell division transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jurado et al., 2010</a>). Our findings indicate that at least in moss, any possible effect of these pathways on auxin-regulated transcription requires Aux/IAAs\u2019 function."

Our mutant analyses reveal that the transition from chloronema to caulonema is regulated by a dynamic balance of quantitative auxin responses. When auxin response is low, as in the auxin-resistant mutants, protonema growth is not accompanied by developmental transition to the caulonemal stage. In contrast, a constitutive auxin response, as exhibited by the <i>aux/iaa\u0394</i> mutant, results in rapid and abnormal maturation."

Structural studies of Arabidopsis ARF1 and ARF5 revealed that both classes of ARF can potentially bind to similar cis elements and form high order oligomers of ARFs and Aux/IAAs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Korasick et al., 2014</a>). Our work provides experimental evidence that auxin responsive genes are targeted by both repressing and activating ARFs, which in turn coordinate their levels of expression. The structural studies as well as our results can support two models of ARF activity. Repressing and activating ARFs can either compete on the same binding sites or cooperatively induce transcription by forming heterodimers. Despite its classification as an activating ARF, the Arabidopsis ARF5 was shown to repress some of its identified gene targets (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>). Given that ARF transcription factors may display opposing roles in different contexts, ARF activity can result in a very complex gene expression pattern. These mechanisms, by which different ARFs coordinate transcriptional responses, can explain the broad effect of auxin on gene expression and the complexity of the resulting transcriptional networks as each gene can display a wide range of expression levels. Recent studies in liverwort support this hypothesis. The <i>M. polymorpha</i> encodes only one Aux/IAA and one member of each ancient ARF clade yet these transcription factors are sufficient to pattern a complete body plan (<a href=\"#bib17\">Flores-Sandoval et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kato et al., 2015</a>)."

For some repressing ARFs, the presence of an EAR domain suggests that repression could involve recruitment of the TPL co-repressor. However, many repressing ARFs, including PpARFb2, PpARFb4, and AtARF1 used in this work do not have this motif. We show that repression provided by these repressing ARFs is weaker compared to the repressing effect of the Aux/IAAs. Based on this observation, we suggest that repressing ARFs may fine-tune gene expression. The Aux/IAAs repress gene expression through interactions with co-repressors such as TPL and the subsequent recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kagale and Rozwadowski, 2011</a>). This may provide stable and long term repression when auxin levels are low. In contrast, when auxin levels are high and/or when auxin response needs to be dynamic, the repressing ARFs may provide a less stable repression that fine-tunes auxin response in the absence of the Aux/IAAs. The fact that the repressing <i>ARF</i> genes are induced by auxin and therefore constitute a negative feedback module is consistent with this idea."

While we have some knowledge of how light affects auxin synthesis and distribution, the effects on auxin transcriptional responses are less known. In moss, the interplay between light, auxin, and growth has been implicated in the transition from chlronema to caulonema. In addition to auxin, light intensity and the availability of nutrients affect the transition from one cell type to the other. High light and glucose triggers caulonema formation while low light inhibits caulonemal growth and stimulates chloronemal branching (<a href=\"#bib52\">Thelander et al., 2005</a>). These observations suggest that favorable conditions promote the differentiation of elongated caulonemal cells, whereas low energy conditions promote the formation of chloroplast-rich chloronemal cells thus increasing photosynthetic capacity and energy production. We found that the auxin downregulated gene set is dominated by genes involved in photoperception and carbon fixation. This finding establishes the molecular basis for auxin signaling in response to light stimuli and suggests that auxin may function as a molecular switch between energy production and growth."

I believe this does not really mean that these genes are directly regulated by the AUX/IAA-ARF system. Presumably, many of those differences could arise as secondary effects, for instance because after all, the protonema grown from wild type and mutant is not that similar morphologically as well as physiologically. Differences could also be amplified by the phenotypic variation the authors describe. So I believe they have to be more careful in their claims."

By studying a plant lacking all Aux/IAA function, the authors show the impact of auxin response on the genome, which turns out to be very large. This, in itself is a very important finding. Next, by functionally studying several ARFs, the authors come up with a model of gene regulation by functionally distinct ARF types. The manuscript is generally of good quality and will have major impact in the field. There are however a number of rough edges and lacking controls, as well as leaps of logic that I would like to see addressed."

Yet another interpretation is that the distinction between the function of activating and repressing ARFs is not strict, and the ARF2 and ARF4 also contribute to gene activation. Similarly, ARF5 in <i>Arabidopsis</i> has been shown to repress certain target genes (ARR7, ARR15 and STOMAGEN). I would ask the authors to discuss this and consider multiple interpretations."

However, a lot of time has passed since <i>Physcomitrella</i> and the precursor of <i>Arabidopsis</i> diverged. The authors seem to rule out the possibility that functions have changed in the past few 100's of millions of years. I would suggest that the assumptions about being activators or repressors are tested according to standard assays (using synthetic promoter in a protoplast assay), at least for the ARFs used here (ARFb2, b4, a8)."

The authors find a large number of gene expression differences in the aux/iaa mutant, with ca. 80% of those genes not being auxin-responsive in wild type. I believe this does not really mean that these genes are directly regulated by the AUX/IAA-ARF system. Presumably, many of those differences could arise as secondary effects, for instance because after all, the protonema grown from wild type and mutant is not that similar morphologically as well as physiologically. Differences could also be amplified by the phenotypic variation the authors describe. So I believe they have to be more careful in their claims.</i>"

Little is known about the evolution of auxin signaling, or its ancestral role, and this manuscript fills in many gaps. By studying a plant lacking all Aux/IAA function, the authors show the impact of auxin response on the genome, which turns out to be very large. This, in itself is a very important finding. Next, by functionally studying several ARFs, the authors come up with a model of gene regulation by functionally distinct ARF types. The manuscript is generally of good quality and will have major impact in the field. There are however a number of rough edges and lacking controls, as well as leaps of logic that I would like to see addressed. 1) The transcriptome shows large effects of Aux/IAA deletion on gene expression. However, the analysis was done in 7-day old protonema, which allows for numerous layers of secondary effects. While this is not necessarily a problem, it becomes difficult when the authors use this approach to support their claim that \"activating and repressing ARFs share target genes\". To make such a strong and direct statement, other types of support are necessary, such as for example EMSA or ChIP.</i>"

Yet another interpretation is that the distinction between the function of activating and repressing ARFs is not strict, and the ARF2 and ARF4 also contribute to gene activation. Similarly, ARF5 in Arabidopsis has been shown to repress certain target genes (ARR7, ARR15 and STOMAGEN). I would ask the authors to discuss this and consider multiple interpretations.</i>"

The authors seem to rule out the possibility that functions have changed in the past few 100's of millions of years. I would suggest that the assumptions about being activators or repressors are tested according to standard assays (using synthetic promoter in a protoplast assay), at least for the ARFs used here (ARFb2, b4, a8).</i>"
