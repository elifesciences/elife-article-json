We hypothesize that the respiratory rhythm central pattern generator (CPG) in mammals is comprised of two oscillators (<a href=\"#bib9\">Feldman et al., 2013</a>): inspiratory rhythm originates in the preB\u00f6tzinger Complex (preB\u00f6tC) in the ventrolateral medulla (<a href=\"#bib45\">Smith et al., 1991</a>) and active expiratory rhythm originates in the rostral medulla ventrolaterally adjacent to the facial nucleus (parafacial lateral region; pF<sub>L</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pagliardini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huckstepp et al., 2015</a>)."

As metabolic demand increases, e.g., during exercise, the pF<sub>L</sub> appears to turn on to produce active expiration. Thus, while breathing is a unified act of inspiratory and expiratory airflow, we postulate this behavior results from the coordinated interaction of two anatomically and functionally distinct oscillators (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mellen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pagliardini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huckstepp et al., 2015</a>). To understand the generation and control of respiration we need to determine how these two oscillators interact. For example, in adult rats the preB\u00f6tC can generate inspiratory rhythm while the pF<sub>L</sub> is quiescent (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pagliardini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huckstepp et al., 2015</a>).

We bilaterally transfected the preB\u00f6tC with the G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled allatostatin receptors (AlstR), which when activated by allatostatin (Alst) silences transfected preB\u00f6tC neurons (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tan et al., 2008</a>). In the same rats, we bilaterally transfected the pF<sub>L</sub> with the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled HM<sub>3</sub>D DREADD receptor (HM<sub>3</sub>DR) that when activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) depolarizes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Armbruster et al., 2007</a>) transfected pF<sub>L</sub> neurons. We slowed respiration in a controlled manner by titrating the dose of Alst applied to the AlstR-transfected preB\u00f6tC, allowing us to examine the dynamics of this presumptive coupled oscillator system as we shifted the balance of activity from the preB\u00f6tC to the pF<sub>L</sub>. Depressing preB\u00f6tC activity resulted in quantal slowing of breathing, similar to slowing of breathing following opiate depression of preB\u00f6tC activity <i>in vitro</i> and in juvenile rats (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mellen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</a>). As preB\u00f6tC activity waned, burstlets appeared on inspiratory muscle electromyograms (EMGs) and in airflow, consistent with our postulate that burstlets, not bursts, in the preB\u00f6tC are rhythmogenic (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kam et al., 2013</a>). In complementary experiments, we applied CNO to the HM<sub>3</sub>DR transfected pF<sub>L</sub> to activate this normally quiescent oscillator. We confirmed that pF<sub>L</sub> activation initiates active expiration (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pagliardini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huckstepp et al., 2015</a>). By combining these protocols, i.e., silencing the preB\u00f6tC while simultaneously driving the pF<sub>L</sub>, we removed some confounding factors from these initial experiments. Importantly, we found that active expiration could not be induced when preB\u00f6tC inspiratory driven motor activity was suppressed and chemosensory drive was absent, indicating that in adult rats active expiration is driven by the pF<sub>L</sub> but requires an additional source of network excitation such as ongoing preB\u00f6tC activity or chemosensory drive.

In histological sections the preB\u00f6tC is defined as the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) dense area ventral to the semi-compact nucleus ambiguous (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) and the pF<sub>L</sub> is defined as the area ventral to the lateral edge of the facial nucleus, juxtaposed to the spinal trigeminal tract (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huckstepp et al., 2015</a>). In representative 40 \u00b5m sections: from preB\u00f6tC injection sites, 161 \u00b1 42, representing 82 \u00b1 6%, neurons expressed GFP (n=3); from pF<sub>L</sub> injection sites, 112 \u00b1 31, representing 81 \u00b1 3%, neurons expressed mCitrine (n=3). Transfection sites ranged from ~350\u2013600 \u00b5m in diameter. As the responses to Alst and CNO did not differ between the largest and smallest injections sites, the effects of receptor activation were due to silencing or driving of the preB\u00f6tC and pF<sub>L</sub> respectively and not to spread of virus to neighboring regions. We found no labeling of neurons in regions of the medulla other than within the injection sites (data not shown). In particular, we found no fluorescent reporters, i.e., eGFP or mCitrine, in the B\u00f6tzinger complex (B\u00f6tC; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>)."

                                "text": "The preB\u00f6tC can generate inspiratory rhythm while the pF<sub>L</sub> is quiescent (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pagliardini et al., 2011</a>). Can the pF<sub>L</sub>\u00a0generate a respiratory rhythm when the preB\u00f6tC is quiescent? If active expiration is independent of inspiratory activity, then active expiration driven by activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs in pF<sub>L</sub> should persist after cessation of inspiratory activity resulting from injection of Alst in the\u00a0preB\u00f6tC. In anesthetized adult rats with an active expiratory breathing pattern induced by CNO, injection of Alst into the\u00a0preB\u00f6tC led to a significant decrease in respiratory activity (n=8; p=0.008 for all variables; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), ultimately resulting in apnea, with no rhythmicity in V<sub>T</sub>, \u222bDia<sub>EMG</sub>, \u222bGG<sub>EMG</sub>, and \u222bAbd<sub>EMG</sub>. After rhythmic inspiratory activity ceased, \u222bAbd<sub>EMG</sub> continued tonically for a short duration (15 <span class=\"small-caps\">iqr</span> 12 s; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,Bii</a>) before disappearing, which was not different from the duration of tonic \u222bAbd<sub>EMG</sub> following the onset of apnea in the absence of CNO (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Biii</a>; p=0.7). When inspiratory activity stopped, rats were severely hypercapnic (ETCO<sub>2</sub> 64.6 <span class=\"small-caps\">iqr</span> 14.5\u2009mm Hg; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Bii</a>), this was not different from the hypercapnia at the onset of apnea in the absence of CNO (ETCO<sub>2</sub> 57.8 <span class=\"small-caps\">iqr</span> 22.3 mm Hg; p=0.8). Rats were mechanically ventilated to restore CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> levels to within the normal range (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). To assess the state of the respiratory CPG the mechanical ventilator was intermittently turned off. Shortly after allatostatin injections into the preB\u00f6tC, no respiratory activity was seen following cessation of mechanical ventilation, and rats were placed back on the ventilator. As the time from allatostatin injection in the preB\u00f6tC increased, removal from the ventilator led to brief periods of spontaneous breathing. When spontaneous breathing occurred, the return of inspiratory activity always preceded the return of expiratory abdominal activity; active expiration did not return until V<sub>T</sub> reached 3.2 <span class=\"small-caps\">iqr</span> 1.7 mL, \u222bDia<sub>EMG</sub> reached 13.1 <span class=\"small-caps\">iqr</span> 8.2 a.u., and \u222bGG<sub>EMG</sub> reached 5.2 <span class=\"small-caps\">iqr</span> 4.2 a.u. (n=8; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). That is, at low levels of reinitiated inspiratory activity there was no active expiration, which appeared only after inspiratory activity reached a higher value. If rats were able to spontaneously breathe without ventilation, they were allowed to do so. However, most early periods of spontaneous breathing deteriorated, and when rats became apneic again they were re-ventilated; in 5 of 6 rats spontaneous breathing occurred during ventilation, and in the remaining rat, spontaneous breathing following removal from the ventilator was sustained. When spontaneous breathing occurred during ventilation the return of inspiratory activity always preceded the return of expiratory abdominal activity. Therefore, following silencing of the preB\u00f6tC with Alst in the presence of CNO to drive the pF<sub>L</sub>,\u00a0at no time during the re-initiation of spontaneous breathing, either with or without mechanical ventilation, did active expiration occur in the absence of inspiratory activity and chemosensory drive."

However opsins can rapidly (&gt;seconds) desensitize and their activation requires placement of optic fibers to illuminate each transfected area, a particularly challenging problem for four regions in the brainstem. Therefore, we chose a pharmacogenetic approach to excite the pF<sub>L</sub> by activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs and inhibit the preB\u00f6tC by activation of AlstRs. This way we were able to switch neurons in these regions on or off over a period of minutes by application of CNO to the ventral surface of the medulla, and careful titration of the dose and infusion rate of Alst injected into the preB\u00f6tC."

Hypoxia and hypercapnia can themselves induce active expiration (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iizuka and Fregosi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huckstepp et al., 2015</a>), whether changes in blood gases are sensed by pF<sub>L</sub> neurons, or by neurons driving the pF<sub>L</sub>, remains to be determined. In either case, active expiration could have been due to increased hypoxic and/or hypercapnic drive to the pF<sub>L</sub> as inspiratory movements waned (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9Dii</a>). Alternatively, active expiration could be due to disinhibition of a conditional expiratory oscillator resulting from a loss of (presumptive) inhibitory preB\u00f6tC drive (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kuwana et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Morgado-Valle et al., 2010</a>) to the pF<sub>L</sub> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9Dii</a>). Subsequently, when inspiratory motor outflow disappeared and hypercapnia and hypoxia inexorably increased, active expiration ceased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9Div</a>, see also <a href=\"#bib49\">Tan et al., 2008</a>), perhaps due to the inhibitory effect of severe hypoxia on expiratory motor output (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sears et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fregosi et al., 1987</a>). At normal blood gas levels, active expiration may be seen in the absence of inspiratory motor activity resulting from lung inflation, e.g., in juvenile rat (<a href=\"#bib19\">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Nonetheless, from the data presented here in the adult rat, we conclude a necessary role of preB\u00f6tC excitatory drive in generating active expiration in normal breathing (discussed further below)."

We suggest, like Sears <i>et al</i>, that near the transition from eupnea to apnea, expiratory activity is phasic due to periodic inhibition of tonic activity during inspiration, and becomes tonic once the phasic inspiratory inhibition is lost (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2Bii\u2013iii</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7Bii</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9Diii</a>).

Following apnea during ventilation to maintain blood gases, when pF<sub>L</sub> neurons were excited by activation of HM<sub>3</sub>DRs there were three phases to the re-initiation of breathing. Initially, soon after silencing the preB\u00f6tC, no inspiratory or expiratory activity was seen, even in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Next, presumably as the effect of Alst on preB\u00f6tC neurons was waning, no inspiratory or expiratory activity was seen during ventilation, but spontaneous breathing was present upon removal from the ventilator. Here, spontaneous breathing was likely due to increased chemosensory drive to the preB\u00f6tC overcoming the waning hyperpolarizing effect of the Alst on preB\u00f6tC neurons. Ultimately, as spontaneous breathing continued and chemosensory drive diminished, rats would once again become apneic and require mechanical ventilation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). During this phase, upon removal from the ventilator, \u222bAbd<sub>EMG</sub> did not return until inspiratory motor, and presumably preB\u00f6tC, activity reached a threshold level (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). Finally, spontaneous breathing occurred during ventilation, once the effect of Alst on preB\u00f6tC neurons had worn off (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). During this phase, inspiratory activity on the GG<sub>EMG</sub> and Dia<sub>EMG</sub> always returned before Abd<sub>EMG</sub> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). At no time during mechanical ventilation, or during the periods where rats were <i>briefly</i> removed from the ventilator, did active expiration occur in the absence of inspiration. As blood gases were normal (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), the loss of expiratory activity is unlikely to be due to excessive hypoxia or hypercapnia. Thus there appears to be a minimum level of respiratory network excitability required for active expiration. In the absence of preB\u00f6tC activity, this network excitability may be provided by chemosensory drive, accounting for the \u222bAbd<sub>EMG</sub> activity seen shortly before the onset of apnea. However following recovery from apnea the increase in network excitability is provided by the preB\u00f6tC either directly through its extensive excitatory projections throughout the respiratory network (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2010</a>), e.g., the pF<sub>V</sub> that can modulate expiratory activity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Marina et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Huckstepp et al., 2015</a>), or indirectly when V<sub>T</sub> became large enough to induce mechanosensory feedback (that can provide expiratory drive,\u00a0e.g., <a href=\"#bib40\">Remmers, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Davies and Roumy, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</a>)."

By independently altering the excitability of two anatomically and functionally separate respiratory oscillators, we have uncovered a fundamental interaction and further delineated their role within the breathing CPG. We conclude that though respiration results from the interaction of two distinct oscillators, the preB\u00f6tC (inspiration) and the pF<sub>L</sub> (expiration) are not organized as symmetrical half centers. Instead in the adult rat, the preB\u00f6tC is the dominant oscillator and the pF<sub>L</sub> is the subsidiary conditional oscillator that is normally suppressed at rest; whereas the preB\u00f6tC can drive breathing alone, the pF<sub>L</sub>\ufeff\u00a0is unable to drive breathing (including active expiration) in the absence of an additional form of network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preB\u00f6tC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive when changes in blood gases are below the threshold where hypoxia is sufficient to inhibit abdominal muscle recruitment. This hierarchy is established by the sensitivity of the system to each oscillator, even when preB\u00f6tC drive is low, it is able to drive inspiratory bursts and inhibit expiration, whereas even when pF<sub>L</sub> drive is high, it requires a certain amount of network excitability from other sources to drive expiratory activity. This asymmetrical organization may be relevant to other neural networks that contain hierarchically organized coupled oscillators for pattern generation, such as may underlie the asymmetrical acts of flexion and extension in locomotion (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grillner, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Talpalar et al., 2013</a>). The interactions of the preB\u00f6tC and pF<sub>L</sub> change with development and maturation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), and with state, represent another layer of complexity in understanding the neural control of breathing."

The trachea was cannulated, and respiratory flow was monitored via a flow head (GM Instruments,\u00a0UK). A capnograph (Type 340: Harvard Apparatus,\u00a0Holliston, MA) was connected to the tracheal tube to monitor expired CO<sub>2</sub>, as a proxy of blood gases homeostasis. Paired electromyographic (EMG) wires (Cooner Wire Co,\u00a0Chatsworth, CA) were inserted into genioglossal (GG), diaphragmatic (Dia), and oblique abdominal muscles (Abd). Anterior neck muscles were removed, a basiooccipital craniotomy exposed the ventral medullary surface, and the dura was resected. A bilateral vagotomy was performed to remove confounding factors such as feedback from lung stretch receptors that can drive abdominal activity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</a>), after which exposed tissue around the neck and mylohyoid muscle were covered with dental putty (Reprosil; Dentsply Caulk,\u00a0Milford, DE) to prevent drying. As micturition is inhibited under anesthesia, rats bladders were expressed preceding and during the experiment to remove any risk of autonomic dysreflexia from bladder distension; to maintain fluid balance rats were given an IP injection of saline every time the bladder was expressed. Rats were left for 30 min for breathing to stabilize. At rest, spontaneous breathing consisted of alternating active inspiration and passive expiration. From a ventral approach allatostatin (Alst; 10\u2009\u03bcM; ~100-200\u00a0nL; Antagene Inc,\u00a0Sunnyvale, CA) in sterile saline was injected bilaterally into the preB\u00f6tC to hyperpolarize neurons transfected by AlstRs.

Small adjustments were made to avoid puncturing blood vessels. Rats were ventilated for the duration of ensuing apnea. After breathing stabilized, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 90 \u00b5M; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\u00a0Dallas,\u00a0TX) in sterile saline was applied to the ventral medullary surface to depolarize pF<sub>L</sub> neurons transfected with HM<sub>3</sub>DRs. Once breathing stabilized, rats received a second set of bilateral injections of Alst. Though rats were ventilated with room air for the duration of ensuing apnea, they were intermittently removed from the ventilator to assess spontaneous breathing, and drives to inspiration and expiration. Ventilation depths and speed were chosen to match end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> to that when the rat was spontaneously breathing room air. Once rats were spontaneously breathing and no longer required ventilation, CNO was removed from the ventral surface of the medulla and the medulla was washed in PBS. All 8 rats underwent the entire procedure, i.e., there were 8 biological replicates, and were only exposed to each condition once, i.e., there were no technical replicates. In age-matched rats not transfected with AlstR- or HM<sub>3</sub>DR-expressing AAVs, we injected Alst into the preB\u00f6tC or applied CNO to the medullary surface to see if these protocols produced non-specific effects All 8 rats underwent the entire procedure, i.e., there were 8 biological replicates, and were only exposed to each condition once, i.e., there were no technical replicates."

High pass filtered (&gt;0.1\u2009Hz) flow head measurements were used to calculate: tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>, peak amplitude of the integrated airflow signal during inspiration, converted to mL by comparison to calibration with a 3\u2009mL syringe), inspiratory duration (T<sub>I</sub>, beginning of inspiration until peak V<sub>T</sub>), expiratory duration (T<sub>E</sub>, peak V<sub>T</sub> to the beginning of the next inspiration), and <i>f</i> (1/[T<sub>I</sub>+T<sub>E</sub>]). EMG data, expressed in arbitrary units (A.U.), were integrated (\u03c4=0.05\u2009s; \u222bDia<sub>EMG</sub>, \u222bGG<sub>EMG</sub>, and \u222bAbd<sub>EMG</sub>) and peak amplitude of each signal was computed for each cycle.

After Alst, measurements were taken at 2 time points: i) 20 cycles were averaged where only partial effects were seen, and; ii) 20 points were averaged following apnea. After CNO, 20 cycles were averaged after breathing had stabilized. After Alst in the presence of CNO, 20 points were averaged following apnea. In the presence or absence of CNO, capnograph peaks were averaged for 10 cycles preceding Alst, and for 5\u201310 cycles preceding apnea.

Recorded data were not normally distributed, and were therefore analyzed using non-parametric statistical test, and reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). Statistical tests performed in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics), are 2-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with a significance level of p\u22640.05. Data are displayed as box and whisker plots for comparison of groups, and as line graphs for individual experiments. Kernel density estimations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Parzen, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Epanechnikov, 1969</a>), were used to determine the distribution of respiratory periods. After calculating the optimal bandwidth, i.e., bin size (<a href=\"#bib36\">Park and Marron, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sheather and Jones, 1991</a>), the data was smoothed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 1994</a>) and plotted. The modality of kernel density plots, were used to assess baseline respiratory periods and whether breathing slowed by quantal integers of that baseline. Bandwidth selection, data smoothing, and kernel density plots were performed in Microsoft excel\u00a0(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) using an add-in written by the royal society of chemistry (<a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/Analytical/AMC/Software/kerneldensities.asp\">http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/Analytical/AMC/Software/kerneldensities.asp</a>)."

Based on these manipulations, you and your co- authors conclude that active expiration (and the oscillator in the pFRG) requires rhythmic inhibition from the preB\u00f6tC to generate expiration in the adult. Since this is not the case in juvenile animals, you proposed that there must be a developmental change in the role of the pFRG in breathing."

In all cases silencing the preB\u00f6tzinger complex is associated with an apnea while the animal is not ventilated. Under these conditions it cannot be avoided that the animal will become hypoxic. Thus, it is not clear whether the cessation of inspiration and expiration is due to the cessation of the preB\u00f6tzinger complex or the hypoxic conditions associated with the apnea. It is well-known that hypoxic conditions will lead to the cessation of inspiration and expiration. It is also well known that adults are more sensitive to hypoxia than juveniles/neonates."

To justify your conclusion it is critical to silence the preB\u00f6tC while ventilating the animal, show stable oxygenation in the absence of preB\u00f6tC activity, and then demonstrate whether under these physiologically stable conditions active expiration can be induced, persists or disappears when inspiration ceases neuronally. These experiments will not be feasible within the allowed two months, hence we will not be able to consider your paper. For further details, please see the individual reviews."

That is as the effect of hyperpolarizing effect of Alst on preB\u00f6tC neurons progressively diminished, the rats were ventilated but upon removal from the ventilator, Abd activity did not return until presumably preB\u00f6tC activity reached a threshold level.

Rats were ventilated on average for ~18 min following the onset apnea after which removal from the ventilator led to the onset of inspiratory activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>).

Therefore, the most parsimonious explanation for the lack of abdominal activity during ventilation when inspiratory motor activity is absent is that expiratory drive from the pF<sub>L</sub> alone is insufficient to drive expiration and requires an additional source of network excitation, such as inspiratory activity or chemosensory drive."

However the discussion in subsection \u201cRespiratory network activity is a requirement for active expiration\u201d seems to counter this concern. That is as the effect of hyperpolarizing effect of Alst on preB\u00f6tC neurons progressively diminished, the rats were ventilated but upon removal from the ventilator, Abd activity did not return until presumably preB\u00f6tC activity reached a threshold level. Dia and GG activity always returned before Abd activity. When the rats were ventilated to maintain normal blood gases, there was no Abd activity when the rats were briefly removed from the ventilator; thus, it does not seem that hypoxia could be causing the depressed Abd activity. Accordingly, I accept their point that a minimal amount of preB\u00f6tC activity seems to be necessary drive the expiratory oscillator.</i>"
