Here, we gained novel functional insight about heterochromatic PTMs by analyzing histone H3 purified from the heterochromatic germline micronucleus of the model organism <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i>. Mass spectrometric sequencing of micronuclear H3 identified H3K23 trimethylation (H3K23me3), a previously uncharacterized PTM. H3K23me3 became particularly enriched during meiotic leptotene and zygotene in germline chromatin of <i>Tetrahymena</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>. Loss of H3K23me3 in <i>Tetrahymena</i> through deletion of the methyltransferase Ezl3p caused mislocalization of meiosis-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to heterochromatin, and a decrease in progeny viability. These results show that an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway regulates H3K23me3 during meiosis, and our studies in <i>Tetrahymena</i> suggest this pathway may function to protect heterochromatin from DSBs."

Here, we gained novel functional insight about heterochromatic PTMs by analyzing histone H3 purified from the heterochromatic germline micronucleus of the model organism <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i>. Mass spectrometric sequencing of micronuclear H3 identified H3K23 trimethylation (H3K23me3), a previously uncharacterized PTM. H3K23me3 became particularly enriched during meiotic leptotene and zygotene in germline chromatin of <i>Tetrahymena</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>. Loss of H3K23me3 in <i>Tetrahymena</i> through deletion of the methyltransferase Ezl3p caused mislocalization of meiosis-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to heterochromatin, and a decrease in progeny viability. These results show that an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway regulates H3K23me3 during meiosis, and our studies in <i>Tetrahymena</i> suggest this pathway may function to protect heterochromatin from DSBs."

An enzyme called Ezl3p adds these methyl groups, and without this enzyme <i>T. thermophila</i> reproduces more slowly and has offspring that are less likely to survive and more likely to be infertile.

Of particular interest is the complement of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that occur on histone proteins within this transcriptionally \u2018off\u2019 environment. Studies of histone PTMs such as methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation have shown they assist in regulation of chromatin activity, which has helped usher in a modern understanding of different varieties or sub-domains of this compact chromatin state (<a href=\"#bib64\">Strahl and Allis, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Turner, 2000</a>). \u2018Constitutive\u2019 heterochromatin is found at structural or highly repetitive stretches of the genome such as pericentric or subtelomeric regions, is enriched in Su(var) (suppressors of position effect variegation) proteins and trimethylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3) (<a href=\"#bib32\">James et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bannister et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jacobs et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Peters et al., 2001</a>).

Despite being generally repressed, much of heterochromatin can be transcribed and processed into non-coding RNA, which in turn has been linked to trans-generational deposition of histone modifications and epigenetic silencing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Djebali et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gu et al., 2012</a>).

We identified H3K23me3 as a micronucleus-specific PTM that exclusively co-occurs with H3K27 methylation on the same H3 molecule. Using an antibody specific for H3K23me3, we found this mark becomes highly enriched during early stages of meiosis in <i>Tetrahymena</i>. Moreover, the loss of H3K23me3 resulted in developmental lags of meiosis, delayed transcription of germline-specific non-coding RNAs, mislocalization of meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and reduction of progeny viability. Finally, we found that H3K23me3 levels also increase in <i>C. elegans</i> germ cells upon meiotic entry. Together, our data suggest H3K23me3 is a conserved heterochromatic histone PTM strongly associated with meiosis, and misregulation of this modification may be linked to problems with germline recombination and reproductive fitness."

While H3<sup>S</sup>K27me3 levels in the macronucleus remain constant throughout conjugation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2007</a>), we found that H3<sup>F</sup>K27me3 levels in the micronucleus increased and diminished concurrently with H3K23me3 levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Our HILIC-MS/MS analysis of micronuclear histone H3 purified from conjugating cells also showed that up-regulated H3K23me3 remained physically linked to H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast to the coordinate increase of H3K23me3 and H3K27me3 observed during meiosis, H3K9me3, which specifically emerges during nuclear differentiation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Taverna et al., 2002</a>), was only detected after levels of H3K23me3 diminished (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The fact that low levels of H3K23me3 detected during nuclear differentiation are present in micronuclei and not the H3K9me3-enriched developing macronuclei (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), further defines distinct functions within heterochromatin for these PTMs. Taken together, these findings suggest that H3K23me3 may play an important new role during meiosis and heterochromatin formation."

Micronuclear chromosomes in early stages of meiosis become highly organized\u2014centromeres and highly-repetitive pericentric regions (DAPI-poor) segregate to one pole of the elongating micronucleus, while telomeres and genic regions (DAPI-rich) localize to the opposite pole (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Loidl and Scherthan, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mochizuki et al., 2008</a>)."

In striking contrast, while some DSB signal in early meiotic <i>\u0394EZL3</i> micronuclei could be detected in the DAPI-rich genic region, the vast majority of DSB signal covered the DAPI-poor, centromeric pole of micronuclei (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In meiotic <i>\u0394EZL3</i> cells, the increased DSB signal over the DAPI-poor, centromeric pole of micronuclei remained for the majority of the meiotic lag, although when mutant cells finally entered pachytene, \u03b3H2A.X localization resembled wild type distribution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Interestingly, DSBs were not mislocalized in <i>\u0394EZL2</i> cells (lacking H3K27me3), suggesting that only cells completely lacking H3K23me3 have mislocalized meiotic DSBs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Further evidence in support of this interpretation was provided by immunoFISH assays combining \u03b1-\u03b3H2A.X and a DNA probe against the Tlr1 element (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wells et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Reddy et al., 2008</a>). A number of micronuclear-limited sequences, including Tlr1, are repetitive in nature and are enriched in centromere-proximal regions, whereas genes are enriched more distally on the chromosome arms (EP Hamilton and RS Coyne, personal communication). The Tlr1 probe we generated was highly specific for micronuclei (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The <i>C. elegans</i> gonad is essentially organized into two physically and functionally distinct regions. Germ cells near the distal tip cell of the gonad are maintained as a mitotically dividing population through Notch-like (<i>glp-1</i>) signaling; however, as germ cells migrate proximally, they enter meiosis and differentiate into sperm or oocytes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Colaiacovo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</a>). By indirect immunofluorescence, H3K23me3 was nearly absent in the mitotic region of the gonad, although a small number of mitotic nuclei in this region were positive for the PTM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In striking contrast, H3K23me3 staining became robust in meiotic cells within the gonad, beginning at the leptotene/zygotene transition zone that marks meiotic entry, and plateauing through the rest of meiotic prophase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Compared to H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H3K4me3 distribution in the gonad, H3K23me3 was the only PTM that became enriched as germ cells entered the transition zone (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Under high magnification, H3K23me3 and other PTMs also exhibited comparatively different sub-nuclear staining patterns within meiotic cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Notably, H3K23me3 appeared relatively punctate across the entire nucleus rather than being enriched on either the autosomes (such as H3K4me3) or the silenced Xs (such as H3K27me3) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kelly et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bender et al., 2004</a>). Importantly, our peptide competitions showed that \u03b1-H3K23me3 is highly specific for H3K23me3 in the <i>C. elegans</i> gonad (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

As expected, in the gonad of <i>mes-2</i> knockout strains, H3K27me3 was completely undetectable (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In contrast, H3K23me3 remained present in meiotic cells, and surprisingly, H3K23me3 levels within the mitotic germ cell region increased (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Additionally, we investigated H3K23me3 levels following RNAi-mediated knockdown of MES-4, an NSD homolog known to antagonize MES-2 in the germline (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gaydos et al., 2012</a>). Similar to <i>mes-</i>2 knockouts, H3K23me3 remained detectable in mitotic and meiotic regions of the <i>mes-4(RNAi)</i> germline (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). MES-2 and MES-4 regulate gene expression in the germline, and their disruption may have pleiotropic effects that include alteration of pathways regulating H3K23me3 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gaydos et al., 2012</a>). Nevertheless, our data suggest neither MES-2 nor MES-4 is exclusively responsible for trimethylation of H3K23 in <i>C. elegans</i>."

As expected, in the GLP-1 loss-of-function mutant <i>glp-1(lf)</i>, which undergoes early differentiation of mitotic cells and early entry into meiosis, we observed a shift of the H3K23me3 signal towards the distal tip of the gonad (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Remarkably, in the GLP-1 gain-of-function mutant <i>glp-1(gf),</i> which prevents entry of mitotic germ cells into meiosis and causes their proliferation, H3K23me3 levels were significantly reduced throughout the gonad (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Moreover, Western blot analysis of <i>glp-1(gf)</i> whole-worm-extracts showed that H3K23me3 levels are also dramatically reduced, further indicating the vast majority of H3K23me3 signal in adult <i>C. elegans</i> is confined to meiotic germ cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Together with our previous data, these results suggest the up-regulation of H3K23me3 during meiosis is conserved between <i>Tetrahymena</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>."

Furthermore, in <i>Tetrahymena</i>, we show that H3K23me3 plays a role in a previously unknown pathway maintaining genome stability during meiosis, and that mutants lacking H3K23 methylation incur a reduction in progeny viability. Taken together with the conserved upregulation of H3K23me3 in meiotic germline chromatin in <i>Tetrahymena</i> and nematodes, our data suggest a previously unappreciated pathway may help limit DSB formation and recombination in heterochromatin during meiosis."

The location of recombination hotspots in budding yeast and mice is positively correlated with the euchromatic PTMs H3K4me3 and acetylation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lichten and de Massy, 2011</a> and references therein; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kota and Feil, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yamada et al., 2013</a>). H3K4me3 and histone acetylation may enhance recruitment of the opportunistic, sequence-independent DSB endonuclease Spo11 to specific sites in the genome by loosening local chromatin structures (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, the heterochromatic PTM H3K9me3 is thought to play a role in inhibiting meiotic DSBs and crossover events through compaction of specific genomic regions, like pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, thus limiting Spo11 access (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gerton et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wu et al., 2009</a>). While H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 are absent altogether from <i>Tetrahymena</i> micronuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Strahl et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Taverna et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2007b</a>), H3K23me3 is readily detected in meiotic micronuclei and found within a distinct sub-nuclear locale than DSBs during leptotene and zygotene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). Furthermore, depletion of H3K23me3 induces meiotic DSBs at non-coding, centromere-proximal regions of the <i>Tetrahymena</i> germline that are occupied by H3K23me3 in wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In analyzing <i>\u0394SPO11</i> cells, which lack meiotic DSBs and \u03b3H2A.X (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mochizuki et al., 2008</a>), we found that H3K23me3 levels remained at wild type levels during meiosis, supporting a role for H3K23me3 that is upstream of DSB formation (data not shown). To this end, we favor a model (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) in which H3K23me3 helps to organize a specialized compact heterochromatin structure, distinct from H3K9me3-associated heterochromatin, that can protect non-coding/highly repetitive regions of the genome from Spo11 activity. The mechanism in <i>\u0394EZL3</i> mutants that leads to an enrichment of early meiotic DSBs at pericentric regions, rather than a global derepression of DSBs, is unclear. Notably, in <i>Su(var)3-9</i><sup><i>null</i></sup> flies, which lack H3K9 methylation, DNA damage is also predominantly increased in heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib53\">Peng and Karpen, 2009</a>). ChIP-based (chromatin immunoprecipitation) efforts to further refine genomic localization of DSB in H3K23me3 <i>Tetrahymena</i> mutants were problematic (data not shown), likely due to the repetitive nature of the DNA surrounding centromeres. Since H3K23me3 is also found in some mitotic chromatin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 7</a>), an intriguing link may exist between this PTM and homologous recombination events outside of meiosis."

The phenotype of <i>Suv39h</i> dn mice was largely attributed to a loss of H3K9me3 at pericentric heterochromatin causing a significant amount of genome instability in both germline and somatic cells. Similarly, the obvious shift of DNA damage to pericentric regions in <i>Tetrahymena</i> mutants lacking H3K23me3 may also underlie their decreased progeny viability. Future analysis of changes in the piRNA-like scanRNA population and genome-wide localization studies of DSBs in <i>\u0394EZL3</i> mutants will further resolve the relationship between histone PTMs and genome instability."

Mass spectrometry data describing the physical linkage of histone PTMs is sparse in relation to their biological context, yet such information is necessary to understand the proposed \u2018epigenetic/histone code\u2019 (Strahl et al., 2000). Our HILIC-MS/MS data demonstrate that H3K23me3 is located within the <i>Tetrahymena</i> germline, and primarily co-exists with H3K27me3 on the proteolytically clipped H3<sup>F</sup> isoform (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition to the physical linkage of these modifications, the loss of either H3K23me3 or H3K27me3 clearly impacts the level of the other in both <i>Tetrahymena</i> and <i>C. elegans.</i> Western blotting and quantitative mass spectrometry of <i>Tetrahymena</i> histones suggested an increase in H3K27me2 in cells missing H3K23me3, while indirect immunofluorescence of <i>C. elegans</i> gonads suggested H3K23me3 increased in worms lacking H3K27me3.

However, the mislocalization of meiotic DSB in <i>Tetrahymena</i> was only observed in H3K23me3 mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In this regard, the functional significance of the combination of K23 and K27 methylation within the germline remains unclear. Previously, proteolysis of H3 N-termini was observed during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and also linked to H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Duncan et al., 2008</a>), although we did not detect H3K23me3 on truncated H3 from mouse or <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and data not shown). Interestingly, a small proportion of H3K23me3 and H3K27me3 are also found in the presence H3S10ph, which is a well-documented PTM that marks mitotic and, to a lesser extent, meiotic chromatin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wei et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Prigent and Dimitrov, 2003</a>). Minimally, this physical linkage suggests that some amount of H3K23me3 can be retained on chromatin throughout the process of cell division, and thus can be inherited."

Samples were resuspended in water and treated with TURBO DNase (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's procedures. Reverse strand synthesis was carried out using poly dT primers, procedures and reagents from the Superscript II RT kit (Life Technologies). <i>EZL3</i> specific primers (Forward -AATGGTCTATGCTAAAGGTGG; Reverse -TTTGAGAGTTCCTTGTCCATC) were used to assess transcript levels and primers that target the ribosomal protein RPL21 (Forward -AAGTTGGTTATCAACTGTTGCGTT and Reverse -GGGTCTTTCAAGGACGACGTA; sequence obtained from <a href=\"#bib3\">Aronica et al., 2008</a>) were used as controls in end-point PCR assays. Quantitative PCR was employed to assess the levels of <i>EZL3</i> expression during conjugation. Total RNA of conjugating cells was harvested at the indicated time points during conjugation and processed following procedures described above. qPCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, 4376600) with StepOne Software v2.1 and Power SYBR Green (Life Technologies, 4367659) to quantify relative mRNA abundance. <i>EZL3</i> specific primers used are shown above. mRNA levels were normalized to time point zero. Samples were analyzed in duplicate. The <i>EZL3</i> gene was amplified from micronuclear genomic DNA using the forward primer (5\u2032 -CACCTATAAAATGAGAAGAGTTAGATAAAATAAATG) and the reverse primer (5\u2032 -GATATCTTTCCTTTTTTTTTATTTTATTAAATTTTAATTTTTAGCAG) and cloned into the pENTR-TOPOD (Life Technologies). This plasmid was used as the template for the site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) reaction that introduced the H599A mutation. The primers for mutagenesis were: forward primer (5\u2032 -GCAGATTCATGAATGCTTCAAAAAGCAAAG) and reverse primer (5\u2032 -CTTTGCTTTTTGAAGCATTCATGAATCTGC). The resultant plasmids (pENTREZL3wt and pENTR-EZL3[H599A]) were then cloned into the pBS-ICY-gtw destination vector using the LR recombination reaction as described previously (<a href=\"#bib51\">Motl and Chalker, 2011</a>). All plasmids and inserted genes were confirmed by sequencing."

The activity of a methyltransferase <i>in vitro</i> does not unambiguously define enzyme lysine preference <i>in vivo</i>. <i>In vitro</i> site specificity for methyltransferases (as is the case with most other chromatin-associated enzymes) can vary depending on the substrate, reaction conditions, the stability of the protein, and the associated complex members present in the assay. The EZH2 class of methyltransferases (and by extension, the homologous <i>Tetrahymena</i> EZL methyltransferases) can be particularly sensitive to <i>in vitro</i> assay conditions since other PRC2 complex members are essential for activity. Despite these limitations of the <i>in vitro</i> biochemistry approaches, we have spent over two years attempting to purify the <i>Tetrahymena</i> Ezl3 methyltransferase and complex using <i>Tetrahymena</i> cells, as well as heterologous cell systems."

In the revised manuscript we have tried to soften language throughout regarding direct modification of H3K23 by Ezl3. Since our exhaustive efforts to characterize Ezl3 <i>in vitro</i> have been hindered by insurmountable technical barriers that will likely take many additional months or years to overcome, and given the scope of this manuscript, we ask that the reviewers provide some leeway in their suggested biochemical experiments. We also point out that EZH methyltransferases are well-documented histone methyltransferases, and ascribing Ezl3 as the key enzyme responsible for H3K23 methylation is the Occam's razor model for our data. Moreover, as knockdown of Ezl3 does not change any other histone methylation site, there is no evidence that Ezl3 causes an indirect, cascade effect that leads to H3K23 methylation. Accordingly, we hope it will not be viewed as a major detraction to exclude this data."

A FISH probe for the germline-limited highly-repetitive Tlr1 sequence, which is present in hundreds of copies at pericentric regions in the micronucleus, has a pattern of strong overlap with \u03b3H2AX signal in cells that are missing H3K23me3, in contrast to the non-overlapping pattern of these markers in wild type cells.

In the original draft, we had analyzed mouse germ tissue to strengthen the link between H3K23me3 and pericentric or otherwise heterochromatic DNA regions that we observed in <i>Tetrahymena</i>, since these sequences are not well characterized in the ciliate model. We feel the new immunoFISH analysis of meiotic <i>Tetrahymena</i> chromatin that we include in our revised submission better resolves the localization of pericentric regions, and we will remove the mouse data from this submission as per the Reviewers\u2019 request (see revised <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, we feel that the <i>C. elegans</i> data remains valuable to maintain in this manuscript since the multicellularity and morphology of <i>C. elegans</i>, and our analysis of the available meiotic mutants, all provide critical support of our central claim that the majority of H3K23me3 is confined to meiotic chromatin. The <i>C. elegans</i> data also underscores that biological roles of H3K23me3 are likely to be distinct from other heterochromatic histone PTMs like H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. These major points would be less convincing if our data was limited to the single-celled <i>Tetrahymena</i> model. Also, we were not attempting to suggest that our data proves that H3K23me impacts <i>C. elegans</i> DSB localization, and the confusing language has been removed in our revised draft."
