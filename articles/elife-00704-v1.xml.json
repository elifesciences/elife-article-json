Of multiple pathways allowing such entry, the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter is a highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channel complex encoded by several recently-discovered genes. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunit remains to be established, since knockdown of all the candidate uniporter genes inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in imaging assays, and reconstitution experiments have been equivocal. To definitively identify the channel, we use whole-mitoplast voltage-clamping, the technique that originally established the uniporter as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. We show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <i>mitochondrial calcium uniporter</i> (<i>MCU</i>) gene reduces mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub>), whereas overexpression increases it. Additionally, a classic feature of <i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub>, its sensitivity to ruthenium red inhibition, can be abolished by a point mutation in the putative pore domain without altering current magnitude. These analyses establish that <i>MCU</i> encodes the pore-forming subunit of the uniporter channel."

Of multiple pathways allowing such entry, the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter is a highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channel complex encoded by several recently-discovered genes. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunit remains to be established, since knockdown of all the candidate uniporter genes inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in imaging assays, and reconstitution experiments have been equivocal. To definitively identify the channel, we use whole-mitoplast voltage-clamping, the technique that originally established the uniporter as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. We show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <i>mitochondrial calcium uniporter</i> (<i>MCU</i>) gene reduces mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub>), whereas overexpression increases it. Additionally, a classic feature of <i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub>, its sensitivity to ruthenium red inhibition, can be abolished by a point mutation in the putative pore domain without altering current magnitude. These analyses establish that <i>MCU</i> encodes the pore-forming subunit of the uniporter channel."

Of several pathways for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, a uniporter found in the inner membrane possesses the largest capacity for uptake and was shown to be a highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective ion channel (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kirichok et al., 2004</a>). However, despite this substantial progress, the identities of the genes encoding the functional uniporter were largely unknown until only recently. In the past several years, investigators from several laboratories have identified <i>mitochondrial calcium uptake 1</i> (<i>MICU1</i>, formerly <i>Cbara1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Perocchi et al., 2010</a>), mitochondrial calcium uniporter (<i>MCU</i>, formerly <i>Ccdc109a</i>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baughman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">De Stefani et al., 2011</a>), and mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1 (<i>MCUR1</i>, formerly <i>Ccdc90a</i>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Mallilankaraman et al., 2012</a>) as potentially integral components of this channel."

So far, the discovery of each of these genes occurred via Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging assays following RNAi-mediated knockdown. Although extremely useful for screening, this technique is ill-suited for separating modulatory effects from altered expression of the channel-forming subunit itself, and each of these genes was found to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via this assay. This difficulty arises because Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging measures Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, which depends critically on (i) the number of open portals, (ii) the voltage gradient, and (iii) the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration gradient driving flux, and none of these is controlled during imaging experiments. In fact, changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers or efflux pathways can alter matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and changes in pH or other divalents can alter indicator fluorescence, without reflecting a true difference in uniporter activity. Rather, the ideal method for assaying electrogenic ion transport is voltage-clamping, which allows precise control of the voltage and concentration gradient and thus accurate measurement of the changes in channel density."

Although such a discrepancy may be explained by the incorporation of the channel into bilayers in the absence of regulatory subunits, lipid bilayer reconstitution is also notorious for false positive findings. Since it detects the activity of single molecules, channel-like behavior can be measured from trace contaminants after even crystallography-grade purification (<a href=\"#bib1\">Accardi et al., 2004</a>).

To confirm targeting to the inner membrane, we treated HEK-293T mitochondrial fractions with increasing concentrations of digitonin, and assayed for enzymatic digestion with proteinase K (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baughman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Since the FLAG-tagged proteins were protected from digestion to a comparable extent as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase F (PPIF, a matrix protein), whereas proteins of the outer- and inter-membrane spaces were not, the MCU constructs are appropriately targeted with their carboxyl-termini facing the mitochondrial matrix. Turning to our whole-mitoplast recordings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,G</a>), we found that overexpression of wild-type MCU-Flag produced a robust increase in <i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub> of approximately 3.4-fold compared to endogenous HEK-293T currents (compare to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>).

In Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging experiments, this mutant had preserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake but diminished sensitivity to uniporter inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baughman et al., 2011</a>). At baseline, mitoplasts from HEK-293T cells transfected with the S259A mutant had capacitances similar to mitoplasts after wild-type MCU overexpression (MCU-Flag: 0.32 \u00b1 0.06 pF, S259A: 0.29 \u00b1 0.10 pF, p&gt;0.05). Moreover, S259A overexpression mirrored the increase in <i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub> seen after wild-type MCU transfection, confirming a fully-functional channel (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). However, this variant displayed markedly decreased sensitivity to RuR, with minimal inhibition at 100 nM. Since overexpression occurred on a background of endogenous channels, this mutant appears to act in a dominant-negative fashion. In particular, the S295A RuR-inhibited fraction (148 \u00b1 33 pA/pF, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) was much less than the RuR-inhibited fraction in endogenous <i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub> (372 \u00b1 42 pA/pF, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). This suggests that, since the channel is an oligomer of multiple MCU subunits (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baughman et al., 2011</a>), mutant S259A-MCU can incorporate with endogenous, wild-type subunits to form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting channel, which nonetheless has drastically-reduced RuR sensitivity."

Second, we show that a central feature of <i>I</i><sub><i>MiCa</i></sub>\u2014its exquisite sensitivity to blockade with ruthenium red\u2014can be abolished via a single point mutation in the pore domain. MCU subunits carrying this mutation act in a dominant-negative fashion, producing functional channels that conduct Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions but are largely insensitive to ruthenium red. We conclude that the functional uniporter pore at the mitochondrial inner membrane is formed by MCU multimers.

Although indirect optical methods helped to identify three candidate proteins important for the activity of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (<i>MICU1</i>, <i>MCU</i>, and <i>MCUR1</i>), the subsequent attempts to understand the exact functions of these proteins led to little progress and produced controversial results. In this manuscript, the authors provide strong evidence that one of the candidate proteins, MCU, forms the pore of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter. Since this is the first structure\u2013function study of the <i>MCU</i> using the patch\u2013clamp technique, methodologically this works sets an important precedent in the field."
