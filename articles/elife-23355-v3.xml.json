Here, we describe a new assay using fluorescently-tagged anthrolysin O, a cholesterol-binding bacterial toxin, to measure accessible cholesterol in human red blood cells (RBCs). Accessible cholesterol levels were stable within individuals, but varied &gt;10 fold among individuals. Significant variation was observed among ethnic groups (Blacks&gt;Hispanics&gt;Whites). Variation in accessibility of RBC cholesterol was unrelated to the cholesterol content of RBCs or plasma, but was associated with the phospholipid composition of the RBC membranes and with plasma triglyceride levels. Pronase treatment of RBCs only modestly altered cholesterol accessibility. Individuals on hemodialysis, who have an unexplained increase in atherosclerotic risk, had significantly higher RBC cholesterol accessibility. Our data indicate that RBC accessible cholesterol is a stable phenotype with significant inter-individual variability. Factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to the RBC contribute to variation in its accessibility. This assay provides a new tool to assess cholesterol homeostasis among tissues in humans."

Here, we describe a new assay using fluorescently-tagged anthrolysin O, a cholesterol-binding bacterial toxin, to measure accessible cholesterol in human red blood cells (RBCs). Accessible cholesterol levels were stable within individuals, but varied &gt;10 fold among individuals. Significant variation was observed among ethnic groups (Blacks&gt;Hispanics&gt;Whites). Variation in accessibility of RBC cholesterol was unrelated to the cholesterol content of RBCs or plasma, but was associated with the phospholipid composition of the RBC membranes and with plasma triglyceride levels. Pronase treatment of RBCs only modestly altered cholesterol accessibility. Individuals on hemodialysis, who have an unexplained increase in atherosclerotic risk, had significantly higher RBC cholesterol accessibility. Our data indicate that RBC accessible cholesterol is a stable phenotype with significant inter-individual variability. Factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to the RBC contribute to variation in its accessibility. This assay provides a new tool to assess cholesterol homeostasis among tissues in humans."

Membrane cholesterol is supplied by the diet or synthesized endogenously from acetyl coenzyme A. All cells in the body except red blood cells (RBCs) synthesize cholesterol. To maintain cholesterol balance, an amount of cholesterol equivalent to the sum of what is made in the\u00a0cells and acquired from the diet must be removed from the body. The major pathway for cholesterol excretion in humans is via the biliary system. The proteins and processes by which cholesterol is secreted into the bile, either directly, or after conversion to bile acids, have been well characterized (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berge et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Russell, 2009</a>). In contrast, the process by which cholesterol from peripheral tissues is delivered to the liver for excretion remains poorly defined."

In the first step of the Glomset model, HDL acquires free cholesterol from cell membranes in peripheral tissues. Free cholesterol is transferred from cells to HDL by ATP binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Lawn et al., 1999</a>). The free cholesterol in the HDL particle is then esterified with long-chain fatty acids by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Glomset, 1968</a>) and sequestered in a hydrophobic core below the phospholipid surface of HDL (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stoffel et al., 1974</a>). This step is critical to the delivery of cholesterol to the liver; sequestration in the HDL core decreases the propensity of cholesterol to exchange with cell membranes, thus limiting the retrograde transfer of cholesterol from HDL back to the\u00a0tissues. The cholesteryl ester is then delivered to the liver either directly via a cell surface receptor, scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acton et al., 1996</a>), or indirectly after transferring the cholesterol to Apolipoprotein (Apo)B-containing lipoproteins, which then undergo endocytosis by the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Several components of the HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport pathway have been supported by studies in cultured cells and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lewis and Rader, 2005</a>)."

The accessibility of cholesterol in a membrane is related to its chemical activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003</a>), alternatively referred to as its fugacity (tendency to flee). The chemical activity of cholesterol generally increases with increasing cholesterol concentration. However, at lower concentrations, complex formation with phospholipids can suppress the chemical activity of cholesterol below what would be expected in the absence of lipid interactions. At higher concentrations, when phospholipids become limiting, the chemical activity of cholesterol rises. Sharp rises in chemical activity have been detected in model membranes by measurements of cholesterol accessibility, as assayed by cyclodextrin extraction (<a href=\"#bib39\">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Litz et al., 2016</a>), oxidation by cholesterol oxidase (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahn and Sampson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lange et al., 2013</a>), and binding of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins such as perfringolysin O (PFO) or anthrolysin O (ALO) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heuck et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gay et al., 2015</a>). A sharp rise in the chemical activity of RBC membrane cholesterol has been observed using the cholesterol oxidase assay to assess cholesterol accessibility (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lange et al., 1980</a>). In all of these cases, the increase in cholesterol accessibility with increasing cholesterol concentration was sigmoidal, rather than linear, with little change until a threshold concentration was reached.

Whereas age and gender had modest effects on accessible RBC cholesterol, significant ethnic differences were apparent in RBC cholesterol accessibility. The variation in cholesterol accessibility was not related to the cholesterol content of the membrane or to pronase-accessible proteins in the RBC membrane, but rather to the content of other membrane lipids and to levels of circulating triglycerides (TG). Finally, we find that a group of patients on hemodialysis, who have more coronary heart disease than anticipated based on known risk factors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levey et al., 1998</a>), have higher RBC cholesterol accessibility."

At RBC concentrations of less than 10<sup>6</sup> RBCs/assay, fALOD4 binding values clearly separated into the low, medium, and high ranges. At higher RBC concentrations, fALOD4 binding per cell decreased in all cases and resolution among high, medium and low binding was lost.

Western blotting was performed using streptavidin-HRP to assess the effect of pronase treatment on accessible membrane proteins. The protein content of the RBC membranes decreased progressively with increasing amounts of pronase. Hemolysis measurements show that the integrity of the RBC membranes was not significantly affected by the pronase treatment, except at the highest level tested. At the lowest concentration of pronase (0.02 \u03bcg/mL), fALOD4 binding increased by\u00a0~25% (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Higher concentrations of pronase did not further increase fALOD4 binding despite further decreases in membrane protein content. Based on these results we concluded that the protein composition of the RBC membrane is not a major determinant of fALOD4 binding, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a protein(s) that is resistant to pronase treatment contributes to the inter-individual differences in fALOD4 binding."

The demographics and the distribution of fALOD4 binding in these individuals are shown in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>; the median fALOD4 binding was higher in Blacks than in Hispanics, which is similar to what we had seen in the other cohort (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Lipids were extracted from RBC ghosts and then the major glycerophospholipids were quantitated by LC-MS/MS in the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center. The overall lipid composition of the RBC membranes was similar to what has been reported previously (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Leidl et al., 2008</a>). Differences in levels of several of the RBC lipids were observed between Blacks and Hispanics, however in a multivariable models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, and plasma TG levels, only differences in lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), SM, and phosphatidic acid levels were associated with differences in fALOD4 binding. Individually, these lipids accounted for 8.55% (LPE), 0.01% (SM), and 3.62% (phosphatidic acid) of variation in fALOD4 binding, respectively (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). To determine the total contribution of the three lipid classes, a separate model was built that was adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and plasma TG levels. In this model the RBC lipids accounted for 17.6% of the inter-individual variation in fALOD4 binding (the R<sup>2</sup> values are not additive because of the correlations among the RBC lipids)."

The assay is highly reproducible and captures a new quantitative trait in humans. The major finding of the study is that the amount of accessible cholesterol in RBC membranes is stable within an individual but varies\u00a0&gt;10 fold among individuals. The high degree of inter-individual variation was unrelated to total cholesterol content of the RBC membrane and modestly affected by pronase-sensitive changes in protein content of the RBC membrane. Differences in RBC phospholipid composition of the RBC membrane accounted for 17.6% of the inter-individual variability (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Cholesterol accessibility in RBCs varied significantly between ethnic groups and correlated indirectly with plasma levels of TG (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), but not with the morphology or hemoglobin content of the RBCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Thus, we have shown that the level of accessible cholesterol in RBCs in the population varies significantly among individuals in a stable fashion and we have identified several factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the RBC membrane, that contribute to the variation in RBC cholesterol accessibility. The significance of this variability on the trafficking of cholesterol among plasma components and tissues or if it relates to human disease awaits further study."

Thus, the cholesterol in the RBC membrane that is accessible to fALOD4 represents a distinct pool (or state) of cholesterol, which is not reflected by direct assays of RBC cholesterol mass. The striking reproducibility of relative fALOD4 binding to RBCs within a given individual (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) indicates that the factors that govern RBC cholesterol accessibility must be relatively stable."

Despite this wide difference in cholesterol content, the chemical activity of cholesterol in these two membranes may be similar (<a href=\"#bib39\">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</a>). This equivalence could be achieved if PM phospholipids interact more strongly with cholesterol than ER phospholipids, a plausible possibility based on extensive fractionation analysis of PM and ER lipids (<a href=\"#bib9\">Colbeau et al., 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Comte et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schroeder et al., 1976</a>) and biophysical studies of the varying affinity of cholesterol for different phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib35\">McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wattenberg and Silbert, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Finean, 1953</a>). Fluctuations in membrane composition lead to changes in the chemical activity of cholesterol and could result in cholesterol transport between membranes, either internally or externally. In the case of the RBC, which has no internal organelle membranes, changes in cholesterol activity in the plasma membrane must equilibrate with cholesterol in lipoproteins, other plasma proteins, or with other cells, such as circulating leukocytes or endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lange and Steck, 2016</a>)."

Non-cholesterol lipids contributed significantly to inter-individual differences in cholesterol accessibility (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>), but identifying exactly which lipid species contributed to the observed variation in cholesterol accessibility was not straightforward. The complex population of phospholipids in the RBC membrane and the high degree of correlation between different phospholipid classes confounded the analysis. In the multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, lipid and lipoprotein levels, only LPE, SM and PA were associated with fALOD4 binding. Taken together, differences in these membrane lipids accounted for 17.6% of the variability in fALOD4 binding. It is also possible that differences in phospholipid composition alter the distribution of cholesterol between the two leaflets of the RBC membrane. Further studies in which the RBC membrane content of individual phospholipids can be selectively altered will be required to elucidate the effect of membrane phospholipids on cholesterol accessibility."

At cholesterol concentrations below the inflection point, the capacity of the membrane to incorporate cholesterol into complexes with phospholipids is high and the propensity for cholesterol to leave the membrane is low, therefore cholesterol will tend to accumulate in the RBC. At cholesterol concentrations above the inflection point, the capacity of the membrane to accommodate additional cholesterol in complexes with phospholipids is low, and cholesterol is poised to leave the RBC membrane when suitable acceptors become available. Thus, the cholesterol content of the RBC membranes is maintained close to equilibrium with respect to cholesterol exchange."

However, depletion of membrane proteins by pronase digestion had only a modest effect on fALOD4 binding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We cannot exclude the possibility that in our experiments pronase treatment failed to digest a protein that contributes to the inter-individual differences in cholesterol accessibility. No association was found between ABO blood groups and fALOD4 binding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, upper panel), but fALOD4 binding was reproducibly lower in those who were negative for the Rh antigen, a transmembrane protein of unknown function (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, lower panel). The effect of the Rh antigen on fALOD4 binding may be direct or indirect. Rh antigen may compete with or directly inhibit fALOD4 binding. Alternatively, the antigen may alter the\u00a0cholesterol accessibility in the RBC membrane. More extensive studies of the relationship between Rh antigenicity and cholesterol accessibility will be needed to elucidate the basis for this relationship."

Plasma levels of TG and RBC cholesterol accessibility were inversely correlated. This correlation may be a direct result of movement of accessible cholesterol from RBCs to very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 1986</a>).

RBCs do not have access to peripheral tissues unless there is loss of vascular integrity, but they can interact indirectly with peripheral tissues through cells, such as macrophages, and lipoproteins that enter the\u00a0tissues and return to the circulation. RBCs have been shown to be excellent acceptors of free cholesterol from macrophages (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ho et al., 1980</a>). Brown and Goldstein found that RBCs were 6-fold more potent than whole serum as cholesterol acceptors from macrophages (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ho et al., 1980</a>). Lipoprotein-depleted plasma is as efficient an acceptor as whole serum or plasma from cholesterol-loaded macrophages (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ho et al., 1980</a>). Although here we focused on the relationship between RBC accessible cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, it is also possible that blood components other than lipoproteins contribute to differences in cholesterol accessibility of the RBC membrane (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ho et al., 1980</a>). RBCs may also exchange cholesterol with endothelial cells, thus indirectly transporting cholesterol from the\u00a0tissues. It is unlikely that RBCs deliver cholesterol directly to hepatocytes since they are too large to enter the space of Disse."

These differences were seen in two independent samples collected at different times (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). The increased RBC accessibility in Blacks was not fully explained by the measured differences in RBC lipid composition or by the plasma lipoprotein levels. In linear regression analysis, adjusted for these factors, the proportion of variability in fALOD4 binding explained by ethnicity was reduced from 32% to 22.4%, but remained highly statistically significant (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Dietary differences between the ethnic groups may also contribute to differences in RBC cholesterol accessibility. It would be informative to measure fALOD4 binding to RBCs in a larger multiethnic sample and use genetic association to identify potential factors accounting for the observed differences between both individuals and ethnic groups."

To determine if RBC cholesterol accessibility provides a clinically relevant biomarker, we measured cholesterol accessibility in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis, who have a dramatically increased risk of atherosclerosis that is not explained by known risk factors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Levey et al., 1998</a>). We found a systematic increase in cholesterol accessibility in RBCs in patients on dialysis when compared to healthy age- and race-matched controls. The cause of these differences and whether they are related to the increase in atherosclerosis seen in this population is not known at this time and will require further study."

Lipids were extracted using the Folch extraction method (<a href=\"#bib16\">Folch et al., 1957</a>). An aliquot of the extracted lipids (10% of total) was used to measure cholesterol by Infinity cholesterol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or by gas chromatography (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wilund et al., 2004</a>). Another aliquot (10% of total) was used to measure choline-containing phospholipids with the Wako Phospholipids C enzymatic kit (Wako Diagnostics, Mountain View, CA). This value was divided by a calibration factor of 0.55 to estimate the total amount of RBC phospholipids. The calibration factor was derived from previous quantitative studies where it was determined that choline-containing phospholipids make up 55% of RBC phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dodge and Phillips, 1967</a>). Mole percentages of cholesterol were calculated by dividing moles of cholesterol by moles of total lipids (cholesterol plus phospholipids) and multiplying the result by 100. We used 389 Da for the molecular mass of cholesterol and 800 Da as an estimate for the average molecular mass of a phospholipid."

In short, membranes were suspended in a volume of 3 mL PBS and added to an 8 mL, 13 \u00d7 100 mm glass culture tube (Fisherbrand, Pittsburgh, PA) containing 3 mL methanol that was immersed in a water bath sonicator (Branson model # B2510MT, Danbury, CT) set at maximum speed. After removal of the tube from the sonicator, a total of 3 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) was added to the tube. The samples were capped (Fisherbrand black phenolic Teflon coated screw cap), vortexed, and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The bottom phase, which contained the lipids, was transferred to a fresh glass culture tube. An additional 4 mL DCM was added to the original tube, which was again capped, vortexed and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 2.5 min at room temperature. The bottom phase was combined with the material from the initial phase separation (total volume of approximately 5 mL). The samples were placed at 42\u00b0C under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas until the volume was approximately 0.5 mL. The samples were transferred to 1 mL glass culture tubes, which were again placed at 42\u00b0C under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas until all solvent had evaporated. The glass tubes containing the dried lipids were immediately capped, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, placed on dry ice, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until they were shipped on dry ice to the Kansas Lipid Core for detailed analysis of polar lipids."

Continuous characteristics were compared using t-tests or ANOVA adjusted for age and gender where appropriate; categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. Variables with non-normal distributions were logarithmically or inverse-normally transformed before analysis. The relationships between fALOD4 binding and lipid levels and RBC indices were assessed using linear regression adjusted for age, gender, and ethnicity. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to determine which factors jointly contributed to variability in fALOD4 binding. We used a forward selection procedure to build the fully adjusted model. Briefly, our baseline model included age, gender and ethnicity as covariates, to account for differences in age and gender distribution between the ethnic groups. Next, we added plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, RBC indices, and RBC lipids to the baseline model, one at a time. The factor with the most significant contribution to the model (lowest p-value) was added to the model, and the procedure was repeated, until no more variables were significantly associated with fALOD4 binding. Partial R<sup>2</sup> values were calculated based on the final model, to assess the proportion of variance in fALOD4 binding explained by each factor. All statistical analyses were performed using the software package Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) or R statistical analysis software version 3.2.3 (<a href=\"http://www.R-project.org/\">www.R-project.org/</a>)."

Some of the experiments in the current study in erythrocytes shows the validity of earlier biochemical findings (for example, reduced binding with cyclodextrin and more binding after sphingomyelinase treatment). What is nice (and novel) is extending studies with ALOD4 to a mammalian cell type (red blood cells). A lot of the paper is descriptive, showing that the binding depends on ethnic background, the presence of renal disease, HDL levels, triglyceride levels, and phospholipid species in the erythrocyte membrane. However, despite this important progress, a lot of the variation in binding of ALOD4 remains unexplained. The authors speculated that the accessibility of cholesterol to ALOD4 is relevant to plasma cholesterol transport, but a strong connection was not made."

However, there are some negatives. One is that a lot of the results are predictable from the earlier papers from UT Southwestern. Another is that the work, although quite interesting, remains largely descriptive. A stronger link to metabolism is needed. Also, I would like to see quantitative analysis of ALOD4 binding to individual erythrocytes. They show median levels of binding. What is the variation in binding to different erythrocytes? What is the level of heterogeneity in ALO binding to erythrocytes? What is the correlation between RFP-ALO binding and GFP-ALO binding in the same experiment? What accounts for variation in binding? If some erythrocytes in a population display more ALO binding than others, then I would like to see some explanation for the difference. Do cells that bind more ALO have more plasma membrane cholesterol? Very high resolution images of the binding of fluorescent ALO are needed."

This fALOD4 binding is reflective of \"accessible\" cholesterol in the exofacial leaflet of the RBCs. It is not correlated with total cholesterol, which indicates that other features of the RBC membrane are responsible for these differences. This suggests the possibility that differences in RBC accessible cholesterol could relate to other parameters such as reverse cholesterol transport."
