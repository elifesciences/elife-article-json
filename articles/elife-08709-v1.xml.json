                    "text": "Plants have evolved intracellular immune receptors to detect pathogen proteins known as effectors. How these immune receptors detect effectors remains poorly understood. Here we describe the structural basis for direct recognition of AVR-Pik, an effector from the rice blast pathogen, by the rice intracellular NLR immune receptor Pik. AVR-PikD binds a dimer of the Pikp-1 HMA integrated domain with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex enabled design of mutations to alter protein interaction in yeast and in vitro, and perturb effector-mediated response both in a rice cultivar containing Pikp and upon expression of AVR-PikD and Pikp in the model plant <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. These data reveal the molecular details of a recognition event, mediated by a novel integrated domain in an NLR, which initiates a plant immune response and resistance to rice blast disease. Such studies underpin novel opportunities for engineering disease resistance to plant pathogens in staple food crops."

Here we describe the structural basis for direct recognition of AVR-Pik, an effector from the rice blast pathogen, by the rice intracellular NLR immune receptor Pik. AVR-PikD binds a dimer of the Pikp-1 HMA integrated domain with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex enabled design of mutations to alter protein interaction in yeast and in vitro, and perturb effector-mediated response both in a rice cultivar containing Pikp and upon expression of AVR-PikD and Pikp in the model plant <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. These data reveal the molecular details of a recognition event, mediated by a novel integrated domain in an NLR, which initiates a plant immune response and resistance to rice blast disease. Such studies underpin novel opportunities for engineering disease resistance to plant pathogens in staple food crops."

NLRs are a conserved component of plants' innate immune systems and survey the host environment for perturbations caused by invading pathogens (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dangl and Jones, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chisholm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jones and Dangl, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">van der Hoorn and Kamoun, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</a>). Most NLRs respond to the presence or activities of translocated pathogen effectors, proteins delivered by adapted pathogens to affect the physiology of the host to benefit the parasite (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Win et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wirthmueller et al., 2013</a>). The recognition event often results in a robust immune response and localised cell death, which limits disease caused by biotrophic pathogens on their hosts. Most NLRs comprise a multi-domain architecture with central nucleotide-binding (NB-ARC) and C-terminal LRR regions. They also usually contain N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or TOLL/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains (<a href=\"#bib51\">Takken and Goverse, 2012</a>). In at least some cases, NLRs function in pairs to deliver disease resistance, and these pairs can be tightly linked genetically (<a href=\"#bib20\">Eitas and Dangl, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cesari et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Le Roux et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sarris et al., 2015</a>).

RGA4/RGA5 physically interact to prevent cell death mediated by RGA4 in the absence of AVR-Pia; the presence of the effector relieves this suppression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cesari et al., 2014</a>).

The purified effector, with a non-cleavable 6xHis tag at the C-terminus, was immobilised on a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA chip; Pikp-HMA was used as the analyte. Using a multi-cycle kinetics approach, we found that Pikp-HMA bound to immobilised AVR-PikD with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 31 \u00b1 2 nM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). SPR studies were expanded to include AVR-PikE, AVR-PikA and AVR-PikC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). For AVR-PikE, even though this was not fully saturatable under the conditions of our assay, we obtained an apparent <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 367 \u00b1 41 nM, a greater than 10-fold weaker binding compared to AVR-PikD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). For AVR-PikA we could determine an apparent <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 710 \u00b1 111 nM (also not saturatable in the assay). We detected essentially no binding for AVR-PikC to Pikp-HMA in this assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This is consistent with the Y2H data and also correlates with the published recognition specificity <i>in planta</i>, although <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates expressing AVR-PikE were reported to not be recognised by cultivars of rice expressing Pikp (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kanzaki et al., 2012</a>)."

However, following a co-expression strategy with 6xHis tagged Pikp-HMA and untagged AVR-PikD (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we obtained crystals of this complex in multiple conditions. Optimisation of one of these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) produced crystals diffracting X-rays to 1.6 \u00c5 resolution. The structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex was solved using molecular replacement to position a Pikp-HMA dimer (see below) in the asymmetric unit, followed by automated rebuilding with the sequence of both proteins supplied. This was sufficient to produce an initial model containing both Pikp-HMA and AVR-PikD that could be used to complete structure determination (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, X-ray Data Collection and Refinement statistics are given in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

The majority of the interaction is formed with a monomer of Pikp-HMA, with 87.5% of the effector's buried surface area (902.2 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) and nine residues contributing hydrogen bond and/or salt bridge interactions. This suggests that the AVR-PikD/Pikp-HMA monomer interaction most likely represents the biologically significant interface. No hydrogen bonds or salt bridge interactions are formed with the second monomer of the Pikp-HMA dimer. Further, due to steric clash that would occur, it is not possible for an AVR-PikD/Pikp-HMA heterotetramer (2:2 complex) to assemble.

The closest structural homologue of Pikp-HMA (defined by PDBeFold [<a href=\"#bib31\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</a>]) is the HMA domain of yeast protein Ccc2A (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banci et al., 2001</a>), overlaying with an r.m.s.d. of 1.58 \u00c5 over 72 residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Typically, HMA domains bind heavy metals, or lighter cations such as Cu<sup>1+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, via two conserved Cys residues and are involved in metal transport or detoxification pathways (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bull and Cox, 1994</a>). Interestingly, these Cys residues are not conserved in Pik-1 HMA domains, including Pikp-1. Hence, the Pikp-HMA structure does not contain a metal ion, and the loop between \u03b2<sub>1</sub> and \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, which usually contains the metal-chelating Cys residues, is disordered. Further, this loop is positioned away from the interface with the effector (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and does not contribute to complex formation."

This suggests that sequence divergent translocated effectors of <i>M. oryzae</i> may share a conserved structural scaffold, despite very different sequences, which has striking parallels to RXLR-type effectors of plant pathogenic oomycetes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutemy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Win et al., 2012</a>). Further, structural homology is also observed to ToxB, a protein toxin from <i>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</i>, the causative agent of tan spot in wheat (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nyarko et al., 2014</a>).

The second involves the side chain of Pikp-HMA<sup>Asp224</sup>, which forms a salt\u2013bridge interaction with the side chain of AVR-PikD<sup>Arg64</sup>, and is also held in place by a hydrogen bond of its main chain NH group to the side chain of AVR-PikD<sup>Asp66</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

AVR-PikE was included in these experiments as it represents a naturally occurring point mutant at the important position 46 (His46Asn). Each of the transformed <i>M. oryzae</i> lines were spot inoculated (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kanzaki et al., 2002</a>) onto leaf blades of rice cultivars Nipponbare (Pik<sup>\u2212</sup>, lacks known Pik alleles) and K60 (which contains Pikp). The Nipponbare cultivar was susceptible to all of the <i>M. oryzae</i> lines, including Sasa2 wild type and empty vector control, as shown by the development of lesions around the inoculation sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). As expected, the K60 (Pikp) cultivar is resistant to the <i>M. oryzae</i> Sasa2 line expressing AVR-PikD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kanzaki et al., 2012</a>). We observed that the K60 (Pikp) cultivar showed an intermediate phenotype between susceptible and resistant to <i>M. oryzae</i> Sasa2 lines expressing AVR-PikE. For the mutants, we found that the K60 (Pikp) cultivar was susceptible to <i>M. oryzae</i> Sasa2 lines expressing AVR-PikD<sup>His46Glu</sup>, AVR-PikD<sup>Arg64Ala</sup> and AVR-PikD<sup>Asp66Arg</sup>, but resistant to those expressing AVR-PikD<sup>Ala67Asp</sup> and AVR-PikD<sup>Pro47Ala/Gly48Asp</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). As for AVR-PikE, K60 (Pikp) shows an intermediate phenotype to Sasa2 lines expressing AVR-PikD<sup>Ile49Glu</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). There is a correlation between AVR-PikD mutants that display the tightest binding affinities in vitro, and interact in the Y2H assay, with resistance in rice when delivered by <i>M. oryzae</i> (partial phenotype in the case of AVR-PikD<sup>Ile49Glu</sup>). Strains expressing AVR-PikD mutants that do not interact in vitro or in yeast (AVR-PikD<sup>His46Glu</sup>, AVR-PikD<sup>Arg64Ala</sup> and AVR-PikD<sup>Asp66Arg</sup>) are fully susceptible in rice.

Despite being &gt;20 years since cloning of the first plant NLRs, this is still lacking. While single NLRs can be sufficient to mediate recognition and initiate signalling by either direct (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</a>) or indirect binding (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dangl and Jones, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">van der Hoorn and Kamoun, 2008</a>), the role of paired NLRs is emerging as a new paradigm for regulating immune responses in plants and mammals. In such cases, one NLR acts as a pathogen \u2018sensor\u2019, and can contain a specific domain that mediates this activity, the second acts as an inducer of signalling. Recent studies have addressed the importance of molecular interactions between classical domains in plant NLR pairs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cesari et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Williams et al., 2014</a>). Here we focussed on dissecting the direct recognition of a rice blast pathogen effector by an unconventional integrated domain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cesari et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wu et al., 2015</a>) in a rice NLR, a critical event for the initiation of immune-related signalling."

One member of the pair can constitutively activate an HR-like cell death on expression in plants (RGA4 and RPS4), and this activity is suppressed by the second (RGA5 and RRS1) through the formation of hetero-complexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cesari et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Williams et al., 2014</a>). This suppression is relieved by co-expression of the cognate effectors and can result in signalling-competent NLR homo-complexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cesari et al., 2014</a>). In mammals, members of the NAIP (NLR) family act as sensors of pathogen signatures and associate with NLRC4 following perception to trigger signalling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kofoed and Vance, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). Although it seems unlikely that assemblies of homo- and hetero-NLR complexes in their suppressed and activated states are universally conserved in mammals and plants, it appears that oligomerisation plays a key role in modulating activity."

Although the limits of our assays preclude a conclusive interpretation of this signalling complex, they do suggest that not all paired plant NLRs function within the confines of existing models.

Conceptually, this residue could be accommodated at the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interface without generating significant steric clashes, but the interactions formed at this site (e.g., hydrogen bonding pattern) will be fundamentally different. This single amino acid polymorphism is sufficient to prevent AVR-Pik-dependent cell death in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, limit resistance in rice, and reduce the affinity of interaction with Pikp-HMA in vitro by an order of magnitude. This suggests a binding threshold is required to elicit a response in plants and the observed 10-fold reduced affinity of AVR-PikE for Pikp-HMA in vitro is sufficient for this. While this may be enough to explain why the conservative His46Asn mutation is the only one found in nature, it remains possible that other mutations would not be tolerated due to a trade-off with the effector's virulence activity."

Different concentrations of Pikp-HMA (ranging from 1 to 1200 nM) and buffer only controls were injected over flow cells 1 and 2 (flow cell 1 was used as reference) for 120 s and dissociation was recorded for another 300 s. Binding responses were recorded at each concentration of Pikp-HMA just before the end of injection and these were then fitted to a steady state affinity model assuming 1:1 binding. The inclusion of buffer-only controls enabled the use of double referencing whereby for each analyte measurement, in addition to subtracting the response in FC 1 from the response in FC 2, a further buffer-only subtraction was made to correct for bulk refractive index changes or machine effects (<a href=\"#bib38\">Myszka, 1999</a>). Interaction studies of Pikp-HMA and AVR-PikD mutants were performed using a single cycle kinetics method. The chip was activated by injecting 30 \u00b5l of 0.5 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> over FC 2 and was used to immobilize His-tagged protein (AVR-PikD mutants) on flow cell 2 to a response level of 250 \u00b1 10. Increasing concentrations of Pikp-HMA (1, 10, 20, 60 and 120 nM) were injected over flow cell 1 and 2 for 120 s. After the final injection the dissociation was recorded for 300 s. Two startup cycles were run where the chip was activated and effector proteins immobilised in the same manner, but buffer only was injected. This was subtracted to account for any dissociation of AVR-PikD mutants from the sensor chip. For both types of kinetic experiments the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 30 \u00b5l of 0.35M EDTA. All the data were analyzed using Biacore T200 BiaEvaluation software (GE Healthcare). The raw data was exported and plotted using Microsoft Excel. Each experiment was done in duplicate, with similar results."

In this case, the NLR with the newly discovered 'integrated' domain is on the 'sensor NLR', which the paired NLR uses to activate disease resistance. It seems by the authors' terminology that the 'sensor NLR' is a 'sensor integrated domain-containing sensor NLR'. Here, clarification is needed."

At this time we do not know the precise role of Pikp-2 in effector-mediated immune activation and can only speculate on this.

Further, shape complementarity in the binding pocket appears less ideal with Asn. Therefore, in the absence of a Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikE structure, we cannot precisely correlate the experimentally determined reduction in binding affinity of AVR-PikE to Pikp-HMA, compared to AVR-PikD, with specific individual molecular interactions at the interface at this time."
