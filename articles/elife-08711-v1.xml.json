                    "text": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive human primary brain cancer. Using a <i>Trp53</i>-deficient mouse model of GBM, we show that genetic inactivation of the Atm cofactor Atmin, which is dispensable for embryonic and adult neural development, strongly suppresses GBM formation. Mechanistically, expression of several GBM-associated genes, including <i>Pdgfra</i>, was normalized by <i>Atmin</i> deletion in the <i>Trp53</i>-null background. Pharmacological ATM inhibition also reduced <i>Pdgfra</i> expression, and reduced the proliferation of <i>Trp53</i>-deficient primary glioma cells from murine and human tumors, while normal neural stem cells were unaffected. Analysis of GBM datasets showed that <i>PDGFRA</i> expression is also significantly increased in human <i>TP53</i>-mutant compared with <i>TP53</i>-wild-type tumors. Moreover, combined treatment with ATM and PDGFRA inhibitors efficiently killed <i>TP53</i>-mutant primary human GBM cells, but not untransformed neural stem cells. These results reveal a new requirement for ATMIN-dependent ATM signaling in TP53-deficient GBM, indicating a pro-tumorigenic role for ATM in the context of these tumors."

Using a <i>Trp53</i>-deficient mouse model of GBM, we show that genetic inactivation of the Atm cofactor Atmin, which is dispensable for embryonic and adult neural development, strongly suppresses GBM formation. Mechanistically, expression of several GBM-associated genes, including <i>Pdgfra</i>, was normalized by <i>Atmin</i> deletion in the <i>Trp53</i>-null background. Pharmacological ATM inhibition also reduced <i>Pdgfra</i> expression, and reduced the proliferation of <i>Trp53</i>-deficient primary glioma cells from murine and human tumors, while normal neural stem cells were unaffected. Analysis of GBM datasets showed that <i>PDGFRA</i> expression is also significantly increased in human <i>TP53</i>-mutant compared with <i>TP53</i>-wild-type tumors. Moreover, combined treatment with ATM and PDGFRA inhibitors efficiently killed <i>TP53</i>-mutant primary human GBM cells, but not untransformed neural stem cells. These results reveal a new requirement for ATMIN-dependent ATM signaling in TP53-deficient GBM, indicating a pro-tumorigenic role for ATM in the context of these tumors."

A recent study has, however, demonstrated loss of ATM signaling to inhibit the growth of TP53-null tumor xenografts, via stabilization of p14<sup>ARF</sup> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Velimezi et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that ATM function in cancer is highly context-dependent."

Precancerous lesions in which the DNA damage response is activated are under selective pressure to lose or mutate <i>TP53</i>, and loss of <i>TP53</i> is known to cooperate with several genes to accelerate tumorigenesis (as summarized in the IARC database\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib40\">Petitjean et al., 2007</a>]). Among these cooperating changes is loss of <i>ATM</i>, which induces rapid T-cell lymphoma development (<a href=\"#bib59\">Westphal et al., 1997</a>). <i>TP53</i> is also one of the most commonly mutated genes in human GBM.

Overexpression of the Pdgf receptor ligand <i>Pdgfrb</i> in adult Nestin-positive neural stem cells, for instance, results in glioma formation, which is accelerated in a <i>Trp53</i>-mutant background (<a href=\"#bib47\">Squatrito et al., 2010</a>)."

Importantly, we find that these results are translatable to therapeutic ATM inhibition in human patient-derived GBM stem cells, and that combining ATM inhibition with PDGFRA inhibition results in synergistic tumor cell killing with minimal effects on untransformed cells."

Out of 17 animals, 14 (82%) showed diffusely infiltrative astrocytic brain tumors, the majority of which were classified as GBM by independent analysis (57% Grade IV, glioblastoma; 29% Grade III, anaplastic astrocytoma; 14% Grade II, fibrillary astrocytoma), while one displayed an osteosarcoma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> GBMs displayed pseudopalisading necrosis (i), microvascular proliferation with endothelial hyperplasia (ii) and occasional endovascular thrombosis (iii), hallmarks of human GBM tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> [i\u2013iii]). The markers Gfap (iv), Nestin (v), and Olig2 (vi) were expressed in all tumors, while they were negative for the neuronal marker NeuN, supporting the diagnosis of glioma (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> (iv\u2013vi) and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity, a classic hallmark of high-grade gliomas, was also frequently observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These data indicate that early embryonic loss of <i>Trp</i>53 in the brain is sufficient to promote GBM formation. The long latency of these tumors, together with the genome instability and transcriptional changes known to be induced by loss of <i>Trp</i>53, indicated that these gliomas almost certainly develop as a result of secondary mutations arising in the <i>Trp</i>53-null brain. In line with this notion, mouse SNP array data revealed large chromosomal gains and losses (typical tumorigenic genetic changes) in four out of five analyzed <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>gliomas, whereas no changes were detected in one wt and three Trp53-deficient non-tumorigenic control NS cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These secondary hits are not congenitally predefined and thus possibly allow a better representation of the genetic diversity of the disease in patients. In addition, the high frequency of brain tumor formation, proportion of high-grade tumors, and consistency of tumor latency on a mixed genetic background make this a valuable GBM model."

                                "text": "As an integral part of the response to genomic stress, activation of the DNA damage response pathway typically represents a barrier to tumorigenesis. Consistent with this, it has previously been shown that loss of the DNA damage kinase Atm accelerates tumorigenesis in a Pdgf-driven glioblastoma model (<a href=\"#bib47\">Squatrito et al., 2010</a>). In addition, deletion of the Atm cofactor Atmin promotes B cell lymphomagenesis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Loizou et al., 2011</a>). Whether loss of Atmin affects tumorigenesis in other cancer types is so far unknown. To investigate the potential role of Atmin in glioma formation, we crossed <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kanu et al., 2010</a>) with <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> mice. Strikingly, <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> mice showed significantly longer tumor-free survival than <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>animals (p&lt;0.0002) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The largest proportion of <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>mice (43%) did not develop any signs of sickness and were still alive after 450 days; a further 36% succumbed either to non-tumor-related illness or, in one case, a pancreatic tumor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Only three animals out of a cohort of 14 <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>double mutants (21%) initiated glial tumors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), compared with 82% of <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>mice over the same period. The three GBMs arising in <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>double-mutant mice arose later but were histologically similar to those observed in <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and did not escape <i>Atmin</i> deletion, suggesting that the requirement for Atmin can eventually be overcome, but only in a small proportion of cases. Importantly, central nervous system deletion of <i>Atmin</i> alone (<i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>) did not affect brain morphology or histology (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kanu et al., 2010</a>) and the mice remained tumor free (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

                                "text": "Loss of Trp53 affects diverse fundamental cellular processes including proliferation, genome stability, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vousden and Lane, 2007</a>). To understand the involvement of Atmin in the suppression of the <i>Trp53</i>-null phenotype, we isolated neural stem cells (NSCs) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) from <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>embryos and tested the effect of <i>Atmin</i> loss on these processes. <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs proliferated more rapidly than wild-type (<i>wt</i>) controls. This proliferative advantage, however, was rescued in <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> NSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>), indicating that Atmin is required for the hyperproliferation of Trp53-deficient NSCs. Loss of Atmin alone did not alter proliferation of NSCs (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). FACS profiling of <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> and <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> NSCs revealed a decrease in the proportion of <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> cells in S phase compared with <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> NSCs, in agreement with the reduced proliferation rate, but no change in cells with a &gt;4n DNA content, and metaphase spreads at passage 10 revealed no obvious difference in ploidy (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We analyzed cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to ionizing radiation (IR) by quantifying the percentage of BrdU-incorporating and DAPI-permeable NSCs respectively. As expected, <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> NSCs arrested less efficiently than <i>wt</i> NSCs and cell death was reduced; but cell cycle arrest and cell death were not rescued in <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> NSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In addition to IR-induced cell death, <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> NSCs were more resilient to hypoxia-induced death, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Graeber et al., 1996</a>). <i>Atmin</i> deletion in these cells re-sensitized them to hypoxia, to similar levels as <i>wt</i> NSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Thus, loss of Atmin is able to rescue some of the phenotypes of Trp53 loss, such as hyperproliferation and hypoxia induced death, but not others, such as IR-induced cell cycle arrest and cell death."

We performed intracranial injections of NSCs isolated from <i>wt</i>, <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>, and <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Five out of five animals injected with <i>p53</i><sup>\u0394N</sup> NSCs died within 93 days post-injection, while four out of five wt and three out of four <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSC-injected animals were still alive even at 155 days, the endpoint of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Histologically, injected cells appeared as atypical glial cells expressing Nestin and Ki67, diffusely infiltrating the host brain (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), similar to previous observations with human GBM xenografts (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stricker et al., 2013</a>). Fluorescent imaging of asymptomatic mice at the experimental endpoint readily detected injected <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> and <i>wt</i> NSCs (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), suggesting that these cells survived in the host brain, but did not induce lethality. Thus, genetic inactivation of <i>Atmin</i> greatly impairs the tumorigenic potential of <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>cells."

Compared with <i>wt</i> NSCs, 145 genes were downregulated more than 1.5-fold in <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>, whereas 77 were overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Many of the canonical Trp53 target genes, such as <i>Bax, Puma</i>, and <i>Cdkn1a</i>, were downregulated to a similar extent in <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup>; p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i> compared with <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs. However, 27% of genes deregulated in <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs returned to <i>wt</i> expression levels when Atmin was also deleted (36/145 of the decreased, and 24/77 of the increased genes; examples in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). When this subset of genes \u2018rescued\u2019 in double mutant NSCs was queried against the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, in several cases abnormal levels of these transcripts were found to be associated with human GBM (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Suvasini et al., 2011</a>). Particularly notable among this list was the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Elevated levels of <i>PDGFRA</i> have been observed in human gliomas of various malignancy grades (<a href=\"#bib14\">Engstr\u00f6m et al., 2012</a>), and increased PDGFR signaling has been shown to induce glioma-like growths in vivo (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jackson et al., 2006</a>). Increased PDGFRA levels are also a characteristic hallmark of the proneural GBM subtype as classified in (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brennan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Verhaak et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, we found that <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs were associated most closely with the proneural subtype when comparing the microarray expression profile from the murine NSCs to that of publically available human GBM samples from TCGA (<a href=\"#bib54\">Verhaak et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is in agreement with elevated <i>Pdgfra</i> mRNA as well as protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This increased protein expression was also apparent in high-grade GBMs from endstage <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Other growth factor receptors, like Egfr, and proteins commonly deregulated in glioma including Rb, Pten, Cyclin D2, Junc, and Cdk4 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2009</a>) remained unaltered in <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>cells and tumors (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>), as did the closely related Pdgf receptor <i>Pdgfrb</i> and the receptor ligands <i>Pdgfa</i> and <i>Pdgfb</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

To determine whether acute silencing of <i>Atmin</i> in tumor cells might reduce <i>Pdgfra</i> expression by disrupting Atm signaling, we tested the effects of pharmacological Atm inhibition in <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>primary tumor cells. Treatment with an Atm inhibitor (ATMi) significantly reduced Pdgfra transcript and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>) and efficiently reduced proliferation of <i>p53<sup>\u2206N</sup></i>primary tumor cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), similar to our observations after <i>Pdgfra</i> silencing. ATMi treatment also reduced <i>Pdgfra</i> expression in <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with these results, <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>double-mutant NSCs had dramatically lower <i>Pdgfra</i> expression levels than <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs, comparable to <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>and <i>wt</i> NSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>). Furthermore, in vitro proliferation assays showed that genetic loss of <i>Atm</i> reduced the proliferation of <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs to <i>wt</i> levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Importantly, the reduction in cell proliferation in vitro correlated with reduced tumorigenic potential of the NSCs when orthotopically injected into the brains of NOD/SCID mice. Mice injected with <i>Atm</i><sup>-/-</sup>; <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs survived up to 50% longer than those receiving <i>p53<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>NSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). However, <i>Atmin</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>) was more effective than deletion of <i>Atm</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Atmin can also act as a transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jurado et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goggolidou et al., 2014</a>), and it is conceivable that this Atm-independent function of Atmin contributes to the suppression on GBM. The similar effect of <i>Atmin</i> deletion and Atm inhibition on <i>Pdgfra</i> expression and proliferation of NSCs and primary tumor cells supports the hypothesis that Atmin functions in these processes via its modulation of Atm signaling. Given the extensively characterized role of PDGFRA in cell proliferation and in particular in glioma, it is reasonable to propose that the reduction in <i>Pdgfra</i> expression upon <i>Atm</i> loss contributes to the reduced tumorigenic potential observed."

To determine whether a reduction in <i>PDGFRA</i> levels would be sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of primary GNSCs from human tumors, G179 cells were infected with doxycycline (dox)-inducible shRNA constructs targeting <i>PDGFRA</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), and their proliferation was monitored over a period of 10 days.

Similar to our observations in murine NSCs, ATMi treatment reduced the proliferation rate of human TP53 mutant GNSCs, but not cb660 control cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). PDGFR inhibitors (PDGFRi) have previously been shown in vitro and in vivo\u00a0to reduce tumor growth in a glioma model (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kilic et al., 2000</a>). These advances, however, have so far failed to transition into clinical practice (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rich et al., 2004</a>). We reasoned that ATMi-mediated reduction in PDGFRA protein levels could potentiate the effects of PDGFR inhibition. Consistent with this, we observed that co-treatment of GNSCs, but not untransformed NSCs (e.g. cb660), with relevant ATM and PDGFR inhibitor concentrations further reduced cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More detailed analysis revealed that this treatment combination induced substantial cell death, while untransformed NSCs remained largely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). The proportion of apoptotic GNSCs receiving the combination treatment was quantifiable by microscopic detection of a caspase-cleaved fluorescent substrate after up to four days of drug treatment; thereafter, dead cells detached from the plate, precluding accurate quantification. Essentially, all GNSCs were eventually killed by the combination of ATM and PDGFR inhibitors, as judged by cell detachment. In contrast, PDGFRi treatment by itself had little effect on cell death and proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7 A\u2013C</a>). Seeding GNSCs at higher confluence gave similar results (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), as did a second, independent PDGFRi in combination with the ATMi (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that cell death was not an indirect consequence of slower proliferation induced by the ATMi or a side effect of a particular drug. Hence, ATM is required for <i>PDGFRA</i> overexpression in both murine and human GBM cells, and combined inhibition of ATM and PDGFR induces lethality in TP53-mutant glioma cells, promising new opportunities for future GBM treatment."

Since TP53 signaling is the most common genetically altered pathway in human gliomas (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008</a>), it is desirable for future cancer therapies to identify new molecular targets that affect TP53-deficient cells. Here, we have shown that genetic loss of <i>Atmin</i> or <i>Atm</i> reduces GBM formation initiated by deletion of <i>Trp53</i>. This finding indicates that Atm/Atmin is crucial for Trp53-deficient GBM development, and suggests the use of ATM inhibitors, which have already been developed, for GBM therapy (<a href=\"#bib5\">Basu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Golding et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Batey et al., 2013</a>)."

Even on a mixed genetic background, mice harboring a Nestin-driven Trp53 deletion show strong consistency in tumor latency, high penetrance of brain tumors and high-grade GBM formation. Such a model, incorporating the stochastic evolution and genetic heterogeneity of human glioblastoma patients, complements existing genetically defined mouse models that show an accelerated disease course (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>)."

This pro-tumorigenic function for Atmin and Atm signaling in brain cancer is unexpected, as systemic Atm deletion has previously been found to accelerate Pdgf ligand-induced gliomagenesis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Squatrito et al., 2010</a>). However, the previous study was carried out in Trp53 wild-type animals. It was recently shown that TP53 status is crucial in determining the cellular response to ATM inhibition in human glioma cell lines (<a href=\"#bib7\">Biddlestone-Thorpe et al., 2013</a>), so this difference might explain the apparently opposite function of Atm in our model. TCGA data indicates that ATM mutation/deletion is rare in TP53-mutant GBM, supporting the hypothesis that ATM loss is not a tumor driver and may even inhibit tumorigenesis in this context. Because the pleiotropic effects of ATM signaling are highly context dependent, factors other than TP53 status must also influence the outcome in vivo. For example, loss of Atm cooperates with Trp53 deficiency and accelerates the progression of T-cell lymphoma (<a href=\"#bib59\">Westphal et al., 1997</a>). Thus, the relationship between TP53 and ATM signaling in tumorigenesis may be tissue specific, ranging from cooperation to antagonism."

Indeed, recently published work has shown that ATM inhibition preferentially radiosensitizes TP53 mutant GBM cell lines (<a href=\"#bib7\">Biddlestone-Thorpe et al., 2013</a>). Our data reveal an additional pro-tumorigenic effect of Atm, which acts in the absence of ionizing radiation and involves non-canonical, Atmin-dependent signaling. It is possible that the effect of Atm inhibition in our model would also be enhanced by ionizing radiation, since the radiosensitizing effect would be predicted to be largely independent of Atmin (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kanu and Behrens, 2007</a>). Thus, combination treatment with ATM and PDGFR inhibitors together with radiotherapy may represent a therapeutic opportunity for GBM."

Although Atmin has been implicated directly as a transcription factor for <i>Dynll1</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jurado et al., 2012b</a>), a broader role for Atmin in transcriptional regulation had not yet been determined. We find here that <i>Atmin</i> loss leads to widespread rescue of glioma-associated changes in gene expression in the <i>p53<sup>\u2206N</sup> </i>background. Several of these genes could be collectively responsible for suppressing GBM formation in <i>Atmin<sup>\u0394N</sup></i>; <i>p53<sup>\u2206N</sup></i> animals. The most compelling single candidate, however, is the proto-oncogene <i>Pdgfra</i>. It has been shown that stimulating Pdgf signaling in vivo is sufficient to induce glioma-like growths (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jackson et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, <i>PDGFRA</i> is commonly overexpressed in human glioma (<a href=\"#bib14\">Engstr\u00f6m et al., 2012</a>), but only a subset of gliomas display <i>PDGFRA</i> locus amplification (<a href=\"#bib15\">Furnari et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008</a>), indicating that additional mechanisms drive its increased expression. <i>PDGFRA</i> overexpression frequently correlates with LOH on chromosome 17p, where the human <i>TP53</i> gene is located (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hermanson et al., 1996</a>), supporting the view that the oncogenic misexpression of <i>PDGFRA</i> might be a direct consequence of TP53 inactivation in human GBM. In our murine and human glioma lines, Pdgfra\u00a0levels could be dynamically modulated by depleting Atmin or inhibiting Atm. At present, how Atm/Atmin controls Pdgfra expression in this background is unclear. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in murine NSCs indicated that Atmin does not bind the <i>Pdgfra</i> gene (unpublished observations), making the regulation unlikely to be via direct transactivation, most likely involving currently unidentified intermediate transcriptional regulators of <i>Pdgfra</i> expression. We speculate that Trp53 controls the expression of a negative regulator of Pdgfra, for\u00a0example, a repressor or a miR RNA, and that Atm signalling is required for the expression or function of this factor. As these intermediate factors could be promising targets for pharmacological inhibition, further investigation into their identity is of therapeutic interest."

Here, we demonstrate that the effect of these drugs on the proliferation and survival of human glioma cells can be greatly potentiated by combining PDGFR inhibitor treatment with ATM inhibitors. Importantly, the strongest effects of combinatorial treatment on cell proliferation and survival are specific to tumor cells that have lost TP53 function, suggesting that systemic therapy should target TP53-deficient tumors with minimal impairment to normal tissue."

In addition, current PDGFR inhibitors are not completely specific and also inhibit EGFR, VEGFR, FLT3, and c-KIT kinases amongst others (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrae et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Homsi and Daud, 2007</a>).

The deletion of both ATM and ATMIN in mice, and in the case of ATM, humans, leads to the development of different types of tumors, primarily of lymphocyte origin. Thus both ATM and ATMIN are primarily regarded as tumor suppressors. Recent work has established that ATM may have some pro-tumorigenic roles through its functions in differentiation and secretory phenotypes in different tumor models (Santos et al., Nature 2014 and Chen et al., <i>ELife</i> 2015)."

This result is convincingly recapitulated in a transplant model using NSCs. The authors identified PDGFRa as a gene strongly affected by ATMIN or ATM status in the p53\u2206 tumors and demonstrated that its levels affected cell growth through a variety of complementary experiments. Finally, the authors demonstrate that combined inhibition of both ATM and PDGFR increases cell death and decreases proliferation in human glioblastoma cell lines with elevated PDGFRa and mutant p53."

While there are some mechanistic details that are not well established, primarily the mechanism by which ATM upregulates PDGFRa and the trigger for ATMIN/ATM activation in the p53 null tumors, the establishment of all of these details would likely not have a strong impact on the primary conclusions of the paper."

Previous work from this group and others (Kanu and Behrens, EMBO J. 2007 and Jurado et al. 2010) has made the point that ATMIN does not seem to play a prominent role in the activation of ATM in response to IR or HU but is a major player in the response to reactive oxygen. The inhibitor experiments argue that ATM activity is required and it is thus presumably activated in the presence of ATMIN. Given that ROS is linked to the activation of ATM by ATMIN, p53 signaling (Liu et al., Free Radical Biol Med (review) 2008) and implicated in PDGFRa activity (Lei and Kazlauskas, MCB 2013), it seems that this would be an important stimuli to test before making this very definitively stated conclusion."

Previous work from this group and others (Kanu and Behrens, EMBO J. 2007 and Jurado et al. 2010) has made the point that ATMIN does not seem to play a prominent role in the activation of ATM in response to IR or HU but is a major player in the response to reactive oxygen. The inhibitor experiments argue that ATM activity is required and it is thus presumably activated in the presence of ATMIN. Given that ROS is linked to the activation of ATM by ATMIN, p53 signaling (Liu et al., Free Radical Biol Med (review) 2008) and implicated in PDGFRa activity (Lei and Kazlauskas, MCB 2013), it seems that this would be an important stimuli to test before making this very definitively stated conclusion.</i> "
