However, despite its clinical prevalence, very little is known about the action of TMS at the cellular level let alone what effect it might have at the subcellular level (e.g. dendrites). Here, we examine the effect of single-pulse TMS on dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex using an optical fiber imaging approach. We find that TMS causes GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition of sensory-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. We conclude that TMS directly activates fibers within the upper cortical layers that leads to the activation of dendrite-targeting inhibitory neurons which in turn suppress dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. This result implies a specificity of TMS at the dendritic level that could in principle be exploited for investigating these structures non-invasively."

However, despite its clinical prevalence, very little is known about the action of TMS at the cellular level let alone what effect it might have at the subcellular level (e.g. dendrites). Here, we examine the effect of single-pulse TMS on dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex using an optical fiber imaging approach. We find that TMS causes GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition of sensory-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. We conclude that TMS directly activates fibers within the upper cortical layers that leads to the activation of dendrite-targeting inhibitory neurons which in turn suppress dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. This result implies a specificity of TMS at the dendritic level that could in principle be exploited for investigating these structures non-invasively."

As such, it has proved to be an important tool for addressing basic questions about brain function as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fregni and Pascual-Leone, 2007</a>). Stimulation is produced by generating a brief, high-intensity magnetic field by passing a brief electric current through a magnetic coil. As a general rule, TMS affects the action of feedback projections (<a href=\"#bib13\">Juan and Walsh, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hung et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Camprodon et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zanto et al., 2011</a>) leading to a disruption in perception (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shimojo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kammer et al., 2005</a>). Due to this influence on higher\u00a0order cognitive processing, TMS is not only useful for examining the interactions of different brain areas (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pascual-Leone and Walsh, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Silvanto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Murd et al., 2012</a>), but it has also\u00a0been used as a therapeutic method to alleviate some of the symptoms of hemispatial neglect (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nyffeler et al., 2009</a>), schizophrenia including auditory hallucinations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Giesel et al., 2012</a>), pain, depression and epilepsy. Despite great interest (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mueller et al., 2014</a>), the cellular influence of TMS has yet to be ascertained since the precise effects of TMS at the level of a single neuron are very difficult to gauge, particularly in humans."

Furthermore, it has been suggested that active dendritic processing underlies a more general principle of cortical operation that facilitates parallel associations between different cortical regions and the thalamus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Larkum, 2013</a>) which is controlled by dendritic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib32\">Palmer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lovett-Barron and Losonczy, 2014</a>). Establishing the validity of this hypothesis will have important ramifications for understanding brain function as a whole.

We uncover the cellular mechanisms underlying TMS-evoked inhibition, demonstrating that TMS of the rat brain activates long-range fibers that leads to the activation of dendrite-targeting inhibitory neurons in the upper cortical layers which in-turn suppress dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Since indirect brain stimulation shows immense promise in treating many neurological disorders, such as epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berenyi et al., 2012</a>), this study not only illustrates the cellular mechanisms underlying TMS but also highlights dendrites as potential targets for therapeutic approaches."

Although cortical application of Gabazine causes a six-fold increase in the sensory evoked dendritic response (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), block of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors also prevented the TMS-evoked decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to hindpaw stimulation (HS amplitude, 130 \u00b1 30% of control; n = 6; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

TMS itself did not directly activate L5 pyramidal neuron dendrites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; n = 4), contrasting greatly to the large TMS-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in cells within layer 2/3 (L2/3; 3.0 \u00b1 1.1 \u25b3F/F; n = 3; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and layer 1 (L1; 5.5 \u00b1 2.1 \u25b3F/F; n = 12; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

The lack of a direct response to TMS in L5 pyramidal neuron dendrites implies that the inhibition of sensory evoked dendritic transients was mediated by the action of inhibitory neurons.

Therefore, since blocking excitatory AMPA-mediated transmission prevented the TMS inhibitory effect, TMS-evoked inhibition in L5 pyramidal neuron dendrites must be of polysynaptic (indirect) origin. We next tested whether the TMS-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in L1 was also of synaptic origin as TMS influenced cell activity in the upper cortical layers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and therefore possibly provides the TMS-evoked inhibition of L5 dendrites.

TMS alone did not directly activate L5 pyramidal dendrites but instead activated axonal processes coursing through the upper layers and synapsing onto GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediating interneurons in L1. A similar form of\u00a0synaptic activation of interneurons leading to inhibition in L5 pyramidal neuron dendrites has been shown previously with activation of callosal input to the cortex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Palmer et al., 2012</a>). This form of 'silent' inhibition involves the activation of inhibitory conductances which are not detectable at the soma except through their eventual influence on the generation of action potential output. These results therefore highlight an effect of single-pulse TMS on the cortical network, which involves the activation of a specific cortical microcircuit."

                        "text": "The action of TMS at the cellular and network levels is extremely complex and likely constitutes the activation of a range of different cell types leading to multiple effects (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rossi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Siebner et al., 2009</a>). A recent combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the biophysical underpinnings of TMS suggested that the generation of a magnetic field is most likely to evoke firing in cell bodies as opposed to dendrites or axons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pashut et al., 2014</a>). This is consistent with our finding that no dendritic activity was observed with TMS stimulation alone indicating there was no direct activation of the pyramidal cell dendrites and contrasted with the signals found in both L1 and L2/3 neurons following a TMS pulse. It is also consistent with the activation of neurogliaform interneurons in L1 that target the dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons and suppress Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ziemann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Terao and Ugawa, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pashut et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ol\u00e1h et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ol\u00e1h et al., 2009</a>). This form of dendritic inhibition arises from the metabotropic inactivation of L-type (Ca<sub>v</sub>1) channels in the apical dendrite that underlie the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wozny and Williams, 2011</a>) and can last several hundred milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib38\">P\u00e9rez-Garci et al., 2006</a>). The suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can significantly reduce the action potential firing of the pyramidal neuron even when the driving input to the pyramidal neuron is not predominantly dendritic (<a href=\"#bib33\">Palmer et al., 2012</a>). The long time-scale of this form of inhibition (~500 ms) raises interesting consequences for the participation of pyramidal neurons in the cortical network. The similarity of some of the effects of TMS to interhemispheric inhibition has been noted previously in human studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lee, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">P\u00e9rez-Garci et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ferbert et al., 1992</a>) including its mediation via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-activation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ferbert et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kobayashi et al., 2003</a>), although these investigations could not examine the cellular mechanisms."

The effect on dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was the same in both cases. Clearly, the use of TMS coils with rats where the magnetic field generated is comparable to the size of the rat brain itself raises the possibility that the effects in humans may differ. However, the cortical feedback fibers which synapse onto the tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons are located in the part of the cortex closest to the magnetic coil (i.e. L1) in both rats and humans (<a href=\"#bib19\">Larkum et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Larkum, 2013</a>), suggesting there would be overlap with respect to the influence of TMS."

We were interested in this, in particular, because we have previously hypothesized that cell assemblies over different cortical regions might be associated through the activation of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in these neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Larkum, 2013</a>). According to this hypothesis, dendritic activity in these neurons is a\u00a0marker of important cognitive processes. The finding that TMS targets this mechanism is therefore highly relevant to the rationale of the study and may be instructive in understanding current applications of TMS. For instance, TMS has been used to alleviate some of the symptoms of hemispatial neglect (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nyffeler et al., 2009</a>) and auditory hallucinations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Giesel et al., 2012</a>) via unknown inhibitory processes."

OGB-1 AM (50 \u00b5g; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was mixed with 5 \u00b5L of pluronic acid (Pluronic F-127, 20% solution in DMSO, Molecular Probes) for 15\u2009min. The solution was then diluted in 28 \u00b5L of HEPES-buffered solution (125\u2009mM NaCl, 2.5\u2009mM KCl, 10\u2009mM HEPES) and mixed for a further 15\u2009min. The OGB-1 AM solution (1.3\u2009mM) was loaded into a glass pipette (tip diameter: 5\u201315 \u00b5m) and pressure-injected into layer 5 (pressure: 10\u201322 kPa) for 1\u2009min. The pipette was withdrawn and the area of the craniotomy was then resubmerged with rat ringer for 2\u2009hrs. For epifluorescence Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings, light from a blue light-emitting-diode (LED, IBF+LS30W-3W-Slim-RX, Imac Co., Ltd., Shiga, Japan) was passed through an excitation filter, dichroic mirror, and emission filter (as a filter set 31001, Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) and focused onto a fiber bundle by a 10\u00d7 objective (Model E58-372, 0.45 NA, Edmund Optics GmbH, Germany). The fiber bundle (IGN-06/17, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Tokyo, Japan) was used as a combined illuminating/recording fiber and consisted of 17,000 fiber elements. The end face of the bundle was fitted with a prism-lens assembly, which consisted of a right-angle prism (dimension of 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.5\u2009mm, GrinTech, Jena, Germany) attached to a GRIN lens (a diameter of 0.5\u2009mm and a NA of 0.5, GrinTech). In previous studies, the fiber optic \u2018periscope\u2019 was vertically inserted 500\u2009\u03bcm into the brain at a 90\u00b0 angle (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murayama et al., 2009</a>). This ensured that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were recorded from the upper cortical layers. However, in this study, the fiber optic could not be inserted vertically due to the positioning of the TMS coil. Instead, the fiber optic was positioned horizontally on the brain surface (\u2018flat\u2019 periscope). In this configuration, the \u2018flat\u2019 periscope was able to capture the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses as the \u2018vertical\u2019 periscope. As previously reported by (<a href=\"#bib27\">Murayama et al., 2009</a>), TTX application into L5 caused a dramatic increase in L5 dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to hindpaw stimulation using both the \u2018flat\u2019 periscope and the \u2018vertical\u2019 periscope (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). With a focal length nominally 100\u2009\u03bcm and 0.73 \u00d7 magnification (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murayama et al., 2007</a>), the flat periscope configuration resulted in a field of view of 685\u2009\u03bcm diameter restricted to the upper layers of the cortex. A cooled CCD camera operating at either 100\u2009Hz (MicroMax, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) or 2.7 kHz (Redshirt imaging, Decatur, GA) was used for collecting fluorescence. The fluorescence signals were quantified by measuring the mean pixel value of a manually selected ROI for each frame of the image stack using Igor software. Data was acquired on a PC using WinView software (Roper Scientific). Regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen offline for measuring fluorescence changes (see 'Data analysis')."

Experiments were typically performed with a 70-mm coil (exception: during CNQX application, TMS was delivered via a 25-mm coil, see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Figure-of-eight-shaped coil was used as they produce a more focal current which is maximal at the intersection of the two round components (<a href=\"#bib6\">DeFelipe, 2011</a>). The coil was centered on the craniotomy directly above the periscope fiber optic cable and angled approximately parallel to the skull curvature. TTL digital pulses triggered a single pulse TMS at 80\u2013100% stimulation intensity (unless otherwise stated) with an inter-trial interval of at least 9 s to limit fluorescence bleaching. Given this experimental design, the electric field should be approximately ~150\u2013200 V/m (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cohen et al., 1990</a>) magnetic stimulation is comparatively indifferent to the conductive properties of the skull (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wagner et al., 2006</a>), and since the small (3 \u00d7 4.4\u2009mm) craniotomy is therefore unlikely to change the currents produced by the coil. Further, there was no behavioral response of the rat during TMS and increasing TMS strength did not elicit an excitatory response in layer 5 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). When paired with hindpaw stimulus, the TMS was activated 50 ms before the contralateral hindpaw stimulus (&gt; 10 trials per animal). Electrical stimulation of the contralateral hindpaw was achieved by applying a brief (1 ms; 100 V) current onto conductive adhesive strips (approximately 1 cm wide by 2 cm long) placed on the contralateral hindpaw pad. Where stated, hindpaw stimulation was also achieved by a triggered airpuff delivered to within 1 cm of the hindpaw (~40 psi; ~400 ms). All trials were interleaved in each experiment to limit time-dependent effects."

Intensity is increased until the contralateral limb is moved. It is therefore important to add controls or calibrations to the study ('Materials and methods' section). Refinement of TMS strength will have a high impact on the activated neuron types. Interneurons have a lower a spike threshold during TMS stimulation than principal cells. Thus, setting the stimulus intensity will have a large impact on the results. Second, the size of the coils used in the study is usually applied for human studies. This can be considered as focal stimulation for human cortex. However, it may be far from focal for a rat cortex. Thus, the authors should address the issues of locality by changing the location of magnetic stimulation while recording from the same cortical location. Finally, the conclusions from the experimental results point to the direct activation of GABAergic cells by TMS. The manuscript would be markedly improved if the direct activation of GABAergic interneurons could be shown. Finally, the study was focused on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated actions. However, a contribution of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors should also be expected and thus discussed in the manuscript. A discussion on possible pre- versus postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub> in relation to the obtained results should be discussed."

The authors clearly show that TMS triggers neuronal activity in cortical neurons. They present evidence arguing that the activity recorded from dendrites in L1 is due to poly synaptic activation of superficial inhibitory interneurons. This is an important step towards a mechanistic understanding of magnetic stimulation of the nervous system. Unfortunately, due to the way the authors use, or rather abuse, TMS the manuscript is out of context with the general body of scientific knowledge.

While this may not be the reviewer\u2019s main interest, we were nevertheless excited to find that TMS lead to a down-regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in L5 pyramidal dendrites without any direct stimulation of these neurons. This points to a specificity of TMS that was unexpected and is potentially extremely useful. The reviewer asks, \u201cWhy the focus on GABA<sub>B</sub>? It is clear that GABA is released activating both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors\u201d.

This cell type (the neurogliaform neuron) has been well characterized and predominantly mediates its effect through GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors probably due to volume transmission. Furthermore, activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors has a remarkably specific effect blocking dendritic L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (cf Perez-Garci et al., 2013). Here we report that TMS appears to recruit this sub-population of cells and that blocking GABA- B receptors completely occluded the effect of TMS on dendritc Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Given this, it would seem unwise to assume that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors played any significant role in suppressing dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

Of course, further tests need to be made for the extension of these results to other preparations, and these were clearly out of the scope of this study, but the implications of these initial data in rodents could, in our opinion, be enormous. If the reviewer is correct, that under other conditions the situation might change (\u201cat higher TMS intensities, they will observe excitation\u201d), this would not change the prediction that TMS can in principle be used to down-regulate dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity non-invasively (e.g. at lower intensities)."
