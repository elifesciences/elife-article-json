Again, it is difficult to combine and compare the results of experiments on visual learning and olfactory (odour-based) learning because the two experimental approaches are different."

Researchers working on olfactory learning in flies traditionally use sugar as a reward, and electric shocks as a punishment, to induce positive and negative associations with various scents. The flies are then tested to see if they have learnt these associations by giving them a choice of two odours that they can walk towards after training (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In contrast, experiments on visual learning have traditionally involved flying animals (which are tethered) and used heat as a punishment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Furthermore, in this flying paradigm the flies themselves can control if they get punished or not by flying in one direction or the other (termed \u2018operant\u2019 conditioning). Again, it is not surprising that such completely different tests have associated distinct brain regions with learning behaviour."

This in turn controls the position of visual objects (blue and green regions) in the flight arena as the fly moves left or right, towards or away from the objects. Learning is achieved by punishing the fly (by laser heating) when it turns towards one of the objects (the blue region in this case).

Then, they probed the neurons involved in a classical olfactory learning pathway to investigate whether any of these neurons could also process visual memories. A substantial overlap was found: the dopamine neurons that signal punishment or reward for odour learning (<a href=\"#bib9\">Waddell, 2010</a>) and the dopamine receptor that communicates these signals to the mushroom bodies are also required for visual learning. Moreover, the \u2018gamma lobes\u2019 of the mushroom body appear to be involved in both short-term olfactory memories and short-term visual memories, while other neurons in the mushroom body show distinct effects."

First, the work highlights the importance of behavioural context. Earlier work using flying insects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) suggested that the mushroom bodies are not needed for simple visual learning, but are instead required for learning that the same signal or stimulus can have the same meaning in different contexts (e.g., learning that an object can be presented on a blue background or a green background and still be the same object; <a href=\"#bib10\">Wolf et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Liu et al., 1999</a>). By showing that mushroom body circuits are indeed involved in simple visual learning, Vogt Schnaitmann et al. raise the possibility that walking flies and flying flies might use different memory pathways."

                        "text": "Another way that tethered flight and walking paradigms are different for visual learning is the fact that visual stimuli are much better controlled in the former, because the fly always sees the stimuli in the same way (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brembs and Wiener, 2006</a>). As such, walking assays for measuring visual or olfactory learning might implicate the mushroom body precisely because these neurons may be needed by the fly to generalise the context, which is always changing when the flies are free to walk around. Alternatively both the mushroom bodies and the central complex might be required for visual learning in this new assay, which remains a possibility because Vogt, Schnaitmann et al. did not probe central complex neurons."

It is therefore likely that a network of different structures in the fly brain also interact to guide learned behaviours."

                        "text": "Another possible explanation for the overlap found between visual and olfactory learning is that certain circuits in the mushroom body, such as the dopamine-to-gamma-lobe pathway highlighted by Vogt, Schnaitmann et al., are involved in \u2018selective attention\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib7\">van Swinderen et al., 2009</a>). This process describes when an animal concentrates on one aspect of its environment, and the same circuits might be involved regardless of which sense is providing the information (e.g. sight or smell). The mushroom bodies may still respond only to olfactory cues or the central complex to visual cues, but both probably require a common filtering mechanism to allow the fly to decide what to do. By making the assays that test different aspects of memory and learning more comparable, Vogt, Schnaitmann, Tanimoto and co-workers have now placed <i>Drosophila</i> researchers in a better position to understand how the fly brain makes these decisions."
