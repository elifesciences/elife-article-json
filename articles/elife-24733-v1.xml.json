                    "text": "Voltage- and calcium-dependent BK channels regulate calcium-dependent cellular events such as neurotransmitter release by limiting calcium influx. Their plasma membrane abundance is an important factor in determining BK current and thus regulation of calcium-dependent events. In <i>C. elegans</i>, we show that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, promotes the trafficking of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane by shielding them from premature degradation. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 channels undergo aspartic protease DDI-1-dependent degradation, resulting in markedly reduced expression at presynaptic terminals. Loss of <i>erg-28</i> suppressed phenotypic defects of <i>slo-1</i> gain-of-function mutants in locomotion, neurotransmitter release, and calcium-mediated asymmetric differentiation of the AWC olfactory neuron pair, and conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling <i>slo-1</i> loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. Our study thus indicates that the control of BK channel trafficking is a critical regulatory mechanism for synaptic transmission and neural function."

Their plasma membrane abundance is an important factor in determining BK current and thus regulation of calcium-dependent events. In <i>C. elegans</i>, we show that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, promotes the trafficking of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane by shielding them from premature degradation. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 channels undergo aspartic protease DDI-1-dependent degradation, resulting in markedly reduced expression at presynaptic terminals. Loss of <i>erg-28</i> suppressed phenotypic defects of <i>slo-1</i> gain-of-function mutants in locomotion, neurotransmitter release, and calcium-mediated asymmetric differentiation of the AWC olfactory neuron pair, and conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling <i>slo-1</i> loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. Our study thus indicates that the control of BK channel trafficking is a critical regulatory mechanism for synaptic transmission and neural function."

These roles of BK channels result from the unique feature that full activation of the BK channel requires coincidental membrane depolarization and elevation in free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fakler and Adelman, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</a>). BK channel activity is regulated by many factors including post-translational modifications, associating auxiliary subunits, its localization at the plasma membrane, and the number of channels expressed at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim and Oh, 2016</a>). Despite its importance, how BK channel density at the plasma membrane is determined is not well understood. Several proteins have been reported to affect the surface membrane expression of BK channels. For instance, cytoskeletal proteins and cytoskeleton-interacting proteins, including actin, microtubule-associated protein 1A, and filamin A, are reported to alter the level of BK channels at the plasma membrane in vitro (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tian et al., 2006</a>). A recent study showed that cereblon mediates the interaction of BK channels with CRL4A E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which causes ubiquitination of BK channels and their retention in the ER (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Blocking BK channel ubiquitination or disrupting the interaction between BK channels and CRL4A E3 ubiquitin ligase was shown to increase the surface expression of BK channels in vitro in transfected primary cultured neurons. However, most of the studies on BK channel trafficking have been performed in heterologous cells that are designed to overexpress BK channels. For this reason, whether proteins that are reported to influence BK channel trafficking in vitro alter BK channel levels in vivo has not been clearly addressed."

In addition to the expression level at the plasma membrane, SLO-1 localization at specific membrane microdomains also plays an important role in determining SLO-1 function. <i>C. elegans</i> genetic studies identified genes that control the localization of SLO-1 channels in both muscles and neurons: The dystrophin complex localizes SLO-1 channels near calcium channels in the sarcolemma of body wall muscle (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2009</a>). It was also shown that alpha-catulin and dystrobrevin hierarchically organize BK channels near calcium channels at presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Oh et al., 2015</a>)."

Once completely folded and assembled, most plasma membrane proteins are packaged in cargo vesicles that exit from the ER through the COPII-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>). It appears that proteins with multiple transmembrane domains require ER membrane chaperons and cargo adaptor proteins for their efficient exit from the ER. For example, yeast Erv14 is a cargo receptor that links many client membrane proteins to the COPII coat adaptor and is required for the efficient trafficking of many polytopic membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herzig et al., 2012</a>). It is not known if the BK channel requires an ER chaperone, or a cargo receptor for its efficient trafficking. In our present study, we identified an ER membrane protein that promotes BK channel expression at the plasma membrane."

We found that ERG-28 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is required for the trafficking of SLO-1 to the plasma membrane. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 is not efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane and undergoes degradation. Accordingly, <i>erg-28</i> mutants exhibit phenotypes of <i>slo-1</i> loss-of-function mutants including ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior. Thus, ERG-28 offers a new regulatory point that controls the synaptic abundance of SLO-1 and thus neurotransmitter release."

The ERG28 protein sequence has diverged in higher organisms (<a href=\"#bib57\">Veitia and Hurst, 2001</a>). These homologues possess four predicted transmembrane domains instead of the two transmembrane domains found in yeast and have acquired the ER retention/retrieval motif in the C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although <i>C. elegans</i> ERG-28 retains four transmembrane domains and the ER retention/retrieval motif, it is further diverged from mammalian ERG28 proteins; it shows 22.2% identity (56.4% similarity) with the human homolog C14orf1 based on a non-overlapping local alignment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A nonsense mutation in <i>cim16</i> leaves the coding sequence intact, except for seven amino acids at the C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To ascertain that the genetic defect in <i>erg-28</i> is responsible for the suppression of the <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> phenotype rather than a background mutation, we tested two other independently isolated alleles, <i>erg-28(gk697770)</i> and <i>erg-28(tm6168)</i>, which were generated by the Million Mutation Project (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thompson et al., 2013</a>) and the National BioResource Project, respectively. The <i>erg-28(gk697770)</i> allele has a nonsense mutation in the 33rd amino acid residue and the <i>erg-28(tm6168)</i> allele is a deletion/insertion allele that introduces a nonsense codon at 145th amino acid residue in addition to the deletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Both alleles also suppressed the sluggish movement of <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> mutants to a level similar to <i>cim16</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although the phenotypes of the three alleles are indistinguishable, the <i>erg-28(gk697770)</i> allele is predicted to be most severe based on the location of its nonsense mutation site.

We examined if <i>erg-28</i> mutation suppresses these phenotypes as well. <i>erg-28</i> mutation was partially able to suppress the egg laying defect, as <i>erg-28(gk697770) slo-1(ky399gf)</i> double mutants retained less eggs than the <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> single mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A pair of AWC olfactory neurons differentiates into two distinctive subtypes; one that expresses the <i>str-2</i> gene (AWC<sup>ON</sup>) and the other that does not (AWC<sup>OFF</sup>). Contrary to wild-type animals, over 90% of the <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> mutant animals express the <i>str-2</i> gene in both of the AWC neurons (2 AWC<sup>ON</sup>). <i>erg-28</i> mutation was able to suppress this <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> phenotype, as less than 30% of the <i>erg-28(gk697770) slo-1(ky399gf)</i> double mutant animals express <i>str-2</i> genes in both AWC neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The asymmetric <i>str-2</i> gene expression is governed by a calcium signaling pathway involving <i>unc-2/unc-36</i> voltage-gated calcium channels and downstream CaMKII, <i>unc-43</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alqadah et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schumacher et al., 2012</a>). <i>erg-28</i> mutation was not able to suppress the 2 AWC<sup>ON</sup> phenotype of the <i>unc-43</i> mutant and minimally suppressed the <i>unc-36</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These results place <i>erg-28</i> upstream of <i>unc-43</i> and parallel to <i>unc-2/unc-36,</i> suggesting <i>erg-28</i> is most likely to act on <i>slo-1</i>. Taken together we conclude that <i>erg-28</i> mutation suppresses the phenotypic defects of the <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> mutant in general and mutation in <i>erg-28</i> is most likely to result in a\u00a0reduction of SLO-1 function."

Our previous study showed that <i>slo-1</i> loss-of-function mutants exhibit a prolonged evoked synaptic response, whereas <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> mutants exhibit a reduced evoked synaptic response (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sancar et al., 2011</a>). Hence, we reasoned that if the underlying mechanism for the suppression of <i>slo-1 (ky399gf)</i> by <i>erg-28</i> mutation is reduction of SLO-1 function, it is expected that <i>erg-28</i> mutant would exhibit increased synaptic transmission. First, we sought to determine the pharmacological sensitivity to aldicarb, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. While mutant animals with decreased levels of cholinergic synaptic transmission are resistant to aldicarb-mediated paralysis, mutants with increased levels of synaptic transmission are hypersensitive to aldicarb (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mahoney et al., 2006</a>). We found that <i>erg-28(gk697770)</i> animals are hypersensitive to aldicarb. Furthermore, <i>erg-28</i> mutation suppresses the aldicarb-resistant phenotype of <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Next, we employed electrophysiology to further examine the effect of <i>erg-28</i> mutation on SLO-1 function in synaptic transmission. We compared evoked current responses at the neuromuscular junctions of wild-type, <i>erg-28(gk697770)</i>, <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i>, and <i>erg-28(gk697770) slo-1(ky399gf)</i> double mutant animals. We did not observe a higher evoked response in <i>erg-28</i> relative to wild-type animals, whereas <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> animals showed a reduced evoked response and faster decay kinetics compared to wild-type and <i>erg-28</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). <i>erg-28</i> mutation significantly improved the reduced evoked response of <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> mutants, but not decay kinetics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>). Together, these results support the hypothesis that ERG-28 reduces SLO-1 synaptic function."

                                "text": "The <i>erg-28</i> gene forms an operon with <i>C14C10.5</i>, which encodes a homolog of proteasome activator subunit 4 (PSME4) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The shared promoter region, 2.5 kb upstream of <i>C14C10.5</i>, was fused to GFP coding sequence, and the resulting construct was used to determine the tissue expression pattern of <i>erg-28</i>. The expression of <i>erg-28</i> was found in many different tissues, including muscles, intestine, and neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Promoters of operons are often promiscuous and expression of individual genes in the operons is controlled at a post-transcriptional level (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blumenthal, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blumenthal et al., 2015</a>). Thus, to evaluate <i>erg-28</i> gene expression, we generated an integrated transgenic line that expresses mCherry-tagged ERG-28 driven by the shared 2.5 kb promoter. In this transgenic line, ERG-28 expression is observed mainly in neurons and muscles, where SLO-1 is predominantly expressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). After establishing its expression pattern, we analyzed the subcellular localization of ERG-28 in neurons by expressing GFP-tagged ERG-28 in a subset of motor neurons (9 DA and DB cholinergic motor neurons) using 2.4 kb <i>unc-129</i> promoter along with the ER and Golgi markers. Localization of GFP-tagged ERG-28 most likely reflects endogenous ERG-28 localization, since GFP-tagged ERG-28 was able to rescue the loss of ERG-28 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Cell bodies and dendrites of the DA and DB neurons are located in the ventral cord, and their axons are located in the dorsal cord, thus allowing us to distinguish axons from dendrites (<a href=\"#bib9\">Colavita et al., 1998</a>). We found that ERG-28 is abundantly expressed proximal to neuronal nuclei and localized as distinct puncta throughout the synaptic terminals and dendrites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). ERG-28 puncta co-localize well with the ER marker (mCherry::PISY-1) and exhibit minimal co-localization with the Golgi marker (AMAN-2::mCherry) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These results are consistent with previous studies that the ER extends to axonal and dendritic neural processes in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brockie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rolls et al., 2002</a>). Importantly, the distribution of ERG-28 is not restricted to axon or dendrites, indicating that ERG-28 does not have axon-dendrite polarity. Like mammalian ERG28, the <i>C. elegans</i> ERG-28 C-terminus has a well-established consensus ER retrieval/retention motif (KKXX-COOH), which interacts with coat protein complex I (COPI) that mediates retrograde transport of target proteins from the <i>cis</i>-end of the Golgi complex to the ER, thereby ensuring the ER localization of the target proteins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jackson, 2014</a>). When GFP-tagged <i>erg-28\u03947</i> lacking 7 amino acids at the C terminus as in <i>cim16</i> allele was expressed in the DA and DB motor neurons, the overall expression was significantly decreased and normal punctate structures were no longer visible (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We cannot determine if the functional defect of the <i>cim16</i> allele is due to a structural instability independently of defective ER localization or localization defect caused by the absence of the ER retrieval sequence. Since the <i>cim16</i> allele suppresses <i>slo-1(ky399gf)</i> allele as effectively as <i>gk697770</i> allele (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), it is very likely that the C-terminal 7 amino acids are important for the stable expression and localization of ERG-28. The presence of the COPI binding motif in ERG-28 strongly suggests that ERG-28 shuttles between ER and Golgi. Indeed, we find that some of the ERG-28 puncta are mobile (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These observations suggest that ERG-28 is localized to the ER membrane through COPI interaction."

By contrast, mCherry-tagged AMAN-2 shows a completely different pattern from that of mCherry-tagged PISY-1 and does not co-localize with GFP-tagged ERG-28 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results together indicate that ERG-28 localizes to the ER."

Yeast ERG28 is a gene necessary for ergosterol (a cholesterol derivative) biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mo and Bard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mo et al., 2004</a>) and functions as a molecular scaffold for sterol biosynthetic enzymes in ER membranes. Nematodes (<i>C. elegans</i>) and arthropods (<i>Drosophil</i>a) cannot synthesize sterol de novo because of the lack of key biosynthetic enzymes. They must therefore obtain sterol via dietary intake. Nonetheless, <i>C. elegans</i> possesses a few genes that are homologous to yeast ERG28p-binding ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme genes. We found that unlike <i>erg-28</i>, none of the tested mutations in these candidate biosynthetic genes (<i>erg-24 (tm3499)</i>, <i>erg-26 (tm1941)</i>, <i>erg-6 (tm1781)</i>) suppressed the sluggish movement of <i>slo-1</i>(<i>ky399gf</i>) (<b>Data not shown</b>), raising the possibility that the suppression of the <i>slo-1(gf)</i> phenotype by <i>erg-28</i> does not occur through the modulation of sterol synthesis pathway per se, although it is possible that these genes function redundantly in modulating cholesterol."

To measure the SLO-1 expression and localization in vivo, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology to fuse GFP to the C-terminus of SLO-1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The edited line, <i>cim105[slo-1::GFP],</i> designed to tag all of 12 SLO-1 isoforms (<a href=\"#bib22\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>), does not show any obvious behavioral phenotypes found in <i>slo-1</i> loss-of-function mutants, such as exaggerated head bending during forward movement, and its locomotory speed was also comparable to that of the wild type animals (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>), indicating that GFP fusion to the C-terminus of SLO-1 in <i>cim105</i> animals does not perturb in vivo SLO-1 function. While weak, diffused SLO-1 channels can be detected in the nerve ring, SLO-1 channels are mainly observed in neurons and muscles as discrete puncta (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>)."

In wild-type muscles, SLO-1::GFP showed the same puncta pattern as previously reported using transgenic animals (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham et al., 2010</a>). In <i>erg-28(gk697770)</i> and <i>erg-28(cim16)</i> mutants, a similar puncta pattern was observable, although the expression level was drastically reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). When measured by western analysis using whole animals, the total amount of SLO-1 was reduced in <i>erg-28</i> mutants, confirming the overall reduction of SLO-1 amount (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). To further confirm that the reduction of SLO-1 is due to <i>erg-28</i> mutations, we examined if transgenic expression of ERG-28 would restore SLO-1 expression at the plasma membrane. We introduced an integrated transgenic array that expresses mCherry-tagged ERG-28 under the control of its own promoter into <i>erg-28 (gk697770) slo-1(cim105)</i> mutant animals and determined SLO-1 expression levels. The expression of mCherry-tagged ERG-28 restored the SLO-1::GFP expression to a level comparable to the heterozygotic expression of SLO-1::GFP (one copy of untagged SLO-1 and one copy of GFP-tagged SLO-1) in both neurons and muscles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>)."

To examine if SLO-1::GFP puncta in <i>erg-28</i> mutant are correctly localized at the presynaptic terminals as in the wild type animals, we generated a line that expresses fRFP fused ELKS-1, an active zone marker, by genome editing (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). First, the genome edited line, <i>cim107[elks-1::fRFP],</i> was crossed with <i>cim105</i> and we examined whether SLO-1::GFP co-localizes with ELKS-1::fRFP. We find that SLO-1::GFP and ELKS-1::fRFP are well co-localized although we occasionally observed that some SLO-1::GFP puncta that did not co-localize with ELKS-1::fRFP, and <i>vice versa</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). While we and others previously observed broad SLO-1 expression in cell bodies of neurons with integrated transgenic lines (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Oh et al., 2015</a>), we did not observe such expression in the cell bodies with <i>cim105[slo-1::GFP]</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In the <i>erg-28</i> mutant, the SLO-1 puncta were co-localized with ELKS-1::fRFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). These results indicate that ERG-28 is required for the normal level of SLO-1 expression in muscles and neurons, but not for the localization at either presynaptic terminals or dense bodies in muscles."

How is an ER resident protein required for the normal expression of a plasma membrane localized protein? As a plasma membrane-localized protein, SLO-1 must be trafficked through the ER and Golgi complex to its final location at the plasma membrane. Thus, ERG-28 is likely to play a role during the biogenesis of SLO-1 in the ER or transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. Given their steady state localization and the mobile nature of ERG-28, the interaction between ERG-28 and SLO-1 is expected to be transient, if it occurs at all. Indeed, we find that SLO-1::GFP puncta rarely co-localize with mCherry::ERG-28 puncta although potential co-localization can be occasionally observed in neuronal cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, ERG-28 is most likely to function in ER for the efficient trafficking of SLO-1 to the plasma membrane."

However, SLO-1 accumulation in the ER was not observed in <i>erg-28</i> mutants. Thus, we hypothesized that in the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 is degraded by the proteasome. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) would increase SLO-1 expression in the ER or at the plasma membrane. When <i>erg-28</i> mutant animals were grown in the presence of bortezomib, SLO-1 expression at presynaptic terminals, but not in cell bodies, was increased by 50%, while the wild type animals showed no statistically significant change (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This suggests that ERG-28 protects SLO-1 from degradation in the ER and is not an obligatory factor for SLO-1 exit from the ER. Thus, the lower expression level of SLO-1 at the plasma membrane in <i>erg-28</i> mutant is at least in part due to proteasomal degradation."

From this approach, we identified <i>ddi-1</i> as a gene that participates in the degradation of SLO-1 in <i>erg-28</i> mutants. <i>ddi-1</i> is an orthologue of yeast and human DDI1, which is thought to be a shuttling factor that delivers ubiquitinated substrates to proteasomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gabriely et al., 2008</a>). In yeast, DDI-1 appears to act as a negative regulator for general exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2011</a>). Compared to wild type, the <i>ddi-1(ok1468)</i> single mutant did not show any significant difference in SLO-1 expression level in neurons and muscles. However, <i>ddi-1(ok1468);erg-28(gk697770)</i> double mutants showed a significantly higher expression of SLO-1 at the plasma membrane than the <i>erg-28(gk697770)</i> single mutant, albeit to a lesser extent than wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). Taken together, we conclude that ERG-28 promotes SLO-1 channel trafficking to the plasma membrane by shielding SLO-1 channels from proteasomal degradation."

This suggests that there is a quantitative correlation between the degree of alcohol sensitivity and the amount of SLO-1 expression at presynaptic terminals.

While the alcohol sensitivity of the <i>ddi-1</i> mutant was not different from the wild type, <i>ddi-1;erg-28</i> double mutants were more sensitive than <i>erg-28</i> single mutants.

Calcium influx is precisely controlled by several layers of regulatory mechanisms. The BK channel is one of the important negative regulators of calcium influx. The efflux of K<sup>+</sup> repolarizes the synaptic terminal, thereby limiting the duration of voltage-gated calcium channel activity. The BK channel current is impacted by many factors, including channel-associated auxiliary factors, post-translational channel modifications, and the number of the channels expressed at the plasma membrane. Our study demonstrates that the density of BK channels at presynaptic terminals influences synaptic transmission and neuronal function, and that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, promotes the transport of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane. In <i>erg-28</i> mutants, the number of SLO-1 channels at presynaptic terminals is drastically reduced, leading to an alcohol resistance, and the suppression of phenotypic defects of <i>slo-1(gf)</i> mutants such as locomotory behavior, synaptic transmission, and altered chemosensory receptor gene expression."

In higher organisms, however, ERG28 appears to have diverged from yeast ERG28 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vinci et al., 2008</a>). The number of ERG28 transmembrane domains changed from two to four, and its C-terminus acquired a COPI binding consensus sequence, which allows for recycling between the ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). While the involvement of ERG28 in cholesterol synthesis has not been studied in mammals, a recent study in <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed that ERG28 tethers C4 demethylase components, but does not interrupt the sterol pathways (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mialoundama et al., 2013</a>). Instead, mutation in <i>ERG28</i> results in accumulation of cryptic sterol biosynthetic intermediates and consequent inhibition of polar auxin transport. <i>C. elegans</i> is not able to synthesize cholesterol de novo, and thus obtains the final sterol products from plants or mammals, such as ergosterol, sitosterol, and cholesterol. In the laboratory, cholesterol is added into the culture medium to maintain <i>C. elegans</i>. Substitution of cholesterol with lanosterol, which is a precursor of cholesterol that has a C4 methyl group, does not allow <i>C. elegans</i> growth (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). Furthermore, <i>C. elegans</i> does not possess biologically active known cholesterol C4 methyl derivatives (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mahanti et al., 2014</a>). Our analysis shows that the genes we examined that encode candidate C4 demethylase enzymes do not affect SLO-1 function. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility that distantly related C4 demethylase components redundantly influence SLO-1 function, it is possible that ERG-28 may function independently of sterol synthesis. For instance, it is reported that hERG28 interacts with CLN8, an ER-resident membrane protein involved in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Passantino et al., 2013</a>). CLN8 mutation in humans causes altered levels of sphingolipid and phospholipid. Whether ERG-28 directly mediates SLO-1 channel folding and trafficking or indirectly fosters the lipid environment conducive to SLO-1 channel folding and trafficking needs to be further investigated."

                        "text": "In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 expression is drastically reduced at presynaptic terminals and muscle excitation sites and inhibition of proteasome function can partially restore the SLO-1 expression and function. This suggests that in the absence of ERG-28 in the ER, functional SLO-1 channels can still be transported to the plasma membrane. Also, in the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 does not appear to accumulate in cell bodies. Thus, ERG-28 is not an obligatory factor necessary for the ER exit of SLO-1. Plasma membrane-localized channels and receptors are folded and assembled in the ER and this process is closely monitored by the ER resident protein quality control system to ensure that only correctly folded and assembled channels are trafficked forward to the plasma membrane and to avoid aggregation of misfolded hydrophobic transmembrane domains. It is not clearly understood how cells discriminate folding/assembly intermediates from misfolded proteins in ER. In yeast, amino acid permeases require an ER chaperone to ensure that folding intermediates are not targeted for degradation prematurely, thereby facilitating trafficking to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kota et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kuehn et al., 1996</a>). The SLO-1 channel consists of four pore-forming \u03b1 subunits and auxiliary subunits, and may require a molecular chaperone that aids channel folding and assembly. Our data support the model in which ERG-28 acts as a chaperone for SLO-1 channel folding/assembly intermediates so that they are not prematurely recognized as misfolded proteins and targeted for degradation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is also possible that ERG-28 may participate in SLO-1 channel trafficking. Designated ER proteins for specific ion channel folding/assembly and trafficking are common, and include RIC-3 that promotes nicotinic acetylcholine receptor surface expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Halevi et al., 2002</a>), CALF-1 that facilitates synaptic localization of UNC-2 voltage-gated calcium channels (<a href=\"#bib47\">Saheki and Bargmann, 2009</a>), and NLF-1 that regulates axonal localization of NALC channels (<a href=\"#bib61\">Xie et al., 2013</a>). Currently, we cannot demonstrate if there is a direct physical interaction between SLO-1 and ERG-28 in vivo. We predict that the physical interaction would be transient and restricted to the folding/assembly intermediates of SLO-1 channels. It is also likely that ERG-28 has other functions independent of SLO-1 channels. For example, ERG-28 is equally distributed to the dendrites and axons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), whereas SLO-1 is relatively specific to axons, suggesting its involvement in the\u00a0trafficking of dendritic membrane proteins. Further studies are needed to identify additional targets of ERG-28 function."

The aspartyl proteinase domain of the yeast DDI1 is important for its function as a negative regulator of general secretion. Recently, the aspartyl proteinase activity of DDI-1 was shown to be required for the activation of the ER-associated SKN-1 isoform during proteasomal dysfunction in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</a>).

This method is based on the observation that if one gene undergoes a double strand break (DBS) and subsequent homologous repair, the second gene that is targeted together with the first in the same injection is more likely to undergo \u2018co-conversion\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arribere et al., 2014</a>). Specifically, we injected into the gonads of wild-type hermaphrodites a DNA mixture that includes a <i>slo-1</i> sgRNA construct and a repair GFP plasmid construct, a <i>dpy-10</i> sgRNA construct and a <i>dpy-10</i> homologous repair oligonucleotide (99 bp). The <i>dpy-10</i> sgRNA will lead to a DSB, and its aberrant non-homologous end-joining repair will lead to the Dpy (dumpy) phenotype in F2 homozygous animals. However, if this DSB is repaired by a homologous repair oligonucleotide, which contains a dominant mutation, the resulting F1 animals will exhibit the dominant Rol (roller) phenotype. We picked Rol animals in the F1 and genotyped them for GFP insertion. For a reason we cannot explain, the efficiency of <i>slo-1</i> CRISPR and homologous repair was extremely low, even though we tried 10 different <i>slo-1</i> sgRNAs and several different repair constructs. We injected over 350 animals, screened over 1200 F1 Rol lines for \u2018co-conversion\u2019 by PCR, and recovered only one line in which GFP is correctly inserted in-frame into the 9 bp upstream from the end of the <i>slo-1</i> gene. The same \u2018co-conversion\u2019 method was used for the insertion of FusionRed to the last exon of the <i>elks-1</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We chose FusionRed for tagging because, despite its low brightness, it exhibits a monomeric property and low toxicity (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shemiakina et al., 2012</a>)."

The two key experiments that would alleviate these concerns are:a) rescue the mutant phenotype with a fluorescent protein-tagged version of the protein, (using low copy transgenes to minimize \"clogging\" up the secretory pathway. b) improve the ER vs. Golgi analysis by expressing the protein in muscle where subcellular structures are easier to localize."

The authors propose a model in which ERG-28 controls BK potassium channel trafficking in the ER to regulate synaptic function.

Two different fusions proteins to ERG-28 are used (mCherry and GFP). In both cases, it is not precisely established that these protein fusions are functional. This is a crucial point since tagging such a small protein with a much larger fluorescent molecule can have strongly deleterious effects on protein folding and potentially subcellular localization. In addition, transgenic expression with extrachromosomal arrays almost always leads to over-expression, which for transmembrane proteins can lead to erroneous accumulation of proteins in the ER. Finally, localizing transmembrane proteins to ER versus Golgi compartments is a difficult task in <i>C. elegans</i> neurons given their small size. Indeed, diffraction limited microscopy used here cannot resolve compartments so closely juxtaposed within neuronal processes. These experiments could for example be repeated in body wall muscle cells where subcellular compartments can be more clearly distinguished. In the absence of a clear demonstration that ERG-28 is indeed an ER-resident protein, the same data could also support other interpretations, e.g. ERG-28 could be required for the stability of SLO-1 channels at the cell surface by modulating channel recycling instead of promoting trafficking from the ER."

Along the same lines, in the absence of a proper rescue experiment, it is essential to analyze at least two different alleles to demonstrate that the observed phenotype is indeed due to mutations in <i>erg-28</i> and not unknown background mutations.

In addition to these new results, ERG-28 has a well-defined classical ER retention/retrieval sequence motif, -KKXX-COOH, which is also called the dilysine motif. In fact, other studies have shown that this dilysine motif in the C-terminus is critical for determining ER localization. For example, a Golgi protein can be redistributed to the ER by attaching this dilysine motif to its C- terminus (Gorleku et al.). Another example is that a gap junction protein can be trapped in the ER by attaching this motif (Maza et al.). The mutant, <i>cim16</i>, that we isolated in our unbiased genetic screen has a mutation that deletes 7 C- terminal amino acid residues. The phenotype of this mutant is comparable to that of another allele <i>gk697770</i> that has a nonsense mutation in the beginning of the coding sequence."

Two different fusions proteins to ERG-28 are used (mCherry and GFP). In both cases, it is not precisely established that these protein fusions are functional. This is a crucial point since tagging such a small protein with a much larger fluorescent molecule can have strongly deleterious effects on protein folding and potentially subcellular localization. In addition, transgenic expression with extrachromosomal arrays almost always leads to over-expression, which for transmembrane proteins can lead to erroneous accumulation of proteins in the ER. Finally, localizing transmembrane proteins to ER versus Golgi compartments is a difficult task in C. elegans neurons given their small size. Indeed, diffraction limited microscopy used here cannot resolve compartments so closely juxtaposed within neuronal processes. These experiments could for example be repeated in body wall muscle cells where subcellular compartments can be more clearly distinguished. In the absence of a clear demonstration that ERG-28 is indeed an ER-resident protein, the same data could also support other interpretations, e.g. ERG-28 could be required for the stability of SLO-1 channels at the cell surface by modulating channel recycling instead of promoting trafficking from the ER.</i>"

We used the <i>unc-129</i> promoter in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> instead of the H20 promoter because we felt that the pan-neuronal H20 promoter was not suitable for investigating subcellular localization of GFP::ERG-28. Pan-neuronal expression of GFP::ERG-28 from the H20 promoter makes it difficult to discern axons, dendrites, and individual cell bodies because of the high density of neurons in the ventral cord. By contrast, because the <i>unc-129</i> promoter drives expression only in the DA/DB cholinergic motor neurons, the exact localization of GFP::ERG-28 in axons, dendrites, and cell bodies is easily discernible. The DA/DB neurons innervate the dorsal body wall muscle that is essential for forward and backward movements (As described in our previous response, <i>erg-28</i> is likely to be expressed in these neurons). For this reason, the <i>unc-129</i> promoter has been widely used to investigate the localization or dynamics of GFP-tagged synaptic proteins by ourselves and others. For example, we previously used the <i>unc-129</i> promoter to study presynaptic localization of SLO-1 and the UNC-2 voltage gated calcium channel (Oh et al. BMC Neuroscience (2015) 16:26). Over-expression of the plasma membrane proteins may lead to a minor ectopic ER localization in addition to their normal localization. In the case of ERG-28, we did not find any other localization besides ER with our imaging setup. While we used the H20 and <i>unc-129</i> promoters to express GFP-tagged ERG-28 for specific purposes, it is unlikely that these different promoters would make a profound difference to the subcellular localization of ERG-28."
