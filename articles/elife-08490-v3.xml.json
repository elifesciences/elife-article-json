In this study, we mined publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomic data sets to identify 12,498 high-confidence viral genomes linked to their microbial hosts. These data augment public data sets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7\u201338% of \u2018unknown\u2019 sequence space in viromes. Genome- and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that (i) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and (ii) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited. Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and coinfection prevalences, as well as evaluation of in silico virus\u2013host linkage predictions. Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes."

In this study, we mined publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomic data sets to identify 12,498 high-confidence viral genomes linked to their microbial hosts. These data augment public data sets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7\u201338% of \u2018unknown\u2019 sequence space in viromes. Genome- and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that (i) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and (ii) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited. Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and coinfection prevalences, as well as evaluation of in silico virus\u2013host linkage predictions. Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes."

This is because the lack of a universal marker gene for viruses hinders environmental survey capabilities, while the number of isolate viral genomes in databases remains limited: for comparison, more than 25,000 bacterial and archaeal host genomes are available in NCBI RefSeq (January 2015), whereas only 1,531 of their viruses were entirely sequenced and most (86%) of these derive from only 3 of 61 known host phyla (<a href=\"#bib68\">Roux et al., 2015a</a>). Thus, although advances in high-throughput sequencing expand the bounds of viral sequence space, these data sets are dominated by uncharacterized sequences (usually 60\u201395%), termed \u2018viral dark matter\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Reyes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Youle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brum and Sullivan, 2015</a>).

These \u2018extrachromosomal prophages\u2019 (also termed \u2018plasmid prophage\u2019) exist outside the microbial chromosome until induced to undergo lytic replication. These have been known to occur for decades (e.g., coliphage P1, <a href=\"#bib73\">Sternberg and Austin, 1981</a>), though their abundance in nature is unknown. Second, some phages can enter a \u2018chronic\u2019 cycle, in which they replicate in the cell outside of the host chromosome, and produce virions that are extruded without killing their host (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abedon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rakonjac et al., 2011</a>). Third, a phage \u2018carrier state\u2019 has been observed, in which a lytic phage is maintained and multiplied within a cultivated host population without measurable effect on cell growth (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bast\u00edas et al., 2010</a>). This phenomenon is thought to arise due to the presence of both resistant and sensitive cells that frequently transition between these two states. Sometimes also termed \u2018partial resistance\u2019, such states that enable the coexistence of phage and host in culture have now been observed in different systems (<i>Vibrio</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Flavobacterium</i>), and are linked to slight decreases in growth rate or cell concentration but no host cell clearing as would be observed for \u2018typical\u2019 lytic viruses (i.e., plaque formation), thus could go unnoticed in a microbial cell culture (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fischer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carey-Smith et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Middelboe et al., 2009</a>). All three of these lesser studied types of infection would result in the assembly of viral sequences outside of the main host chromosome in a microbial genome sequencing project and could be a new type of viral signal in modern microbial genomic data sets due to deep sequencing and public release of draft (i.e., not completely assembled) genomic sequences."

Evolutionarily, we posit that while co-infection by multiple viruses appears common, the consistency of so many VCs with ICTV taxonomy suggests that most phage genomes harbor a largely vertically inherited core gene set as detected for marine T4-like populations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ignacio-Espinoza and Sullivan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Marston et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Deng et al., 2014</a>) rather than the rampant mosaicism paradigm largely derived from <i>Siphoviridae</i> genomes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hendrix et al., 1999</a>). While data remain limited to a subset of the known microbial phyla, it might be that viral infection modes influence the tempo of their genome evolution. Specifically, we posit that horizontal gene transfer is more prevalent in phages that occupy host cells longer due to lysogenic or chronic infection stages and/or infect densely packed hosts (e.g., biofilms or clumped life stages) as these parameters would increase the probability of co-infection. Perhaps then, at least for more highly lytic viral groups, genome-based clustering approaches can now be leveraged for their taxonomic predictive value as suggested over a decade ago (<a href=\"#bib66\">Rohwer and Edwards, 2002</a>)."

Beyond the above-noted expansion of viruses to novel hosts, we next examined these patterns on a global scale by constructing a virus\u2013host interaction network based on database-available taxa. When considering viral diversity at the genus level, the network displays a modular topology (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Such modularity in virus\u2013host interaction networks suggests that hosts are specifically associated with particular viruses (<a href=\"#bib77\">Weitz et al., 2012</a>), probably reflecting long-term coevolution between microbial hosts and their viruses. Such modular structure was expected, but not observed in previous virus\u2013host interaction network studies, likely due to the short phylogenetic distances between hosts evaluated in available data sets (<a href=\"#bib27\">Flores et al., 2011</a>). The modular network presented here derives from a data set spanning 18 phyla across bacterial and archaeal domains. These results confirmed the prediction that \u2018at macroevolutionary scales, host\u2013phage interaction matrices should be typified by a modular structure\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Flores et al., 2011</a>), as also had been observed across 215 phage types against 286 host types of unknown diversity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Flores et al., 2013</a>)."

Our expectations were that prophages would be largely optimized towards the genome of their host, but that genome composition of the extrachromosomal category would be less correlated. Particularly, as cyanophage host range breadth scales with the number of tRNA genes encoded by the virus (<a href=\"#bib23\">Enav et al., 2012</a>), we expected that genome composition of viral genomes with many tRNA genes might have poor correlation to that of their host genomes, assuming that the viral-encoded tRNA genes could compensate for codon mismatches across hosts. However, these latter expectations were not met as viral and host genome composition correlations were strong regardless of the number of viral-encoded tRNA genes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which suggests that host-optimized viral genome composition may be beneficial even when the virus encodes its own tRNA genes."

This contrasts with a previous analysis of 500 phage genomes that did not detect any difference between dsDNA and ssDNA genomes adaptations to their host's genome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cardinale and Duffy, 2011</a>). One ssDNA viral group, the <i>Microviridae</i>, had a reduced signal for genome composition metrics except for codon usage where its signal was comparable to that of the dsDNA viruses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Although this could indicate a bias linked to the small genome size of these viruses (around 5 kb), dsDNA viruses' genomes subsampled to similar sizes displayed a minimal signal loss (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which suggests other mechanisms may be driving this lower genome composition adaptation in <i>Microviridae</i>. Another ssDNA group, the <i>Inoviridae</i> had reduced genome composition and codon usage adaptation signals. Again, because <i>Inoviridae</i> release virions without killing their hosts, it is possible that the virus is exposed to host resources over a much longer time interval, lowering the selection pressure toward transcription and translation speed and efficiency, which is the main mechanism thought to drive genome composition and codon usage adaptation of viral genomes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cardinale and Duffy, 2011</a>)."

When the host database included all host genomes, this host prediction was 99% accurate at both the family and genus level for virus\u2013host TNF distances lower than 4.10<sup>\u221204</sup>, 88%/51% (family/genus level) for TNF distances ranging between 4.10<sup>\u221204</sup> and 1.10<sup>\u221203</sup>, and 70%/37% for distances greater than 10<sup>\u221203</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). When genomes from the actual host species are excluded, the accuracy of host prediction drops slightly (95%, 83%/30%, 67%/30% for the same distance ranges), and even more when all genomes from the host genus are excluded (70% and 37% at the family level, no correct genus could be predicted in that case, and only one distance lower than 4.10<sup>\u221204</sup> was observed, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

This data set also likely harbor novel biology beyond the global patterns of viral diversity and virus\u2013host interactions presented in this manuscript, to be revealed through analyses targeted toward specific viral or host subgroups. To facilitate these follow-up studies, VirSorter curated data set is made available through two complementary websites: MetaVir and iVirus. MetaVir (project \u2018VirSorter\u2019, data set \u2018VirSorter curated data set\u2019) provides an automatic annotation of each sequence, with multiple visualization tools to explore and compare genome maps, as well as multiple ways of searching the data (by host, by phage affiliation, by taxonomic or functional affiliation of predicted genes, etc) and extract a specific subset of interest (these tools are under the tab \u2018Contig maps\u2019). Nucleotide sequences from the VirSorter curated data set are also hosted at iVirus, alongside the viral clusters annotation and network (as cytoscape-ready text files), the virus\u2013host matrix, and the complete list of viral sequence predictions in the 14,977 archaeal and bacterial genomic data sets including the category 3 predictions that are not in VirSorter curated data set (<a href=\"http://mirrors.iplantcollaborative.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/ivirus/VirSorter_curated_dataset\">http://mirrors.iplantcollaborative.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/ivirus/VirSorter_curated_dataset</a>).

Concurrently, emerging methods provide new virus\u2013host linkage capabilities, but do not scale well with increasing data set size and complexity (e.g., <a href=\"#bib5\">Andersson and Banfield, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Tadmor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Allers et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Deng et al., 2014</a>). Here, the mining of publicly available microbial genomic data proved to be a useful complement to these approaches as it enables the exploration of host-linked viral diversity. The resulting viral sequences hidden in microbial genomes represent a powerful data set, increasing the number of known, host-linked viruses by an order of magnitude, with analyses of these data elucidating viral dark matter in ocean and human gut viromes, as well as augmenting our understanding of viral taxonomy, viral genome evolution, and virus\u2013host interactions on multiple fronts. While this current VirSorter data set remains limited by the cultivation bias inherent in the publicly available complete and draft microbial genomes, such bias will progressively be eliminated as SAGs are used to better map microbial dark matter (e.g., <a href=\"#bib64\">Rinke et al., 2013</a>). Such a drastically improved map of the virosphere, together with advances in experimental approaches and theory (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brum and Sullivan, 2015</a>), will help reveal the eco-evolutionary forces shaping virus\u2013host interactions across diverse ecosystems and eventually shift our inference capability from observation to prediction."

We next removed all linear sequences shorter than 10 kb except for sequences detected with the non-<i>Caudovirales</i> score where a threshold of 5 kb was used, as these viruses can frequently have genomes smaller than 10 kb. We also discarded all circular contigs (which should represent complete genomes) smaller than 3 kb as these are likely short repeat regions (the smallest known genome for a bacteria or archaea virus is \u223c5 kb). The resulting 13,391 sequences were then manually curated to remove false positives. These false positives corresponded to defective prophages (wherein most are expected to be smaller than 10 kb), plasmid-like sequences, GTA gene clusters, and low complexity regions. In addition, this manual curation step allowed us to adjust the boundaries of some prophage predictions and/or modify the prophage vs complete viral contig automatic prediction.

It is an excellent idea that makes a lot of sense and is badly needed to increase the knowledge about the sequence space of phages presently very biased and incomplete. It can also provide a great contribution into one of the conundrums of phage biology, the infection range without the bias of culture. However, I have mixed feelings about this manuscript. On the one hand it is very comprehensive including all genomes in repositories (including many draft genomes) but the results are a bit disappointing and provide very little novelty. That the pattern of infection at large phylogenetic scale will be modular was largely expected from classical work with cultures. But the most relevant question is whether at short phylogenetic distances is nested what is left unanswered. Maybe a problem that is general to these \u201cbig data\u201d analysis is the gross level of detail. I wonder why the authors do not provide analysis at the fine resolution level i.e. phages detected within a single species or genus. At the broad level analysed here most of the results are very predictable from classic approaches. The use of draft genomes and the possibility of discriminating plasmids from phages is another question that is left untouched in both this manuscript and the previous submission. There is a gradient in nature between infective phages and conjugative elements and establishing the borderline might be risky."

This tool has been applied to data mining of the available and rapidly growing genomic datasets and thereby has increased the number of putative (mostly partial) viral genomes by ten-fold. Due to association with both known genomes and SAG genomes from known sources, the analysis allowed identification of potential viruses in hosts for which no known viruses are currently available. This is clearly a boon to researchers working on these organisms. I find the tetranucleotide analysis of viral genomes in order to possibly identify hosts for these viruses to be particularly attractive and plan on using it in my own research."

There are lots of lines which clearly fall into a handful of modules, but within these modules it is pretty hard to see what is going on. Maybe a two-way clustering would be more insightful. Consider a distance matrix d_ij, where d_ij is the fraction of sequences in viral cluster (VC) i that come from genomes of host phylum j, maybe normalized for the abundance of genomes from phylum j. Then cluster this matrix both by VC and host, similar to RNA-seq being clustered by gene and tissue. The modules should show up as blocks on the diagonal, while promiscuous affiliations are off-diagonal terms. What exactly the distance matrix d_ij should be requires some thought and there are probably better choices then this proposal. But if something like this would work out, it could be more informative than the current figure. Keeping one as a supplement of the other could be a good solution."

Seeing these reviews also help us see that we failed to really start out with a quantitative metric of \u201cimpact\u201d as to us the scale alone (augmenting available phage genome sequences by an order of magnitude) was a closed case. This is because the last decade has seen microbial ecology transformed by large scale datasets including the Global Ocean Survey microbial metagenomics dataset (Rusch et al. PLoS Biology, 2007) and the first viral metagenomic dataset (Angly et al. PLoS Biology, 2006) \u2013 papers which have 1383 and 613 citations, respectively. At the same time, viral ecology is paralyzed by the dominance of \u201cunknowns\u201d in metagenomics studies as commonly 63\u201393% of new viral metagenomic reads are new to science, presumably because we only have just over a thousand phage genomes and they derive largely (85%) from only 3 of 45 bacterial phyla."

First, genome network analysis helps classify new viruses in a robust genome-based taxonomic framework that is largely consistent with accepted ICTV taxonomy (subsection \u201c264 new putative viral genera identified through genome-based network clustering\u201d). Second, leveraging this unprecedentedly large-scale, host-associated viral genomic dataset, we show that tetranucleotide frequency distance is a surprisingly robust predictor of the host of most viruses. Again, while not novel knowledge, working at this scale we added an effort to quantify the probabilistic value of these predictions across multiple host phyla, as well as compared the performance of tetranucleotide frequency to 4 other sequence composition based metrics to help provide strong guidance to researchers on using this metric. Perhaps this is why in spite of the idea being in the literature for some time, reviewer #3 notes: \u201cI find the tetranucleotide analysis of viral genomes in order to possibly identify hosts for these viruses to be particularly attractive and plan on using it in my own research<i>.</i>\u201d Third, the modular pattern of a global virus-host network was indeed predicted by theoretical models, although the only study of comparable size observing a modular virus-host network (Flores et al., ISMEJ, 2011) was based on plaque formation on host cultures where genetic diversity was unknown. Here, we validate the modularity with an unprecedentedly large-scale dataset that includes microbes spanning 18 phyla, and add information about the level of taxonomy at which the virus-host network is modular (as we expect it to become nested at one point, near the \u201ctip of the tree\u201d). Fourth, the dominance of Caudovirales in the dataset, as well as the clear separation between DNA and RNA viruses as well as Archaeal and Bacterial viruses were all expected based on the previous knowledge on viral diversity, and so these findings are largely only confirmatory."

Due to association with both known genomes and SAG genomes from known sources, the analysis allowed identification of potential viruses in hosts for which no known viruses are currently available. This is clearly a boon to researchers working on these organisms. I find the tetranucleotide analysis of viral genomes in order to possibly identify hosts for these viruses to be particularly attractive and plan on using it in my own research.</i>"

Although we agree that the tool enables exciting potential follow-up investigations, we still consider that the description of such a vast dataset, that includes (as noted by the reviewer) potential viruses for host groups with no currently isolated virus, is akin to taking one (giant) step into the viral dark matter. Notably, using this host-associated viral sequences as a complementary database doubled the ratio of affiliated genes from human gut viromes (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>). The description of the different viral clusters linked to these new viruses and associated with specific host groups is for us what we consider as new insights into viral dark matter and virus -host interactions. Clearly we failed to articulate those advances in the submitted manuscript, but hope that our response to the editor\u2019s summary above helps more clearly make our case. We hope this revised manuscript is better at bringing these points out."

There are lots of lines which clearly fall into a handful of modules, but within these modules it is pretty hard to see what is going on. Maybe a two-way clustering would be more insightful. Consider a distance matrix d_ij, where d_ij is the fraction of sequences in viral cluster (VC) i that come from genomes of host phylum j, maybe normalized for the abundance of genomes from phylum j. Then cluster this matrix both by VC and host, similar to RNA-seq being clustered by gene and tissue. The modules should show up as blocks on the diagonal, while promiscuous affiliations are off-diagonal terms. What exactly the distance matrix d_ij should be requires some thought and there are probably better choices then this proposal.
