As part of such adaptation they maintain an active memory of heat stress for several days that promotes a more efficient response to recurring stress. We show that this heat stress memory requires the activity of the <i>FORGETTER1 (FGT1</i>) locus, with <i>fgt1</i> mutants displaying reduced maintenance of heat-induced gene expression. <i>FGT1</i> encodes the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> orthologue of Strawberry notch (Sno), and the protein globally associates with the promoter regions of actively expressed genes in a heat-dependent fashion. FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF and ISWI families, which also display reduced heat stress memory. Genomic targets of the BRM remodeler overlap significantly with FGT1 targets. Accordingly, nucleosome dynamics at loci with altered maintenance of heat-induced expression are affected in <i>fgt1</i>. Together, our results suggest that by modulating nucleosome occupancy, FGT1 mediates stress-induced chromatin memory."

As part of such adaptation they maintain an active memory of heat stress for several days that promotes a more efficient response to recurring stress. We show that this heat stress memory requires the activity of the <i>FORGETTER1 (FGT1</i>) locus, with <i>fgt1</i> mutants displaying reduced maintenance of heat-induced gene expression. <i>FGT1</i> encodes the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> orthologue of Strawberry notch (Sno), and the protein globally associates with the promoter regions of actively expressed genes in a heat-dependent fashion. FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF and ISWI families, which also display reduced heat stress memory. Genomic targets of the BRM remodeler overlap significantly with FGT1 targets. Accordingly, nucleosome dynamics at loci with altered maintenance of heat-induced expression are affected in <i>fgt1</i>. Together, our results suggest that by modulating nucleosome occupancy, FGT1 mediates stress-induced chromatin memory."

Brzezinka, Altmann et al. identified one such gene and termed it <i>FORGETTER1</i> (or <i>FGT1</i> for short). Further experiments then revealed that the FGT1 protein binds directly to a specific class of heat-inducible genes that are relevant for heat stress memory."

DNA is wrapped around protein complexes called nucleosomes and depending on how tightly the DNA of a gene is wrapped makes it more or less easy to activate the gene. In agreement with this model, FGT1 does interact with proteins that can reposition nucleosomes and leave the DNA more loosely packaged. Also, the fact that plants that lack a working <i>FGT1</i> gene repackage the DNA of memory-related genes too early after experiencing heat stress provides further support for the model."

A large body of research has focused on the immediate stress responses. However, in nature, stress is frequently chronic or recurring, suggesting that temporal dynamics are an important, but under-researched, component of plant stress responses. Indeed, plants can be primed by a stress exposure such that they respond more efficiently to another stress incident that occurs after a stressless period (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hilker et al., 2015</a>). Priming has been described in response to pathogen attack, heat stress (HS), drought, and salt stress (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Conrath, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jaskiewicz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sani et al., 2013</a>).

It activates <i>HEAT-STRESS-ASSOCIATED32 (HSA32</i>), a gene with chaperone-like activity, although no homology to known chaperone families (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). Like <i>HSFA2, HSA32</i> is critically required for HS memory (<a href=\"#bib4\">Charng et al., 2006</a>). <i>HSA32</i> is induced by HS and this induction is sustained for at least three days. A set of HS memory-related genes was identified based on their similar expression pattern, which is in contrast to that of canonical HS-inducible genes (<i>HSP70, HSP101</i>) that show upregulation after HS, but not sustained induction (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stief et al., 2014</a>). Among the HS memory-related genes are small HSPs (such as <i>HSP21, HSP22.0, HSP18.2</i>). A subset of these loci show transcriptional memory in the sense that recurring stress causes a more efficient re-activation compared to the first stress incident, even though active transcription has subsided before the second stress (<a href=\"#bib22\">L\u00e4mke et al., 2016</a>). Sustained induction and transcriptional memory of these genes is associated with hyper-methylation of H3K4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and requires HSFA2, which binds directly to these genes (<a href=\"#bib22\">L\u00e4mke et al., 2016</a>).

FGT1 is the single <i>A. thaliana</i> orthologue of metazoan Strawberry notch, a highly conserved co-activator of the developmental regulator Notch. We show that FGT1 associates with memory genes in a HS-dependent way. Moreover, FGT1 is widely associated with the transcriptional start site of expressed genes. We further show that FGT1 interacts with highly conserved chromatin remodeling complexes and is required for proper nucleosome dynamics at HS-memory genes. Thus, FGT1 maintains its target loci in an open and transcription-competent state by interacting with remodeler complexes around the transcriptional start site."

For intron-containing genes, we measured unspliced transcripts as a proxy for transcriptional activity. Unspliced <i>HSA32</i> transcripts were induced in <i>fgt1-1</i> similarly as in the parent up to 21\u2009h, but declined faster thereafter. Notably, unspliced transcript levels in the parent were still elevated 20-fold relative to the non-HS control (NHS) at 69\u2009h after ACC, indicating continued transcription throughout the memory phase. Similar results were obtained for <i>HSP21</i>, but not for the non-memory genes. This is in accordance with what was observed previously (<a href=\"#bib22\">L\u00e4mke et al., 2016</a>).

We identified a 0.77 MB interval at the bottom of chromosome 1, containing a splice acceptor site mutation in <i>At1g79350</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This mutation caused retention of intron 19, resulting in a premature stop codon. <i>At1g79350</i> was previously tentatively identified as <i>EMB1135</i> with a reported embryo-defective phenotype (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meinke et al., 2008</a>). However, it was not confirmed that the disruption of this gene in the <i>emb1135</i> allele indeed causes the phenotype and neither <i>fgt1-1</i>, nor any of several putative loss-of-function T-DNA insertion lines showed any obvious morphological phenotype. Three independent lines of evidence show that <i>FGT1</i> is <i>At1g79350</i>. First, we complemented the <i>LUC</i> expression and physiological memory phenotypes by expressing a genomic <i>FGT1</i> fragment (SA13) in the <i>fgt1-1</i> background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>).

Although DExD helicases have been ascribed a role in RNA processing and translation, roles in gene expression and transcription have been suggested (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fuller-Pace, 2006</a>). <i>FGT1</i> is expressed throughout the plant (<a href=\"#bib53\">Winter et al., 2007</a>) and was slightly induced (1.7 fold) at 4\u00a0h\u00a0after HS, but not thereafter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

FGT1-YFP was localized to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). PHD domains have the potential to bind to methylated histone H3 tails (<a href=\"#bib36\">Musselman and Kutateladze, 2011</a>). We thus tested whether FGT1<sub>PHD</sub>-GST was precipitated by H3 histone tail peptides that were either unmethylated or mono-, di-, or trimethylated, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We observed comparable binding to H3 aa 1\u201320, H3 aa 21\u201344 or H3 aa 1\u201320 methylated at K4 or K9. In contrast, the PHD domain of ING1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lee et al., 2009</a>) bound under the same conditions only to the H3K4me3 peptide (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This suggests that FGT1-PHD binds to the N-terminal region of H3, albeit not in a methylation-specific manner (at least with respect to methylated K4 and K9). In addition, histone H3 was co-immunoprecipitated with FGT1-YFP, but not YFP alone, from extracts of transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> seedlings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In summary, nuclear FGT1 is the <i>A. thaliana</i> orthologue of the DExD helicase Sno and associates with H3 in vivo, consistent with a function as a co-activator."

Such heat-dependent enrichment was not observed at the <i>ACTIN7 (ACT7</i>) and <i>AtMu1</i> control loci. The enrichment at the active <i>ACT7</i> gene was comparable to that of <i>HSA32</i> before HS, suggesting that FGT1 binds <i>HSA32</i> and <i>ACT7</i> already pre-HS.

This revealed that FGT1 is preferentially associated with expressed genes at a global scale (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). FGT1 is most strongly associated with genes that have high or intermediate expression in a pattern similar to that observed for the peak genes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next asked whether FGT1 shows differential association with genes that are HS-responsive (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stief et al., 2014</a>). FGT1 associated most strongly with those expressed genes that are upregulated at 4\u2009h\u00a0after ACC, irrespective of their expression level before HS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This is especially true for genes that are lowly expressed without HS; this category contains typical HS-responsive genes. Accordingly, FGT1 associated most strongly with genes that are upregulated at 4\u2009h and/ or 52\u2009h after ACC and this is more pronounced in the ACC samples (Figure 7C).

                                "text": "To elucidate the mechanism of how FGT1 promotes gene expression, we isolated FGT1-interacting proteins. To this end, we purified native FGT1-YFP complexes from <i>35S::FGT1-YFP</i> seedlings 28\u2009h after ACC or control (NHS) treatment. FGT1-YFP and associated proteins were then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. As controls, we performed purifications on <i>35S::YFP</i> and Col-0 plants, respectively. Among the peptides identified specifically in the FGT1-YFP samples were both <i>A. thaliana</i> orthologues of the ISWI chromatin remodeler, CHR11 and CHR17, and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler BRAHMA (BRM), suggesting that FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Because of the high homology between CHR11 and CHR17, most of the identified peptides could not be assigned unequivocally to either of the two proteins, however, a few specific peptides were recovered demonstrating the presence of both ISWI proteins (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We also identified several known subunits (SWI3a, b, d, SWP73b) of the BRM complex. We did not observe differences between the ACC and NHS samples, suggesting that the mode of action of FGT1 is independent of HS. To confirm the interactions between FGT1 and the remodelers we used bimolecular fluorescent complementation in transiently transformed tobacco leaves (<a href=\"#bib51\">Walter et al., 2004</a>). We thus confirmed the interaction of FGT1 with CHR11, CHR17 and BRM in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In summary, FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins of the ISWI and SWI/SNF classes."

As the loss of <i>BRM</i> causes sterility, we performed the assay on the progeny of a heterozygous <i>brm-1</i>/+ plant and genotyped individual seedlings after phenotyping. Indeed, <i>brm-1</i> mutants displayed reduced HS memory (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). The highly similar CHR11 and CHR17 proteins show functional redundancy and the double mutant displays severe developmental defects including dwarfism (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we performed the experiment on the progeny of a <i>chr11/chr11 chr17</i>/+ plant. As for <i>brm-1</i>, we genotyped individual seedlings after the phenotypic analysis was completed. We observed that <i>chr11</i> single mutants and <i>chr11/chr11 chr17</i>/+ seedlings were defective in the physiological HS memory (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Due to their growth defects, we could not analyze <i>chr11 chr17</i> double mutants. To test whether the remodeler mutants have a generally impaired HS response, we also tested their ability to acquire thermotolerance and their basal thermotolerance. Mutants in the remodelers behaved similar to the wild type or slightly better in these assays (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>), which indicates that the responses to acute HS were not compromised. Thus, the remodeler mutants under investigation displayed a specific impairment of HS memory and not a general defect in HS responses. We also tested the expression of HS-responsive genes after ACC in wild type, and <i>brm-1</i>/+ or <i>chr11/chr11 chr17</i>/+ -segregating lines, respectively. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that both mutant lines show a premature decline of expression of <i>HSA32, HSP18.2, HSP21, HSP22</i> and <i>HSP101</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In many cases, transcript levels were already lower at the earliest time point measured (immediately after the end of ACC), suggesting that the remodelers were also necessary for full induction of these genes. Interestingly, this was not correlated with a reduced level of acquired thermotolerance in our assays (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Indeed, the <i>brm-1 fgt1-1</i> double mutants displayed several novel phenotypes compared to the <i>brm-1</i> single mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). During seedling development, growth of the <i>brm-1 fgt1-1</i> double mutant was retarded, resulting in reduced development and delayed leaf initiation (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Later on, flowering time (days to flowering) was delayed compared to the wild type or either single mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). As the double mutants have to be isolated from a segregating population due to the sterility of <i>brm-1</i>, we could not obtain suitable material for testing HS memory. Nevertheless, the additive phenotypes observed in the double mutant clearly suggest that both genes act partially redundantly, in agreement with the idea that they act at least partly on the same targets. The additional phenotypes indicate that <i>FGT1</i> also plays a role during plant development, which is consistent with the large number of target genes that are not\u00a0related to HS memory."

We observed a highly significant overlap between genes associated with BRM under non-stress conditions and FGT1-associated genes (NHS and ACC; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Globally, BRM was more strongly associated with FGT1 ACC target genes than with the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Strikingly, BRM showed a very similar coverage profile as FGT1; a pronounced peak at the TSS and a second, weaker peak just downstream the TTS. When comparing the association with genes that are induced at 4 and/or 52\u2009h\u00a0after ACC, we found BRM to be strongly enriched at memory genes (up at 4 and 52\u2009h) and late-inducible genes (up at 52\u2009h only), compared to downregulated or non-responsive genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Again, this was very similar to the results observed for FGT1. Notably, the association of BRM and (to a lesser extent) FGT1 with memory genes was established before HS. The overlapping binding pattern of FGT1 and BRM was also apparent from browser screenshots of individual loci (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In summary, genome-wide BRM target genes overlap strongly with FGT1 target genes and they are pre-associated with memory genes under non-stress conditions, strongly supporting the interaction of FGT1 and BRM."

FGT1 interacts with conserved chromatin remodeling complexes, and the catalytic subunits of these complexes are also required for physiological HS memory. Together, our data suggest the following model (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>); HS induces memory gene expression through HSF proteins. FGT1 binds to these loci at the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) adjacent to the TSS, where it interacts with nucleosome remodeling complexes. By tuning nucleosome occupancy around the TSS, FGT1 maintains these loci in a memory-competent state. This allows active transcription to be maintained for several days after HS, thus contributing to HS memory."

Whether FGT1 interacts with HSFA2 and H3K4 methylation remains a question for future studies. FGT1 and BRM are associated with HS memory loci already before HS, when their expression levels are low. FGT1 binding increases after HS and is maintained at high levels over the course of HS memory. It is unclear whether HS memory is conserved outside the plant kingdom. However, our results strongly indicate that FGT1 has a more generic role in transcription, despite the lack of morphological aberrations under standard growth conditions. This general function of FGT1 is partially redundant with that of the SWI/SNF remodeler BRM (as apparent in the double mutant). It is conceivable that FGT1 is required for regulated gene expression, which is prevalent especially during development and under stress conditions."

Interestingly, other DExD/H helicase proteins have been implicated in coordinating transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing by interacting with co-activator/-repressor proteins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fuller-Pace, 2006</a>). While FGT1 binds to active genes, it was not associated with transcribed regions, but rather with the flanking promoter and terminator sequences, supporting the notion of a role in transcriptional regulation rather than RNA processing. However, we currently cannot rule out a role for (non-)coding RNAs in FGT1-dependent regulation. FGT1 also contains a Helicase C domain, which is frequently found in chromatin remodeler proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>). In fact, the combination of two helicase domains as present in FGT1 is reminiscent of remodeler proteins. In addition, FGT1 contains a PHD domain. Several PHD domains display very high binding affinities to specific posttranslational modifications of histone H3 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Musselman and Kutateladze, 2011</a>). Using recombinant FGT1<sub>PHD</sub> or transgenic FGT1-YFP, we confirmed H3 binding, however, we did not observe preferential binding to any of the tested modifications (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that other determinants contribute to targeting FGT1.

Chromatin remodeling complexes have widespread functions during development and have been linked with several pathologies, including tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Narlikar et al., 2013</a>). Four families of chromatin remodelers are conserved in metazoans, plants and yeast; the SWI/SNF, the ISWI, the CHD and the INO80 families (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>). The catalytic subunits of all families contain a Snf2-related helicase domain and form large multi-subunit complexes. Although they have differing functions, there is evidence that remodelers of different families interact on the chromatin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Narlikar et al., 2013</a>). FGT1 interacts with remodelers of the ISWI and SWI/SNF families. Both ISWI orthologues, BRM and several accessory subunits (SWI3, BAF73b) were identified by co-immunoprecipitation. ISWI is required for the regular spacing of nucleosomes downstream of the +1 border nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2014</a>). FGT1 was found previously in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment with CHR17, thus independently confirming our results (<a href=\"#bib45\">Smaczniak et al., 2012</a>). Drosophila BRM was originally identified due to its activating function that antagonizes Polycomb group silencing (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tamkun et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>). During HS memory, both BRM and ISWI act as positive regulators of the memory, suggesting that both contribute to maintaining the chromatin open and accessible. FGT1, localized just upstream of the TSS, may bridge both remodelers. This notion is consistent with the localization of BRM and ISWI in other systems (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Narlikar et al., 2013</a>) and with the high overlap in BRM and FGT1 localization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2016</a>). Moreover, remodelers of different families cooperate to regulate dynamic sites (<a href=\"#bib35\">Morris et al., 2014</a>). The evidence for interaction with BRM is further strengthened by the double mutant analysis, which demonstrated that <i>FGT1</i> activity becomes critical in the absence of <i>BRM</i>."

Whether this reflects one function or two separable functions, remains to be investigated. The FGT1 peaks that we detected were wide and relatively flat. Consistent with FGT1 interacting with BRM and CHR11/CHR17, such a binding pattern is characteristic for chromatin remodeling proteins but not sequence-specific transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2016</a>). FGT1 was preferentially associated with medium and highly expressed genes. Among the lowly expressed genes, those that are HS-inducible were more strongly bound than other genes - not only after HS, but also under control conditions. This indicates that despite an overall correlation with expression, FGT1 binding does not simply reflect the\u00a0transcriptional activity of a locus. It is tempting to speculate that at some loci FGT1 binding indicates a readiness for transcription rather than actual transcription, similar to what was described as a poised state (<a href=\"#bib24\">Levine et al., 2014</a>). FGT1 binding overlaps the NDRs present next to the TSS and TTS. Hence, FGT1 may be required to maintain the NDR by interacting with remodeler proteins. Accordingly, we observed changes in the nucleosome occupancy of this region and particularly the adjacent +1 nucleosome in <i>fgt1-1</i> mutants. The changes in nucleosome occupancy at FGT1 target loci preceded HS, in agreement with the FGT1 binding pattern. In non-stressed adult leaves, similar changes were observed for <i>brm</i> and <i>iswi</i> mutants. Locus-specific and developmental effects indicate the involvement of additional components. Thus, it is likely that BRM and ISWI cooperate with FGT1 to mediate nucleosome occupancy before and after HS. We propose that the molecular function of Sno/FGT1 orthologues is conserved and that they promote transcriptional regulation through interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes. The reported function of <i>Sno</i> as a co-activator is consistent with this mechanism; moreover, the interacting chromatin remodelers are highly conserved in metazoans."

They found that FGT1 primarily binds to the proximal promoter upstream of the TSS as well as the region downstream of the TTS and functions as a co-activator of memory genes. Moreover, they showed that FGT1 interacts with SWI/SNF and ISWI chromatin remodelers that are also required for HS memory. Finally, they showed that FGT1 is required for maintaining low nucleosome occupancy during the memory phase. The authors propose that FGT1 modulates HS memory through modulating nucleosome occupancy dynamics and transcription-competent chromatin. These findings advance our understanding about the molecular mechanism of stress memory and should be of general interest. The data are of high quality and well presented. Meanwhile, I feel the authors should make efforts to provide the missing link between FGT1 and nucleosome dynamics. My requests for additional experiments are listed below."

Most of these changes are transient and are lost if the environmental stimulus is removed. For example, heat shock leads to transient upregulation of protein folding chaperones. However, in Arabidopsis, heat stress also leads to persistent expression of several genes (HSA32, HSP21, HSP22.0, HPS18.2) for ~3 days and this protects plants from lethal heat stress during this period. This phenomenon is called heat stress memory and requires an HSF-related transcription factor HSFA2 and is correlated with changes in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation."

This mutant resulted in 1) normal expression of HSA32 immediately after a mild heat shock, 2) normal survival of a lethal heat stress administered 90 minutes after a mild heat stress, 3) low expression of an HSA32 reporter (compared with wild type) after 2 or 3 days of recovery and 4) poor survival of a lethal heat stress after 3 days of recovery. These results suggest that FGT1 is specifically required for the long-term effects of mild heat stress. The manuscript seeks to understand the phenotype of the fgt1 mutant and to define the molecular role of FGT1 in stress memory. This is a very interesting phenomenon and the system is excellent. The experiments are well designed and the data are clear.

Surprisingly, despite having used an HSA32 reporter for the screen, the fgt1-1 mutant plants showed normal persistent expression of HSA32 and HSP18.2 and slightly defective persistence of HSP21 and HSP22.0. However, the authors claim that the very slight decrease in HSA32 after 45 and 69h are the source of the phenotype. Because there was no statistical analysis of this difference, it is unclear if it is significant. These differences do not appear to be as strong as the differences observed with the Luciferase reporter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Quantitation of the luciferase for comparison would have clarified the phenotype. To convince the reader that the mutation is impacting transcription, ChIP against RNAPII would have helped. Furthermore, inclusion of the HSFA2 mutant for comparison would have made the strength of the phenotype easier to assess. It is possible that the mutation has a larger effect on the reporter and that the survival phenotype is the result of an effect on a different subset of genes (i.e., HSP21 and HSP22). If so, then the persistent expression of genes in response to heat stress involves both an FGT1-dependent and an FGT1-independent mechanism."

Consistent with this hypothesis, FGT1 localizes to the nucleus, interacts with both active genes and heat stress-induced genes and physically interacts with the BRM (SWI/SNF) and CHR11/CHR17 (ISWI). Unfortunately, a number of experiments create uncertainty about this conclusion. First, the changes in nucleosome occupancy in the fgt1 mutant do not correlate with binding of FGT1: FGT1 binds strongly to the HSA32 promoter/TSS upon heat stress and this correlates with decreased nucleosome occupancy. The fgt1 mutant shows lower nucleosome occupancy prior to heat stress and this decreases to a comparable level to the wild type in the days following heat stress. Therefore, FGT1 is not required for the decrease in nucleosome occupancy at HSA32. In the cases of HSP18.2 and HSP22, although the fgt1 mutant shows increased nucleosome occupancy, the changes in the wild type strain upon heat stress are difficult to appreciate and, as mentioned above, there is no obvious effect of this mutation on the expression of HSP18.2. It would have been helpful to include a gene that is neither a target of FGT1 nor persistently expressed (i.e. HSP101) as a more relevant control. Likewise, as mentioned above, examining the effect of the HSFA2 mutant in this assay would have been informative. Also, peptide binding experiments show that the PHD finger interacts non-specifically with (non-overlapping) histone peptides. The authors did not include a biologically irrelevant peptide control, but the low affinity and the lack of specificity cast doubt on the claim that \"FGT1 binds to the N-terminal region of H3[\u2026]\". It seems equally plausible that FGT1 binds to the FLAG peptide. Finally, ChIP seq shows that FGT1 associates with both the transcription start sites and the transcription termination sites of active genes. Given the DExD-like helicase domain, this raises the alternative hypothesis that the protein is involved in post-transcriptional events and might impact the ability of plants to survive through influencing protein levels."

Mutations in BRM1 and FGT1 produced synthetic flowering and development phenotypes, suggesting non-overlapping roles in these processes. Both mutant plants were somewhat defective in heat stress protection after 3d of recovery. However, these mutant plants also showed significantly lower peak levels of the HS-induction of HSA32, HSP18.1, HSP21 and HSP22. Therefore, the decrease in expression afterward appears proportional to the wildtype, but starting at a significantly lower peak level. If so, then poor survival after 3d of recovery is likely due to lower levels of induced transcription, not less sustained transcription."

We have addressed this issue via two complementary approaches. (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) We have analyzed the overlap in genome-wide binding sites of the SWI/SNF protein BRM with those of FGT1. The BRM ChIP-seq dataset employed for this purspose has recently been published (Li et al., Nat Genet 2016), using a BRM-GFP line and anti-GFP antibody in non-stressed conditions. At the genome-wide level, we detected a highly significant overlap between regions bound by BRM and FGT1 as shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>. In particular, BRM associates significantly more strongly with FGT1-bound regions than with the rest of the genome and both factors show a very similar binding profile across genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The same enrichment of BRM binding is also seen for genes that show sustained expression after HS in our time-course microarray experiments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, Stief et al. 2014). These results are supported by a series of browser screenshots of individual genes, as suggested by Reviewer #3 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, we conclude that a high fraction of FGT1-bound regions is also bound by BRM and the significant overlap in these orthogonal genome-wide datasets strongly supports our interpretation of a functional interaction between the two proteins."

(co-) transcriptionally (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The other memory genes do not contain introns, thus precluding this type of analysis. Moreover, the transcript analysis of the LUC transgene shows that the magnitude of the effect is similar to that observed for the endogenous HSA32 gene, suggesting that the transgene mimicks closely the behavior of the endogeneous HSA32. This is in accordance with the analysis of unspliced HSA32 transcripts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), for which the primers detected both the endogene and the transgene. To clarify the significance of the differences, we have also added statistical analysis for the qRT-PCR experiments presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>.

Consistent with this hypothesis, FGT1 localizes to the nucleus, interacts with both active genes and heat stress-induced genes and physically interacts with the BRM (SWI/SNF) and CHR11/CHR17 (ISWI). Unfortunately, a number of experiments create uncertainty about this conclusion. First, the changes in nucleosome occupancy in the fgt1 mutant do not correlate with binding of FGT1: FGT1 binds strongly to the HSA32 promoter/TSS upon heat stress and this correlates with decreased nucleosome occupancy. The fgt1 mutant shows lower nucleosome occupancy prior to heat stress and this decreases to a comparable level to the wild type in the days following heat stress. Therefore, FGT1 is not required for the decrease in nucleosome occupancy at HSA32. In the cases of HSP18.2 and HSP22, although the fgt1 mutant shows increased nucleosome occupancy, the changes in the wild type strain upon heat stress are difficult to appreciate and, as mentioned above, there is no obvious effect of this mutation on the expression of HSP18.2.
