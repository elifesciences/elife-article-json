Molecular diversification of cell surface recognition molecules through DNA recombination and complex alternative splicing has emerged as an important principle for encoding such interactions. However, the lack of tools to specifically detect and quantify receptor protein isoforms is a major impediment to functional studies. We here developed a workflow for targeted mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring that permits quantitative assessment of highly diversified protein families. We apply this workflow to dissecting the molecular diversity of the neuronal neurexin receptors and uncover an alternative splicing-dependent recognition code for synaptic ligands."

Molecular diversification of cell surface recognition molecules through DNA recombination and complex alternative splicing has emerged as an important principle for encoding such interactions. However, the lack of tools to specifically detect and quantify receptor protein isoforms is a major impediment to functional studies. We here developed a workflow for targeted mass spectrometry by selected reaction monitoring that permits quantitative assessment of highly diversified protein families. We apply this workflow to dissecting the molecular diversity of the neuronal neurexin receptors and uncover an alternative splicing-dependent recognition code for synaptic ligands."

Major advances in transcriptomics have enabled the identification of gene regulatory programs and mRNA targets that underlie specification of neuronal cell types and their plasticity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hobert, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ebert and Greenberg, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Molyneaux et al., 2015</a>). For example, specific transcriptional programs direct the neurotransmitter phenotypes of neuronal populations, the targeting of axonal projections, or the modification of synapse numbers in response to neuronal activity. In addition, transcript-based studies have uncovered gene families with substantial molecular complexity that may encode neuronal recognition events (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zipursky and Sanes, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Schreiner et al., 2014a</a>)."

Notably, such post-transcriptional forms of gene regulation are particularly prevalent in the central nervous system highlighting the need for quantitative approaches that enable targeted dissection of the neuronal proteome. Additionally, many neurons possess long-distance projections. The localization of presynaptic proteins in many cases differs from the anatomical place of their mRNA expression. Thus, the possibility to detect and quantify isoforms at the protein level provides an important advantage in order to understand the functional role of these proteins."

These led to the delineation of the composition of purified synaptic vesicles, postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor complexes, or models of presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib52\">Takamori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shanks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schwenk et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wilhelm et al., 2014</a>).

In this regard, the complexity of neuronal tissues and the molecular diversity of some neuronal receptor families pose significant limitations. First, many proteins are present in only a fraction of the cells or structures analyzed reducing the chance of detecting peptide levels required for adequate quantification. Second, over the past years alternative splicing has emerged as a key mechanism for the regulation of neuronal recognition (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aoto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Takahashi and Craig, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">He et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Iijima et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lah et al., 2014</a>). Alternative splicing programs can generate families of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of closely related protein isoforms frequently distinguished by only a single peptide. Thus, when applying random sampling (\u2018shotgun\u2019) approaches it is challenging to obtain sufficient coverage for isoform detection and quantification. Additionally, the protein inference problem, i.e., presence of the same peptide sequence in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms limits applicability of \u2018shotgun\u2019 approaches for detection and quantification of protein families with high sequence homologies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nesvizhskii and Aebersold, 2005</a>)."

While originally developed for characterization of chemical compounds this method has recently emerged as promising technique for the quantitative analysis of protein species in biological samples (<a href=\"#bib37\">Phanstiel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Picotti and Aebersold, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carr et al., 2014</a>). Instead of sampling a random portion of the proteome, SRM assays use optimized separation and detection parameters for a set of pre-selected peptides (termed proteotypic peptides or PTPs) that are specific to a protein or isoform of interest. PTPs are detected based on their chromatographic retention time and mass to charge ratio (rather than by sequencing as in shotgun proteomics). For each PTP, an isotopically labeled reference peptide is added to the sample which then is used as standard for quantification. This strategy greatly reduces experimental variability and significantly increases sensitivity in the detection and quantification of selected peptides (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bauer et al., 2014</a>). To date, significant contributions in advancing our knowledge in biology have been made by applying SRM-based approaches, in particular to profile cellular pathways and metabolic states, thereby quantifying low abundance proteins within complex mixtures (<a href=\"#bib39\">Picotti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Simicevic et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kennedy et al., 2014</a>).

Importantly, insertion or skipping of alternative exons at two of the alternatively spliced segments (AS2 and AS4) was reported to regulate binding of neurexins to a number of different interaction partners (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ichtchenko et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sugita et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chih et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Koehnke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Siddiqui et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Uemura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reissner et al., 2013</a>).

This was similar to the amounts of N-cadherin (\u223c20 fmol/\u03bcg) and approximately threefold lower than amounts of PSD95 (54 fmol/\u03bcg), one of the most abundant proteins in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. For all three neurexins, the alpha-isoforms represented the major protein variants, whereas beta variants were 2- to 4-fold less abundant (NRX1beta: 0.87 \u00b1 0.36 fmol/\u03bcg, NRX1-alpha: 3.86 \u00b1 0.46 fmol/\u03bcg, NRX2-beta: 1.39 \u00b1 0.49 fmol/\u03bcg, NRX2-alpha: 2.19 \u00b1 0.83, NRX3-beta: 1.97 \u00b1 1.6 fmol/\u03bcg, NRX3-alpha: 4.18 \u00b1 0.45 fmol/\u03bcg, n = 4, \u00b1SD). Importantly, independent measurements with in vitro translated alpha and beta standard proteins for each primary NRX isoform (each quantified based on different PTPs) yielded highly similar results for pan-NRX amounts as well as the contents of alpha and beta isoforms. This further confirms the accuracy of this method. Based on previous estimates for the number of N-cadherin molecules per synapse (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wilhelm et al., 2014</a>), we estimate the average number of neurexin molecules to be 7\u201316 for NRX-beta and 18 to 35 for NRX-alpha per synapse."

Thus, we profiled recognition specificity of neurexin isoforms for three different postsynaptic receptors detected at glutamatergic synapses: neuroligin-1 (NL1B, containing splice insertion B), neuroligin-3 (NL3A2, containing splice insertion A2), and the leucine-rich transmembrane protein 2 (LRRTM2) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chih et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Budreck and Scheiffele, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">de Wit et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Siddiqui et al., 2010</a>). Affinity matrixes containing recombinant postsynaptic receptor proteins were incubated with protein extracts from mouse brain and bound proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Based on the normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zybailov et al., 2006</a>) of proteins identified by shotgun analysis, neurexins were amongst the most abundant proteins associated with the receptor proteins. Proteins derived from all three <i>Nrxn</i> genes were recovered on each of the binding partners. Interestingly, LRRTM2 beads led to a more robust isolation of NRX2-derived peptides as compared to NL1B and NL3A2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Quantification by spectral counts provides a good estimate of total protein isoforms derived from the individual <i>Nrxn</i> genes but enables only limited detection of isoforms identified by short unique sequence elements, such as beta isoforms or specific splice variants (e.g., average spectral counts for NRX-beta isoforms were \u22643 in three independent pull-down experiments). By contrast, SRM analysis revealed highly significant differential recovery of specific neurexin isoforms on the postsynaptic ligands. Comparison of neurexin isoforms associated with NL1B and NL3A2 matrices revealed preferential binding of NRX1 and 2 alpha forms to NL3A2 over NL1B. The selectivity of interactions was even more significant when comparing binding to LRRTM2 vs NL1B or NL3A2. LRRTM2 showed higher recovery of NRX1alpha and 2 alpha isoforms and lower recovery of NRX1beta and 2beta isoforms. Most importantly, NRX1alpha variants containing AS3 and AS6 insertions were significantly de-enriched in LRRTM2 pull-downs as compared to NL1B and NL3A2. This suggests a major role for neurexin alternative splicing in differential association with these postsynaptic ligands."

We compared adhesive interactions between cells expressing NRX1alpha variants containing different combinations of alternative insertions at AS3 and AS6 and cells expressing LRRTM2 or NL3A2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These experiments demonstrated a threefold increase in adhesive interactions of NRX1alpha isoforms lacking AS6 insertions as compared to the AS6+ isoforms. Presence or absence of the insertion at AS3 did not affect adhesion to LRRTM2 cells in this assay. By contrast, for NL3A2 presence of the AS6+ insertion in NRX1alpha resulted in slightly increased adhesion and isoforms containing AS6 but lacking AS3 showed the strongest adhesive interactions. These experiments uncover a significant differential regulation of neurexin interactions with two different receptors through a splice code at two alternatively spliced segments that had not previously been implicated in molecular recognition events."

The same approach can be extended to the remaining sites modified by alternative splicing (AS1, 2, 5). While we focused in this study on tryptic peptides the use of additional proteases will expand the repertoire of peptides available for analysis, making the quantitative detection of protein isoforms in complex samples even more reliable (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meyer et al., 2014</a>). The detection of specific splice isoforms at the protein level is particularly important for the recently discovered AS6 variants which are rare (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schreiner et al., 2014b</a>), and there has been no evidence that such isoforms exist on the protein level and have any functional relevance."

Notably, crystallographic studies provide a potential structural basis for this regulation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miller et al., 2011</a>). The six amino acids incorporated in AS6+ variants are positioned at a hinge region in the L-shaped NRX1alpha protein (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schreiner et al., 2014b</a>). Thus, the regulation of LRRTM2 binding to laminin-G domain 6 might involve a modification of the flexibility positioning laminin-G domains 1-5 vs the EGF domain 3 and laminin-G domain 6 in the NRX1alpha structure. Moreover, modeling studies predict that NRX1alpha AS3 is positioned in close proximity to an interaction surface with neuroligins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanaka et al., 2012</a>). This might underlie the modulation of NRX1alpha-NL3A2 interactions by AS3 insertions observed in our assays."

First, within individual brain regions, neurexin-alpha isoforms are significantly more abundant than beta isoforms. In fact, many previous studies with exogenously expressed neurexins focused on NRX1beta isoforms but our quantitative analysis demonstrates that these forms are the least abundant of all neurexins in vivo. Considering that neurexin-alpha and beta forms differ in their interactions with receptors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#bib7\">Boucard et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chih et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Siddiqui et al., 2010</a>), this has important functional implications. Second, comparison of absolute levels of neurexins with other synaptic proteins demonstrates that neurexins are rather abundant synaptic proteins. For example, the total amount of all neurexin proteins is similar to that of N-cadherin, a highly abundant synaptic protein and about one third of the amount of PSD95, one of the most abundant proteins in glutamatergic synapses."

We observed that several different synthetic AQUA peptides reporting on the same neurexin isoform often yielded divergent results, making a reliable quantification difficult (data not shown). This is most likely due to the variability in tryptic digests of endogenous proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arsene et al., 2008</a>). To circumvent these problems, we utilized an in vitro recombinant protein expression system, to use surrogate protein-constructs as standards for quantification. This approach is not only more robust and more accurate, but is also cost-effective, can be multiplexed by using multiple different tags in the isotopically labeled function proteins (in addition to GFP) and can be scaled to screen large numbers of different proteins and isoforms. Thus, the experimental pipeline established here is readily transferable to any protein class of interest."

Notably, SILAC labeling has been most frequently applied to cell culture or microorganisms. This powerful technique has been extended to higher organisms, by using labeled cell lines as an internal standard for quantitation or raising rodents for multiple generations on a diet with heavy isotope-labeled amino acids (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kruger et al., 2008</a>). While methods are well suited to assess overall proteome modifications it remains challenging to measure proteins of low abundance or protein isoforms in a consistent manner and across large sample numbers with reasonable throughput, due to fact that neuronal tissues are complex and heterogeneous. In most instances, the SRM-assays developed and validated here for mouse tissues can be directly transferred to assessing protein levels in small amounts of biopsy material from human patients or postmortem brain tissue. This is particularly interesting for the <i>Nrxn</i> gene family as <i>Nrxn</i>1 mutations are associated with autism and schizophrenia in the human population (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reichelt et al., 2012</a>). Given the complexity and size of the mammalian neurexin genes it is difficult to predict the impact of such mutations on the expression and function of the neurexin proteins. In the future, the approach established here can be readily applied to iPSC-derived human neurons, biopsy or postmortem tissue and enables exploration of the impact of such mutations on the neurexin isoform repertoires."

For expression of each construct, four 15-cm plates of HEK293T cells were transfected, conditioned media were collected 48 hr post-transfection, and incubated with 100 \u03bcl of SNAP-capture agarose resin (NEB) overnight. This results in covalent binding of the \u2018bait\u2019 proteins to the agarose beads. Beads were washed with pull-down buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). For pull-down, one brain of an adult (P25-P30) mouse (ca. 0.4g) was homogenized in 20 ml using a glass-homogenizer in pull-down buffer completed with protease inhibitors (Roche), 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. 5 ml of the supernatant was added to each \u2018bait\u2019 protein-bead preparation, and incubated overnight. On the next day, beads were washed 4 times with pull-down buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 1% sodium deoxycholate and prepared for mass spectrometry as described above."

After nucleofection, cells were grown in 2.5 ml DMEM in 6 well plates (one nucleofection per well). 24 hr post-nucleofection, 10 \u03bcM biotin was added to cells transfected with \u2018bait\u2019 mixes. On the next day \u2018bait\u2019 cells (5 wells) were pooled, washed 1x with DMEM (without serum), and re-suspend in 10 ml DMEM (without serum) in 15-ml tube. 75 \u03bcl neutravidin-magnetic beads (Pierce) were added and incubated for 15 min (overhead shaker). During pre-incubation of \u2018bait\u2019 cells with magnetic beads \u2018prey\u2019 cells (one well for each NRX1-alpha construct or control) were collected in 15-ml tubes, spun down, and re-suspended in 1.5 ml DMEM (without serum). To each tube with \u2018prey\u2019 cell suspension, 2 ml of \u2018bait\u2019 cells/magnetic beads suspension was added. Suspension mixes were aliquoted (1 ml) in round bottom 2 ml tubes. One 200 \u03bcl aliquot was taken (input). Suspensions were incubated for 60 min at RT on an overhead shaker. Magnetic beads were washed once with 1 ml DMEM and bound cells were lysed in 100 \u03bcl of 1X passive lysis buffer (Promega) complemented with protease inhibitors. Input samples (200 \u03bcl) were lysed by adding 100 \u03bcl of 3x passive lysis buffer."

Obtained results are systematically analyzed and initial validations performed that will guide future in-depth mechanistic investigations.

They do so by developing a workflow for targeted mass spectroscopy that is based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) signatures of individual variants. Their results provide quantitative measurement of neurexins from different regions of mouse brain and reveal the relative abundance of certain isoforms. In general the experiments are well executed and the strategy is elegant. The possibility of extending this type of analyses to other protein families is very attractive.\u201d"
