We report the first genome-wide study of NCO events in humans. Using SNP array data from 98 meioses, we identified 103 sites affected by NCO, of which 50/52 were confirmed in sequence data. Overlap with double strand break (DSB) hotspots indicates that most of the events are likely of meiotic origin. We estimate that a site is involved in a NCO at a rate of 5.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>/bp/generation, consistent with sperm-typing studies, and infer that tract lengths span at least an order of magnitude. Observed NCO events show strong allelic bias at heterozygous AT/GC SNPs, with 68% (58\u201378%) transmitting GC alleles (p = 5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>). Strikingly, in 4 of 15 regions with resequencing data, multiple disjoint NCO tracts cluster in close proximity (\u223c20\u201330 kb), a phenomenon not previously seen in mammals."

We report the first genome-wide study of NCO events in humans. Using SNP array data from 98 meioses, we identified 103 sites affected by NCO, of which 50/52 were confirmed in sequence data. Overlap with double strand break (DSB) hotspots indicates that most of the events are likely of meiotic origin. We estimate that a site is involved in a NCO at a rate of 5.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>/bp/generation, consistent with sperm-typing studies, and infer that tract lengths span at least an order of magnitude. Observed NCO events show strong allelic bias at heterozygous AT/GC SNPs, with 68% (58\u201378%) transmitting GC alleles (p = 5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>). Strikingly, in 4 of 15 regions with resequencing data, multiple disjoint NCO tracts cluster in close proximity (\u223c20\u201330 kb), a phenomenon not previously seen in mammals."

In addition to finding 103 sites where these events occurred, Williams et al. discovered that non-crossover events are more frequent around sites where crossover events also have a higher frequency. This suggests that the mechanism that initiates non-crossover events is shared with crossovers, and that non-crossover events primarily occur during meiosis.

The number of such variable genetic positions that non-crossover events affect in a generation is roughly the same number as the number of newly generated random mutations to the DNA sequence in a generation. Examining the DNA sequences transferred during non-crossover events also shows that two different types of DNA bases (cytosine and guanine) are more likely to be transmitted by a non-crossover event than are the other two bases (adenine and thymine). This bias indicates that non-crossover events are an important factor in driving genome evolution. In the future, sequencing the entire genome\u2014the total genetic material\u2014of many different people could provide further insights into non-crossover events in humans."

Thus SNP array data will identify only a small subset of NCO events. Moreover, to be informative about NCO events (and recombination in general), a site must be heterozygous in the transmitting parent, so not all assayed positions are informative."

Errors in SNP array data can in principle confound an analysis of NCO because certain classes of errors can mimic these events (e.g., if a child is truly heterozygous but is called homozygous, or if a parent is homozygous but called heterozygous). Our study design minimizes false positive NCO calls by using three-generation pedigrees, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. The approach requires that a putative NCO event identified in a child in the second generation is also transmitted to a grandchild (red arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Additionally, the approach validates the genotype of the transmitting parent as heterozygous by requiring that the allele from the alternate haplotype in that parent (i.e., the one that is not transmitted in the putative NCO) be transmitted to at least one child (blue arrow in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These requirements exclude the possibility that a segregating deletion will be misinterpreted as a NCO event. Moreover, they guarantee that a false positive NCO event will only be called if there are at least two genotyping errors at a site. Specifically, for a false positive to occur, either the recipient of the NCO and his or her child must be incorrectly typed, or the parent transmitting the putative NCO and the child/children receiving the alternate allele must be in error. This approach decreases the number of events that can be detected since not all sites affected by NCO will be transmitted to a grandchild, but importantly it also greatly reduces the false positive rate.

Next, we identified informative sites relative to each parent in the first generation: sites where the parent is heterozygous, the inferred phase is unambiguous, and where, if a NCO event were to occur, both alleles would be transmitted to children (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019\u2014\u2018Determination of informative sites\u2019). We then examined all apparent double CO events that occur within a span of 20 informative sites or less, that is, we identified haplotype transmissions that contain switches from one parental haplotype to the other and then switch back to the original haplotype. Most of these recombination intervals span one to three SNPs and are less than 5 kb; these are putative NCO events. A few loci showed complex patterns with multiple, discontinuous recombination events across several SNPs, with tracts spanning 5 kb or more; these are not counted as NCOs but are described further below."

By these criteria, there are 51 events, of which 26 (51%) overlap a meiotic DSB hotspot. Moreover, when focusing on events transmitted by males (because the DSB map is for spermatocytes), 19 of 27 events (70%) overlap a DSB hotspot.

This sperm-based study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate direct evidence of gBGC in mammals. In the NCO events identified here, we saw no evidence for a difference in GC transmission rate between the two SNP density datasets (p = 0.18, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> 1-df test), or between males and females (p = 0.79, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> 1-df test), and so considered the data jointly. For this calculation, we again omitted the ambiguous NCO events (described below and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019\u2014\u2018Inclusion criteria\u2019) and we excluded the four sites that occur within <i>PRDM9</i> motifs. The remaining 92 NCO sites all have an AT allele on one homolog and GC on the other, a consequence of the fact that only \u22641% of sites on the Illumina SNP arrays are A/T or C/G SNPs. We observed a strong bias towards the transmission of G or C: of the 92 sites, 63 transmit G or C alleles (68%, 95% CI 58\u201378%; p = 5.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, two-sided binomial test). SNP variants at CpG dinucleotides account for 39 of these 92 sites, and these also show GC bias, with 25 CpG sites (64%) transmitting GC alleles, and no evidence of rate difference between transmissions at CpG and non-CpG sites (p = 0.58, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> 1-df test). By comparison, the sperm-typing study noted above found that two of six assayed hotspots exhibited detectable levels of gBGC, and these two loci transmitted GC alleles in \u223c70% of NCO transmissions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Odenthal-Hesse et al., 2014</a>). Across recombination rate bins, we observed consistent GC transmission rates (p = 0.67, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> 5-df test <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Since the strength of gBGC depends on both the degree of bias and the rate of recombination, this finding implies that the effects of gBGC will be strongest in high recombination rate regions, as seen in analyses of polymorphism and divergence (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duret and Galtier, 2009</a>)."

We also examined these regions for overlap with segmental duplications, but found none (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019\u2014\u2018Examination of regions containing clustered NCOs\u2019). Finally, to evaluate whether an uncharacterized paralogous sequence variant could confound the results, we considered the genotype status (homozygous or heterozygous) of variants within these regions. Haplotypes 10 and 12 include heterozygous and homozygous genotypes both within and outside the NCO tracts. For haplotypes 11 and 13, the genotypes at all NCO sites are homozygous whereas the genotypes at other sites (blue in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) are heterozygous. This observation raises the concern of a structural variant or duplicated sequence that has not been identified and spans the nearby CO breakpoint. In this case, heterozygous genotypes could be mismapped to the wrong side of the CO and possibly mimic a NCO tract. Reassuringly, at all these positions, the non-transmitting parent is homozygous, one sibling is heterozygous, the other is homozygous, and neither of the other children received a recombinant haplotype.

More generally, our results provide a direct confirmation of the presence of gBGC, and lend strong support to the hypothesis that it could play a major role in shaping base composition over evolutionary timescales (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duret and Galtier, 2009</a>). Our estimated rate of GC transmission is high relative to what was found in the recent sperm-typing study, where only two of six hotspots had such a bias (\u223c70%) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Odenthal-Hesse et al., 2014</a>). In that regard, one possible caveat is that, under certain conditions on mutation, the ascertainment bias of SNP genotyping arrays could lead SNPs subject to stronger biased gene conversion to be enriched, and thus lead us to slightly over-estimate the strength of biased gene conversion across the genome."

Both our findings and recent results from human sperm (<a href=\"#bib38\">Odenthal-Hesse et al., 2014</a>) indicate that in contrast, in humans, gBGC does operate in NCO events, pointing to a difference in repair mechanisms between humans and yeast that remains to be elucidated."

Intriguingly, we also identified several examples of loci where multiple NCO tracts cluster within 20\u201330 kb intervals, as well as instances of complex CO over extended intervals. As a potential example of the same phenomenon, a study of de novo mutations reported observing regions with NCO sites across intervals spanning between 2\u201311 kb (<a href=\"#bib12\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>). These events may either be long NCO tracts or clustered but discontinuous NCO events in the same meiosis. In any case, the complex NCO resolutions seen in our pedigree data has not been reported in mammals previously, and is consistent with either with patchy GC biased repair across long stretches of heteroduplex DNA or repeated template switching during the repair of DSBs. Alternatively, these events may arise through mitotic recombination, a process that has been found to produce similar patterns in yeast (<a href=\"#bib44\">St Charles and Petes, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yin and Petes, 2013</a>).

Fourth, except at sites that are putatively affected by NCO, we required a second child to have received the same haplotype as the child that is potentially informative. This requirement helps to ensure the validity of the heterozygous genotype call of the parent.

If the fourth child were to receive a NCO at some subsequent position, it would receive haplotype \u2018A\u2019, and thus all four children would receive the same haplotype. This scenario violates the requirement that the alternate allele (not transmitted in the putative NCO) be transmitted to at least one second-generation child. Thus, at this example site, the fourth child is not informative (where it is the sole recipient of haplotype \u2018B\u2019).

Sites in which all individuals in a nuclear family are heterozygous have ambiguous phase. Thus, if a given child is homozygous at a marker but all other individuals in the family are heterozygous, the child is not informative at that site since a NCO event would lead the child to be heterozygous. We note that it is possible to identify putative NCOs when a child receives a haplotype that has recombined from otherwise ambiguous phase to be homozygous at this type of marker. Indeed, we identified five such putative NCO sites, but did not include them when calculating the rate of NCO since the denominator does not include ambiguously phased sites and is therefore ascertained differently."

Here, the phasing procedure may incorrectly infer that an allele transmitted by the recipient was instead transmitted by his/her partner; thus the potential NCO allele is not necessarily observed in the grandchildren. To address this issue, we filtered sites that have two properties: (1) the recipient is called homozygous, but the partner and grandchildren are all heterozygous, and (2) both parents transmit only one of their haplotypes to the third generation. If, in contrast to property (2), either the recipient or the partner transmits both his/her haplotypes, this type of erroneous NCO genotype call will produce haplotype assignments in the grandchildren with apparent recombination events relative to flanking markers. As a result, there will be an apparent NCO in the third generation and a filter noted above will remove the site from consideration."

We called genotypes in the five grandchildren at seven of the eight sites, and call four of the five grandchildren at the eighth site. Data quality for other individuals in the pedigree was high for four of the eight sites, but low for the other four sites. In all cases for which we obtained genotype calls, the Sanger data are concordant with the Complete Genomics data. Overall, the Sanger sequence data provided genotype calls for three (haplotypes 11 and 12) or four (haplotype 10) NCO sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) as well as one (haplotype 11) and at least two sites (haplotypes 10 and 12) that descend from the background haplotype (red in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

Our quality control procedure already removed individual SNPs that overlap several of these resources (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019\u2014\u2018Quality control procedures\u2019), and this additional analysis revealed no overlap with the regions containing these clustered events."

As previously noted, haplotypes 11 and 13 are ambiguous with respect to NCO status; for these, we included all sites between NCO tracts for both possible recombination outcomes.

For the suggested primer designs, we performed a BLAST against the human reference to ensure that each primer is unique, and ordered primers from Eurofins Operon. We tested each primer using the temperature suggested during primer design on DNA at a concentration of 10 ng/ul and checked on a 2% agarose gel. For any primer with poor performance, we conducted a temperature gradient, and, if needed, a salt gradient until we found a PCR mix that performed well. Next we performed PCR on the samples of interest, running a small quantity on a 2% agarose gel. We then cleaned the PCR sample using Affymetrix ExoSAP-IT and ran sequencing reactions twice for each sample using Life Technologies BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. Finally, we purified each sample using Life Technologies BigDye XTerminator Purification Kit and placed these onto the 3730xl DNA Analyzer for sequencing."

If CO and NCO activities are correlated at this scale (10Kb), one needs to know more accurately the correlation between CO hotspots activity and NCOs. A better stratification of CO activity is necessary, and may clarify this point and then allow a separate analysis of events in hot regions (thus most likely to be meiotic) or in cold regions for transmission bias. Please also clarify the interpolation (size of intervals used, accuracy) for the many (how many?) sites/events where high resolution CO mapping is not available."

The transmission bias in gene conversion events is much weaker in yeast (at most 55:45, depending on how it is measured (Lesecque et al. 2013) compared to what is reported here in humans (70:30). One possible explanation is that the intensity of gBGC in yeast is weakened by interference among neighboring SNPs (Lesecque et al. 2013) (the SNP density in the yeast strain that was analyzed is very high, and the direction of the repair at a given SNP is not independent of that at flanking SNPs). One puzzling observation is that in yeast, gBGC is exclusively associated with CO events (Lesecque et al. 2013). This suggests that the molecular mechanisms that cause gBGC might differ between yeasts and mammals. It might be worth discussing these points."

Among NCO sites transmitted by individuals that likely carry only the <i>PRDM9</i> A or B alleles (see below regarding PRDM9 variants), four NCO sites overlap such motifs, and in all four, the motif matches 6 of the 8 bases. The NCO events at these four sites all transmit a GC allele, the opposite of what would be expected from initiation bias. However, within 2 kb of all of these sites, there are other sequences that match the PRDM9 motif: three events have sequences with matches to 7/8 bases, and the fourth contains another motif in which 6/8 bases match. If these other matches are the ones bound by PRDM9 rather than the analyzed NCO sites, the observed GC transmissions may not derive from initiation bias but rather from bias in repair. In any case, if we exclude these four sites from consideration (as done in the revised manuscript), we continue to observe strong GC bias, with 63/92 = 68% of sites transmitting GC alleles (<i>P</i>=8.1\u00d710<sup>-4</sup>)."
