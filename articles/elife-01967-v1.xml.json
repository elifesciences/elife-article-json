Here, we show that the shape of <i>Arabidopsis</i> pavement cells creates a stress pattern that controls microtubule orientation, which then guides cell wall reinforcement. Live-imaging, combined with modeling of cell mechanics, shows that microtubules align along the maximal tensile stress direction within the cells, and atomic force microscopy demonstrates that this leads to reinforcement of the cell wall parallel to the microtubules. This feedback loop is regulated: cell-shape derived stresses could be overridden by imposed tissue level stresses, showing how competition between subcellular and supracellular cues control microtubule behavior. Furthermore, at the microtubule level, we identified an amplification mechanism in which mechanical stress promotes the microtubule response to stress by increasing severing activity. These multiscale feedbacks likely contribute to the robustness of microtubule behavior in plant epidermis."

Here, we show that the shape of <i>Arabidopsis</i> pavement cells creates a stress pattern that controls microtubule orientation, which then guides cell wall reinforcement. Live-imaging, combined with modeling of cell mechanics, shows that microtubules align along the maximal tensile stress direction within the cells, and atomic force microscopy demonstrates that this leads to reinforcement of the cell wall parallel to the microtubules. This feedback loop is regulated: cell-shape derived stresses could be overridden by imposed tissue level stresses, showing how competition between subcellular and supracellular cues control microtubule behavior. Furthermore, at the microtubule level, we identified an amplification mechanism in which mechanical stress promotes the microtubule response to stress by increasing severing activity. These multiscale feedbacks likely contribute to the robustness of microtubule behavior in plant epidermis."

An unusually shaped epithelial cell is the pavement cell, which looks like a jigsaw puzzle piece and is found in the leaves of many flowering plants. Relatively little was known about the exact contribution of mechanical properties of the wall to this shape. Furthermore, although it was known that parts of pavement cells are rich in microtubules\u2014tubes of protein that act as a scaffold inside the cell\u2014 the possibility that shape impacts the behavior of microtubules was not fully addressed."

In an individual cell, microtubules align along the direction of the largest stress, with a protein severing those microtubules that are not aligned in this direction. As the stress inside a cell is determined in part by the cell\u2019s shape, this sets up a feedback loop: the stress resulting from the cell shape aligns the microtubules that reinforce the cell wall, thus maintaining the shape of the cell."

Because all of the plant cells are under turgor pressure from the inside, pressure from the outside, like squeezing a balloon, changes the stress pattern, causing the realignment of the microtubules so as to resist the new stress. This shows that the microtubules respond to local stresses within a cell, and are continually responsive to stress changes."

Consistently, several mechanisms ensure some level of coordination between epithelial cells. In addition to biochemical signals, such as morphogens that diffuse and provide regional coordination across several cell files (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wolpert, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jonsson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jaeger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wartlick et al., 2009</a>), mechanical stress also contributes to growth coordination, for instance by synchronizing cell proliferation rate (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shraiman, 2005</a>) and orientation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thery et al., 2007</a>), or by prescribing cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asnacios and Hamant, 2012</a>) and cell fate (<a href=\"#bib16\">Engler et al., 2006</a>). In theory, these coordinating mechanisms could lead to relatively homogeneous cell shapes. While this is observed in some classic cases, such as the cells of <i>Drosophila</i> ommatidia or <i>Arabidopsis</i> petals, most epithelia exhibit variable cell sizes and shapes, demonstrating that each cell retains the ability to regulate its own growth and shape (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2012</a>). This heterogeneity has been studied in several systems. In <i>Drosophila</i> embryos, stochastic actomyosin-dependent constrictions of cells occur during gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martin et al., 2009</a>) and dorsal closure (<a href=\"#bib51\">Solon et al., 2009</a>), and this stochasticity has been proposed to play a key role in invagination events (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pouille et al., 2009</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i> sepals, stochastic events including cell division and entry into endoreduplication also play a critical role in the distribution of cells of different shapes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roeder et al., 2010</a>). Altogether this suggests that cell behavior results from both local and supracellular cues. The exact role of such heterogeneity remains poorly explored, and how cells can differentiate between local and global cues is completely unknown. In this study, we show that mechanical stress act as a common instructing signal for microtubule (MT) orientation at both subcellular and tissue scales."

MT arrays have been proposed to align along maximal mechanical stress directions in the shoot apical meristem, as prescribed by tissue shape, assuming tension in the epidermis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamant et al., 2008</a>). Mechanical forces were recently found to modify MT organization in leaf epidermal cell layers (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jacques et al., 2013</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i> and most angiosperms, the cotyledon and leaf epidermal cells, also called pavement cells, exhibit typical jigsaw puzzle shapes, with indented regions and lobe-like outgrowths. The intracellular effectors of these morphologies are being described in many reports. In particular, indenting regions are enriched in cortical MTs, which are thought to restrain growth expansion via the presumptive localized deposition of stiff cellulose microfibrils (CMF) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yang, 2008</a>). Although this model seems relatively parsimonious, these biophysical assumptions have not been tested. The MT severing enzyme katanin is required for local MT ordering in pavement cell indenting regions, downstream of the plant hormone auxin and Rho GTPases (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). How robust shapes could derive from such regulation is however a subject of debate."

In this study, we have combined computational models and experiments to determine the relation between physical forces, material elasticity, and the behavior of cortical MT. We first relate MT behavior to cell wall reinforcements. Second, we confirm (in a different tissue than investigated in the past and at a different scale) that MTs orient along the predicted maximal tensile stress direction\u2014and in this case, that they can do so at a subcellular or a supracellular scale, depending on the stresses involved. Lastly, we take advantage of the large size of the pavement cells to show how the MT response to stress depends on MT severing-dependent self-organization events. Altogether, this provides a scenario, in which not only tissue shape, but also cell shape, depends on a mechanical feedback loop. Based on our results, we propose that cells sense mechanical stresses at the subcellular scale, and that they are hence able to integrate cell shape-derived stresses and tissue shape-derived stresses, with a single mechanism."

                                "text": "The presence of parallel bundles of MTs in pavement cells is spatially correlated with indenting neck regions of the cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fu et al., 2005</a>). However, this correlation is debated, as MT orientations can be very noisy and pavement cell growth has even been proposed to be rather isotropic (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). To quantify MT behavior in pavement cells, we used a nematic tensor-based tool to measure MT anisotropy (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boudaoud et al., 2014</a>). This showed that MT arrays in indenting regions were more anisotropic than the MT arrays in lobes (mean \u00b1 SE is 0.40 \u00b1 0.02 for indenting region and 0.20 \u00b1 0.02 for lobes, n = 18 cells; 3 seedlings; p&lt;0.01, <i>t</i> test; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Time lapse imaging of pavement cells showed that the anisotropy of MTs was maintained in indenting regions after 3 hr (mean \u00b1 SE is 0.47 \u00b1 0.01, n = 14 cells; 3 seedlings), consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Note that we focused our analysis on a stage where cells have already attained their jigsaw puzzle shape and are still growing; our conclusions do not necessarily apply to these cells at a younger, undifferentiated stage or at an older, fully grown stage. The correlation between pavement cell shape and the presence of stably aligned MTs in indenting regions suggests that pavement cell shape relies on the impact of MTs on the mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall in these regions. This however has never been demonstrated. To directly measure mechanical properties of the outer wall with sufficient resolution, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe different regions of pavement cells, using an established protocol (<a href=\"#bib39\">Milani et al., 2011</a>). First, we probed guard cells, in which the presence of transverse MT and CMF is unequivocally established (<a href=\"#bib37\">Marcus et al., 2001</a>). The stiffness map of the outer wall of guard cells revealed the presence of transverse wall reinforcements matching the CMF orientation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Therefore, our AFM approach has sufficient spatial resolution to reveal mechanical heterogeneities in cell walls. The AFM-based stiffness map of pavement cells also revealed the presence of mechanical heterogeneities, with apparent elastic moduli spanning the range 2\u20138 MPa. In particular, we found fibrous patterns of higher elastic modulus congregating at sites of indenting regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These lines are independent of small-scale topography (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Note that with AFM, we are measuring the mechanical properties of the wall in the normal direction to the wall surface with an isotropic probe, and therefore, we are not assessing the very local mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall in-plane. Yet, our data reveal a spatial pattern of mechanical anisotropy at a larger scale, and thus can be used as a proxy for mechanical anisotropy in sub-regions of the cell\u2019s outer wall. Staining for cellulose in mesophyll cells of wheat that exhibit alternating patterns of lobe like outgrowth and indenting regions has shown a strong presence of cellulose in the constricted regions of the cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jung and Wernicke, 1990</a>). Altogether, this suggests that CMFs act as a brace around the indenting regions providing mechanical reinforcement of those regions."

The 3D geometries of the cells were extracted from confocal microscope images of pavement cells processed with MorphographX and meshed with quadrilateral shell elements (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</a>). The boundaries of the cells contain additional beam elements that account for increase in stiffness due to the presence of the anticlinal walls. For the material properties, we used a constitutive model of hyperelastic transversely isotropic material. To account for the mechanical anisotropy of the wall (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baskin et al., 1999</a>), elasticity of the tissue was represented by the behavior of an isotropic matrix combined with the resistance of CMF oriented in a single-preferred direction per element.

Stress directions were also computed in a model representing a 3D pavement cell shape along with the anticlinal and bottom walls. The model generated principal stress tensor direction pattern similar to the curved surface model (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). Both cases showed a higher magnitude of tensile stresses in the indenting neck-like regions, matching the local MT pattern; compression forces at approximately 10% of the tension value were observed in some regions close to the cell boundary with no clear relation with MT behavior (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F</a>).

The simulations thus suggest that for small elastic deformations the overall stress pattern is affected more strongly by the geometry of the cells than by the mechanical anisotropy of the existing cell wall material."

Application of compressive forces resulted in hyper-alignment of MTs. We tested whether mechanical stress can act as an instructive signal to organize MTs in cotyledon pavement cells by performing mechanical perturbations. Our finite element model predicts that when subjected to compression from above, there is an increase in overall stress in physical models (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Note that this response would however largely depend on the ability of the epidermis epidermal wall to maintain a constant volume while under compression. We directly applied compressive forces to pavement cells by using a coverslip that was pressed on the surface of the cotyledons and kept in place using adhesive silicone applied on the margins (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Depth color-coded Z stacks of MT organization and transects of the confocal Z-stack showed flattening of cells due to compression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Imaging of MTs in the cells immediately after and 7 hr after compression showed rearrangement of MTs into more aligned arrays by 7 hr (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D,F</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>; mean \u00b1 SE is 0.37 \u00b1 0.06 for 0 hr, n = 95 cells, 5 seedlings and 0.57 \u00b1 0.06 for 7 hr, n = 95 cells; 5 seedlings; p&lt;0.0001; Mann\u2013Whitney U test; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). This increased MT anisotropy persisted for longer periods when the tissue was maintained in the compressed condition (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This response was also reversible: 24 hr following removal of compression, nematic tensor values for MT anisotropy were reduced to a value close to that obtained during the time point immediately after compression (mean \u00b1 SE is 0.24 \u00b1 0.02; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G,H</a>). It should be noted that the nematic tensor values between the 0 hr time point and the recovery state are not identical which could be the result of changes in imaging conditions (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). However, despite this the reported nematic tensor values clearly show a trend in the increase and decrease of the MT anisotropy in the compression experiments. These results on cotyledon epidermal cells are thus consistent with the recently published report on contribution of mechanical stress in controlling MT behavior in leaf epidermal cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jacques et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "A limit of the compression test is that water movements may be induced, and while it is extremely difficult to monitor, water flow may alter turgor pressure in the long term and thus the predicted stress pattern. So to further investigate the link between MT behavior and stress in pavement cells, we next induced large cuts to change stress patterns in cotyledons and observed the resulting MT pattern. The observation of tissue deformations after large cuts has long been used to deduce the stress pattern (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dumais and Steele, 2000</a>) and has recently been adapted to calculate solid stresses in animal tumors (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stylianopoulos et al., 2012</a>). Macroscopically, large cuts in cotyledons resulted in an immediate outward displacement of the cut edges, consistent with release of tension (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We also observed upward movement of mesophyll cells from the layer below (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), consistent with the epidermis being under tension as observed in other plant tissues (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kutschera and Niklas, 2007</a>). Simulation of such a large-scale nick in physical models was done with the assumption that laceration would lead to removal of turgor pressure from the cut cells followed by a reduction of wall elasticity, as previously published in more local (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamant et al., 2008</a>) and more global (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dumais and Steele, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kutschera and Niklas, 2007</a>) tissue contexts. Our physical model suggests that maximal stress directions become circumferential to the laceration after treatment and independent of cell geometry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). To test the model predictions, we performed similar lacerations on cotyledons of seedlings expressing fluorescent reporters of MTs. Time series imaging of MT rearrangements showed a progressive change in the organization of MT arrays around the site. After 3.5 hr, we observed hyper-aligned MT arrays in cells adjacent to the damaged region and at 7 hr the alignment advanced to cell layers farther away from the site of laceration, independently of cell shape (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Quantification of MT anisotropy showed a significant increase in MT anisotropy 7 hr after laceration (mean \u00b1 SE is 0.080 \u00b1 0.007 for 0 hr, n = 61 cells and 0.37 \u00b1 0.02 for 7 hr, n = 65 cells; 3 seedlings each; p&lt;0.0001; Mann\u2013Whitney U test), indicating that changes in tissue-wide stresses could override cellular level control of MT anisotropy."

Similar to the large scale laceration experiments, a circumferential rearrangement of stresses was observed. However, the rearrangement was less pronounced than after cotyledon dissection, and observed in cells only adjacent to the site of perturbation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). To test this experimentally, we ablated single cells using a pulsed dye-coupled laser to see if small-scale perturbations could decouple the cellular level control of microtubule organization. 7 hr after ablation, we observed that MT alignment had responded to treatment by tending toward a circumferential alignment around the ablated cell site. The MTs around the site of ablation were not completely circumferential, consistent with a scenario in which stress anisotropy is weaker in single cell ablation cases than in cases of large-scale dissection, therefore leading to a comparatively reduced alignment of MTs around the site of ablation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D,E</a>). The alignment observed after single-cell ablation was significantly different from that resulting from large-scale perturbation, in which a strong circumferential response was obtained."

The changes observed could be due to a modified pattern of mechanical stress but also to the biochemical consequences of wounding of the sample. To investigate this we used the cellulose synthase inhibitor isoxaben, as a pharmacological means of increasing mechanical stress in pavement cells. Isoxaben was shown previously to induce hyperbundling and hyperalignment of cortical microtubules along the predicted directions of maximal stress in shoot meristem cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>), consistent with increased stress levels in the cell walls compared to non-treated plants. Treatment of 3-day-old seedlings with 40 \u03bcM isoxaben for 16 hr led to a sizeable increase in the anisotropy of microtubules (mean \u00b1 SE is 0.27 \u00b1 0.04 for 0 hr, n = 53 cells and 0.54 \u00b1 0.08 for 16 hr, n = 53 cells; 3 seedlings; p&lt;0.0001, Mann\u2013Whitney U test; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). These observations add further evidence that mechanical forces are responsible for MT rearrangement. However, it should be noted that a much more complex scenario, involving both mechanics and wound responses, could govern this aspect of MT rearrangements."

When quantifying MT anisotropy in the <i>bot 1-7</i> katanin allele, we found a 60% reduction when compared to the wild type (Mean \u00b1 SE is 0.09 \u00b1 0.01 for <i>bot 1-7</i>, n = 83 cells; 4 seedling and 0.23 \u00b1 0.05 for WT, n = 53 cells; 3 seedlings), thus confirming the relation between MT ordering and pavement cell shape. It has been shown in the shoot meristem that the response of MTs to tissue stress relies on MT self-organization. In particular, MT rearrangement after changes in mechanical stress is promoted by katanin-dependent MT severing (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</a>). To test whether, as in the shoot meristem, katanin activity is required for the MT response to stress in pavement cells, we performed lacerations and compressions in the katanin mutant background <i>bot1-7</i>. In both assays, MT arrays in pavement cells remained relatively isotropic after the micromechanical perturbations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>).

Only subtle alignments could be detected in the immediate vicinity of the ablated zone in large-scale lacerations, but no alignment over several cell files was observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). These results are consistent with observations made in the shoot apical meristem (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</a>) and suggest that the MT response to stress is not only conserved in different tissues and at different scales, but also relies on a similar mechanism."

However, in seedlings subjected to changes in mechanical forces, cell files close to the site of ablation showed a significant increase in severing rate to 0.93 \u00b1 0.45 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup> events \u03bcm<sup>\u22122</sup> min<sup>\u22121</sup> (mean \u00b1 SD, N = 16 cells, 4 seedlings, total area of 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.01, <i>t</i> test) 3 hr after ablation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Measurement of number of crossover points (i.e., two polymerizing MT crossing each other without experiencing severing or catastrophe) immediately after and 3 hr after mock treatment showed a 9% increase (mean \u00b1 SE is 11.0 \u00b1 1.4 per 10 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> for 0 hr, n = 6 cells and 12 \u00b1 1.5 per 10 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> for 3 hr) whereas the cells experiencing changes in mechanical stress showed a 65% decrease in the number of cross over points (mean \u00b1 SE is 15 \u00b1 3 per 10 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> for 0 hr, n = 6 cells and 5 \u00b1 2 per 10 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> for 3 hr). These measurements demonstrate an up-regulation in the severing of MTs at crossover sites after changes in mechanical stress. This mechanism could enrich the population of free MTs, while removing the MTs that do not align parallel to maximal tensile stress, thereby resulting in the generation of anisotropic MT arrays."

Some pioneering studies in <i>Drosophila</i> have investigated the role of mechanical stress in tissues, and most notably in germ band extension (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sherrard et al., 2010</a>), dorsal closure (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Solon et al., 2009</a>), and gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pouille et al., 2009</a>) in relation to actomyosin reorganization. However the mechanical properties of these tissues have not been studied, notably because of the difficult physical access to these embedded tissues, and because the rapid growth dynamics of these tissues is not compatible with high resolution mechanical measurements, using for instance, atomic force microscopy. Because plant growth is much slower and because tissues are easily accessible, such measurements are possible in plants. Here, we could correlate the behavior of the microtubular cytoskeleton with the predicted stress pattern and with quantified mechanical properties. This validates a number of previous studies assuming that pavement cell shape depends on mechanical heterogeneities (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fu et al., 2005</a>), albeit relying only on MT behavior, and further supports plant tissues as facile systems to investigate the relation between the biophysics of growth and development."

The findings suggest that growth is restricted in pavement cell indenting regions due to localized accumulation of anticlinal MT arrays by regulating CMF deposition, whereas local outgrowths are associated with the presence of an actin cytoskeleton that promotes growth. More recently it has been proposed that an auxin-dependent self-organizing mechanism controls the ROP-based signaling network (<a href=\"#bib63\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). This model of differential growth is challenged by time lapse-imaging studies of pavement cell development, which shows an initial phase of multiple lobe initiations, followed by a phase of isotropic expansion during which the cell shape is maintained (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). These studies do not take into account the mechanical aspects of the cell. In our study we show how subcellular mechanical stresses control MT organization, which in turn affects the mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall thereby contributing to cell shape irrespective of the previously proposed mechanisms. We believe that such a signaling module could add robustness to shape changes at the cellular scale."

The organismal theory of multicellular organisms states that comprehension of tissue properties is essential to understanding the development of the organism, as opposed the view of cell theory, that proposes that the function of individual cells is what dictates development of the entire organism (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kaplan, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baluska et al., 2004</a>). Previous findings on the shoot meristem suggest that MT organization depends on tissue shape-derived stresses (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamant et al., 2008</a>). Here, we found that cells can also interpret mechanical signals that are generated by their own shape. As this response is lost in large-scale mechanical perturbations, we propose that MT behavior depends on stress intensity, which is cell autonomous as long as tissue stresses do not override it. Such a balance between cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous stresses could control subcellular events in animal systems too."

In several organisms tensile forces acting on the kinetochore complex-attached MT ends are known to influence MT elongation rates during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nicklas, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Skibbens et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gardner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Franck et al., 2007</a>). It remains to be tested if changes in mechanical forces could alter single MT dynamics in whole organism based studies. Previous studies on the shoot apical meristem show that katanin-mediated MT severing is required for MT response to changes in mechanical stresses (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</a>). Our data not only show that a similar mechanism is present in pavement cells, but also show that severing itself is promoted by mechanical stress. One possible mechanism for stress-dependent regulation of MT alignment, where each MT is stressed due to their coupling with CMFs potentially by means of the cellulose synthesizing complexes which ride along the MT synthesizing the CMFs parallel to the MTs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Paredez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bringmann et al., 2012</a>). In such a scenario, a MT under tension is strained producing a conformational change to the MT lattice, which then could bias the binding of katanin to the less strained MTs at crossover sites, leading to preferential severing of the MTs that are not aligned to the principal stress direction. Reports have shown that conformation changes to the MT lattice act as hotspots promoting katanin binding and activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">D\u00edaz-Valencia et al., 2011</a>). As a result, this strain in MTs would lead to a MT alignment parallel to the anisotropic stress, not to overall cellular strain. MT behavior would thus depend on two parameters of mechanical stress (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>): stress direction from cell and tissue shape determine the dominant MT orientation, which dictates wall reinforcement, and thus in turn contributes to cell and tissue shape; and stress intensity modulates severing activity, which controls the response of MTs to stress. Based on these results, there is no need for several rules to explain MT behaviors at different scales or in different tissues in response to mechanical signals and perturbations, and this parsimony might be one of the defining features of mechanical signaling, when compared to molecular signaling. As shape rather relies on the actomyosin network in animals, the impact of mechanical forces on actin dynamics may in principle have a similar multiscale role in animals."

For all other experiments, the macro was modified in order to include in the output the visual and numerical measure of anisotropy of the nematic and texture tensors. The modified macro displays directions of both eigenvectors of the tensor of which relative length is an indication of the anisotropy of the signal. The score is calculated as a difference between the principal eigenvalues divided by the sum of diagonal elements of the tensor. The score gives 0 in case of completely isotropic pattern and 2 in case of completely aligned pattern. Analysis was carried out in each cell by drawing an outline of the region of interest, using the \u2018Polygon selection\u2019 tool in ImageJ. The outlines covered the entire area of the cell, without the anticlinal wall signal. These regions were then recorded using the \u2018ROI manager\u2019 tool in ImageJ and saved for automatic selection of the same cells in other time points."

All quantitative measurements were performed using standard pyramidal tips (ScanAsyst Air, Bruker, Inc.). The tip radius is given by the manufacturer to be between 2 nm and 10 nm. The spring constant of cantilevers was measured using the thermal tuning method (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hutter and Bechhoefer, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Levy and Maaloum, 2002</a>) and was ranged from 0.3\u20130.5 N/m. The deflection sensitivity of cantilevers was calibrated against a clean silicon wafer. All measurements were made under water at room temperature and the standard cantilever holder for operation in liquid was used. Cotyledons were detached from the stem with a fine blade and the abaxial (lower) side of the cotyledon was used for the measurement. The upper side of the sample was adhered to a Petri dish using a tissue section adhesive (Biobond, Ted Pella, Inc.). Then the Petri dish was positioned on an XY motorized stage and held by a magnetic clamp. Then, the AFM head was mounted on the stage and an approximated positioning with respect to the cantilever was done using the optical macroscope."

Simulations involving pavement cell geometries were performed with in-house written software, which is specialized and optimized for cellular geometries. The software is based on a procedure of minimization of nonlinear strain energy for a given constitutive model of the material (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonet and Wood, 1997</a>). We have used a hyperelastic transversely isotropic model of the material, which is particularly suited for description of fibrillar tissues (<a href=\"#bib58\">Weiss et al., 1996</a>). For the matrix part of the material, we employed the Saint Venant\u2013Kirchhoff model. The epidermal cell wall surface was modeled with shell elements, designed to handle thin curved surfaces. Additional beam elements accounting for the presence of the anticlinal cell walls were placed along the projections of the individual cell boundaries on the epidermal surface. These beam elements were assumed to have Young\u2019s modulus of the matrix part of the material and thickness of 1/5 of the epidermal wall. For the model on feedback between wall anisotropy and mechanical stresses we have set the material anisotropy axis at each step of the Newton\u2013Raphson iteration aligned with maximal principal stress measured in the previous step. The model parameter values were chosen from different experimental estimates of plant cell wall elasticity based on measurements of in vivo samples (<a href=\"#bib53\">Suslov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hayot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nezhad et al., 2013</a>) and synthetic bio-composites (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chanliaud et al., 2002</a>). We set Young\u2019s modulus equal to 40 MPa for the matrix part of the material. The Young\u2019s modulus of the CMF was assumed to be five times larger than the matrix. Turgor pressure was set to 0.2 MPa and thickness of the epidermal wall was assumed to be 1 \u03bcm. We have also tested different values of these parameters varying them in the range 0.5\u20132 times the presented values and found the results of the simulations to be qualitatively consistent within these limits. To account for tension in the epidermal layer the outer boundary of the templates was expanded by 1% in the x-y plane. The inner boundaries of individual cells were free in the x-y plane and restricted in the z direction. Pressure was applied on the surface of each cell. The choice of low turgor pressure was mainly dictated by convergence requirements of our model. Large turgor pressures caused instability of the model with respect to x-y movement of the cell boundaries, as a result of our approximate treatment of anticlinal walls. We have found, however, that the stress pattern does not show major qualitative changes for larger pressures. Thus, we have used the turgor within low range of experimentally reported values assuring good convergence with reasonable computational cost."

These compression simulations were performed with a constant volume assumption and node to surface frictionless contact. Similar results were obtainable with a constant pressure assumption, but in that case the outcome of the simulation was dependent on material properties and the degree of deformation from pressing.

After having been out of fashion for a few decades, this topic (aided by new tools) is experiencing a renaissance. This manuscript complements recent work on tissue-level dynamics in the plant shoot meristem by examining the relationships between growth, stress patterns and microtubules (MTs) in crenulated pavement cells of the leaf epidermis. New data here provide more convincing experimental support that MTs respond to stress, and novel work with an AFM system shows that MT patterns and cellulose MF patterns match. Exploiting the large size of pavement cells and using mechanical manipulations (ablations), the authors show a correlation between the frequency of katanin-mediated MT severing events and reactions to mechanical stress. Their observation that tissue level stress can override cell level stress was also documented in a recent paper from <a href=\"#bib26\">Jacques et al. (2013)</a>. Altogether these experiments and models have the potential to have a broad impact on our thinking about mechanical influences on development."

When looking at the finer details of stress patterns of individual cells, the patterns do not look like what would be expected from a proper 3D model of a cell \u2013 the necks should be under compression and the lobes under tension (see for example <a href=\"#bib15\">Dumais and Steele 2000</a> paper, which the authors cite). In the presented model all stresses are tensional, even after ablation, which may not be realistic. Moreover, the text is misleading in making this appear to be a 3D model when it may be a 2D surface of cells, tethered to a substrate by springs at the anticlinal walls. If it is too difficult or inappropriate to apply the 3D model based on their previous shoot apex work (where cells have a very different shape), please explain. Similarly, the model used (and assumptions) should be much more clearly explained in the main text, as the difference between a 2D model with springs and a full 3D model is potentially very important. It is a bit hard to justify making a fine-grained analysis of stresses in a situation where the geometry of the model itself has not been shown to be representative of the system. For example, in 3D one would expect the neck of a pressurized, isolated pavement cell to be under compression."

The answer to this will give a parameter to address the cell autonomy vs. tissue response. Another simple test would be to look at whether guard cell MTs respond to cuts. Given the evidence that GCs created their own local zones of stress and oriented MTs, my guess would be no, but there might be an interesting correlation with \u201celevated\u201d vs. planar and open vs. closed stomata with respect to responsiveness.

In support, the authors point to their (very nice) previous work that suggests that MT orientation is controlled by stresses in the tissue, which can be deduced from organ shape (Introduction, paragraph 2). However, this is difficult to reconcile even in the shoot apex. If cells start out with a random orientation creating isotropic growth, why doesn't the plant just create a globular structure? How can MTs be responsible for both tissue shape and cell shape if their orientation is primarily controlled by stress? Another interpretation would be that MT orientation is specified by a mechanism other than stress. Genetically defined organizing centers could control tissue and cell polarity, controlling the orientation of MTs. The shape change induced by the MT orientation would then direct the cellulose orientation, and thus cell wall anisotropy, and create non-trivial shapes. The resulting shape would then have a stress pattern that correlates with the MT orientation, which the authors observe. What is the mechanism for sensing stress? It is relatively easy to sense strains, but how can you sense stress, without invoking strain at some point?"

The AFM results that show the technique can see the CMF bundles in walls. The results are very nice and convincing, and it is believable that you are indeed making a map of the CMF network with the AFM. However this are not measuring cell wall anisotropy in-plane with these experiments as the text seems to claim. However I see nothing wrong with using this data as a proxy for cell wall anisotropy. One should also note that this still does not show a causal relationship between MT and CMF orientation in this system, but it is convincing correlative data given what is already know about the interaction there."

When looking at the finer details of stress patterns of individual cells, the patterns do not look like what would be expected from a proper 3D model of a cell \u2013 the necks should be under compression and the lobes under tension (see for example</i> <a href=\"#bib15\"><i>Dumais and Steele 2000</i></a> <i>paper, which the authors cite). In the presented model all stresses are tensional, even after ablation, which may not be realistic. Moreover, the text is misleading in making this appear to be a 3D model when it may be a 2D surface of cells, tethered to a substrate by springs at the anticlinal walls. If it is too difficult or inappropriate to apply the 3D model based on their previous shoot apex work (where cells have a very different shape), please explain. Similarly, the model used (and assumptions) should be much more clearly explained in the main text, as the difference between a 2D model with springs and a full 3D model is potentially very important. It is a bit hard to justify making a fine-grained analysis of stresses in a situation where the geometry of the model itself has not been shown to be representative of the system. For example, in 3D one would expect the neck of a pressurized, isolated pavement cell to be under compression</i>."

In simpler cases (like a pressurized, rotationally symmetric Mexican hat shape as in <a href=\"#bib15\">Dumais and Steele, 2000</a>) one can infer stresses from curvature of the surface, and in our simulation of a hat shape we also observe compression in some regions of this structure (similar to <a href=\"#bib15\">Dumais and Steele 2000</a>). While Dumais and Steele report circumferential compression in more simple dome-shaped structures, we tend not to see this in our simulations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamant et al. (2008)</a>, Bozorg et al. (2014)). We can get a decrease in circumferential stresses. However, we mainly ascribe this to boundary effects, since if we smoothly continue the surface into a cylindrical shape we have tensional circumferential stresses throughout the tissue. In more complex structures, this is dependent on the precise geometry, boundary and loading conditions, especially for doubly curved surfaces (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>, Bozorg et al (2014))."

In support, the authors point to their (very nice) previous work that suggests that MT orientation is controlled by stresses in the tissue, which can be deduced from organ shape (Introduction, paragraph 2). However, this is difficult to reconcile even in the shoot apex. If cells start out with a random orientation creating isotropic growth, why doesn't the plant just create a globular structure? How can MTs be responsible for both tissue shape and cell shape if their orientation is primarily controlled by stress? Another interpretation would be that MT orientation is specified by a mechanism other than stress. Genetically defined organizing centers could control tissue and cell polarity, controlling the orientation of MTs. The shape change induced by the MT orientation would then direct the cellulose orientation, and thus cell wall anisotropy, and create non-trivial shapes. The resulting shape would then have a stress pattern that correlates with the MT orientation, which the authors observe. What is the mechanism for sensing stress?

This is an interesting topic, but the experiments we have done to date are with pavement cells after they already are in their characteristic jigsaw puzzle piece shape. The initial generation of this shape would require elements that we have not yet studied. In the meristem, we could propose that tissue-derived stresses contribute to tissue shape emergence, because we analyzed the formation of young primordia and we had quantitative data on growth, from which we could argue that an initial differential growth would be sufficient to generate anisotropic stress, and thus a microtubule pattern, which in turn would promote organ outgrowth and organ separation from the meristem (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamant et al. 2008</a>, cf Bozorg et al. 2014) where different models are compared to explicitly show that a stress feedback promotes anisotropic organ growth). In pavement cells, as we did not analyze growth at a subcellular level, it is more cautious to focus our conclusion on cell shape maintenance."

Yet, our data are consistent with mechanical stress playing a primary role in microtubule orientation. Could it be strain instead? Stress sensing mechanism will certainly involve an initial and very local measurement of strain (as that is the only way stress can be measured). There is however no convincing evidence that cell strain would act as a cue for microtubule orientation: the alignment of the microtubules is parallel to the principal direction of maximal stress both globally (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hamant et al. 2008</a>) and locally (this paper) but the alignment of the microtubules is not always correlated with the direction of maximal cell strain. In particular, microtubules tend to be perpendicular to the maximal strain direction in cells (e.g., in the peripheral zone of the meristem), whereas they are parallel to maximal strain in the boundary regions between shoot apical meristem and floral meristems, a region which is also under highly anisotropic tensile stress parallel to the microtubules (Burian et al. 2013, Bozorg et al. 2014). Thus a response to stress provides a more parsimonious explanation than a response to cell strain."

If a microtubule under tension is strained so as to make the severing enzyme katanin bind more poorly than to an unstrained microtubule, then severing will prefer MTs that are not aligned to the stress direction, and will eliminate them. This fits with the finding in the paper and in our previous work (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uyttewaal et al. 2012</a>) that severing is necessary to achieve alignment upon mechanical perturbation. There is also evidence from the literature that katanin activity can discriminate between microtubule domains with different properties (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis et al. 2002</a>; Diaz-Valencia et al. 2011). In this way a strain in microtubules results in alignment parallel to anisotropic stress, not to overall cellular strain. There are certainly other possibilities (e.g., a role of tension-induced microtubule polymerization (see <a href=\"#bib55\">Trushko et al. 2013</a>)), and this mechanism is not proven in any way, but this is an example where an initial strain imposed by a specific mechanism and specific subcellular complex could lead to alignment to stress."

In such a scenario a MT under tension is strained producing a conformational change to the MT lattice, which then could bias the binding of katanin to the less strained MTs at crossover sites leading to preferentially severing only the MTs not aligned to the principal stress direction. Reports have shown that conformation changes to the MT lattice act as hotspots promoting katanin binding and activity properties (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis et al. 2002</a>; Diaz-Valencia et al. 2011).

The compressed state is imaged with a cover glass and higher NA objectives, whereas the uncompressed recovery state is imaged with a water-dipping lens having lower NA.
