Algorithms designed to automate image segmentation suffer from substantial error rates and require significant manual error correction. Any improvement in segmentation error rates would therefore directly reduce the time required to analyze 3D EM data. We explored preserving extracellular space (ECS) during chemical tissue fixation to improve the ability to segment neurites and to identify synaptic contacts. ECS preserved tissue is easier to segment using machine learning algorithms, leading to significantly reduced error rates. In addition, we observed that electrical synapses are readily identified in ECS preserved tissue. Finally, we determined that antibodies penetrate deep into ECS preserved tissue with only minimal permeabilization, thereby enabling correlated light microscopy (LM) and EM studies. We conclude that preservation of ECS benefits multiple aspects of the connectomic analysis of neural circuits."

Algorithms designed to automate image segmentation suffer from substantial error rates and require significant manual error correction. Any improvement in segmentation error rates would therefore directly reduce the time required to analyze 3D EM data. We explored preserving extracellular space (ECS) during chemical tissue fixation to improve the ability to segment neurites and to identify synaptic contacts. ECS preserved tissue is easier to segment using machine learning algorithms, leading to significantly reduced error rates. In addition, we observed that electrical synapses are readily identified in ECS preserved tissue. Finally, we determined that antibodies penetrate deep into ECS preserved tissue with only minimal permeabilization, thereby enabling correlated light microscopy (LM) and EM studies. We conclude that preservation of ECS benefits multiple aspects of the connectomic analysis of neural circuits."

However, these algorithms often make 'segmentation errors' that researchers need to manually correct: for example, overlapping neurons may be counted as a single neuron, or a neuron may be marked into several segments. Correcting these errors is a time-consuming and tedious task that limits how much of the brain can be currently mapped. Future algorithm improvements will hopefully reduce the number of errors; Pallotto, Watkins et al. explored an alternative approach by making the images themselves easier to analyze using existing algorithms."

Pallotto, Watkins et al. have now developed a method of preserving tissue that maintains more space between the neurons, and used this method to preserve samples of mouse brain with different amounts of extracellular space. Pallotto, Watkins et al. found that the algorithm used to analyze the images of these samples made far fewer segmentation errors on samples that contained more extracellular space. It was also easier to identify the connections between different neurons in these samples. The next challenge will be to extend these methods to preserving extracellular space across whole brains."

Complete (connectomic) mapping of synaptic connectivity in these datasets, however, is hampered by the lack of automated analysis methods. The two most important goals for neuronal circuit reconstruction are the reliable reconstruction of neuronal morphologies and the identification of synapses. The delineation of morphologies has proven to be the most difficult step to automate. Current machine learning-based analysis methods enable semi-automated reconstructions (segmentations) of neurons that still require significant human effort to correct (<a href=\"#bib16\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). Many of the errors encountered during the automated segmentation of neuronal morphologies are related to the dense packing of neurites in neuropil, which frequently leads to the artifactual merging of neighboring neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jain et al., 2010</a>). Merging errors are particularly difficult to detect and correct, so most current approaches attempt to reduce merging errors by biasing the output of algorithms to generate over-segmentations of neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). Over-segmentation splits neurons into many small objects that must then be reassembled into complete morphologies, a labor-intensive process. Here, we illustrate that automated segmentation error rates are improved by reducing the packing density of neurites in neuropil."

One of the most significant, but often underappreciated, artifacts encountered during aldehyde-based fixation is the loss of extracellular space (ECS). Although this artifact was described decades ago, it has been omitted from major texts describing the ultrastructure of the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib35\">Peters et al., 1991</a>). The artifact was first recognized by <a href=\"#bib45\">Van Harreveld and Malhotra (1967</a>) and was convincingly demonstrated by comparing the appearance of aldehyde-fixed tissue with that of frozen tissue (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Harreveld and Steiner 1970a</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">1970b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Harreveld and Fifkova 1975</a>). The ultrastructure of rapidly frozen tissue revealed appreciable ECS volume fractions of 15\u201325%, depending on the brain region (<a href=\"#bib34\">van Harreveld and Khattab 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Harreveld and Fifkova 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Korogod et al., 2015</a>), compared to less than 5% ECS in aldehyde-fixed tissue. The presence of large in\u00a0vivoECS volume fractions was corroborated by complementary methods including brain conductivity measurements, tracer diffusion studies, and more modern high-pressure freezing experiments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rostaing et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sykova and Nicholson 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Korogod et al., 2015</a>). The primary cause of ECS loss is a net inward flux of ions during tissue fixation, which increases intracellular osmolarity, leading to a redistribution of water into cells and resulting in a swelling of cellular compartments (<a href=\"#bib45\">Van Harreveld and Malhotra 1967</a>). Cragg subsequently developed a method to preserve ECS during chemical fixation using a simple ion substitution protocol that replaces extracellular sodium and chloride with a membrane-impermeant molecule such as sucrose prior to fixation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cragg 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">1980</a>), preventing the net inward ion flux that leads to swelling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

We tested this hypothesis in the study presented here. Our goal was not to approximate the actual in vivo distribution of ECS. Rather, we reasoned that any manipulation of the ultrastructure that improved image segmentation, including perhaps exaggerating ECS volume fractions beyond physiological ranges, would be beneficial for connectomics so long as the manipulation did not alter synaptic connectivity. By utilizing an ECS-preserving chemical fixation protocol, we were able to titrate the ECS volume fraction in a variety of brain regions. We measured a significant reduction in automated segmentation error rates as the ECS fraction increased, indicating that ECS preservation improves the ability to automatically reconstruct neuronal morphologies from EM data."

We focused on identifying electrical synapses in a known retinal circuit and found that gap junctions were readily identifiable in ECS-preserved tissue, again due to the increased separation between neurites. Finally, we demonstrate that ECS preservation leads to significant improvements in the diffusion of antibodies into tissue sections with minimal disruption of ultrastructure, an important prerequisite for correlating immunofluorescence with EM. Therefore, we conclude that there are multiple practical benefits to preserving ECS that improve the connectomic analysis of neuronal circuits."

We initially applied Cragg\u2019s protocol to acute brain sections of the mouse cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb and, while ECS was preserved, membranes appeared excessively wrinkled. We therefore developed an alternative strategy to preserve ECS by simply varying the osmolarity of the fixative buffer. Because the loss of ECS during chemical fixation ultimately is due to an imbalance in osmolarity across cellular membranes, we reasoned that adjusting the osmolarity of the fixation buffer would enable us to control the ECS fraction in fixed tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). It is known that buffer molecules rather than fixative molecules contribute most to the physiological osmotic pressure (<a href=\"#bib49\">Young 1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bone and Ryan 1972</a>). Overall, we noticed smoother membranes using the osmolarity-based approach compared to the sucrose/phosphate protocol."

For example, a volume fraction of 23.9% in the external plexiform layer (EPL) of the olfactory bulb was observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) when fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde buffered with 175 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (CB, 343 mOsm) compared to 5.8% ECS when fixed with 100 mM CB (204 mOsm, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). By comparison, fixing tissue by transcardial perfusion, in which the blood\u2013brain barrier remains intact, consistently yielded &lt;1% ECS in the EPL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). We observed that we could achieve unrealistically large ECS fractions of &gt;25% in the olfactory bulb by raising the buffer osmolarity above 400\u2013450 mOsm, but we began to observe significant membrane ruptures and excessive cellular shrinkage under these conditions. To examine whether overall tissue dimensions changed (either swelled or shrinked) as a function of the preserved ECS fraction, we measured the cross-sectional thickness of 500 \u00b5m cortical sections by EM (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We did not observe a correlation between the fixative osmolarity and section thickness (p=0.46, one-way ANOVA), indicating macroscopic tissue dimensions are not affected by osmolarity-based ECS preservation. We also noted that ECS was preserved uniformly across 500-\u00b5m-thick sections, the maximum thickness that we tested (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Preservation of ECS was similar whether tissue was sectioned at 4\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating the described protocol is suitable if alterations of neuronal morphology due to cold shock are a concern (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kirov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bourne et al., 2007</a>)."

The only exception was the mouse retina, for which we were unable to preserve ECS by changing the osmolarity of the fixative buffer. Replacing the fixative buffer with unbuffered sucrose, although, restored our ability to preserve ECS in an osmolarity-dependent way (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). One possible explanation for this is that cellular membranes in the retina are permeable to the cacodylate anion (138\u2009g/mol), but not to sucrose (342\u2009g/mol). This observation indicates that the protocol requires fine-tuning for different brain regions, but we were able to control ECS preservation in every region we have studied."

Similar pixel classification errors were observed regardless of ECS fraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating that networks were equally able to learn the statistics of the images. We, however, were interested primarily in the degree to which ECS preservation affected the ability of neural networks to segment actual cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jain et al., 2010</a>). We therefore joined (segmented) regions of neighboring intracellular pixels and measured segmentation performance using two common segmentation metrics (see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods'). We color-coded segmentations using a four-color map method (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, fourth column) such that neighboring objects do not share a color. This approach helps to highlight the locations of two predominant error-types: mergers between neurons that should have been segmented as independent objects as well as the splitting of neurons into multiple objects. We observed a significant reduction in segmentation errors that correlated with increasing ECS fraction, regardless of the error metric we used (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,\u00a0D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, despite sharing similar pixel classification errors, images that contained some degree of ECS were easier to automatically segment. This is because ECS provides more separation between neighboring neurons leading to, for example, fewer mergers between cells."

We note that the error metrics were calculated based on a watershed of the network output and that no additional steps to improve the segmentations, such as supervoxel agglomeration (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jain et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2014</a>), were applied. In summary, the improvements in automated segmentation that were observed in 2D images were also found in a 3D analysis of ECS preserved compared to perfused tissue."

Chemical synapses indicated by clusters of presynaptic vesicles are relatively easy to identify in most brain regions. The identification of electrical synapses (gap junctions), however, remains difficult even in the highest resolution electron micrographs. The number of missed electrical synapses based on thin section images has been estimated to be as high as 75\u201395% (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rash et al., 1998</a>). Unless gap junctions are captured in cross-section in an electron micrograph, electron tomography is usually required to positively identify a gap junction (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rash et al., 1998</a>). But performing electron tomography on every putative gap junction in a large EM volume would prohibitively slow data acquisition of even modestly large volumes. We hypothesized that gap junctions would be easier to identify in ECS-preserved tissue given the reduction in incidental (non-synaptic) contacts between cells."

For the majority of these contacts, we observed a clear cleft between the apposed membranes (n = 150 cleft contacts), but, as well, we noted many instances in which we could not observe any cleft (n = 21 tight contacts) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>, see also Supplemental Data stacks). For each contact, we then traced the cell forming the contact through the 3D SBEM volume and classified each cell into four categories: AII amacrine cell, ON cone bipolar cell, presynaptic amacrine cell, or other (see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods'). The \u2018other\u2019 category included a variety of cell types including bipolar, amacrine, ganglion and glial cells that, although making cleft contact with the AII, formed no obvious synapse (e.g. no presynaptic clouds of vesicles were observed). Of the 150 cleft contacts, 13 were attributed to chemical synapses from amacrine cells. The remaining 137 cleft contacts assigned to the \u2018other\u2019 category were deemed to be incidental contacts or ribbon-type synapses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>)."

Of the 21 tight contacts we annotated, 4 were formed with a neighboring AII amacrine cell and 17 were formed with ON cone bipolar cell terminals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). Thus, in every instance, the tight contact was formed with a cell type known to be electrically coupled to the AII amacrine cell indicating that tight contacts in ECS preserved data are consistent with gap junctions. Moreover, AII-AII gap junctions were found in sublamina 5 of the IPL, and AII-ON cone bipolar gap junctions were found in sublaminae 3 and 4, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib39\">Strettoia et al., 1992</a>). We noted that the gap junctions were not identifiable based on contact geometry measurements, such as surface area, alone (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

A long-standing problem with preparing brain tissue for immunohistochemical observation is the incomplete diffusion of antibodies into large tissue volumes. Antibodies are large proteins and therefore strong permeabilization of tissue is typically\u00a0required for labeling thick tissue sections. Often, the degree of permeabilization required to label thick samples destroys the fine tissue ultrastructure. We hypothesized that the preservation of ECS would allow antibodies to penetrate deeper into tissue and would, therefore, require only minimal permeabilization. We tested this idea in the mouse retina using antibodies against the vesicular acetylcholine (VAChT) and GABA (VGAT) transporters, two antibodies that generate distinct labeling patterns in the retina. Following a fixation and minimal permeabilization procotol that we developed in order to preserve ECS and decent tissue ultrastructure (see 'Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods'), we incubated 200-\u00b5m-thick retinal sections with primary and secondary antibodies for relatively short durations (9\u2009hr each) and measured the labelling depth. We observed deeper penetration of both antibodies in ECS-preserved retina (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). VAChT penetrated 28.1 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b5m in ECS-preserved samples versus 6.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m in control samples; VGAT penetration was 16.9 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b5m versus 6.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m for ECS-preserved and control samples, respectively. The labeling patterns were consistent with the known expression patterns of the two transporters in the retina (<a href=\"#bib29\">Koulen 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Johnson et al., 2003</a>). We processed these same pieces of retina for EM and confirmed that the penetration depth correlated with the ECS fraction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, 0.2% vs. 19.2% ECS fraction). Furthermore, the ultrastructure of the weakly permeabilized tissue was well preserved (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Manual data analysis allows targeted reconstructions of small population of neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>) but is unfeasible for dense reconstructions. Automating image segmentation is therefore necessary for any reasonable scalability; trained human annotators, however, will still be required to correct the results of automated image processing algorithms (<a href=\"#bib16\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2014</a>).

                        "text": "Our findings indicate that preserving ECS aids the connectomic analysis of neuronal circuits in multiple ways. The loss of ECS during the conventional chemical fixation of brain tissue leads to densely packed neurites and tightly apposed plasma membranes that complicate automated analyses of EM data. We reasoned that preserving some degree of ECS would improve automated image segmentation methods due to the increased separation of non-synaptic membrane appositions. We emphasize that our goal was not to preserve in vivo-like ECS or neuronal volumes. Indeed, freezing tissue is likely the only way to approximate in vivo-like morphologies (<a href=\"#bib28\">Korogod et al., 2015</a>). Our goal was rather to measure image segmentation performance as a function of increasing ECS volume fractions. In other words, because changes in ECS are unavoidable during the chemical fixation of brain tissue, why not adjust the artifact to be more beneficial to us from a data analysis standpoint? Indeed, it was possible that actually exceeding in vivo ECS volume fractions would lead to the best segmentation performance. On the contrary, we found that while preserving ECS improved segmentation performance, the performance did not continue to improve with increasing ECS fractions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). One of the reasons for the diminishing returns on segmentation performance is the shrinkage of cells that accompanies increasing ECS fractions which makes segmenting thin processes, particularly glial sheets, more error prone. There, therefore, appears to be an optimal ECS fraction from the standpoint of image segmentation that balances the increased separation between neurites with the shrinkage of cellular compartments. Modest ECS fractions of 6% already significantly improve segmentation performance compared to fractions of &lt;1% (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>), typical of standard perfusion fixation protocols."

                        "text": "Most current EM segmentation strategies rely on generating over-segmentations (neurons are split into many objects) to avoid accidental mergers between neighboring neurons. These over-segmented objects then are joined together algorithmically (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jain et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2014</a>) and/or by human annotators (<a href=\"#bib41\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). The segmentation of ECS-preserved data results in fewer mergers, leading to better initial segmentations, and therefore should reduce the human effort required to generate accurate reconstructions. We modified a state-of-the-art CNN originally designed for natural image classification (<a href=\"#bib30\">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</a>) to analyze EM data. The CNNs we trained achieved similar pixel classification error rates regardless of the ECS fraction of a sample (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), but segmentation errors were reduced substantially by increasing ECS fractions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In other words, pixel classification errors have a more detrimental impact on segmentation when cells are tightly packed versus when they are separated by ECS. This basic observation should hold regardless of the particular analysis approach used (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rigoll et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jurrus et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Turaga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berning et al., 2015</a>).

The modification we made involved simply changing the osmolarity of the buffer used during fixation. This approach, however, was not successful in the mouse retina; we had to rather change to unbuffered sucrose fixation to preserve ECS in the retina. We have successfully preserved ECS uniformly across 500-\u00b5m-thick acute brain slices, the thickest slices we tested. High-pressure freezing is an alternative to chemical fixation that also preserves ECS (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rostaing et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sykova and Nicholson 2008</a>). The maximum slice thickness that is adequately preserved using this technique, however, is at most 200 \u00b5m: too thin to contain many neuronal circuits. The chemical preservation protocol we used is also far less expensive to implement than high-pressure freezing and is simple to evaluate in different brain regions and species."

Because improvements in data acquisition speeds eventually will allow larger volumes to be acquired, extending uniform ECS preservation to, for example, a whole mouse brain is an important goal. A previous study described a transcardial perfusion-based approach to preserve ECS throughout the brain involving transient opening of the blood-brain barrier and ion replacement (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cragg 1980</a>), but the uniformity of the ECS fraction across the brain was not evaluated. Given the benefits we observed, further exploration and validation of this whole-brain ECS preservation method is warranted."

Performing electron tomography on each putative gap junction in a large tissue volume is impractical. We therefore determined whether ECS preservation aided gap junction detection at a moderate pixel resolution (10 nm) using SBEM <a href=\"#bib13\">(Denk and Horstmann, 2004</a> )\u00a0data.\u00a0We found that subsets of all contacts onto an AII amacrine cell in the mouse retina are tight contacts with no visible cleft. We identified all these tight contacts as being formed with cells known to be coupled electrically to AIIs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Although we performed this analysis manually, we anticipate a relatively straightforward method for automating the detection of tight contacts between cells. Along the same lines, the automated identification of chemical synapses may also be aided simply because there are fewer incidental contacts between cells in ECS-preserved data. Importantly, the analysis of the AII amacrine cell circuitry demonstrates that the known synaptic connectivity is present in ECS-preserved tissue."

We wish to, in particular, note the pioneering work of Anthonie Van Harreveld who first elucidated this artifact in EM and whose careful analyses directly led to the ECS-preserving interventions that we employed. The relatively minor changes to existing tissue fixation protocols that preserve ECS ultimately benefit several aspects of the connectomic analysis of neuronal circuits."

Denk. The dataset spanned the inner plexiform layer including the ganglion cell layer and a portion of the inner nuclear layer. The retina was cut out of the flat-embedding block and re-embedded in Epon Hard on aluminium stubs. The retina was then trimmed to a block face ~200 \u03bcm wide and ~200 \u03bcm long. The samples were imaged in a scanning electron microscope with a field-emission cathode (UltraPlus, Carl Zeiss). Back-scattered electrons were detected using a custom-designed detector based on a special silicon diode (AXUV, International Radiation Detectors,\u00a0Torrance,\u00a0CA) combined with a custom-built current amplifier. The incident electron beam had an energy of 1.4 keV and a current of ~1 nA. Images were acquired with a pixel dwell time of 0.45 \u03bcs and size of 12 nm \u00d7 12 nm, which corresponds to a dose of ~31 electrons/nm<sup>2</sup>.

Networks were trained on 3GB Nvidia GTX 780Ti and 6GB GTX TITAN Black graphics cards (EVGA). The CNNs processed 2D images to learn labels for both 2D and 3D EM data. Training images were sampled from randomized pixels in the EM data such that the network was trained to learn, in parallel, the identity of all the pixels (ICS, ECS, or MEM) in a 16 x 16 pixel patch located in the center of 64 x 64 pixel input images (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jain et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ciresan et al., 2012</a>). We trained seven-stage convolutional networks containing (1) an input convolutional layer with 96 kernels of size 7, response normalization across 31 feature maps, and max pool subsampling of size 3 with stride of 2 (overlapped pooling resulting in an overall downsampling factor of 2); (2) a convolutional layer with 256 kernels of size 5 and the same normalization and subsampling as the first layer; (3,4) two convolutional layers with 384 kernels of size 3; (5) a convolutional layer with 256 kernels of size 3 and the same subsampling as the first layer; (6,7) two fully connected hidden layers of size 4096 each with a dropout rate of 0.5 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hinton et al., 2012</a>); and (8) an output layer of size 768 (16x16 output pixels x 3 pixel identities).

Two networks were trained by reslicing the original volumes to create xz and yz oriented images. The final voxel probabilities used to create EM segmentations were a weighted average of the five networks, with the probabilities from the xz and yz networks weighted at 0.5 relative to the xy networks. The randomized presentation of images to the network was balanced so that the center pixel ICS, ECS, or MEM identities were presented with equal probability. Because this procedure changes the prior probabilities and does not guarantee the same equal balancing for all 256 (16 x 16) output pixels, the output probabilities of test images were reweighted using Bayes\u2019 rule (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vucetic and Obradovic 2001</a>). The test probabilities (the target prior) represented the actual frequency of ICS, ECS and MEM voxels over all training data.

ICS and ECS probabilities were set to zero if they were not the winning probability, and then probabilities were binarized at increasing thresholds. For 2D segmentations the thresholds were 0.3, 0.4, 0.5; then from 0.5 to 0.99 in steps of 0.01; and then 0.995, 0.999, 0.9995, 0.9999, 0.99995, 0.99999, 0.999995, and 0.999999. For 3D segmentations thresholds were 0.3 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1; then 0.95, 0.975, 0.99; and then 0.995, 0.999, 0.9995, 0.9999, 0.99995, 0.99999, 0.999995, and 0.999999. At each binarization step, connected components (four\u00a0connectivity for 2D,\u00a0six connectivity for 3D) were created for all pixels above the threshold. Any components that fell below a minimum size threshold parameter (T<sub>min</sub>) of 64 pixels for 2D or 256 voxels for 3D were accumulated in a binary mask. Tests for the sensitivity of this parameter revealed that it had less than 1% impact on all metrics measured across the ranges tested (T<sub>min</sub> = 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). This step essentially was a method for detecting local peaks in the probabilities. Moving from low to high thresholds, connected components was run on the logical OR of the accumulated binary mask and the remaining binarized pixels above the current threshold level. These components were then dilated toward filling in the surrounding region of voxels with the matching winner-take-all identity using a topological warping technique that does not allow components to become split or merged (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kong and Rosenfeld 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Legland et al., 2011</a>). Any remaining ICS or ECS winner-take-all voxels were merged to the nearest (Euclidean distance) ICS or ECS component, respectively.

We summed the path lengths of all error free edges to get TEFPL, which was expressed as a percentage of the total path length in each volume."

For comparison between two groups of equal size, the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis\u00a0test was applied to assess whether there was any significance between medians, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for pairwise comparisons in the cases where the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was significant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). For comparison between two groups of equal size, unpaired t-tests were used (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). For correlation coefficients, the Student's t-test was used with n-2 degrees of freedom (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Confidence intervals for 3D skeleton-based error metrics were calculated using a Bernoulli sampling with an expected value of 95% of the minimum number of skeletons (n = 206)."

The approach of this paper is very interesting and relatively novel since the investigators are focused on improving sample preparation for segmentation algorithms rather than what the majority of the field is focused on, building better algorithms. The issue is related to the shrinkage of the extracellular space associated with the normal aldehyde fixation and processing procedures used for EM. As has long been known (from Van Harreveld's work in the 1950's and 1960's), the ECM is compressed during fixation and subsequent processing, as compartments like dendrites and astroglia swell a little at the expense of the ECM, which is compressed. Strategies to avoid this involve difficult to implement methods such as high pressure freezing and freeze substitution, (the methods introduced by Van Harreveld). This extreme method of stopping action by vitrification is not easy to use or apply to brains without also being concerned with the effects of anoxia on the way to the snap-freezing step. Anoxia itself results in similar differential changes in compartment sizes, at the expense of the ECM space. High osmolality and pressure in perfusions have been tried but results are very inconsistent. This work chose to investigate the utility of a work around using stabilized slice preparations, thus avoiding the concerns above, but introducing the obvious issue of the preparation having been ripped from the brain and then stabilized to be as good as a slice is in faithfully representing the in vivo physiology and anatomy. Since it is well known that significant synaptic remodeling occurs during slice stabilization (at least for the hippocampus where it has been studied carefully) the results here must be considered in the context of the preparation having already endured some likelihood of synaptic and other morphological changes. Nevertheless, the work shows a practical method for swelling extracellular space to make automated tracing more feasible for connectomics work. However, care should be taken to make sure the community does not conclude that this makes the spaces \"as they were\" in nature. There are a number of other serious concerns that need to be addressed in the revised version."

The authors only examined 2D segmentation and even within the 2D segmentation results, it is not clear that a certain fraction of ECS maximizes segmentation accuracy with the various metrics used to evaluate segmentation accuracy (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B-D</a>). Even more problematic is the lack of 3D automatic segmentation results. This is worrisome since there seem to be an abundance of very small neuronal processes (due to the inevitable 'shrinking' of cells caused by ECS preservation relative to standard EM datasets.) This has been well known in the efforts of the current connectomics community for preservation of the ECS and has remained a source of errors for tracing cellular processes in EM datasets. Examples of small processes can be seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and it is not clear whether they can be accurately traced over 3D either manually or by automatic segmentation. Without 3D segmentation results of these small processes, it remains possible that ECS preservation improves 2D segmentation but could actually worsen 3D segmentation and not improve our ability to trace the finest neuronal processes. Thus 3D segmentation results are important for demonstrating that this study has made a significant advance."

We agree with the authors that putative electrical synapses seem to occur in their dataset between cells known to have these connections, but it is difficult to evaluate whether it is possible to get an accurate number of these connections. Given that a 'goal' of dense circuit reconstruction is to move past qualitative descriptions of the type of connectivity between neurons (i.e. they are electrically or synaptically coupled) to quantitating numbers of connections, data about false positive and negative rates would make this result more compelling."

While it may be true that large-scale connectivity could not change in a few minutes during slice prep, however it is a shame that the authors do not reference the work of Kristin Harris' group showing that spines are lost on neurons in slices during cold shock (Kirov et al., Neuroscience 2004). There was also a follow-up paper showing that this can be largely avoided by preparing slices at room temp (Bourne et al., Neuropharmacology 2007). In the current manuscript, the authors are slicing before fixation at ice-temp. They do not state so clearly in the Materials and methods, but one has to assume from the Materials and methods description here that the slices then went directly into ice-cold fixative. So there is no warm recovery period and one would expect that there would be a severe loss of spines and other changes in microtubules, known to be cold sensitive. True, the synapses are probably still there, but they would appear to be onto dendrites instead of spines. This could make it difficult to distinguish excitatory and inhibitory synapses, for one thing. It means that this approach would not be well suited for use in any study focused on neuronal morphology, rather than just finding connections (with the concern about artifacts of slice preps as above). The authors should ensure that they further emphasize these potential limitations of their approach."

This has been well known in the efforts of the current connectomics community for preservation of the ECS and has remained a source of errors for tracing cellular processes in EM datasets. Examples of small processes can be seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and it is not clear whether they can be accurately traced over 3D either manually or by automatic segmentation. Without 3D segmentation results of these small processes, it remains possible that ECS preservation improves 2D segmentation but could actually worsen 3D segmentation and not improve our ability to trace the finest neuronal processes. Thus 3D segmentation results are important for demonstrating that this study has made a significant advance.</i> "

This error metric is sensitive to minor differences in how, for example, pixels are labeled near membranes. For example, if a neural network consistently provides a slightly eroded segmentation relative to ground truth labels, the pixel classification error will be high even though this may not change the resulting segmentation.

Block-face SEM data is typically of a lower lateral resolution than TEM sections (but substantially better Z resolution), 10 x 10 x 25 nm<sup>3</sup> voxels are state-of-the-art, which may lead to an even worse false negative rate. Our view is that the preservation of ECS at least makes it more likely to identify tight contacts that are oriented at arbitrary angles in 3D. That is, ECS preservation shifts detecting electrical synapses from \u2018nearly undetectable\u2019 to \u2018detectable\u2019 in SBEM data. We view this as a significant advance. Because we do not have a ground truth estimate of the number of gap junctions between AII-AII cells or between AII-CBC cells, we cannot estimate how many we may have missed. We could explicitly label for gap junctions, but that would require the collection of another large dataset and we feel this is beyond the scope of the paper."

Any tight contact that was formed with a cell known to not electrically coupled to AII amacrine cells is a false positive. In our sample, 0 of 21 tight contacts were formed with cells that do not couple to the AII. Therefore, given our sample, our current false positive rate is 0. We note two important details. First, the judgement of whether a contact was tight or cleft was made blind to the identity of the postsynaptic process. It is therefore not possible that we unintentionally biased our results towards cells known to couple to the AII. Second, the distribution of tight contacts along the axis of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) is in agreement with previously described positions of gap junctions. AII-CBC gap junctions are observed at the most distal tips of AIIs and AII-AII gap junctions are observed more proximal to the soma. Our results also show this pattern, further supporting the finding that we did not annotate false positives in our sample."

While it may be true that large-scale connectivity could not change in a few minutes during slice prep, however it is a shame that the authors do not reference the work of Kristin Harris' group showing that spines are lost on neurons in slices during cold shock (Kirov et al., Neuroscience 2004). There was also a follow-up paper showing that this can be largely avoided by preparing slices at room temp (Bourne et al., Neuropharmacology 2007). In the current manuscript, the authors are slicing before fixation at ice-temp. They do not state so clearly in the Materials and methods, but one has to assume from the Materials and methods description here that the slices then went directly into ice-cold fixative. So there is no warm recovery period and one would expect that there would be a severe loss of spines and other changes in microtubules, known to be cold sensitive. True, the synapses are probably still there, but they would appear to be onto dendrites instead of spines. This could make it difficult to distinguish excitatory and inhibitory synapses, for one thing. It means that this approach would not be well suited for use in any study focused on neuronal morphology, rather than just finding connections (with the concern about artifacts of slice preps as above). The authors should ensure that they further emphasize these potential limitations of their approach.</i> "
