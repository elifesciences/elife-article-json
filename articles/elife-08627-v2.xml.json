Yet, how the lengths of actin-based stereocilia are regulated remains poorly understood. Mutations of the molecular motor myosin 15 stunt stereocilia growth and cause deafness. We found that hair cells express two isoforms of myosin 15 that differ by inclusion of an 133-kDa N-terminal domain, and that these isoforms can selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows. Using an isoform-specific knockout mouse, we show that hair cells expressing only the small isoform remarkably develop normal stereocilia bundles. However, a critical subset of stereocilia with active mechanotransducer channels subsequently retracts. The larger isoform with the 133-kDa N-terminal domain traffics to these specialized stereocilia and prevents disassembly of their actin core. Our results show that myosin 15 isoforms can navigate between functionally distinct classes of stereocilia, and are independently required to assemble and then maintain the intricate hair bundle architecture."

Yet, how the lengths of actin-based stereocilia are regulated remains poorly understood. Mutations of the molecular motor myosin 15 stunt stereocilia growth and cause deafness. We found that hair cells express two isoforms of myosin 15 that differ by inclusion of an 133-kDa N-terminal domain, and that these isoforms can selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows. Using an isoform-specific knockout mouse, we show that hair cells expressing only the small isoform remarkably develop normal stereocilia bundles. However, a critical subset of stereocilia with active mechanotransducer channels subsequently retracts. The larger isoform with the 133-kDa N-terminal domain traffics to these specialized stereocilia and prevents disassembly of their actin core. Our results show that myosin 15 isoforms can navigate between functionally distinct classes of stereocilia, and are independently required to assemble and then maintain the intricate hair bundle architecture."

Once hair cells mature however, they switch to producing the larger version of myosin 15 that contains the N-terminal extension. In the mutant mice that lacked the larger version of myosin 15, stereocilia ultimately deteriorate, leaving the hair cells unable to detect sound."

Remarkably, unlike the short stereocilia bundles of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> and <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2-J/sh2-J</i></sup> hair cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Probst et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2000</a>), we found that stereocilia bundles of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> inner hair cells (IHCs) had the characteristic staircase architecture and were indistinguishable from normal hearing <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>+/\u0394N</i></sup> littermate controls at P4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We quantified the architecture of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> and control <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>+/\u0394N</i></sup> IHC bundles at P4 and found no differences in either the distribution of heights (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), or the aspect ratio of the second row mechanosensitive stereocilia tips (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Tip-links were present in both <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> and <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>+/\u0394N</i></sup> IHCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lower panels). The normal morphology of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHC hair bundles at P4 was striking compared to those of age-matched <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> mice that were abnormally short and had immature, omnidirectional links (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Hair bundles of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> IHCs also had supernumerary stereocilia rows, which were not observed in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similar to IHCs, <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> OHCs at P4 also developed a normal hair bundle morphology that was clearly distinct from age-matched <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> OHCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Although the hair bundles of IHCs and OHCs initially developed normally at P4, they subsequently degenerated (Figure 6), and this likely contributes to the deafness observed in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> mice at P14 and older (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Labeling of P14 IHC bundles with PB888 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and PB886 (data not shown) revealed that isoform 1 was concentrated at the tips of the shorter second and third row stereocilia.

There is no unique epitope to generate isoform 2 specific antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Instead, we labeled <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> cochleae with an antibody raised against a common epitope present in both isoforms 1 and 2 (PB48, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), reasoning that a pan-specific myosin 15 antibody should recognize only isoform 2 in isoform 1-null hair cells. In IHCs from normal controls at P7 and P14, strong PB48 labeling was detected at the tips of all stereocilia rows (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belyantseva et al., 2003</a>). PB48 still strongly localized to tips of the tallest stereocilia row of littermate <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHCs, however there was a selective loss from the shorter (second and third) stereocilia rows at both P7 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and P14 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Because isoform 1 is absent from <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHC bundles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), we infer that PB48 was detecting isoform 2 on the tallest row. We quantified the intensity of PB48 signal on the shorter, second row IHC stereocilia relative to the tallest row. In IHCs from normal controls at P7, the intensity of PB48 labeling on the second row was 54 \u00b1 22% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the first row signal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHCs this values was significantly reduced to 9.7 \u00b1 5.9% of the tallest row intensity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This indicates that the majority of myosin 15 in the second row is isoform 1 and that isoform 2 is the minor species at this location. These observations, taken together with PB888 data, support the conclusion that myosin 15 isoforms are sorted into different stereocilia rows as early as P7 in IHCs."

Whole cell MET current responses of young postnatal IHCs and OHCs (P3-4 + 3\u20135 days in vitro) were evoked by graded stereocilia deflections using a rigid probe (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>).

Furthermore, the third stereocilia row was almost completely resorbed by P32 in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> hair cells. Remarkably, this degeneration was specific to the shorter rows that harbor active MET channels (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beurg et al., 2009</a>), and it did not affect the tallest rows, at least up until P50. The same degenerative phenotype was observed in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/sh2-J</i></sup> compound heterozygotes, which produce normal isoform 2 from the <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N</i></sup> allele and a mutant isoform 1 lacking the tail domain from the <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2-J</i></sup> allele (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data indicate that a single genetic copy of isoform 2 is sufficient for the production of a normal hair bundle (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and show that isoform 1 must be full-length to maintain shorter row stereocilia."

In the second row of <i>Myo15<sup>\u0394N/\u0394N</sup></i> IHCs at P8, the shape of the normally prolate tips were frequently exaggerated and over-elongated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), compared to <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> IHCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We observed these over-elongated tips in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHCs at P8, but not at P4 (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting this abnormality was not a developmental defect, but rather the abnormal maintenance of stereocilia in isoform 1-deficient hair cells. The over-elongated tips of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHCs were filled with actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), indicating that actin polymerization was dysregulated at this location. The tips of stereocilia actin filaments are normally capped in an electron dense material that likely contains components of the actin polymerization machinery (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tilney et al., 1983</a>). In agreement with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rzadzinska et al., 2004</a>), we confirmed that the tip density was absent from the tips of young postnatal <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> stereocilia (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013I</a>), supporting the role of this structure in stereocilia elongation and actin polymerization. In contrast to <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> stereocilia, a prominent tip density was detected at the tips of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> stereocilia at P7<i>,</i> similar to littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). These data are consistent with isoform 2 being necessary to form the tip density complex and drive stereocilia elongation. Whilst isoform 1 is not required for initial tip density formation, its incorporation into the postnatal structure appears to regulate actin dynamics, specifically on the shorter stereocilia rows that have active MET channels."

At P8, the distribution of diameters in the second stereocilia row of <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> IHCs was comparable to controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), although there was a small, statistically significant reduction in the average diameter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). By P11, the average diameter of second row stereocilia in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u0394N/\u0394N</i></sup> hair cells was significantly reduced from 256 \u00b1 2 nm (mean \u00b1 SEM) to 189 \u00b1 4 nm and included a distinct population of \u2018super-thin\u2019 stereocilia with diameters of less than 150 nm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>).

The involvement of myosin 15 isoform 2 in stereocilia development was previously established (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belyantseva et al., 2005</a>), however our finding that isoform 1 is required to maintain mature stereocilia was unexpected. These contrasting functions for myosin 15 are underlined by their different expression profiles during development. Furthermore, the isoforms have distinct spatial localizations within the hair bundle. A growing number of proteins exhibit asymmetrical distributions within different stereocilia rows of the hair bundle (<a href=\"#bib39\">Peng et al., 2011</a>), yet how these gradients are formed remains unclear. Our study shows that myosin 15 isoforms can selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows and establish the distribution of other proteins (e.g., whirlin and Eps8) critical for stereocilia development."

Because isoform 2 has no unique sequence when compared with isoform 1, the unique N-terminal extension of isoform 1 must be responsible for regulating its ultimate destination within the hair bundle. Several targeting mechanisms are conceivable. Under a selective retention model, both isoforms would uniformly enter all stereocilia, but be captured at the tips of the tallest or shorter rows by isoform-specific interactions. Alternatively, a selective entry model would specifically restrict isoforms from entering at the base of each stereocilium. A physical \u2018gate keeper\u2019 structure restricts cytosolic access to primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dishinger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hu et al., 2010</a>), but an equivalent apparatus has yet to be identified in stereocilia or actin-rich protrusions like microvilli. Rather than being restricted by a physical barrier, the two myosin 15 isoforms may exhibit different motility on stereocilia actin filaments. The <i>shaker 2</i> (p.C1779Y) mutation within the actin-binding motor domain prevents both isoforms from accumulating in stereocilia, and indicates that the interaction with actin is likely critical in the trafficking process. Actin-binding proteins can direct myosin motility within cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brawley and Rock, 2009</a>) by enhancing, or inhibiting the acto-myosin binding interface to create permissive or restrictive actin tracks. Although row-specific variations in actin topology have not yet been identified (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tilney et al., 1983</a>), stereocilia and rootlets contain a plethora of actin-binding proteins that may provide guidance cues to spatially regulate the activity of myosin 15 isoforms (<a href=\"#bib18\">Drummond et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28a\">Kitajiri et al., 2010</a>). The recent purification of myosin 15 will allow its motility to be tested on different types of cross-linked actin filaments, and to examine how the N-terminal extension might modulate this activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bird et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hartman et al., 2011</a>)."

The sole dependence upon isoform 2 is intriguing since both myosin 15 isoforms share identical Eps8 and whirlin binding sites in the tail domain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Belyantseva et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Manor et al., 2011</a>). The molecular basis for this selectivity is unknown, although a distinct possibility is that the N-terminal extension may interact with the tail domain of myosin 15 to regulate binding to cargo proteins. This type of intra-molecular regulation is common in other myosin classes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sellers and Knight, 2007</a>). We postulate that selective binding of cargo protein to isoform 1, or 2, forms the basis of a targeted protein trafficking system within mechanosensory hair bundles. Binding partners of the N-terminal extension are now of great interest, since isoform 1 may be responsible for trafficking proteins to the vicinity of the MET machinery on the shorter stereocilia rows."

In one model, isoform 2 is required for elongation but does not set the absolute length (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belyantseva et al., 2003</a>). This model is supported by the fact that exogenous expression of isoform 2 does not cause additional elongation of developing stereocilia in vitro (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belyantseva et al., 2003</a>). An alternate model posits that the quantity of myosin 15 at each stereocilia tip determines its length, and that graded increases on each row specify the overall staircase architecture (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rzadzinska et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Manor and Kachar, 2008</a>).

There is growing experimental evidence that myosin 15 regulates the actin cytoskeleton in developing stereocilia: (i) <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> hair cells have short stereocilia where the actin core fails to elongate (<a href=\"#bib43\">Probst et al., 1998</a>); (ii) exogenous expression of isoform 2 in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>sh2/sh2</i></sup> hair cells rescues elongation of the stereocilia core, which entails actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belyantseva et al., 2005</a>); (iii) expression of isoform 2 in COS-7 cells induces filopodia formation, again entailing actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belyantseva et al., 2003</a>); (iv) our present study shows that the loss of isoform 1 results in progressive disassembly of mature mechanotransducing stereocilia. Considering the exceptional stability of the stereocilia actin core (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Drummond et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Narayanan et al., 2015</a>), this implies changes to how the actin cytoskeleton is regulated at the stereocilia tips of isoform 1-null hair cells. Actin filaments at the stereocilia tip are embedded within an electron-dense plaque, which is proposed to cap the filament barbed ends and regulate polymerization (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tilney et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DeRosier and Tilney, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rzadzinska et al., 2004</a>).

However, once stereocilia are assembled, the postnatal incorporation of isoform 1 into the tip density, along with its cargoes, may repurpose the actin polymerization machinery from driving elongation towards the fine-tuning of local actin dynamics; which are normally restricted to the tips of mature stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Drummond et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Narayanan et al., 2015</a>). Accordingly, we note that the onset of stereocilia abnormalities in the second row (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and changes to the staircase architecture (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) occur around the same time as the appearance of isoform 1 within normal hair bundles (i.e. by P7)."

This is consistent with the tallest stereocilia rows not degenerating in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u2206N/\u2206N</i></sup> hair cells, since MET currents are not detected on the tallest rows (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beurg et al., 2009</a>). A role for mechano-transduction has been further evidenced in hair cells of mutant <i>Ush1g</i><sup><i>flox/flox</i></sup> mice, which lose tip-links and MET currents prior to degeneration of the shorter row stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caberlotto et al., 2011</a>). However, the loss of MET currents can occur alone without any apparent effects on stereocilia morphology (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kawashima et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the absence of MET currents was unlikely the cause of stereocilia disassembly in <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u2206N/\u2206N</i></sup> hair cells, since we found grossly normal transduction in these cells. We argue that membrane tension is instead a critical factor controlling actin polymerization at the tips of mature mechanosensitive stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib16\">Diz-Munoz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barr-Gillespie, 2015</a>) and that isoform 1 may contribute to a tension-sensing mechanism.

                        "text": "How might isoform 1 regulate the stereocilia actin cytoskeleton in response to tension? One possibility is that isoform 1 traffics components of a tension-sensing mechanism directly to the MET machinery. The 133-kDa N-terminal extension, unique to isoform 1, contains dense clusters of poly-proline helices (data not shown) that are ligands for SH3, WW and Enabled/VASP homology (EVH1) domains commonly found in actin-regulatory proteins. The N-terminal extension may thus interact with a broad range of proteins capable of directly orchestrating cytoskeletal dynamics. The unusual physical properties of the N-terminal extension raise another distinct possibility. The N-terminal extension is predicted as intrinsically disordered due to its high-proline content (16.8%) and low sequence complexity (<a href=\"http://dis.embl.de\">http://dis.embl.de</a>; data not shown). Intrinsically disordered domains can explore multiple structural conformations (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dunker et al., 2002</a>), and in some cases act as entropic spring elements, such as the PEVK domains within the giant muscle protein, titin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Linke et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Watanabe et al., 2002</a>). We found that hair bundle deflection sensitivity was increased in isoform 1-null <i>Myo15</i><sup><i>\u2206N/\u2206N</i></sup> IHCs, consistent with the alteration of a spring element within the MET machinery. In a further parallel with the N-terminal extension, the reversible unfolding of titin's PEVK domains during muscle extension is proposed to expose buried SH3 ligands and enable force-dependent biochemical signaling (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2006</a>). If the N-terminus were similarly mechano-sensitive, this may result in tension-dependent interactions with SH3, WW and EVH1 domains, and retention of isoform 1 at sites of mechanical stress, e.g. in the vicinity of the lower tip-link insertion point on stereocilia. A mechano-sensitive N-terminal extension may also explain the localization of isoform 1 to the tallest rows of OHC stereocilia, since the tips likely experience tension from their attachment to the tectorial membrane during sound-induced deflections. Understanding the properties of isoform 1 and the N-terminal extension are now key to deciphering how the actin cytoskeleton is regulated in adult stereocilia, and to ultimately understand how these mechanosensory organelles are continually maintained throughout life."

Series resistance was compensated (up to 80%, lag 7\u201310 \u00b5s). After compensation, the time constant of the recording system was in the range of 35\u201370 \u00b5s. Hair cells were held at \u221260 mV except for short periods of MET recordings, when the holding potential was temporarily changed to \u221290 mV. All recorded hair cells were approximately at the middle turn of the cochlea."

The protruding part of the probe was 2\u20133 mm long, which prevented lateral resonances. The probe was moved by a fast piezo actuator (PA 8/14 SG, Piezosystem Jena, Hopedale, MA), custom-modified for a faster response with a time constant of 26\u201328 \u03bcs. The built-in strain gauge sensor of this actuator provided a direct reading of the probe's axial displacement. The angle between the axis of the probe movement and the bottom surface of a dish was kept at \u223c30\u00b0."

The hair bundle is composed of an array of actin-based stereocilia of increasing height projecting from the top of hair cells. This complex structure is the site of mechanotransduction. Despite the pivotal role of the hair bundle in sound detection, we still have a very limited understanding of how it is put together during development and maintained throughout life. Myosin 15 has been shown to be required for the initial elongation of stereocilia. Hair cells express two isoforms of myosin 15 through alternative spicing (isoform 1 and 2), but the function of isoform 1 is still unknown. Isoform1 transcript includes the exon 2, which causes deafness in human when mutated. The authors have generated a knockout mouse to ablate isoform 1 but leaving the other isoform intact. They have found a time-dependent expression of both isoforms with 2 being mainly expressed at very early stages of development (hair bundle elongation period) and 1 during later stages (maintenance period). Moreover, the two isoforms appear to selectively traffic to different stereocilia rows, with the isoform 1 being a crucial element for the morphological maintenance of adult hair bundles and their function. The authors concluded that myosin 15 can be differentially recruited at different stereocilia and play a crucial role in initial growth and maintenance of the mechano-sensory transducer apparatus. This is an excellent manuscript tackling an important research question. It is also well presented and the numerous experiments are well executed."
