Here, we show that nucleophosmin (NPM1) integrates within the nucleolus via a multi-modal mechanism involving multivalent interactions with proteins containing arginine-rich linear motifs (R-motifs) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Importantly, these R-motifs are found in canonical nucleolar localization signals. Based on a novel combination of biophysical approaches, we propose a model for the molecular organization within liquid-like droplets formed by the N-terminal domain of NPM1 and R-motif peptides, thus providing insights into the structural organization of the nucleolus. We identify multivalency of acidic tracts and folded nucleic acid binding domains, mediated by N-terminal domain oligomerization, as structural features required for phase separation of NPM1 with other nucleolar components in vitro and for localization within mammalian nucleoli. We propose that one mechanism of nucleolar localization involves phase separation of proteins within the nucleolus."

Here, we show that nucleophosmin (NPM1) integrates within the nucleolus via a multi-modal mechanism involving multivalent interactions with proteins containing arginine-rich linear motifs (R-motifs) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Importantly, these R-motifs are found in canonical nucleolar localization signals. Based on a novel combination of biophysical approaches, we propose a model for the molecular organization within liquid-like droplets formed by the N-terminal domain of NPM1 and R-motif peptides, thus providing insights into the structural organization of the nucleolus. We identify multivalency of acidic tracts and folded nucleic acid binding domains, mediated by N-terminal domain oligomerization, as structural features required for phase separation of NPM1 with other nucleolar components in vitro and for localization within mammalian nucleoli. We propose that one mechanism of nucleolar localization involves phase separation of proteins within the nucleolus."

Recent work suggests that the nucleolus is formed through a process referred to as \u201cphase separation\u201d in which the liquid in a particular region of the cell has different physical properties to the liquid surrounding it. This is like how oil and water form separate layers when mixed."

Now, Mitrea et al. investigate how nucleophosmin binds to R-motif proteins and whether this is important for assembling the nucleolus. A search for R-motifs in a list of over a hundred proteins known to bind to nucleophosmin showed that the majority of these proteins contained multiple R-motifs. Furthermore, when high levels of nucleophosmin and the R-motif proteins were present, they underwent phase separation."

The experiments show that many molecules of nucleophosmin bind to each other and that multiple regions in nucleophosmin are able to interact with the R-motifs. Together, these interactions produce large assemblies of proteins that result in the creation of separate liquid layers. Furthermore, the experiments show that R-motif proteins and other molecules needed to make ribosomes can be brought together within the same liquid phase by nucleophosmin. Mitrea et al.\u2019s findings provide the first insights into the role of nucleophosmin in the molecular organisation of the nucleolus. The next challenge is to understand how this organisation promotes the production of ribosomes and helps the cell to respond to stressful situations."

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are transcribed between the FC and DFC, and rRNAs are processed while migrating into the GC, wherein they assemble with ribosomal proteins to form pre-ribosomal particles (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boisvert et al., 2007</a>). Nucleophosmin (NPM1, also known as B23), a highly abundant marker of the GC, functions as a nucleolar chaperone and plays a role in cellular stress responses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colombo et al., 2011</a>).

However, NPM1 is known to influence ribosome biogenesis, genome stability and tumor suppression (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lindstrom, 2011</a>) and to participate in responses to cellular stresses, including DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 2005</a>), chemotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chan, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yao et al., 2010b</a>), and oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib54\">Paron et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, NPM1 depletion is associated with disruption of nucleolar structure (<a href=\"#bib30\">Holmberg Olausson et al., 2014</a>). We propose that NPM1 participates in the organization of the liquid-like structure of the GC and consequently may actively participate in stress signal integration and transmission, thereby explaining its known roles in ribosome biogenesis, tumor suppression and other processes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lindstrom, 2011</a>). Accordingly, NPM1 interacts with a vast array of partners (<a href=\"http://thebiogrid.org/110929/summary/homo-sapiens/npm1.html\">http://thebiogrid.org/110929/summary/homo-sapiens/npm1.html</a>), many involved in ribosome biogenesis, and controls the nucleolar localization of ribosomal (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lindstrom, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rosorius et al., 2000</a>), viral (<a href=\"#bib17\">Duan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fankhauser et al., 1991</a>), and certain tumor suppressor proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bertwistle et al., 2004</a>), many of which engage the N-terminal oligomerization domain (OD) of NPM1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) via arginine-rich short linear motifs (R-motifs) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mitrea et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, NPM1 binds nucleic acids (e.g., rRNA and DNA) through its C-terminal domain (nucleic acid binding domain, NBD) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 1994</a>). We seek to understand the molecular mechanisms of NPM1\u2019s multifarious functional interactions. Here, we show that NPM1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in the presence of two classes of nucleolar macromolecules: proteins and RNA. Using a multidisciplinary strategy, we identify the structural features that mediate NPM1 phase separation and its nucleoar localization. These results provide a novel perspective on the mechanisms involved in the formation of the liquid-like structure of the nucleolus and in the nucleolar localization of biological macromolecules."

                                "text": "R-motifs bind to a region of NPM1 which includes the OD and a short disordered region (residues 1\u2013130; termed N130; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). The interactions engage two highly conserved acidic tracts, termed A1 (residues 34\u201339) and A2 (residues 120\u2013130), at the interface between monomer subunits and within the disordered region (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mitrea et al., 2014</a>), respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). These A tracts and the pentameric nature create multivalency within N130. Multivalent interactions involving low complexity sequences cause assembly and phase separation of biopolymers within membrane-less organelles (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fromm et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2012</a>); therefore, we tested the ability of multivalent N130 and peptides containing multiple R-motifs derived from NPM1-binding proteins to undergo phase separation. Titration of four R-motif-containing peptides (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) caused phase separation into liquid-like droplets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media4\">4</a>) at critical concentrations that varied with R-motif composition and affinity for N130 (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At 200 \u00b5M N130, upon titration of the divalent rpL5 peptide, phase separation was observed when the rpL5:N130 ratio reached ~3:1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). At the same N130 concentration, phase separation was not observed upon titration of a monovalent R-motif peptide (rpL5-RA; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), even though it bound, albeit with lower affinity (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), confirming that R-motif multivalency is required for phase separation with N130. The inability to phase separate was not due to reduced binding affinity (rather than loss of multivalency); a poly-R peptide, containing a single but longer R-motif, with affinity similar to that of rpL5, also failed to phase separate (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, phase separation was not observed when an NPM1 construct containing only the OD (N122, residues 1\u2013122; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) was titrated with the rpL5 peptide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). We thus conclude that the minimal multivalency requirements for phase separation are the acidic A1 and A2 tracts within NPM1 and at least two complementarily charged R-motifs within a polypeptide binding partner."

Fluorescence anisotropy (FA) of a N130<sup>S125C</sup> mutant, labeled with Alexa Fluor594 within A2, increased in a biphasic manner upon titration of rpL5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Results from small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments showed that monodisperse, soluble complexes formed at the first FA transition, which occurred at ~1:1 rpL5:N130 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, inset; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a\u2013c</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>).

To gain insight into conformational changes associated with phase separation, we performed single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer ( smFRET) experiments with a mutant of N130, N130<sup>Q15C/S125C</sup>, that could be dually labeled with Alexa Fluor594 &amp; 680 at sites within the pentamer core (Q15C) and the A2 acidic tract (S125C), respectively. The FRET efficiency (E<sub>FRET</sub>) for this dye pair within the droplet phase (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.15) was dramatically reduced in comparison with that observed in the absence of rpL5 (E<sub>FRET</sub> ~0.85; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), consistent with the\u00a0extension of the A2 tract from the N130 pentamer core due to interactions with rpL5 molecules upon phase separation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). In contrast to the monodisperse character of the SANS curves for samples of rpL5 and N130 at 0:1 and 1:1 (rpL5:N130) stoichiometry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>), the curve for the 1:3 sample indicated periodic structural organization within the liquid-like droplets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, red curve). We interpreted these features in terms of inter-molecular correlation distances (55\u2009\u00c5, 77\u2009\u00c5, and 119\u2009\u00c5; see Analysis methods) due to organization of N130 and rpL5 induced by phase separation. Notably, nascent, higher order structural organization was evident in the SANS curve for a solution of rpL5 and N130 with 2:1 stoichiometry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, green curve). Assembly of rpL5 and N130 into higher order, soluble intermediates at and above the 2:1 stoichiometric ratio was also demonstrated using sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The appearance of high molecular weight species within the detection range (&lt;1 MDa) was accompanied by a progressive decrease in the total mass detected, likely due to sedimentation of rpL5:N130 droplets in the sample cell during the dead-time of the experiment. Above the phase separation threshold (&gt;3:1 rpL5:N130), resonances for residues within the N130 core broadened beyond detection in 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY spectra but not those for residues within the A2 tract (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>).

As rpL5 is titrated into N130 up to 2:1 stoichiometry (rpL5:N130), the R1 motifs, comprised of four Arg residues each, bind to acidic residues within the A1 binding groove and disordered A2 tract of N130, with the R2 motif available for interactions. Upon further titration of rpL5, at the critical phase separation concentration, when the higher affinity sites reach a critical saturation threshold, R2 motifs within rpL5 molecules already bound to N130 pentamers transiently engage A tracts of other pentamers, possibly within the longer and disordered A2 tract, establishing inter-N130 pentamer cross-links. Together, our data support the hypothesis that the molecular basis of phase separation is the formation of non-covalent, inter-N130 pentamer interactions via the two R-motifs within the same rpL5 peptide molecule. We propose that these rpL5-mediated interactions establish the inter-pentamer spacing within the droplet phase that was detected by SANS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). In order to validate this model, we synthesized a variant rpL5 peptide in which the eight residue-long linker connecting the two R-motifs (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) was duplicated. The phase separated sample formed between the peptide with the longer linker (rpL5-2xLinker) exhibited altered inter-molecular spacing, as indicated by altered correlation distances derived from the SANS curve (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These shifted to positions corresponding to larger correlation distances, in agreement with the hypothesis that the R-motif peptides establish inter-N130 pentamer spacing in the liquid-like phase. We envision that such cross-links are dynamically formed and broken but that, once phase separation occurs, they dominate the structural organization detected by SANS."

Full length NPM1 also exhibits a central intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that, in addition to the A2 tract, contains a longer acidic tract termed A3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). We tested and confirmed the ability of full length NPM1 (N294) to phase separate with either wheat germ rRNA or rpL5 using light scattering (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a &amp; b</a>, respectively) and fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>, Rows 1 &amp; 2, respectively). Binary mixtures of N294 with either rpL5 or rRNA formed droplets that increased in size over time (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>); those with rpL5 fused more rapidly and were larger in size than those with rRNA. Furthermore, droplets of NPM1 with rpL5 formed at ~5-fold lower concentrations of both components (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>) than were required for phase separation with N130 and rpL5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) due to the higher valency of acidic tracts within the full-length protein.

We cannot explain the physical basis for the different dynamics of liquid-like droplets formed by N294 with either rRNA or rpL5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>, Rows 1 and 2, respectively) or the morphology of the punctate structures formed by rRNA and rpL5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>, Rows 3) due to the lack of data on the interaction between NBD of NPM1 or rpL5, and rRNA (<i>i.e.,</i> binding affinities, number and location of binding sites, etc.). The size difference between the two types of droplets with N294 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>, Rows 1 and 2) may, however, arise from differences in binding affinity between rRNA and NBD <i>versus</i> rpL5 and A tracts within OD/IDR."

In the absence of NPM1, rRNA and rpL5, representing these two classes, phase separated into small puncta (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c,d</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Given this result, we next asked whether addition of NPM1 constructs to these puncta would cause reorganization and co-localization of the constituent macromolecules within larger, liquid-like droplets. In order to differentiate between the effects of interactions between the OD/A tracts and rpL5 (mode 1) and OD/NBD and rRNA mode (mode 2) on phase separation, we first formed rRNA/rpL5 puncta at two concentrations of rpL5 and then added the NPM1 constructs and monitored phase separation using confocal-microscopy. At the high rpL5 concentration (rpL5, 200 \u03bcM; NPM1 constructs, 30 \u03bcM; termed the 'excess' condition), rpL5 and NPM1 could independently phase separate. However, at the low concentration (rpL5, 50 \u03bcM; NPM1 constructs, 30 \u03bcM; termed the 'limiting' condition), rpL5 and NPM1 could not independently phase separate. The addition of N294 to pre-formed, rpL5/rRNA puncta caused spontaneous formation of large droplets under conditions of both limiting and excess rpL5, whose sizes increased with increasing N294 concentration (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). In contrast, addition of the N240 deletion construct, lacking the NBD, caused phase separation under conditions of excess rpL5, but not with a limiting amount of rpL5 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Finally, addition of the \u0394N construct, lacking the OD and therefore displaying dramatically reduced multivalency, failed to cause phase separation under both excess and limiting rpL5 conditions (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Together, these results support a mechanism wherein the high valency associated with the NPM1 OD, together with the multiple acidic tracts and NBD, are required for the dissolution of rpL5/rRNA puncta and co-localization of these molecules within large liquid-like droplets that readily grow in size. We thus propose that, through multi-modal interactions with two major classes of nucleolar macromolecules, NPM1 localizes to the nucleolus and also mediates the co-localization of other protein-binding partners and rRNA within the GC of the nucleolus."

The parental DKO cell line was created by replacing exons 2\u20137 of <i>Npm1</i> with <i>eGFP</i>, and therefore constitutively expresses the fluorescent protein (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grisendi et al., 2005</a>). The stable DKO MEF cell lines were created through infection with retroviruses carrying the Thy1.1 cell surface marker in frame with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and an mCherry-NPM1 variant gene. The two genes are translated from the same bicistronic mRNA transcript at similar levels (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gurtu et al., 1996</a>). Therefore, the Thy1.1 cell surface marker is an unbiased reporter of mCherry-NPM1 variant expression. mCherry is primarily localized to the cytoplasm and is stable in cells (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shaner et al., 2004</a>); therefore, with the constructs under study here, any alteration of its localization and stability can be attributed to its NPM1 variant fusion partner. In agreement with the <i>in vitro</i>\u00a0and <i>ex cellulo</i> results, full length mCherry-NPM1 accumulated in nucleoli and co-localized with the nucleolar markers NOPP140 (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12d</a>) and fibrillarin (<a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Despite the fact that all cell lines expressed comparable levels of the Thy1.1 marker (<a href=\"#fig12s2\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and all NPM1 constructs encode the native bi-partite nuclear localization signal (residues 152\u2013157 and 191\u2013197 [<a href=\"#bib28\">Hingorani et al., 2000</a>]), mCherry fluorescence was undetected in the mCherry-N240 cell lines, while the mCherry-\u0394N cell lines exhibited diffuse mCherry fluorescence throughout the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12d</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Notably, Enomoto, <i>et al.,</i> previously showed that NPM1 mutants which lacked the ability to accumulate within nucleoli exhibited dramatically reduced half lives in cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Enomoto et al., 2006</a>), a potential explanation for the undetectable levels of mCherry-N240 in our study. We note that our observations through use of DKO cell lines contrast with those of others (<a href=\"#bib18\">Enomoto et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Negi and Olson, 2006</a>) wherein NPM1 constructs lacking the C-terminal domain accumulated within nucleoli. These previous studies are confounded by the possiblility for the formation of heteromeric oligomers comprised of endogenous wild-type and mutant NPM1 proteins. Collectively, these data suggest that nucleolar localization of NPM1 is achieved only when interactions with both R-motif-containing nucleolar proteins and rRNA are possible. Deletion of either the NBD or OD abrogated the ability of NPM1 to simultaneously interact with an R-motif-containing peptide and rRNA within droplets <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>), suggesting that co-localization of NPM1 with the two types of nucleolar components in dense liquid-like droplets and localization within nucleoli arise through similar mechanisms involving multi-modal, multivalent interactions that promote phase separation."

In contrast to the nuclear localization process, for example, which relies on nuclear transport receptors that recognize their cargo via a specific short linear motif (<a href=\"#bib13\">Christie et al., 2015</a>) and transport them across the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex, there are no known molecular transporters that mediate localization of proteins to the nucleolous. It has been hypothesized that enrichment of proteins within the nucleolus occurs though selective retention within the nucleolar matrix. Short basic sequences, termed nucleolar localization signals (NoLS), often rich in R and lysine (K) residues, have been identified experimentally to be necessary and, in some cases, sufficient for localization of certain proteins within the nucleolus (<a href=\"#bib58\">Scott et al., 2010</a>). However, the molecular basis for how these canonical signals cause nucleolar localization is presently unknown. Here, we identified multivalent, low complexity R-motifs within proteins that are associated with binding to the abundant nucleolar protein, NPM1. Furthermore, we showed that these multivalent R-motifs underwent phase separation with NPM1 to form dense, liquid-like droplets, and became co-localized within these types of droplets that also contained rRNA. Strikingly, the multivalent R-motifs that we identified to mediate interactions with NPM1 have features in common with the canonical NoLSs: they are enriched in basic amino acids and are often located within disordered and solvent accessible regions of proteins (<a href=\"#bib58\">Scott et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This observation, however, raises several questions. Do the links between canonical NoLSs and nucleolar localization, and multivalent R-motifs and NPM1 binding, have a common mechanistic basis? And, does nucleolar localization rely on the ability of proteins to experience phase separation within a multi-component, liquid-like phase? To address these questions, we compared our list of NPM1 interacting proteins that contained multivalent R-motifs with the database of all predicted NoLSs within the human proteome ([<a href=\"#bib58\">Scott et al., 2010</a>]; <a href=\"http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-nod/downloads/AllPredictedHumanNoLSs.txt\">http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-nod/downloads/AllPredictedHumanNoLSs.txt</a>). Interestingly, 83 (63%) of the proteins from our curated list of NPM1 interactors corresponded to those with predicted NoLSs. Of these 83, 69 (83%) contained 2 or more R-motifs, and there was extensive overlap between the sequence locations of the multivalent R-motifs that we identified and those of the predicted NoLSs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Based on these observations, we propose that canonical NoLSs, which closely match our definition of multivalent R-motifs, enable proteins that are freely diffusing through the nuclear compartment to phase separate within the nucleolar matrix, thereby mediating their nucleolar localization."

                        "text": "Furthermore, while the NoLSs described by Scott, <i>et al.,</i> account for the nucleolar localization of hundreds of proteins, more than 4,500 proteins are known to reside within the nucleolus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmad et al., 2009</a>), highlighting the need to identify additional localization mechanisms. Interestingly, along these lines, NPM1, although well established to be highly enriched in the nucleolus, does not exhibit a canonical NoLS. Rather, here we describe a multi-modal interaction model that enables the multifunctional protein NPM1 to interact with R-motif-containing proteins and rRNA, representative of two major classes of macromolecules resident of the nucleolus. In support of this, we found that disruption of its multi-modal interactions, through abrogation of NBD oligomerization by the\u00a0deletion of the OD or removal of the NBD, hindered NPM1\u2019s ability to phase separate <i>in vitro</i> and to accumulate in nucleoli within mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig12\">12</a>). Consistent with our model, a previously described putative NoLS involves two buried Trp residues which are essential for proper folding of the NBD (<a href=\"#bib25\">Grummitt et al., 2008</a>). Mutations of these residues destabilized the NBD, thereby impeding interactions with nucleic acids and nucleolar localization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banuelos et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chiarella et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Falini et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Grummitt et al., 2008</a>). Thus, we propose that multi-modal binding by NPM1 may play an important role in the structural organization of the nucleolus and the recruitment of proteins to the nucleolus."

We propose that the intermolecular spacing indicated by SANS is dictated, at least in part, by the length of the linker connecting the two R-motifs in the divalent rpL5 peptide. Another factor in the spatial organization within these droplets is the 5-fold symmetry of the A1 binding grooves within the N130 pentamer that bind R-motifs within the rpL5 peptide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and [<a href=\"#bib50\">Mitrea et al., 2014</a>]). We suggest that the SANS data indicate the 'persistence length' of local structural order that, despite constant formation and dissociation of R-motif peptide-mediated cross-links, is sufficient to provide 'structure' to the liquid-like droplets. However, for several reasons, this is likely a highly simplified view of NPM1 structural organization within the GC of the nucleolus. First, NPM1\u2019s binding partners display diverse patterns of multivalent R-motifs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), providing many ways of forming cross-links with NPM1. Second, in comparison with N130, full length NPM1 exhibits the A3 acidic tract within the IDR, enabling additional interactions with R-motifs within proteins, and the NBD, that can bind to rRNA. Therefore, due to these factors, NPM1\u2019s structural organization within the nucleolus is likely highly heterogeneous, in contrast to the orderly organization of N130 within droplets with rpL5. This model for the the structurally heterogenous integration of NPM1 within the nucleolar matrix provides a mechanistic explanation for its central role in many nucleolar functions, such as ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar stress responses (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lindstrom, 2011</a>)."

Disrupting either type (1) or (3) interactions abrogated accumulation of NPM1 within nucleoli (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>), demonstrating the relevance of our <i>in vitro</i> findings to the physiological setting. Complete loss of NPM1 from nucleoli (e.g., in the <i>Trp53</i><sup>-/-</sup>/<i>Npm1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells) did not, however, preclude other nucleolar proteins (NOPP140 and fibrillarin; <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, respectively) from accumulating within punctate nuclear structures, in support of a model wherein collective interactions between many different nucleolar components drive their assembly into dense liquid-like structures."

Notably, the association of multivalency mediated by homo-oligomerization and acidic low complexity regions with phase separation is, to the best of our knowledge, unique to NPM1. We expect, however, that similar features may be utilized by other proteins for incorporation into the nucleolar matrix. For example, NOPP140, known to be localized within the GC, exhibits 11 acidic, serine-rich clusters ([<a href=\"#bib62\">UniProt, 2014</a>]; <a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q14978\">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q14978</a>). Furthermore, nucleolin, which also lacks a canonical NoLS, exhibits 3 acidic tracts (with lengths between 15 and 29 amino acids), 4 tandem folded RNA recognition motifs in addition to multivalent R-motifs ([<a href=\"#bib62\">UniProt, 2014</a>]; <a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P19338\">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P19338</a>), which may mediate multi-modal binding to protein and rRNA components within the dense liquid-like phase of the nucleolus. While the established NoLS is consistent with our mechanistic model for nucleolar localization, other proteins, which we suggest function by contributing to the structural organization of the nucleolus, such as NPM1, are not encompassed by this definition. We propose that the three fundamental types of interactions noted above mediate the localization of a wide veriety of proteins, along with rRNA, within the liquid-like structure of the nucleolus, providing new perspective on the term 'nucleolar localization signal'."

NMR-based chemical shift titrations of N130 with rpL5 peptide were performed in a step-wise manner in which a stock of highly concentrated peptide was added incrementally to the N130 samples. A total of nine additions were performed over which the dilution of the N130 was small changing the overall volume of the sample by only 2%. rpL5 was titrated into a sample with N130 up to a [rpL5]:[N130] ratio of 3:1 (maximum concentration of rpL5 was 870 \u03bcM). All titration experiments were collected with a Bruker Avance I spectrometer operating at a Larmor frequency of 800 MHz. For apo N130 and with each addition of rpL5 a TROSY type amide proton, nitrogen two-dimensional correlation spectrum was recorded. Spectra were collected with 100 and 1024 complex points in the indirect and direct dimension yielding maximum acquisition times of 12.1 ms and 91.8 ms, respectively. Incremental additions of rpL5 allowed for the extraction of binding isotherms by monitoring the change in the <sup>15</sup>N\u00a0chemical shift (\u25b3\u03c9<sub>15N</sub>) as a function of ligand concentration (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>).

The extension to higher order binding models that represent multiple independent binding sites may be necessary, but the binding isotherms collected here do not display multiple independent binding events and thus only a two-state model was applied (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arai et al., 2012</a>). Error bars for all individual and global fits were determined from Monte-Carlo simulations in which a 10% error in the absolute peptide concentration (effectively shifting points along the abscissa) was considered and 500 random binding isotherms were generated and subsequently refit (<a href=\"#bib49\">Markin and Spyracopoulos, 2012</a>).

Since solution NMR is uniquely suited to probe motions with atomic detail, we exploited a combination of NMR relaxation experiments that report on motions faster than the overall rotational correlation time (\u03c4<sub>c</sub>). Conventional NMR relaxation experiments which probe fast pico- to nanosecond timescale motion can be used to obtain information on internuclear vector flexibility (S<sup>2</sup>) and molecular time constants related to rotational diffusion processes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Palmer, 2004</a>). These experiments, when combined, can be used to extract \u03c4<sub>c</sub>, S<sup>2</sup>, and time constants such as the fast lifetimes of internal motion (\u03c4<sub>f</sub>; picoseconds), and in some cases motion in the low nanosecond range if \u03c4<sub>c</sub> is much greater than this additionally 'slow' nanosecond motion (denoted as \u03c4<sub>s</sub>). However, for high molecular weight proteins like N130 (the molecular weight of the pentamer is 73.4\u2009kDa), the study of backbone <sup>15</sup>N nuclei dynamics is challenging due to slow molecular tumbling. In order to overcome this, we utilized experiments analogous to Lakomek, <i>et al</i>., (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lakomek et al., 2013</a>) that utilize the TRACT (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2006</a>) concept in which the slowly (\u03b2) and fast relaxing (\u03b1) transverse components of the <sup>15</sup>N doublet were individually queried and their rate of decay measured within conventional TROSY-type HSQC experiments in order to obtain the relaxation rates for both components. Measurement of both R<sub>2,\u03b2</sub> and R<sub>2,\u03b1</sub> permits the calculation of the transverse cross-relaxation rate, \u03b7<sub>xy</sub>, which reports on motions up to \u03c4<sub>c</sub> and in addition contains no contribution of slow ms-\u03bcs motional processes due to chemical exchange (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). For the extraction of parameters that define the observed relaxation processes, we also recorded longitudinal relaxation (R<sub>1</sub>) experiments for backbone <sup>15</sup>N nuclei which have small values for large molecular weight proteins to increase the number of observables (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lee and Wand, 1999</a>). The inclusion of R<sub>1</sub> values in our analysis was critical because this relaxation rate samples contributions of high frequency motions for backbone <sup>15</sup>N nuclei that \u03b7<sub>xy</sub> does not (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kroenke et al., 1998</a>). The approach described above was necessary because high quality intrinsic relaxation rate (R<sub>2,0</sub>) and <sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear-NOE data could not be recorded due to signal-to-noise limitations."

We implemented the R<sub>1</sub> experiment with TROSY-readout similar to that in Lakomek, <i>et al.</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lakomek et al., 2012</a>), and performed experiments in which 70 and 512 complex points in the indirect and direct dimension, respectively, were acquired with 120 transients per point (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>,iii). The recycle delay for the R<sub>1</sub> experiments was set to two seconds yielding a total experiment run time of 38\u2009hr. All sampled delay lengths were interleaved in a random order throughout the experiment."

Using these expressions that describe the relaxation rates of each nucleus, residues were initially subjected to a grid search. This initial search consisted of only residues from the folded core of N130 which were identified based on the crystal structure (PDB: 4N8M). This was done to ensure that they would behave as resonances whose expected <sup>1</sup>H<sup>N-15</sup>N NOE would be greater than 0.65 following conventional protocols for establishing residues which can be used to determine \u03c4<sub>c</sub> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kay et al., 1989</a>). The following method is similar to Lakomek, <i>et al.</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lakomek et al., 2013</a>), and Lorieau, <i>et al.</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lorieau et al., 2011</a>). The grid was evaluated from a range of 0.6 to 1.0 in steps of 0.01 for S<sup>2</sup> and 0 to 1 ns in steps of 100 ps for \u03c4<sub>f</sub>. \u03c4<sub>c</sub> was evaluated from 40 to 80 ns in steps of 1 ns. A target function (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>) comprised of the sum of the error weighted squared difference between the experimental and calculated relaxation rates was minimized. All lowest \u03c7<sup>2</sup> values from each residue\u2019s minimization was kept and nuclei with similar \u03c4<sub>c</sub> values and whose \u03c4<sub>f</sub> values were either 0 or 100 ps were grouped together and then globally minimized. This global minimization was not conducted in a grid fashion and the minimized parameters included a single \u03c4<sub>c</sub> and residue specific S<sup>2</sup> and \u03c4<sub>f</sub> parameters. The lower limit in \u03c4<sub>c</sub> was constrained based on the \u03b7<sub>xy</sub> data assuming a rigid rotor spectral density function (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2006</a>) and the error in \u03c4<sub>c</sub> was determined from Monte-Carlo simulations with all calculations performed in Mathematica (Wolfram Research,\u00a0Champaign,\u00a0IL). Rotational anisotropy was not considered under the current analysis; however, the disordered N- and C-termini do fluctuate independently from the folded core based on 1D-TRACT (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2006</a>) data in which two overall correlation times could be extracted (data not shown)."

Local-MF is one in which \u03c4<sub>f</sub> in LS-MF equals zero. The selection of formalisms was based on fit statistics comparing models with different numbers of parameters with an F-test at 95% confidence interval and on whether minimizations using a particular formalism produced unrealistic values (e.g. S<sup>2</sup>\u22651) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 1997</a>).

For residues in the C-terminal A2 tract consisting of Ala123-Glu130, only \u03c4<sub>c,local</sub> and S<sup>2</sup> values were determined (local-MF) (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>).

The Pearson correlation coefficient between \u03b7<sub>xy</sub> calculated and observed for all data across all static magnetic fields used here was 0.97 and 0.94 for the apo N130 and 2.5:1 rpL5:N130, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the R<sub>1</sub> data collected for apo and rpL5-bound N130 was 0.99 for both datasets. All errors were assessed using Monte-Carlo simulations. This procedure was performed for all data on apo N130 and 2.5:1 rpL5:N130. We note that there was a distinct lack of precision in determining \u03c4<sub>f</sub> for residues in which LS-MF was used to analyze the data (<math id=\"inf30\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>212</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>272</mn><mo></mo><mi>p</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><mo></mo><msubsup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>L</mi><mn>5</mn><mo>:</mo><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>272</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>310</mn><mo></mo><mi>p</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></math>). This is expected because high frequency motions contribute to a greater extent to R<sub>1</sub> than to \u03b7<sub>xy</sub> and, with limited R<sub>1</sub> values only measured at a single magnetic field and for resonances whose R<sub>1</sub> is larger than the average, error will cause a decrease in precision when determining \u03c4<sub>f</sub>. We note that the average S<sup>2</sup> for both apo and rpL5-bound forms of N130 are comparable to what is expected for folded proteins(<a href=\"#bib39\">Lakomek et al., 2013</a>) (<math id=\"inf31\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>o</mi><mo></mo><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>0.73</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.06</mn></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf32\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mn>2.5</mn><mo>:</mo><mn>1</mn><mo></mo><mi>r</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>L</mi><mn>5</mn><mo>:</mo><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>0.71</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.10</mn></mrow></math>; average included residues 16\u201332 and 40\u2013118). Of interest are significant changes to dynamic parameters for residues within the N- and C-termini of N130 due to rpL5 peptide binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>,i\u2013iii)."

The extraction of parameters that define C-terminal A2 tract motion was not well fit when the overall \u03c4<sub>c</sub> was fixed, as in the aforementioned analysis. Instead, for the C-terminal A2 tract (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>,ii-iii), changes in motion were monitored using S<sup>2</sup> and the overall local correlation time (\u03c4<sub>c,local</sub>). For the A2 tract, this is consistent with slowed local motion and increased rigidity due to peptide binding (green bars; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>,ii). We note that increased rigidity can be seen beginning from residue Val119. However, we focus on the local-MF analysis for the C-terminal A2 tract (Ala123-Glu130). From <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>,ii, we find that the motion is slowed by a factor two (<math id=\"inf35\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>C</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>o</mi><mo></mo><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>2.10</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.05</mn><mo></mo><mi>n</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf36\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>C</mi><mrow><mn>2.5</mn><mo>:</mo><mn>1</mn><mo></mo><mi>r</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>L</mi><mn>5</mn><mo>:</mo><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>4.56</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.06</mn><mo></mo><mi>n</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></math>) for the C-terminal residues and flexibility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>,iii) is reduced by nearly half (<math id=\"inf37\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>o</mi><mo></mo><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>0.44</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.01</mn></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf38\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mn>2.51</mn><mo></mo><mi>r</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>L</mi><mn>5</mn><mo>:</mo><mi>N</mi><mn>130</mn></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mn>0.76</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.01</mn></mrow></math>). We also note that residues at the beginning of the A2 tract (Val119-Asp122), which were well fit when \u03c4<sub>c</sub> was fixed to the overall tumbling value, also exhibited restricted motion in the 2.5:1 rpL5:N130 state (by about 30%) as compared with apo N130. \u03c4<sub>c,local</sub> for Ser125 in N130 could not be determined because the resonance was overlapped in the apo state."

The authors use a suite of techniques, including fluorescence anisotropy, small angle neutron scattering, NMR spectroscopy, and FRAP to understand the molecular driving forces for assembly of the nucleolus. They find that the oligomerization domain of NPM1 can phase separate in the presence of peptides containing two R-rich motifs commonly found in NPM1 binding partners, including the ribosomal protein rpL5. They also demonstrate that full length NPM1 can phase separate with ribosomal RNA and the R motif-containing rpL5 peptide and uncover distinct roles for the oligomerization and nucleic acid-binding domains of NPM1 in droplet formation and morphology. Using NMR they show that the internal dynamics of NPM1 greatly slow within the phase separated droplets."

Using only DIC imaging to monitor the isolated nucleoli, it is unclear if the nucleoli are dissolving in the droplets or simply being surrounded by them.

The data on the N122 protein make a stronger case (as does a comparison of the various R-motif proteins, where higher valency seems to correlate with a lower phase separation concentration).

It is also not clear from the authors' description in paragraph four, Results, exactly what causes phase separation when the rpL5 concentration reaches the critical value. The authors describe the appearance of interpentamer crosslinks as occurring suddenly when rpL5 reaches some concentration and driving phase separation. But there should always be some such crosslinks. Affinity aside, one might expect that crosslinks would be most favored at low rpL5 stoichiometries. Maybe the key issue is solubility of the various species?"

The bulk (non-nucleolar) fluorescence at each point, or some initial fluorescence? If the former, so that each point represents the fold-increase of nucleolar fluorescence over background (bulk solution) fluorescence, then the data do not show saturation. Rather, in this case a constant fold-increase as the total gN294 rises means that the nucleolar fluorescence rises linearly. For a saturating system, the ratio of nucleolar/bulk fluorescence should decrease above the saturation point as the denominator grows and the numerator remains constant. If the y-axis is relative to some initial fluorescence value, the system does show saturation, but it is not clear what that initial point is."

To validate our in vitro findings, which show that both the ability to oligomerize and to bind nucleic acids is required for NPM1 to phase separate with ribosomal RNA and a multivalent R-motif-containing peptide, we created cell lines that stably express mCherry-NPM1 constructs that parallel those used in the in vitro studies. We show by fluorescence microscopy that only the full length protein can accumulate within mammalian nucleoli and co-localize with known nucleolar markers (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The major conceptual advance is that the protein sequence features (multivalent R-motifs) we have identified as being required for binding to and phase separation with NPM1 correspond to features identified by others as being nucleolar localization signals (NoLSs). We gained this insight by using bioinformatics tools to compare our list of NPM1 binding proteins with another from others of NoLSs in all human nucleolar proteins; we present this analysis in the Discussion of the revised manuscript. Thus, we propose that the molecular mechanism of protein phase separation with NPM1 that we describe is, in essence, the mechanism through which hundreds of proteins are localized within the nucleolus."

Thus, the NMR behaviors reflect a complex average of the two states of the system, which will depend on the relative amounts of the two states (which is not provided) and their properties. While the qualitative features of the droplet state are likely correct (dynamics are slowed), this mixing calls into question the quantitative aspects of the analysis. The authors need to address this issue in their analyses and presentation of the work. The fact that the relaxation data for the N- and C-termini could be fit globally does not in itself indicate that these elements undergo collective motions, as is stated in the text. If one assumes collective motion, then the global fitting can give greater precision in the derived values. But the interpretation does not go in the other direction in the absence of knowing what the errors should be if the motions were not collective. Phrased differently, what would the authors have observed in their analyses if the motions had been uncoupled but were fit as collective? Would the fitting have produced qualitatively different results? Or would the errors in the fitted parameters have simply been larger?
