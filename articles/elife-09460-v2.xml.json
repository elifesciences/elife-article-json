Unfortunately, many people are living in an environment where their circadian system is challenged by inappropriate meal- or work-times. Here we scheduled food access to the sleep time and examined the impact on learning and memory in mice. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that the molecular clock in the master pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is unaltered while the molecular clock in the hippocampus is synchronized by the timing of food availability. This chronic circadian misalignment causes reduced hippocampal long term potentiation and total CREB expression. Importantly this mis-timed feeding resulted in dramatic deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Our findings suggest that the timing of meals have far-reaching effects on hippocampal physiology and learned behaviour."

Unfortunately, many people are living in an environment where their circadian system is challenged by inappropriate meal- or work-times. Here we scheduled food access to the sleep time and examined the impact on learning and memory in mice. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that the molecular clock in the master pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is unaltered while the molecular clock in the hippocampus is synchronized by the timing of food availability. This chronic circadian misalignment causes reduced hippocampal long term potentiation and total CREB expression. Importantly this mis-timed feeding resulted in dramatic deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Our findings suggest that the timing of meals have far-reaching effects on hippocampal physiology and learned behaviour."

This network regulates cognitive processes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Holloway and Wansley, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chaudhury and Colwell, 2002</a>), and the neural circuits involved in learning and memory also exhibit circadian rhythms in gene expression and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fropf et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lamont et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lyons, 2006</a>).

At this point, timing of food intake is well-established to have a major impact on the phase of the molecular oscillations in peripheral organs such as the liver and pancreas (<a href=\"#bib10\">Damiola, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Stokkan, 2001</a>). Mis-timed meals during the sleep phase accelerates weight gain compared with animals fed during their wake phase (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arble et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bray et al., 2013</a>), whereas wake-phase feeding has a protective effect against the cardiac and metabolic dysfunction caused by high fat diets (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hatori et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gill et al., 2015</a>). Similar disruptive effects are seen in humans, where misaligned mealtimes produce cardiac and metabolic deficits, leading to a pre-diabetic state (<a href=\"#bib37\">Scheer et al., 2009</a>). We thus became interested in the possibility that these ill consequences of eating at inappropriate phases of the daily cycle may also be maladaptive for cognitive function. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of chronic but stable misalignment of the circadian network by scheduling access to food at an inappropriate phase of the daily cycle. We demonstrate that this simple manipulation has far-reaching consequences for learning and memory."

Mice adapted to the feeding protocol within 6 days (p = 0.9, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and there were no significant differences in body weight between the two groups at the time of testing (p = 0.5, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Daytime activity was increased in mice subjected to misaligned feeding (p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), and the strength of daily rhythms of activity was reduced by misaligned feeding (p = 0.003; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Similarly, the temporal pattern of sleep was altered by misaligned feeding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Immobility-defined video monitoring of sleep behaviour of misaligned mice showed decreased time spent asleep during the day (p &lt; 0.001) and a corresponding increase in sleep during the night (p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Misaligned mice no longer exhibit a day vs night difference in sleep, sleeping equally during the day and night (p = 0.5). Crucially, the total time spent asleep over a 24\u2009hr day was not reduced by misaligned feeding (p = 0.2). The change in temporal pattern of sleep quantity is also reflected in sleep fragmentation, where misaligned mice exhibit a greater number of sleep bouts (p &lt; 0.05) with a corresponding decrease in average sleep bout duration (p &lt; 0.001) during the day compared to aligned mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This increased day-time sleep fragmentation is compensated by fewer (p &lt; 0.05) and longer (p &lt; 0.001) night sleep bouts in the misaligned animals, resulting in no significant change in the total number (p = 0.9) and average duration (p = 0.6) of sleep bouts over a 24\u2009hr period."

Due to these schedules, we eat around the clock with well-established literature of metabolic consequences (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mattson et al., 2014</a>). In this study, we sought to determine if temporally restricted feeding schedules in mice could impact cognition. We found that time-restricted feeding led\u00a0to\u00a0dramatic impairments in\u00a0learned behaviours such as hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition. Not all behavioural tests were similarly affected, as amygdala-dependent cued-fear conditioning was not altered by the misalignment. This implies that some learned behaviours are more vulnerable to the impact of misaligned feeding. Crucially, the total amount of sleep was not altered by the scheduled feeding and the mice did not lose weight as might be expected if their caloric intake was restricted. Hence, by simply adjusting the time of food access, we demonstrated that we can alter the cognitive performance of mice. We do not know yet if this equally applies to humans but shift work has been associated with decreased performance on cognitive tests (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wright et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Marquie et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>)."

The misaligned feeding treatment did not result in an overall decrease in amount of sleep, but instead had a severe impact on the temporal pattern, suggesting that this treatment acts via disruption of the circadian timing of sleep. While sleep quality as assessed by polysomnography was not measured\u00a0in this study, we were able to examine the degree of sleep fragmentation as determined by the number and duration of individual sleep bouts. Misaligned feeding again has a greater impact on the temporal pattern of sleep fragmentation, where the misaligned mice appear to \u201ccatch up\u201d on consolidated sleep during what should be their active phase."

This finding is consistent with earlier literature suggesting the phasing of the molecular clock in the corticolimbic system and hippocampus are strongly influenced by the time of food availability (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amir, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">\u00c1ngeles-Castellanos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wakamatsu et al., 2001</a>). We have thus created a situation in which the molecular clocks within the nervous system are running at different phases, <i>i.e.</i> internal desynchronisation of the circadian system. A consequence of this misalignment is altered synaptic plasticity within the hippocampal circuit (Schaffer Collaterals/CA1) as revealed by the reduction in LTP. This is the first demonstration that the time of eating can impact the physiological underpinning of learned behaviour. Importantly, our manipulation of feeding caused a significant decline in CREB in the hippocampus, which has been demonstrated to be critical for memory allocation in mice (e.g. <a href=\"#bib36\">Sano et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). The levels of tCREB were reduced at all phases that we sampled (ZT 2, 8, 14 and 20), and although we did not carry out cognitive tests at each of these phases, this finding indicates that memory would be impaired throughout the daily cycle. The reduction in tCREB provides a biochemical explanation for our finding, as well as providing a guidepost for future analysis of the effects of the misaligned feeding in the hippocampus. Therefore, this work raises the possibility that the timing of when we eat alters the physiological and biochemical events underlying learning and memory."

Mice were habituated to the testing arena (60 \u00d7 48 \u00d7 30 cm) in 10\u2009min trials on 2 consecutive days. During familiarization trials, two identical objects were placed equidistant from each other and the walls of the arena, and mice were allowed to explore the arena for 10\u2009min on 2 consecutive days. Mice that failed to travel 20\u2009m or interact with objects for more than 20 sec in the second familiarization trial were eliminated from further analysis. On the day of testing for NOR, one familiar object was replaced with a novel object with a different shape and made of a different material (plastic or glass). The testing trial was 5\u2009min in duration. Arenas and objects were wiped between animals with 10% Windex and dried using paper towels. Video feeds of each arena from an overhead CCTV camera supplemented with infrared lighting were fed to the ANY-maze software. The arena and object maps were defined in ANY-maze, and allowed for automated tracking of the animal\u2019s area, with the ability to distinguish between the head and tail. Entry of the animal\u2019s head to the defined object\u2019s area was scored for time interacting with the object. An experimenter watched the recorded videos and overlaid tracking in real-time to verify that tracking of the animal\u2019s area and head/tail orientation was consistent and that scoring of object interaction was accurate. Performance on the NOR test is indicated by a discrimination index calculated of time spent with the novel object (T<sub>novel</sub>) divided by the sum of time spent with both objects (T<sub>novel</sub>+T<sub>familiar</sub>). One animal from the misaligned group (out of 8) tested during the day failed to sufficiently explore both objects (&lt; 10 sec during the second familiarization trial) and was eliminated from further analysis.

The main findings indicate that feeding during the inactive phase of the circadian cycle leads to ~14 h phase alteration in hippocampal clock gene rhythms whereas SCN phase is unaltered. These changes were associated with deficits in hippocampal LTP, total hippocampal CREB expression, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory."

This not only controls for time of food presentation but also more accurately mimics the human condition. However, under laboratory conditions, mice eat throughout the day with food consumption peaking during their active phase. The possibility might be considered that restricting feeding to the active phase enhances LTP, learning and memory, etc. above that normally seen in mice either by surveying the literature or adding a group of ad lib fed animals as a point of comparison."

The CREB data suggest this is not the case, but the point might be considered in the manuscript."

The possibility should be considered that the pattern/quality of sleep might contribute to the deficits observed, particularly as EEG data are unavailable and it's unknown whether sleep quality was markedly impacted. Given the importance of sleep for memory consolidation, this point is of particular importance."
