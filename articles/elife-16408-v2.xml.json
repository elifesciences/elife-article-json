Here we show that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> eIF4A and Ded1p directly interact with each other and simultaneously with the scaffolding protein eIF4G. We delineate a comprehensive thermodynamic framework for the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA and ATP, which indicates that eIF4A, with and without eIF4G, acts as a modulator for activity and substrate preferences of Ded1p, which is the RNA remodeling unit in all complexes. Our results reveal and characterize an unexpected interdependence between the two RNA helicases and eIF4G, and suggest that Ded1p is an integral part of eIF4F, the complex comprising eIF4G, eIF4A, and eIF4E."

Here we show that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> eIF4A and Ded1p directly interact with each other and simultaneously with the scaffolding protein eIF4G. We delineate a comprehensive thermodynamic framework for the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA and ATP, which indicates that eIF4A, with and without eIF4G, acts as a modulator for activity and substrate preferences of Ded1p, which is the RNA remodeling unit in all complexes. Our results reveal and characterize an unexpected interdependence between the two RNA helicases and eIF4G, and suggest that Ded1p is an integral part of eIF4F, the complex comprising eIF4G, eIF4A, and eIF4E."

The complex containing eIF4G, eIF4E and eIF4A is called eIF4F (<a href=\"#bib27\">Merrick, 2015</a>). eIF4A binds to a MIF4G domain of eIF4G (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sch\u00fctz et al., 2008</a>), and this interaction stimulates RNA- and ATP-binding, and ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity of eIF4A in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Hilbert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rajagopal et al., 2012</a>).

Ded1p uses its C-terminus to bind to the C terminus of eIF4G, a region distinct from the eIF4A binding site in eIF4G (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hilliker et al., 2011</a>). The interaction with eIF4G interferes with Ded1p oligomerization and thus inhibits RNA unwinding by the helicase (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>). In translation initiation, Ded1p and DDX3X have been implicated in the\u00a0mRNA recognition by eIF4F, recruitment of the 40S ribosome subunit to the mRNA, the scanning process, start codon selection and joining of the two ribosomal subunits (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sharma and Jankowsky, 2014</a>).

While these data suggest a possible link between the two helicases, Ded1p and eIF4A have been generally viewed as separately functioning factors. Despite the central biological roles of the two enzymes, their level of conservation, and their implication in numerous diseases, it is unknown whether and how eIF4A and Ded1p are linked biochemically and physically, and if their functions are coordinated. The answer to these questions is of considerable importance for understanding eukaryotic translation initiation on the molecular level. However, experimentally addressing the link between the two enzymes presents significant challenges. First, as RNA helicases, eIF4A and Ded1p share basic biochemical properties including RNA binding, unwinding, ATP binding and ATP turnover. Therefore, enzymatic readouts are similar and potentially difficult deconvolute. Second, both helicases interact with eIF4G, which also binds RNA. The multitude of possible individual interactions significantly complicates the analyses of coupling between the proteins. Third, interactions between the proteins are likely transient or dynamic, given that both, Ded1p and eIF4A bind and hydrolyze ATP, which in turn modulates RNA binding by the helicases (<a href=\"#bib25\">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</a>). Functional analysis of dynamic multi-component assemblies is not well developed, even though such RNA-protein complexes are numerous in biology."

Using quantitative biochemical and enzymological approaches, we show that Ded1p and eIF4A directly interact with each other and that both helicases simultaneously interact with eIF4G. We devise an unbiased, comprehensive thermodynamic framework for the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA and ATP. This framework indicates that eIF4A, with and without eIF4G, acts as\u00a0a modulator for activity and substrate preferences of Ded1p, and that Ded1p functions as the RNA remodeling unit in complexes with eIF4A. Our observations reveal an unexpected interdependence between both RNA helicases and eIF4G, and suggest that Ded1p is an integral part of the eIF4F complex."

It was thus important to determine whether Ded1p could directly interact with eIF4A, and to probe whether both proteins could interact simultaneously with eIF4G. Reactions were performed with RNases to exclude possible RNA bridging of the three RNA binding proteins. EIF4A bound directly to Ded1p (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lanes 2). This observation indicates a direct interaction between the two DEAD-box helicases that does not depend on RNA or another factor. EIF4A increased the amount of eIF4G bound to immobilized Ded1p (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, compare lanes 1 and 3). As expected, Ded1p bound to immobilized eIF4G (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, compare lanes 5 and 7). Ded1p increased the amount of bound eIF4A to eIF4G (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, compare lanes 6 and 7). Together, the data reveal a direct interaction between Ded1p and eIF4A and promotion of Ded1p-eIF4G binding by eIF4A. The observations show that interactions between Ded1p, eIF4G, and eIF4A are not mutually exclusive and suggest that all three proteins can interact simultaneously."

We first included hippuristanol in the unwinding reactions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, hippuristanol decreased unwinding activity for eIF4A alone and in combination with eIF4G, but did not significantly impact unwinding of Ded1p alone or in combination with eIF4G (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, hippuristanol decreased unwinding for Ded1p in the presence of eIF4A, with and without eIF4G, essentially to the level seen with Ded1p alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The data suggest that Ded1p is the unwinding module in the complexes with eIF4A, but that functional integrity of eIF4A is important for its impact on Ded1p. This observation provides a rationale for the exacerbating effect of hippuristanol on the growth defect of the <i>ded1-95</i> mutant strain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To further probe the role of eIF4A in complexes with Ded1p, we tested the impact of a mutation of the ATP binding site of eIF4A (eIF4A<sup>E171A</sup>), which abolishes RNA unwinding, as well as ATP binding and hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iost et al., 1999</a>).

The slight stimulation of Ded1p<sup>117-604</sup> by eIF4G, as opposed to the inhibition seen with wtDed1p, likely reflects an increase in RNA affinity of Ded1p<sup>117-604</sup> by eIF4G. This increase in affinity is also seen with wtDed1p, but does not result in a stimulation of the wild type protein under identical reaction conditions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>). Most notably, eIF4A no longer stimulated Ded1p<sup>117-604</sup>, and addition of eIF4G did not increase the activity further (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). No direct interaction between Ded1p<sup>117-604</sup> and eIF4A was detected in pull down experiments (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Together, the data show that the N-terminus of Ded1p is important for the interaction between eIF4A and Ded1p, with and without eIF4G, and further support the notion that eIF4A and Ded1p do not simply act additively."

We therefore examined the impact of eIF4A on oligomerization of Ded1p using chemical protein-protein crosslinking (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Without eIF4A, trimer formation of Ded1p was seen (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>). With eIF4A, no Ded1p trimer was observed, and a prominent new species emerged with a molecular weight consistent with a predominant one to one Ded1p-eIF4A complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). The Ded1p dimer species seen in the sample with eIF4A represents remaining Ded1p. The data thus indicate that eIF4A interferes with Ded1p oligomerization, even though the C-terminus of Ded1p is not critical for the complex formation with eIF4A."

To understand biochemical characteristics of these complexes, their interdependencies, and the roles of ATP and RNA, we set out to establish a mechanistic framework describing the thermodynamic stability of these complexes, their RNA and ATP affinities, and their unwinding activities. To our knowledge, no comparable framework exists for any dynamic complex with multiple RNA binding proteins. To devise an instructive quantitative model, it was important to measure the interactions under conditions where ATP binding and turnover as well as RNA binding and remodeling occurred simultaneously. These conditions are best met in unwinding reactions. We therefore performed a large set of unwinding reactions where we systematically varied concentrations of Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, and ATP. Representative data show, among other trends, scaling of the Ded1p stimulation with ATP and Ded1p concentrations, and biphasic response curves with increasing concentrations of eIF4G (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4s4\">4</a>).

Model building, data fitting strategy and assessment of model quality are described the Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section, in <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 5</a>,<a href=\"#fig4s6\">6</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary files 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD3-data\">3</a>. The model considers all 28 distinct complexes formed between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA and ATP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), plus complexes formed by Ded1p during oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>). 108 individual interactions were modeled and more than 3000 individual data points were used in the global datafit.

The model faithfully recapitulates measured unwinding rate constants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) as well as previously reported ATP affinities for eIF4A and the eIF4A-eIF4G complex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rajagopal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mitchell et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

The stability of the Ded1p-eIF4A complex, although lower than for the Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complex, also increases with ATP, RNA, or both (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>).

To independently verify the calculated high stability of the Ded1p-eIF4G-eIF4A complex, we used microscale thermophoresis (MST) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Seidel et al., 2013</a>) to directly measure binding of Ded1p to a pre-formed eIF4G-eIF4A complex in the absence of RNA and ATP. We measured an apparent dissociation constant of <i>K</i><sub>1/2</sub> &lt; 7 nM (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), the experimentally accessible lower limit of affinity with the available MST setup. This value is consistent with the corresponding affinity calculated with our model (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2F</a>). Given the high thermodynamic stability of the Ded1p-eIF4G-eIF4A complex, we suggest to consider Ded1p, like eIF4A, as integral functional part of eIF4F. We note that high thermodynamic stability does not equal persistence of the complex. In fact, the complex between the three proteins is unlikely to be long-lived, given that both eIF4A and Ded1p constantly turn over ATP."

Ded1p is stimulated by eIF4A at lower Ded1p concentrations because the complexes with eIF4A bind as single units with hyperbolic binding isotherms, whereas Ded1p oligomerizes cooperatively, which results in a sigmoidal isotherm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Accordingly, stimulation of Ded1p by eIF4A, with or without eIF4G, decreases at higher Ded1p concentration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The similar unwinding rate constants at ATP and protein saturation for the Ded1p trimer, the Ded1p-eIF4A and the Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complexes are consistent with the notion that a Ded1p protomer acts as the unwinding unit in the complexes with eIF4A.

To this end, we obtained functional affinities for the various protein complexes for a substrate with 10 nt 3' overhang (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These parameters were calculated from sets of unwinding reactions with the 10 nt tailed substrate with varying concentrations of Ded1p, eIF4A, and eIF4G, analogous to the process described for the substrate with the 25 nt overhang (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We then compared the functional affinities for the 10 and the 25 nt tailed substrates for each protein complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). For Ded1p alone, affinity increased for a 25 nt vs. a 10 nt tail (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, lower panel), consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yang et al., 2007a</a>). Addition of eIF4A, eIF4G, or both, increased the relative affinity of the complexes for 25 nt vs. 10 nt tails (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Yet, at low Ded1p concentrations, eIF4A and eIF4G stimulated Ded1p unwinding stronger for a substrate with a 10 nt tail (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), compared to a substrate with a 25 nt tail (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The stronger stimulation for substrates with shorter tails arises from the hyperbolic shape of the functional binding isotherm of the Ded1p-eIF4G-eIF4A complex, compared to the sigmoidal isotherm for the Ded1p trimer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These data show that activity stimulation can scale with the concentration of components, without a marked change in affinity."

Since duplex length impacts only the unwinding rate constant, but not the substrate affinity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>), we calculated unwinding rate constants at ATP and enzyme saturation for duplexes of different length using our thermodynamic model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), and data collected from substrates with 13, 16, and 19 basepairs and identical 3', 25 nt overhangs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The shortest duplex was unwound fastest by the eIF4A-Ded1p complex, and slowest by the eIF4A-eIF4G-Ded1p complex. For the longest duplex, this order was reversed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The scaling of the unwinding rate constants with duplex length correlates with the process of strand separation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>). The data thus indicate that both eIF4A and eIF4G directly affect the strand separation step by the Ded1p protomer. EIF4A most likely increases the time by which partially opened duplex stands are kept apart, while decreasing the number of basepairs opened per strand separation event. In contrast, eIF4G and eIF4A together appear to decrease the time by which partially opened duplex stands are kept apart, while increasing the number of basepairs opened per strand separation event. For substrates containing a 5' tail, no comparable scaling of the stimulation with the duplex length was seen, although the stimulation was somewhat higher for the longer duplex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Collectively, our data show that substrate architecture influences the degree by which unwinding activity of Ded1p is impacted by eIF4A and eIF4G, alone and in combination. Our observations further reveal that eIF4A and eIF4G directly influence the strand separation step of Ded1p (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), and that substrate affinity of each protein complex scales with the length of the unpaired tail (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>)."

Most importantly, Ded1p is the primary RNA remodeling unit in all complexes where it is present. Compared to previously described complexes between eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4B, the complexes with Ded1p display orders of magnitude more potent RNA remodeling activity than complexes that only contain eIF4A. This observation raises the possibility that remodeling of stable RNA structures in cellular 5'UTRs, which is often attributed to eIF4A, might in fact be carried out by complexes that contain Ded1p."

For Ded1p, the changes in the complex ratio have only little impact on helicase activity, since complexes with Ded1p have similar unwinding activities and RNA affinities, although this depends somewhat on the duplex length (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>). Increasing eIF4G concentrations dramatically decreases the fraction of eIF4G that is associated with Ded1p and thus with potent remodeling activity. These observations suggest that Ded1p, in addition to eIF4A, might be important for the function of eIF4G. The data provide a possible rationale for the roughly equal cellular concentration of eIF4G and Ded1p (<a href=\"#bib12\">Firczuk et al., 2013</a>)."

For this reason, we suggest to consider Ded1p, like eIF4A, as integral part of eIF4F. Our data highlight a previously unknown role of eIF4A as a\u00a0co-factor for Ded1p. This function is consistent with recently discovered overlapping roles of Ded1p and eIF4A in translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sen et al., 2015</a>), and with the partial complementation of <i>ded1</i> mutations by overexpression of eIF4A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Since the cellular eIF4A concentration exceeds the Ded1p concentration by a factor of approximately five, our findings do not exclude roles of eIF4A in translation initiation that are independent of Ded1p."

Most notably, Ded1p utilizes distinct regions to bind to eIF4A and eIF4G. If eIF4A is present, the Ded1p N-terminus is most critical for binding, whereas the Ded1p C-terminus is critical for binding to eIF4G alone. eIF4G and eIF4A allosterically affect the unwinding activity of the Ded1p protomer. In energetic terms, these effects are smaller than the allosteric impact of co-factors on RNA helicases seen in other multi-component complexes, such as the TRAMP complex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jia et al., 2011</a>). However, Ded1p allosterically impacts eIF4A, eIF4G, or both, as reflected in the marked increase in RNA affinity for the two proteins. This increase in the RNA affinity most likely indicates a function of the proteins as RNA binding adaptors for the Ded1p protomer that separates the strands. Unwinding activity and RNA affinity in the Ded1p-eIF4A, and Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complexes depends on the substrate architecture to a moderate degree, but substrate preferences of Ded1p are not drastically altered by eIF4A or by eIF4A-eIF4G."

In addition, complexes containing Ded1p are more sensitive to ATP depletion and inhibition by AMP than complexes containing only eIF4A, because Ded1p has a\u00a0weaker ATP affinity than eIF4A (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rajagopal et al., 2012</a>). Complexes with Ded1p might therefore be more sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell than complexes with only eIF4A (<a href=\"#bib32\">Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013</a>). A\u00a0broad regulatory potential is thus likely to be associated with the interaction between Ded1p to eIF4A. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Ded1p N-terminus that binds to eIF4A, harbors a multitude of proven and potential sites for post-translational modifications (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sharma and Jankowsky, 2014</a>). Modification of these sites could affect the interaction with eIF4A."

Because multiple sub-complexes are often simultaneously present, both in vitro and in the cell, observed effects depend on the concentration of individual proteins, relative to each other and in absolute molar terms, and on ATP and RNA concentrations. For these reasons, frameworks such as the one developed in this study are required to adequately describe biochemical features of individual complexes, and to define the interactions between all factors, especially if the complexes are not long lived. The\u00a0approaches outlined in this work could therefore be useful for the quantitative analysis of other dynamic complexes that contain multiple RNA-binding proteins."

The thermodynamic framework to describe the interactions between Ded1p, eIF4A, eIF4G, RNA, and ATP was built on the previously established kinetic framework for duplex unwinding by the Ded1p oligomer (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>). eIF4A and eIF4G only interact with a Ded1p monomer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The resulting framework contains 108 binding reactions, listed in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. The model was constrained by considering energy conservation. That is, the change in free energy for transition of one complex into another is independent of the reaction pathway. In addition, we incorporated the experimentally determined RNA affinity of eIF4G (<a href=\"#bib31\">Putnam et al., 2015</a>). We further considered that the comparably weak RNA independent ATPase activity of Ded1p was not affected by eIF4G and eIF4A to a measurable degree (data not shown). This notion allowed us to use the Ded1p affinity for ATP in the absence of RNA for multiple Ded1p complexes. Collectively, these considerations enabled us to describe the entire framework in 16 groups of thermodynamically linked binding steps (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>)."

In the presence of eIF4G, ATP binding by eIF4A was required for the impact on Ded1p (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We therefore considered the Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G complex with ATP bound to both helicases as active unwinding complex.

For each complex at least one dataset was included for a titration of each component (e.g., Ded1-eIF4G: 1 Ded1p titration, 1 eIF4G titration, 1 ATP titration).Datasets were as follows: Ded1p-eIF4A (4 datasets), Ded1p-eIF4G (3 datasets), eIF4A-eIF4G (4 data sets), and Ded1p-eIF4A-eIF4G (9 datasets). Multiple iterations were performed until the best fit to all data sets was achieved. Data were fit assuming that all binding steps for Ded1p with eIF4A, and eIF4G were in rapid equilibrium. Parameters for the best fit values are reported in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. Variables not well constrained by the data are reported as limits. Errors are not always symmetrically distributed around the best fit value (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Uncertainty in each parameter is presented as a range calculated at the 95% confidence interval. To visually assess the quality of fit, experimental data were plotted versus values predicted with the model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

They do an extensive set of unwinding assays with Ded1 and these other two proteins over a range of different protein, RNA, and ATP concentrations, allowing them to model a thermodynamic framework that generates functional affinity constants (<i>K<sub>1/2</sub> </i>values) for forming all of the different potential combinations of these 3 proteins with and without RNA and ATP. Based on these affinity constants and known information about cellular concentrations, they argue that the trimeric complex of Ded1/eIF4A/eIF4G is the predominant form in cells. This would change the way we think about Ded1 as functioning independently of eIF4F (4E/4G/4A) on a subset of mRNAs with highly structured 5'UTRs towards the view that it generally functions as a subunit within eIF4F and that its activity is modulated by eIF4F components. They also have evidence that eIF4A and eIF4G activities are likewise modulated by Ded1. In addition, they examine the effects of eIF4A and eIF4G on unwinding by Ded1 for substrates with 3' versus 5' overhangs, finding the greater stimulation for the former. And they measure unwinding activities for substrates of different duplex lengths from which they deduce different effects of eIF4A alone or together with eIF4G on unwinding by the trimeric complex."

The data analysis is carried out by global modeling of a huge dataset using KinTek Explorer. The datasets are comprehensive and more than sufficient to make the modeling. In addition, key statements are tested directly by alternative methods which further strengthen the conclusions. This type of analysis is extremely challenging and innovative. The results provide a new insight into the function of helicases in eukaryotic translation and demonstrate the importance of the protein networks in shaping their functional activity. I have only one uncertainty concerning the statistical evaluation of data. In my opinion, correlations between the observed and calculated constants are only the first step in the assessment of the data fit and alone it is insufficient to judge the quality of the fit. Another key piece of fitting is the error analysis for the lower and upper bounds of the calculated values. This is not documented sufficiently. It would be important to provide the information about the \u03c3 value, Ch2 Threshold and provide a supplemental figure with the symmetry distributions (see of KinTek manual)."

Nevertheless, while the in vitro data are convincing for the complexes studied, one does wonder if the in vitro reconstituted complex truly reflects what occurs in vivo and whether eIF4A unwinding activity is increased by an untested accessory factor (e.g. eIF4B in the presence of Dedp1). One possible set of experiments to test this would be to determine unwinding rates in yeast cytoplasmic extracts that have eIF4A and Ded1p mutants."

This raises a rather important point, which is that there now appears to be a rather significant difference between yeast and human eIF4A unwinding potential using purified components in vitro. Is it that the human eIF4G and eIF4B provide the necessary regulation of eIF4A activity, which the yeast homologs just can't accomplish (they are certainly quite different at the sequence level)? Or, is yeast eIF4A naturally a poor unwinding enzyme even in the presence of eIF4G and eIF4B and therefore requires Ded1p? The authors write the introduction as if the two systems can be viewed as the same mechanism, but this is increasingly becoming less likely. As it stands, the authors should rewrite their introduction to raise this fact. While I appreciate stating the link between eIF4A and disease (cancer), the function of yeast eIF4A may have nothing to do with how the human system is regulated."

The explanation that this complex may not be long lived in the presence of ATP and RNA does not explain why these proteins are not retained on the pull-down in the absence of ATP and RNA.

In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, the increases in Ded1 and eIF4A interaction with eIF4G when all three components are present are quite modest, perhaps ~3-fold or less, whereas the thermodynamic modeling later in the paper predicts a 3-order of magnitude increase in affinity for the heterotrimeric complex compared to all 3 dimeric complexes. The authors suggest later in the paper that the Ded1 interaction with eIF4G/eIF4A will have a high off-rate owing to ATP hydrolysis; however, the affinities predicted by the thermodynamic model for the heterotrimeric complex are subnanomolar even in the absence of ATP and RNA-the conditions of the pull-down experiments. One wonders whether the on-rate would have to exceed the diffusion limit to account for the pull-down data on the hetertrimeric complex. Later on, in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, they measure the affinity of Ded1 for a pre-formed eIF4G-eIF4A complex in vitro with microscale thermophoresis as &lt;7nM (the limit of the instrument). This is consistent with the high affinity deduced from the thermodynamic model; however, it would be superior to employ Surface Plasmon Resonance to confirm that the heterotrimeric complex has a high off-rate, albeit much slower than the on-rate, in the manner required to unify their pull-down data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C-D</a> (and later in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A) with the other measurements of the Kd for the heterotrimeric complex.

Presumably, they want to propose that eIF4A is allosterically stimulating Ded1 activity, and ATP binding to eIF4A enhances this effect without being required for it. But don't these results also argue that Ded1 is not the sole unwinding activity in the complex and that eIF4A also makes an important contribution to it, with Ded1 enhancing eIF4A activity?

Using quantitative biochemical approaches the authors show that Ded1 and eIF4A interact with one another and simultaneously interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G. Utilizing a framework of binding and unwinding reactions with different protein combinations, they characterize thermodynamic stability of all three possible binary complexes as well as the ternary complex (eIF4A-eIF4G-Ded1p), and find that the ternary complex is the most stable species. They find that while all complexes are competent for unwinding, the ternary complex exhibits the highest unwinding activity. Importantly, the authors show that within the ternary complex, Ded1 is responsible for the bulk of ATP-dependent RNA unwinding/remodeling activity, while eIF4A and eIF4G are solely stimulatory. The authors suggest that Ded1 is an integral and dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. In addition, they identify the N-terminus of Ded1p as the region responsible for its interaction with eIF4A. Combined with their previous finding that the C-terminus of Ded1 makes interaction with eIF4G, this allows the authors to hypothesize about the overall structural organization of the ternary complex."

It presents compelling evidence that Ded1p may be regarded as a dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. The latter is an important and potentially paradigm-shifting finding for the field of translation regulation as well as our understanding of the early events in translation initiation. The conventional view of translation initiation suggests that eIF4F is comprised of well-defined and stably associated components, and the same eIF4F complex acts on all mRNAs. The new evidence presented here shows that dynamic association of Ded1p with eIF4A and eIF4G can result in an array of complexes with variable properties, which paints a much more dynamic picture of early initiation events. Jankowsky and coworkers also show that, depending on their structure (i.e., 3'-tailed vs 5'-tailed duplex), RNA substrates bind different complexes with different affinities. This suggests that populations of mRNAs with different 5' UTR structures can be differentially expressed depending on the profile of prevalent eIF4F complexes. Importantly, they show that even relatively small changes in expression levels (~2-fold) of Ded1 or eIF4G can lead to drastic changes in the abundance of the binary and ternary complexes, and consequently to large effects on translation initiation efficiency."

For our measurements, the complex resulting in eIF4A binding to eIF4G-eIF4E only shows an impact if it further interacts with Ded1p and thereby affects Ded1p's unwinding activity. It is possible that eIF4A can bind to eIF4G-eIF4E to form a complex that does not interact with Ded1p, and that this complex forms with higher affinity than seen in our data. If the binding and dissociation dynamics of this complex are fast compared to the timescale of our experiments, our model would be insensitive to such a complex. As with all models for reaction systems that contain multiple components, our framework contains only the minimally required stages to describe the observed data.

Pull-down assays that include Ded1p had to be particularly stringently washed, to remove Ded1p that non-specifically adhered to the beads. We speculate that the high level of non-specific adherence is seen because Ded1p contains on both N- and C-termini regions of low complexity that are also very basic. In addition, surface immobilization of a component does affect binding behavior, by (a) affecting the degrees of freedom of the system, and (b) creating a microenvironment that might be unfavorable to binding. Given the considerations above, it is perhaps not surprising that the amount of complex retained on beads does not closely correspond to the apparent dissociation constants measured in solution. It is well established that pull-down experiments often reflect solution affinities poorly, especially for dynamic systems.

Based on these affinity constants and known information about cellular concentrations, they argue that the trimeric complex of Ded1/eIF4A/eIF4G is the predominant form in cells. This would change the way we think about Ded1 as functioning independently of eIF4F (4E/4G/4A) on a subset of mRNAs with highly structured 5'UTRs towards the view that it generally functions as a subunit within eIF4F and that its activity is modulated by eIF4F components. They also have evidence that eIF4A and eIF4G activities are likewise modulated by Ded1. In addition, they examine the effects of eIF4A and eIF4G on unwinding by Ded1 for substrates with 3' versus 5' overhangs, finding the greater stimulation for the former.

The authors suggest later in the paper that the Ded1 interaction with eIF4G/eIF4A will have a high off-rate owing to ATP hydrolysis; however, the affinities predicted by the thermodynamic model for the heterotrimeric complex are subnanomolar even in the absence of ATP and RNA-the conditions of the pull-down experiments. One wonders whether the on-rate would have to exceed the diffusion limit to account for the pull-down data on the hetertrimeric complex. Later on, in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, they measure the affinity of Ded1 for a pre-formed eIF4G-eIF4A complex in vitro with microscale thermophoresis as &lt;7nM (the limit of the instrument). This is consistent with the high affinity deduced from the thermodynamic model; however, it would be superior to employ Surface Plasmon Resonance to confirm that the heterotrimeric complex has a high off-rate, albeit much slower than the on-rate, in the manner required to unify their pull-down data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C-D</a> (and later in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A) with the other measurements of the Kd for the heterotrimeric complex. The important discrepancy between the different approaches used to establish the stability of the key heterotrimeric complex needs to be resolved.</i> "

As loading adaptor, eIF4A would bind the unapaired tail of the RNA substrate, and this binding is most likely influenced by the ability of eIF4A to bind ATP, RNA, or both. EIF4A would thus be sensitive to compounds that interfer with either or both of these activities. Yet, the unit responsible for the strand separation is still solely Ded1p.

Using quantitative biochemical approaches the authors show that Ded1 and eIF4A interact with one another and simultaneously interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G. Utilizing a framework of binding and unwinding reactions with different protein combinations, they characterize thermodynamic stability of all three possible binary complexes as well as the ternary complex (eIF4A-eIF4G-Ded1p), and find that the ternary complex is the most stable species. They find that while all complexes are competent for unwinding, the ternary complex exhibits the highest unwinding activity. Importantly, the authors show that within the ternary complex, Ded1 is responsible for the bulk of ATP-dependent RNA unwinding/remodeling activity, while eIF4A and eIF4G are solely stimulatory. The authors suggest that Ded1 is an integral and dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. In addition, they identify the N-terminus of Ded1p as the region responsible for its interaction with eIF4A. Combined with their previous finding that the C-terminus of Ded1 makes interaction with eIF4G, this allows the authors to hypothesize about the overall structural organization of the ternary complex.</i> "

It presents compelling evidence that Ded1p may be regarded as a dynamically associating component of eIF4F complex. The latter is an important and potentially paradigm-shifting finding for the field of translation regulation as well as our understanding of the early events in translation initiation. The conventional view of translation initiation suggests that eIF4F is comprised of well-defined and stably associated components, and the same eIF4F complex acts on all mRNAs. The new evidence presented here shows that dynamic association of Ded1p with eIF4A and eIF4G can result in an array of complexes with variable properties, which paints a much more dynamic picture of early initiation events. Jankowsky and coworkers also show that, depending on their structure (i.e., 3'-tailed vs 5'-tailed duplex), RNA substrates bind different complexes with different affinities. This suggests that populations of mRNAs with different 5' UTR structures can be differentially expressed depending on the profile of prevalent eIF4F complexes. Importantly, they show that even relatively small changes in expression levels (~2-fold) of Ded1 or eIF4G can lead to drastic changes in the abundance of the binary and ternary complexes, and consequently to large effects on translation initiation efficiency.</i> "
