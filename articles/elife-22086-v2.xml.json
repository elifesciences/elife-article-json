The complete 90S is a gigantic complex with a molecular mass of approximately five megadaltons. Here, we report the nearly complete architecture of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> 90S determined from three cryo-electron microscopy single particle reconstructions at 4.5 to 8.7 angstrom resolution. The majority of the density maps were modeled and assigned to specific RNA and protein components. The nascent ribosome is assembled into isolated native-like substructures that are stabilized by abundant assembly factors. The 5' external transcribed spacer and U3 snoRNA nucleate a large subcomplex that scaffolds the nascent ribosome. U3 binds four sites of pre-rRNA, including a novel site on helix 27 but not the 3' side of the central pseudoknot, and crucially organizes the 90S structure. The 90S model provides significant insight into the principle of small subunit assembly and the function of assembly factors."

The complete 90S is a gigantic complex with a molecular mass of approximately five megadaltons. Here, we report the nearly complete architecture of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> 90S determined from three cryo-electron microscopy single particle reconstructions at 4.5 to 8.7 angstrom resolution. The majority of the density maps were modeled and assigned to specific RNA and protein components. The nascent ribosome is assembled into isolated native-like substructures that are stabilized by abundant assembly factors. The 5' external transcribed spacer and U3 snoRNA nucleate a large subcomplex that scaffolds the nascent ribosome. U3 binds four sites of pre-rRNA, including a novel site on helix 27 but not the 3' side of the central pseudoknot, and crucially organizes the 90S structure. The 90S model provides significant insight into the principle of small subunit assembly and the function of assembly factors."

Numerous assembly factors (AFs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) associate with the two subunits to assist their maturation.

The pre-rRNA also encodes four spacer sequences that need to be removed during processing. The 5' region of pre-rRNA that consists of the 5' external transcribed spacer (5' ETS), 18S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) is co-transcriptionally packed into a terminal ball of\u00a0~40 nm in size (<a href=\"#bib62\">Osheim et al., 2004</a>). These particles represent the earliest assembly intermediates of 40S and are known as the 90S pre-ribosome or the SSU processome (<a href=\"#bib80\">Trapman et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dragon et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Grandi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Phipps et al., 2011</a>). Within 90S, the pre-rRNA is cleaved at sites A0 and A1 in the 5' ETS and site A2 in the ITS1, yielding a 20S pre-rRNA intermediate. The 20S pre-rRNA is packed in the pre-40S particle and processed at site D in the cytoplasm to generate the mature 18S rRNA."

The 5' ETS associates with U3 snoRNA and 28 AFs into a 2.1 MDa particle. A subset of 5' ETS-associated factors exist as pre-assembled subcomplexes: UTPA, UTPB and U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Watkins et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Grandi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Krogan et al., 2004</a>). As the 18S rRNA region is transcribed, the U14 and snR30 snoRNAs and at least 37 AFs are recruited. The assembly of 90S is also highly dynamic. When the 18S rRNA is close to completion, U14 and snR30 snoRNAs and at least 14 protein factors assembled earlier to the 18S region begin to dissociate (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2016b</a>). The fully assembled 90S contains an unprocessed pre-18S rRNA, U3 snoRNA, approximately 51 assembly factors and 18 r-proteins with a molecular mass of 5.0 megadaltons (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2016b</a>)."

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been used to reveal structure for 60S pre-ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Leidig et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Greber et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wu et al., 2016</a>) and a late pre-40S particle (<a href=\"#bib75\">Strunk et al., 2011</a>). These structures represent late assembly intermediates in which ribosomal subunits already take shape. Very recently, a cryo-EM structure of <i>Chaetomonum thermophilum</i> (Ct) 90S was determined at 7.3 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kornprobst et al., 2016</a>). However, the reported model was rather incomplete with many unmodeled and unassigned densities due to limited resolution. Here, we determined three cryo-EM maps of Sc 90S pre-ribosome with resolution from 4.5 to 8.7 \u00c5. The\u00a0majority of the maps have been modeled and assigned to specific RNA and protein component based on fitting of crystal structures, de novo model building, chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry (CXMS) data. Our maps also contain many densities unseen in the Ct 90S map. The nearly complete 90S model provides major insights into the early assembly events of 40S subunit and the function of AFs."

The purified Noc4-TAP sample contains a large number of proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We first constructed a density map for the Noc4-TAP particle at approximately 25 \u00c5 by using negative stain EM and with the mature 40S structure as the initial model (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). Then, we analyzed its structure with cryo-EM and obtained a density map with a resolution range of 6\u201320 \u00c5 and an overall resolution of 8.7 \u00c5 by the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC)\u00a0=\u00a00.143 criterion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). RNA duplexes, protein \u03b1-helices and WD \u03b2-propeller structures were readily recognized in the density. However, the densities at the top and some peripheral regions are weak, probably due to the heterogeneity of Noc4-TAP particles that contain both unprocessed and processed pre-rRNAs (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2016b</a>). We next attempted to improve the sample homogeneity by genetic approach. The RNA helicases Dhr1 and Mtr4 function after the A0 cleavage of pre-rRNA (<a href=\"#bib14\">de la Cruz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Colley et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sardana et al., 2015</a>). To stall ribosome maturation at certain stages, Dhr1 or Mtr4 was depleted and 90S was purified using Enp1-TAP as bait. Although Enp1 is present in both 90S and pre-40S particles (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schafer et al., 2003</a>), the Enp1-TAP samples purified after Dhr1 or Mtr4 depletion contained mainly 90S particles, suggesting that 90S failed to develop into pre-40S. The two samples were subsequently analyzed by cryo-EM. Three density maps were constructed from the \u0394Dhr1 sample with resolution ranges of 6\u201320 \u00c5 and 7.8 to 9.5 \u00c5 overall resolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). One map (state 1) is highly similar to but more complete than the Noc4-TAP map and the other two maps reveal different states of 90S and will be discussed elsewhere. The \u0394Mtr4 sample yielded a density map of a resolution range of 4\u201320 \u00c5 and an overall resolution of 4.5 \u00c5 that is also highly similar with the Noc4-TAP map (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Some bulky side chains of proteins are visible at the core region of the \u0394Mtr4 map (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The three maps were essentially superimposable other than differences in resolution and local occupancy (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A\u2013B</a>). The initial Noc4-TAP map, the more complete \u0394Dhr1 map and the high-resolution \u0394Mtr4 map allowed us to build a more complete and accurate model."

Notably, the level of 5'-A0 fragment is significantly reduced (to\u00a0~10\u201320%) in the \u0394Dhr1 particle, apparently as a result of degradation or release.

In 90S, Pno1 is located near the center of UTPB with interactions to the CTD of Utp21 and the WD domain of Utp1 (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). A density that is suggestive of a short RNA hairpin is sandwiched between Pno1 and the WD domain of Utp13 (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5N</a>). Because the D site RNA potentially forms a short hairpin (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and binds Pno1, the density was temporarily assigned to the D site RNA. Although the D site RNA was found by chemical probing to be single-stranded (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009</a>), this result may mainly reflect the structure of pre-rRNA in the more abundant pre-40S ribosome. In the 90S model, the first KH domain of Pno1, which contains a degenerated RNA-binding motif, contacts the duplex part of the hairpin. The second KH domain of Pno1 binds at the 5' single-stranded region of 18S rRNA with the conserved RNA-binding surface, consistent with the known RNA-binding model of KH domain. The linker between helix 44 and D site and major part of ITS1 were not detected. During the stepwise assembly process of 90S, Pno1 is bound after the transcription of helix 44 and before the emergence of the D site sequence (<a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2016b</a>). This suggests that Pno1 is initially recruited by the protein-protein interaction with the UTPB complex."

Unfortunately, the current model does not include these processing sites that appear to locate at the\u00a0periphery or outside of the 90S core structure. Although the three analyzed 90S samples contain multiple processing intermediates of pre-rRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>), all reconstructions led to similar structures, suggesting that pre-rRNA cleavage may not significantly affect the global architecture of 90S."

The 5' domain and the central domain are assembled to great extents and primed to combine into the body.

U3 is a prominent component in the 5' ETS subcomplex (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chaker-Margot et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2016b</a>). The 5' domain of U3 is located at the heart of 90S and crucially organizes its architecture by making four helices with the 5' ETS and 18S RNA. We show that U3 binds 18S RNA in a way different from the previously proposed model (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the mature 40S structure, the 5' end of 18S base pairs with a central region (nt 1140\u20131144) to form the central pseudoknot (CPK). U3 has been long thought to bind both sides of the CPK and chaperone its formation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hughes, 1996</a>). However, our structure shows that U3 pairs with the 5' end of 18S, but not with the 3' side of the CPK. Previous mutational studies also support the former, but not the latter, interaction (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sharma and Tollervey, 1999</a>). Unexpectedly, we found that the 5' end of U3 makes a novel evolutionarily conserved interaction with the helix 27 sequence upstream of the 3' side of the CPK. By bringing the 5' end and the central region of 18S close, U3 would facilitate the formation of the CPK and the overall architecture of mature 40S after cleavage of sites A0-A2 and during the transition of 90S to pre-40S."

The structural organization of 90S is consistent with the ordered assembly pathway of the 5' ETS, the 5' domain and the central domain as these RNA sequences can form rather independent structures with the associated AFs (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). The transcription of helix 44 was shown to trigger a dramatic assembly event, which involves association of 12 late factors and release of U14, snR30 and about 14 AFs bound earlier, and eventually leads to the compaction of 90S particle and acquirement of cleavage competency (<a href=\"#bib62\">Osheim et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Zhang et al., 2016b</a>). The structural role of helix 44 and six assigned late factors (Utp30, Enp1, Bms1, Rcl1, Pno1, Utp20) in the 90S structure provide insight into the last major assembly event. They function to assemble the 3' major domain (Utp30, Enp1), the 3' minor domain (Pno1) and the 5' basal subdomain (Bms1) and to establish long range connections between ribosomal subdomains (helix 44, Bms1/Rcl1, Utp20). Specifically, helix 44 links helix 28 to Utp22, establishing a connection between the 3' major domain and the central domain. Binding of helix 44 to the tandem WD domains of Utp12 and Utp13 would lock their conformation. Consequently, Utp13 would promote the association of Pno1 and the D site RNA and Utp12 would induce the closure of the front face by stabilizing the Bms1/Rcl1 complex that also connects the 5' basal subdomain and the 3' basal subdomain. The elongated Utp20 molecule ties up the central domain and the 5' domain. These assembly events, triggered by helix 44, likely occur cooperatively to establish the global architecture of 90S."

The Ct 90S map lacks densities for the Utp22-Rrp7 complex, Rrp5, Utp18 (in our assignment) and helix 44 and has extremely weak densities for the beak subdomain and bound Enp1. These differences in the density map may be caused by species-specific features, different maturation stages of purified 90S and different sample preparation procedures. The two models have different assignment for Utp6, Utp18, the N domain of Utp10 and Kre33. The bulky density around the 5' apical major domain was assigned to two Kre33 molecules in the Ct 90S, but was tentatively assigned to Bfr2, Lcp5 and Efg1 in our study.

Three similar maps were obtained and discussed here, a Noc4-TAP complex at 8.7A, a \u0394Dhr1 complex at 8.7A, and a \u0394Mtr1 complex at 4.5A. (Two other \u0394Dhr1 complexes were analyzed but are being presented elsewhere.) The \u0394Mtr1 complex was also analyzed by chemical crosslinking and MS (CXMS) to obtain 340 intermolecular and 255 intramolecular linkages to assist in assignment of EM densities. Crystal structures of 19 of the 33 40S ribosomal proteins (RPs) that could be identified in the structure, and of ~27 different assembly factors (AFs), including a number of unpublished x-ray structures determined by the authors and not yet deposited in RCSB, were modeled into the EM densities. Other densities corresponding to \u03b2-propellers were fitted with known structures of other WD40 repeat proteins, or were modeled as poly-alanine helical segments or A-form RNA helices. The structure contains a total of 19 RPs, 35AFs, the 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS), and the U3 RNA. A cryoEM model of <i>Chaetomonium thermophilum</i> (Ct) 90S at 7.3A was recently reported. It is stated that the current Sc map is more complete than the Ct map, containing densities not assigned in the Ct map. In addition, a number of densities are assigned differently here compared to the Ct map. Hence, the current map seems to represent a valuable addition to the literature of the 90S pre-ribosome."

It is necessary for the authors to make the density map available to the reviewers to allow first-hand evaluation of some of the most unexpected assignments, including a revised base-pairing scheme for U3, a dramatic reorganization of helix 44, and a stem-loop at the D cleavage site. It is also imperative that the pdb files for all of the novel crystal structures be deposited prior to publication and be made available to the referees for inspection during the review of the revised manuscript. The authors also need to document the cross-linking/MS data and indicate when it was used to guide an assignment, and whether each crosslink is consistent with the final structure. The authors must do a better job of citing the previous literature. The paper is a challenge to read and each of the reviewers has specific suggestions for how the presentation of data can be improved, both in text and figures. In addition it is important that the authors address in a more thorough and transparent way the discrepancies between their assignments and those of the recent structure published by Kornprobst et al., and their objective justifications for their assignments. In short, the readers/reviewers of this paper must be able to assess the quality of the interpretation and the model from the data provided by the manuscript, knowing that some of these assignments are provisional, and the authors must do their best to facilitate this assessment. The essential revisions can be found in the reviews below."

E.g. in the Kornprobst paper the authors incorrectly assigned Kre33. This is obvious once you look into the density (as the density is not symmetrical), but not necessarily from the manuscript. In any case, without access to the map it is impossible to judge whether the authors correctly assigned the helices base pairing with U3."

Both studies present various important discrepancies, and the interpretation was mainly based on shape similarity to solved structures of ribosomal proteins and AFs, which can be accurate provided that the resolution of the map is sufficient. In the case of Ye et al., the resolution is higher than in the study by Kornprobst et al., which may suggest a more accurate assignment.

Rather, the map shows a duplex, which the authors have assigned as U3 and H27. However, there is no way of telling that H27 is part of this duplex, because there is no density connecting it to either H26 or H28, and indeed 20 nt are missing on either side. In addition, it is unclear that U3 is the other part of the duplex, because there is no EM density for parts of it. The authors must remove the claim that U3 base pairs to helix 27. Similarly, the map does not support the placement of Mpp10, as it is free floating, and the authors should make the speculative nature of their assignment of Mpp10 helices more clear. As in: \"Based on the known interactions with Imp3 and Imp4, we assign these to Mpp10, although they could come from other nearby proteins as well.\""

However, Pno1 has been shown to bind single stranded RNA, not double stranded RNA, and Lamanna and Karbstein have shown that D-site is single stranded not in a hairpin. Thus, there is no \"predicted\" duplex. Reviewer 3 had similar concerns. Moreover, looking at the map, I actually have no faith that this is a hairpin. There is density extending from the loop, which shouldn't be there, if it really were a hairpin. I strongly suggest the authors take out the assignment of the D-site hairpin. Minimally, the authors must present this logic in the paper, and add that the identified density might be a hairpin, and if so, could be the D-site hairpin, although previous data on later intermediates indicate that at that stage D-site is single stranded. In other words, this interpretation rests on assumptions, which are unproven, and probably untrue."

It is necessary for the authors to make the density map available to the reviewers to allow first-hand evaluation of some of the most unexpected assignments, including a revised base-pairing scheme for U3, a dramatic reorganization of helix 44, and a stem-loop at the D cleavage site. It is also imperative that the pdb files for all of the novel crystal structures be deposited prior to publication and be made available to the referees for inspection during the review of the revised manuscript. The authors also need to document the cross-linking/MS data and indicate when it was used to guide an assignment, and whether each crosslink is consistent with the final structure. The authors must do a better job of citing the previous literature. The paper is a challenge to read and each of the reviewers has specific suggestions for how the presentation of data can be improved, both in text and figures. In addition it is important that the authors address in a more thorough and transparent way the discrepancies between their assignments and those of the recent structure published by Kornprobst et al., and their objective justifications for their assignments. In short, the readers/reviewers of this paper must be able to assess the quality of the interpretation and the model from the data provided by the manuscript, knowing that some of these assignments are provisional, and the authors must do their best to facilitate this assessment. The essential revisions can be found in the reviews below.</i>"

Rather, the map shows a duplex, which the authors have assigned as U3 and H27.

In addition, it is unclear that U3 is the other part of the duplex, because there is no EM density for parts of it. The authors must remove the claim that U3 base pairs to helix 27. Similarly, the map does not support the placement of Mpp10, as it is free floating, and the authors should make the speculative nature of their assignment of Mpp10 helices more clear.

However, Pno1 has been shown to bind single stranded RNA, not double stranded RNA, and Lamanna and Karbstein have shown that D-site is single stranded not in a hairpin. Thus, there is no \"predicted\" duplex. Reviewer 3 had similar concerns. Moreover, looking at the map, I actually have no faith that this is a hairpin. There is density extending from the loop, which shouldn't be there, if it really were a hairpin. I strongly suggest the authors take out the assignment of the D-site hairpin. Minimally, the authors must present this logic in the paper, and add that the identified density might be a hairpin, and if so, could be the D-site hairpin, although previous data on later intermediates indicate that at that stage D-site is single stranded.
