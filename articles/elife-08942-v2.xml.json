Here we show that in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> a single DSB causes transcriptional inhibition of proximal genes independently of Tel1/ATM and Mec1/ATR. Since the DSB ends undergo nucleolytic degradation (resection) of their 5\u2032-ending strands, we investigated the contribution of resection in this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition. We discovered that resection-defective mutants fail to stop transcription around a DSB, and the extent of this failure correlates with the severity of the resection defect. Furthermore, Rad9 and generation of \u03b3H2A reduce this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition by counteracting DSB resection. Therefore, the conversion of the DSB ends from double-stranded to single-stranded DNA, which is necessary to initiate DSB repair by homologous recombination, is responsible for loss of transcription around a DSB in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>."

Here we show that in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> a single DSB causes transcriptional inhibition of proximal genes independently of Tel1/ATM and Mec1/ATR. Since the DSB ends undergo nucleolytic degradation (resection) of their 5\u2032-ending strands, we investigated the contribution of resection in this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition. We discovered that resection-defective mutants fail to stop transcription around a DSB, and the extent of this failure correlates with the severity of the resection defect. Furthermore, Rad9 and generation of \u03b3H2A reduce this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition by counteracting DSB resection. Therefore, the conversion of the DSB ends from double-stranded to single-stranded DNA, which is necessary to initiate DSB repair by homologous recombination, is responsible for loss of transcription around a DSB in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>."

One of the most characterized histone modifications is the phosphorylation of histone H2AX by ATM/Tel1 and ATR/Mec1, which spreads away from the DSB into large domains of surrounding chromatin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rogakou et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Downs et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Burma et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ward and Chen, 2001</a>).

Consistent with this hypothesis, generation of several DSBs distal to the promoter of a reporter gene in mammalian cells leads to ATM-dependent transcriptional repression of this reporter gene (<a href=\"#bib33\">Shanbhag et al., 2010</a>), possibly through phosphorylation of the transcriptional elongation factor ENL (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ui et al., 2015</a>).

As the homologous donor sequences <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> are deleted in this strain, this DSB cannot be repaired by HR (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 1998</a>). We previously used this strain for total RNA-seq analysis of protein-coding gene expression upon induction of the HO-induced DSB to show that mRNA levels of the vast majority of protein-coding genes underwent no significant change upon DSB generation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Manfrini et al., 2015</a>). Here we focused on the <i>MAT</i> locus that was not analyzed in the previous study. We mapped the RNA-seq data from two biological replicates of the JKM139 wild-type strain grown in raffinose (time zero, T0) and shifted to galactose-containing medium for 60 (T60) and 240 (T240) min on a restricted reference \u2018genome\u2019 corresponding to the <i>MAT</i> locus \u00b110 kb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Quantitative analysis of tag densities for annotated genes in this region revealed a moderate signal decrease for the DSB-proximal genes 60 min after HO induction, and a strong signal reduction along the whole region after 240 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

The lack of \u03b3H2A reduces the amount of Rad9 bound at the DSB ends and, as a consequence, <i>hta1-S129A</i> cells resect the DSB ends more efficiently than wild type cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Eapen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Clerici et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we investigated whether the enhanced DSB-induced transcriptional repression observed in <i>hta1-S129A</i> mutant cells was due to their accelerated nucleolytic processing of the DSB ends. Resection of the DSB 5\u2032 strand can be measured by following the loss of restriction fragments by Southern blot analysis with a ssRNA probe annealing on one side of the break (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Strikingly, <i>SGS1</i> deletion, which reduced the accelerated resection in <i>hta1-S129A</i> cells to almost wild type levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), also reduced their enhanced DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

The resulting partially resected 5\u2032 strand can be further processed by the nucleases Exo1 and Dna2, the latter working in concert with the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 helicase Sgs1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mimitou and Symington, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>). DSB resection is severely affected by either simultaneous inactivation of Exo1 and Sgs1 or the lack of MRX, with the latter not only providing the endonuclease activity to initiate resection, but also promoting the loading of Exo1, Sgs1 and Dna2 at DSB ends (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shim et al., 2010</a>). To assess whether DSB resection has a role in the DSB-induced transcriptional silencing, we asked whether <i>exo1\u2206</i>, <i>mre11\u2206</i> or <i>exo1\u2206 sgs1\u2206</i> cells, which were impaired in resection to different extents, were still capable to repress transcription of genes in the vicinity of the HO-induced DSB.

In contrast to the reported requirement of mammalian ATM for transcription silencing around a DSB (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kruhlak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shanbhag et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ui et al., 2015</a>), neither Tel1 nor Mec1 appear to be necessary for transcriptional inhibition at the DSB site in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Instead, we found that mutants defective in DSB resection fail to inhibit transcription around a DSB, and the extent of this failure correlates with the severity of the DSB resection defect. Furthermore, accelerating DSB resection by preventing \u03b3H2A generation or by eliminating Rad9 enhances this DSB-induced transcriptional inhibition. Altogether, these data indicate that loss of transcription around a DSB in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is not due to an active regulatory mechanism, but to the conversion of the DSB ends from dsDNA to ssDNA."

However, we found that mRNA levels and RNA polymerase II occupancy around a DSB decrease independently of the strand that is transcribed, indicating that loss of non-template DNA strands also impedes transcription. Therefore, the most likely reason of why the conversion from dsDNA to ssDNA stops transcription is that the transcription machinery binds only dsDNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that within a region containing a stretch of dsDNA preceding a single-strand 3\u2032 DNA end, purified RNA polymerase II transcribes within the dsDNA portion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lilley and Houghton, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kadesch and Chamberlin, 1982</a>). Furthermore, structural analyses of transcription initiation reveals that RNA polymerase II and its associated General Transcription Factors bind double-stranded promoter DNA to form a closed preinitiation complex (PIC), where the transcriptional machinery interacts with both template and non-template DNA strands (<a href=\"#bib22\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sainsbury et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, removal of either the template or non-template strands prevents binding of T7 RNA polymerase to the promoter, supporting the importance of protein-dsDNA interaction in the spatial organization of the transcriptional initiation complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maslak and Martin, 1993</a>)."

Furthermore, competition between the non-template DNA strand and the RNA transcript for base-pairing with the DNA template strand was shown to be important for maintaining structure and function during elongation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kireeva et al., 2011</a>), reinforcing the inhibitory effects of ssDNA on the transcription process."

In any case, while Mec1 and Tel1 are not required to resect a DSB, ATM and the chromatin compaction promoting proteins macroH2A1, PRMD2 and HP1 promote end resection by facilitating the loading of BRCA1 at the DSB ends (<a href=\"#bib36\">Soria and Almouzni, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ayrapetov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Khurana et al., 2014</a>). Thus, whether the nucleolytic processing of the DSB ends contributes to repress transcription around a DSB also in mammals is an important question that remains to be addressed. In fact, although in human cells inactivation of the end resection factor CtIP does not restore trascription around the DSB (<a href=\"#bib33\">Shanbhag et al., 2010</a>), other resection machineries are known to be active in resecting DSBs in CtIP-depleted cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tomimatsu et al., 2012</a>) and could contribute to inhibit transcription around the DSB."

The ratio between values obtained for Rpb2-HA and those obtained with the untagged Rpb2 immunoprecipitated samples, both of which normalized against the corresponding input, was calculated for each time point after HO induction.

This stopping transcription due to loss of DNA template model is quite a different model from the current repression model, which implies an active regulatory mechanism. As such, an in depth discussion of loss of transcription as a consequence of loss of DNA template with appropriate citations, and a model figure to illustrate this idea, is needed."

There are a plethora of observations in the literature that bare on this issue, motivating the authors to carry out these studies. At the risk of oversimplification, the message from this story seems to be very simply simplified, that conversion of DNA from double strand to single strand, that allows homologous recombination, has an \u2018unintended\u2019 consequence; genes that become single-stranded can no longer by transcribed (presumably it\u2019s well know that RNA polymerase binding and regulation etc. occurs only on double-strand templates, and not on single-strand templates). All of their lovely experiments are consistent with this simple idea, an idea they only state once and, in my view, deserves to be highlighted in the Abstract, and supported with a model at manuscript\u2019s end.

Yet, showing data at the HO site at <i>LEU2</i> is critical for the generality of their conclusions. I suggest they therefore put the <i>LEU2</i> HO data in a separate Figure. Shape the data in a similar fashion as the HO data, state distance from HO site, extending left and right from the DSB, as they did for the <i>MAT</i> HO site data. Parallel presentations make it easier for the reader."
