                    "text": "The small GTPase Rab7 is a key regulator of endosomal maturation in eukaryotic cells. Mutations in <i>rab7</i> are thought to cause the dominant neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) by a gain-of-function mechanism. Here we show that loss of <i>rab7</i>, but not overexpression of <i>rab7</i> CMT2B mutants, causes adult-onset neurodegeneration in a <i>Drosophila</i> model. All CMT2B mutant proteins retain 10\u201350% function based on quantitative imaging, electrophysiology, and rescue experiments in sensory and motor neurons in vivo. Consequently, expression of CMT2B mutants at levels between 0.5 and 10-fold their endogenous levels fully rescues the neuropathy-like phenotypes of the <i>rab7</i> mutant. Live imaging reveals that CMT2B proteins are inefficiently recruited to endosomes, but do not impair endosomal maturation. These findings are not consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. Instead, they indicate a dosage-dependent sensitivity of neurons to <i>rab7</i>-dependent degradation. Our results suggest a therapeutic approach opposite to the currently proposed reduction of mutant protein function."

Mutations in <i>rab7</i> are thought to cause the dominant neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) by a gain-of-function mechanism. Here we show that loss of <i>rab7</i>, but not overexpression of <i>rab7</i> CMT2B mutants, causes adult-onset neurodegeneration in a <i>Drosophila</i> model. All CMT2B mutant proteins retain 10\u201350% function based on quantitative imaging, electrophysiology, and rescue experiments in sensory and motor neurons in vivo. Consequently, expression of CMT2B mutants at levels between 0.5 and 10-fold their endogenous levels fully rescues the neuropathy-like phenotypes of the <i>rab7</i> mutant. Live imaging reveals that CMT2B proteins are inefficiently recruited to endosomes, but do not impair endosomal maturation. These findings are not consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. Instead, they indicate a dosage-dependent sensitivity of neurons to <i>rab7</i>-dependent degradation. Our results suggest a therapeutic approach opposite to the currently proposed reduction of mutant protein function."

While the two cell types were initially similar, the mutant cells gradually degenerated in the adult animal.

Moreover, when mutant Rab7 proteins were introduced into the cells that lacked the <i>rab7</i> gene, the proteins restored the cells\u2019 sensitivity to light.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) is a sensory neuropathy that primarily affects some of the longest axon projections in the human body and is caused by mutations in the <i>rab7</i> locus. <i>rab7</i> encodes a GTPase that regulates endolysosomal degradation in all cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elliott et al., 1997</a>). All known mutations in CMT2B patients alter highly conserved amino acids in Rab7 and cause pathology in heterozygosity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kwon et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Verhoeven et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Houlden et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Meggouh et al., 2006</a>).

In support of this hypothesis, several dominant functions of CMT2B mutant Rab7 have been described based on overexpression of the mutant proteins in neuronal or non-neuronal cultured cells. For example, CMT2B protein expression leads to altered EGF degradation in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>), decreased upregulation of the growth-associated protein 43 in PC12 cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cogli et al., 2010</a>), increased interaction with the filament protein peripherin in Neura2A cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cogli et al., 2013</a>), modulatory effects on JNK signaling in N1E-115 cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Yamauchi et al., 2010</a>), accumulation of the NGF receptor TrkA in cultured dorsal root ganglia cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>), and altered EGF receptor signaling in HeLa, BHK-21 and A431 cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Basuray et al., 2013</a>), amongst others. Furthermore, a recent report has suggested that overexpression of CMT2B mutants in HeLa and PC12 cells dominantly reduces <i>rab7</i> function (<a href=\"#bib1\">Basuray et al., 2013</a>). It is unclear which ones of these effects are causally linked to the neuropathy in aging sensory and motor neurons in humans. Since Rab7 is a key protein required for endolysosomal function in all cells, its loss or gain-of-function is predicted to directly or indirectly affect many signaling pathways over time. In addition, it is currently unclear whether overexpression of the CMT2B mutant proteins actually causes axon terminal degeneration in a sensory or motor neuron. Indeed, overexpression in at least one cell culture system revealed no obvious toxic effects (<a href=\"#bib23\">McCray et al., 2010</a>). Consequently, the mechanism underlying the genetic dominance and the putative gain-of-function underlying the pathology of CMT2B remains unclear."

Rab7 GTPase function is biochemically well defined and GTP-locked \u2018constitutively active\u2019 and GDP-locked \u2018dominant negative\u2019 mutants have been tested and utilized in a plethora of systems, including human cell lines and <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bucci et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). More recently, extensive biochemical characterizations of all four CMT2B proteins revealed that the majority of the overexpressed protein is in a GTP-bound form when compared to the GDP-bound form (<a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>). However, the same study showed that the overall binding to both GTP and GDP is drastically reduced for the CMT2B proteins, unlike a constitutively active form (<a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>). In addition, a 2.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of one of the CMT2B proteins revealed no intrinsic GTPase defect (<a href=\"#bib23\">McCray et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, the CMT2B variants can at least partially rescue defects caused by reduced <i>rab7</i> levels (<a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">McCray et al., 2010</a>). In summary, neither overexpression studies in cell culture nor comprehensive biochemical analyses have so far pinpointed a molecular mechanism that directly causes adult-onset loss of synaptic function in sensory and motor neurons. In mouse (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kawamura et al., 2012</a>) and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kinchen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Skorobogata and Rocheleau, 2012</a>) <i>rab7</i> null mutants cause embryonic lethality, which has so far precluded the analysis of neuronal phenotypes. In this study, we used the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to analyze the role and mechanism of CMT2B mutant Rab7 proteins in sensory and motor neurons in vivo. Our findings did not uncover a neuron-specific dominant gain- or loss-of-function for the CMT2B alleles. Instead, our findings indicate that the CMT2B alleles are partial loss of function alleles of <i>rab7</i> that cause, in a dosage-dependent manner, first synaptic and subsequently neuronal degeneration."

To investigate an enhanced or specialized role for <i>rab7</i> in the nervous system, we generated a null mutant by replacing the <i>rab7</i> open reading frame with a Gal4 knock-in cassette (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>); the Gal4 knock-in provides a means to express any gene of interest under the endogenous regulatory elements of <i>rab7</i> in either heterozygous or homozygous <i>rab7</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chan et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2012</a>).

Under the same conditions, wild-type photoreceptors exhibit no significant reduction in synaptic function. By contrast, the photoreceptor response amplitude does not significantly differ between wild-type and <i>rab7</i>, suggesting that synaptic function is more sensitive than cell body function to loss of <i>rab7</i>. Furthermore, the age-dependent synaptic defect can be fully rescued by minimizing their stimulation through raising the flies in the dark (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similarly, electron microscopy of <i>rab7</i> mutant photoreceptors reveals increased degeneration of cellular structure after 5 days in constant light compared with wild-type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1N</a>), while 5-day dark-reared <i>rab7</i> mutants and controls exhibit no obvious defects (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Synaptic terminals of light-exposed <i>rab7</i> photoreceptors exhibit large-scale degeneration that is absent in unstimulated <i>rab7</i> mutant terminals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O,P</a>). These findings suggest that in the absence of neuronal stimulation <i>rab7</i> in photoreceptor neurons is partially dispensable at least in young flies. Overall, our analysis of <i>rab7</i>-deficient sensory neurons revealed progressive defects that appear first as a loss of synaptic function but lead ultimately to degeneration of the entire neuron."

                                "text": "Adult-onset synaptic degeneration is a hallmark of many human sensory neuropathies. Indeed, four independent mutations in <i>rab7</i> that cause the sensory neuropathy CMT2B in patients have been characterized (<a href=\"#bib38\">Verhoeven et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Houlden et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Meggouh et al., 2006</a>). The four amino acids altered by these mutations (L129, K157, N161 and V162) are 100% conserved in the single <i>Drosophila rab7</i> ortholog, including their precise location in the primary sequence of identical length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). All four mutations cause the CMT2B neuropathy independently and dominantly in heterozygote patients, which has led to a focus on identifying a putative gain-of-function effect of the disease mutants (<a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">McCray et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cogli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the disease mutations might mimic the constitutively active <i>rab7</i><sup><i>Q67L</i></sup>, a known gain-of-function mutation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">De Luca et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>). To test the gain-of-function hypothesis in vivo<i>,</i> we generated transgenic flies for the expression of all four CMT2B mutants. <i>rab7</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup>, <i>rab7</i><sup><i>Q67L</i></sup> and the well-characterized dominant negative <i>rab7</i><sup><i>T22N</i></sup> variants have previously been generated and successfully used in <i>Drosophila,</i> but their random genomic integrations preclude comparable levels of expression (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). To compare these variants quantitatively with the CMT2B mutations at identical expression levels, we generated new transgenic lines for <i>rab7</i><sup><i>Q67L</i></sup>, <i>rab7</i><sup><i>T22N</i></sup> and <i>rab7</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup> using the same insertion site in the genome. Finally, we generated two transgenic fly lines for the expression of the human <i>rab7</i> ortholog <i>rab7A,</i> one for wild-type <i>hrab7A</i> and one of the CMT2B mutation K157N. All nine fly and human <i>rab7</i> variants (WT, Q67L, T22N, K157N, L129F, N161T, V162M, hrab7A-WT, hrab7A-K157N) were N-terminally tagged with the YFP variant Venus, similar to previous experiments showing that N-terminal tagging does not interfere with <i>rab</i> GTPase function (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>)."

Western Blot analysis of total protein extract from fly heads revealed that all Venus-Rab7 proteins are mildly overexpressed at \u223c1.8 to 3-fold of the levels of the endogenous Rab7 protein (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In contrast, the CMT2B variants accumulate in the center of synaptic boutons (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Functional Rab7 is characterized by dynamic colocalization first with the early endosomal marker Rab5 and second with the early-to-late endosomal ESCRT protein Hrs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lloyd et al., 2002</a>). Colocalization analysis with these markers therefore provides a means to assess the functional state of the nine Venus-tagged Rab7 variants.

The GTP-locked Rab7-Q67L has an increased activity that is quantitatively reflected in its localization to late endosomal compartments, whereas the GDP-locked Rab7-T22N is considered inactive, as reflected by a complete failure to be recruited to endosomal compartments. Hence, compartment localization is a quantitative readout for GTP-dependent Rab7 activity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chan et al., 2011</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013J</a>, the nine variants exhibit localization to distinct compartments (arrows in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>) and diffuse labeling in varying ratios. Quantification of the ratio of compartment fluorescence to total fluorescence in 3D datasets of individual cell bodies shows that 38% of Rab7-Q67L, compared to 21% of wild-type Rab7 and less than 4% of Rab7-T22N localize to distinct compartments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). These data are consistent with a plethora of previous studies on these widely studied Rab7 variants (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bucci et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). Analysis of the Venus-tagged CMT2B variants reveals mostly a diffuse cytoplasmic location, similar to Rab7-T22N, with 2\u201311% of the total fluorescent protein localized to distinct compartments. Hence, the reduced compartment localization suggests that the CMT2B proteins retain \u223c5\u201350% of the function of Rab7-WT. A similar difference is observed for the human proteins hRab7-WT and hRab7-K157N (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). These data do not support the hypothesis that the disease variants mimic the gain-of-function of the Q67L mutations. Instead, they suggest that CMT2B variants exhibit reduced function more similar to the T22N mutant, but may retain some wild-type protein function that, based on quantitative analysis of localization to distinct compartments, ranges between 5\u201350% of Rab7-WT."

The ratio of genotypes that emerge after four generations is indicative of the fitness of each genotype relative to the others in the population. For instance, if overexpression of any of the nine <i>rab7</i> variants has deleterious effects, two copies of the transgene will be less common than one. In the case of wild-type Rab7, three quarters of the population had two copies of the Rab7-WT transgene, indicating little to no toxicity of the overexpressed Rab7-WT. Furthermore, 12% of the flies in the population were rescued homozygous <i>rab7</i> null mutants (light and dark green in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We note that this number reflects a remarkably healthy rescue, because a significant part of the population lives without the wild-type <i>rab7</i> chromosome, but instead only due to Rab7-<i>Gal4</i>-driven UAS-<i>rab7</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup> in direct competition with wild-type flies over four generations. Indeed, the ratio of rescued to wild-type progeny prior to the competition experiment obeyed Mendelian ratios and homozygous <i>rab7</i> null mutant flies rescued with Rab7-WT expression (UAS-<i>rab7</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup>/UAS-<i>rab7</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup>; <i>rab7</i><sup><i>Gal4-knock-in</i></sup>/<i>rab7</i><sup><i>Gal4-knock-in</i></sup>) appear indistinguishable from wild type."

Hence, Rab7-T22N exhibits little or no toxicity but is also not sufficiently functional to efficiently rescue the null mutant. Interestingly, close investigation of the fly stock revealed that the <i>rab7</i><sup><i>T22N</i></sup> mutant actually yielded rare adult escapers that died shortly after emergence. In contrast, Rab7-Q67L never occurred in two copies, indicating that high levels of this constitutively active mutant are associated with reduced fitness (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, two of the four CMT2B variants lead to populations consisting entirely of individuals expressing two copies of these disease-associated proteins. Remarkably, almost no rescue of the null mutant with a single copy of these CMT2B transgenes was observed, but between 12\u201335% of individuals were rescued by two copies of the CMT2B mutant transgenes. These findings suggest that higher levels of at least three of the four CMT2B mutant proteins increase the fitness and are indeed required to compensate for the loss of wild-type <i>rab7</i>. In summary, all CMT2B disease mutants, including the <i>Drosophila</i> and human Rab7-K157N, exhibited significant rescue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Indeed, all UAS-<i>rab7</i> variants except Rab7-T22N rescued <i>rab7</i> lethality and yielded adult flies with no obvious defects. These findings reveal that the CMT2B proteins do not reduce fitness or neuronal health, but retain sufficient wild-type function to compensate for loss of <i>rab7</i> if expressed at 2\u20136-fold endogenous levels."

However, the observation that <i>rab7</i><sup><i>T22N</i></sup> exhibits some rescue of the null mutant further indicates that it retains some wild-type function and does not obviously act as a genetically dominant negative mutant at these levels of overexpression in Drosophila. While both human Rab7 proteins exhibit a reduced ability to rescue synaptic functions under these stress conditions, <i>hrab7</i><sup><i>K157N</i></sup> does not significantly differ from <i>hrab7</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup>. The ability of all CMT2B mutant proteins to rescue the null mutant phenotype indicates that replacement of wild-type <i>rab7</i> with mild overexpression in the correct spatiotemporal pattern is sufficient to compensate for the partial loss of function of the mutant variants. In summary, we conclude that all CMT2B mutants retain significant levels of wild-type function."

To measure the function of each of the Rab7 variants, we devised a live imaging method to assay the well-characterized role of Rab7 in the maturation of late endosomal compartments. We developed a culture system for high-resolution live imaging of endosomal dynamics in photoreceptor neurons in intact eye-brain complexes and made use of the lysosomal marker spinster/benchwarmer (spin) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sweeney and Davis, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dermaut et al., 2005</a>). Co-expression of the Venus-tagged Rab7 proteins with spin-RFP reveals the dynamics of endolysosomal conversion both in cell bodies and at synapses (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1\u201310</a>). In cell bodies, Venus-Rab7-WT marks on average 15 clearly distinguishable, circular endosomal compartments of 0.5 \u00b5m diameter or more per 500 \u00b5m\u00b2 tissue area. In contrast, Rab7-T22N marks no individual compartments and expression of the constitutively active Venus-Rab7-Q67L leads to a doubling of compartment numbers, many of which are significantly larger than those observed for wild type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). As seen before, all four CMT2B mutant proteins exhibit mostly diffuse labeling similar to Rab7-T22N; however, in contrast to Rab7-T22N and Rab7-K157N, the other three CMT2B variants also reveal clear circular labeling of distinct compartments of 0.5 \u00b5m diameter or above (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), albeit at significantly reduced numbers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). 3D time lapse imaging of the dynamics of these compartments reveals conversion of 8\u20139% of these compartments into spin-RFP positive compartments within a 5 min imaging interval. Conversion of wild type and CMT2B Venus-Rab7 marked compartments typically occurs quickly and within the 30 s between image acquisition time points (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>). Remarkably, the conversion rate of 8\u20139% per 500 \u00b5m\u00b2 tissue area per 5 min is identical between all genotypes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Based on these measurements, the CMT2B proteins exhibit 5\u201350% of the wild type levels of recruitment to endosomal compartments, but no defects in endosomal conversion."

We therefore analyzed viable heterozygous flies for increased sensitivity to stimulation using 10-days of light exposure in white-eyed flies. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, constant stimulation leads to almost complete loss of synaptic function in heterozygous <i>rab7</i> mutants similar to the null mutant. This defect is fully rescued by the absence of stimulation and does not significantly affect the photoreceptor response amplitude (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Furthermore, <i>rab7</i> heterozygous photoreceptors after stimulation exhibit a morphological haploinsufficiency phenotype with partial loss of rhabdomere structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>).

If the CMT2B mutations are hypomorphic alleles and encode proteins with 5\u201350% function, as our data indicates, then the cause of the adult-onset loss of synaptic function in patients may be due to this partial loss of function. On the other hand, numerous overexpression experiments revealed clear dominant effects of the CMT2B proteins in cell culture (<a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cogli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">McCray et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Basuray et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cogli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). To determine the levels and range of CMT2B protein levels that are sufficient to rescue partial loss of <i>rab7</i> or induce dominant effects, we generated heterozygous <i>rab7</i> flies (one copy of the wild-type chromosome) and a second copy at half, identical and &gt;10-fold levels of the endogenous copy of <i>rab7</i>. To generate these flies, we introduced the temperature-sensitive Gal4 suppressor Gal80ts (<a href=\"#bib24\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>) and determined temperature conditions to match the CMT2B overexpression levels to endogenous Rab7 levels and further reduce the CMT2B expression 50% below endogenous levels. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, an antibody against <i>Drosophila</i> Rab7 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chinchore et al., 2009</a>) recognizes both endogenous Rab7 as well as our Venus-tagged transgenes. More than 10-fold overexpression of the CMT2B variants was achieved in the absence of Gal80ts at 25\u00b0C. Remarkably, all transgenes over this large range rescued the haploinsufficiency phenotype after a 5-day light stimulation protocol in the ERG depolarization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), synaptic function (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) and Rhabdomere structure of the eye (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013J</a>). These findings quantitatively support two key findings reported in this study: First, Rab7 CMT2B proteins at 50% less than endogenous heterozygous levels (corresponding to 25% of total Rab7 function) retain sufficient wild-type function to rescue the <i>rab7</i> phenotype. Second, Rab7 CMT2B proteins at &gt;10-fold overexpression rescue, but exhibit no toxic or other obvious gain-of-function effects. Together with our quantitative colocalization and live imaging experiments that show quantitatively reduced wild-type function, these data corroborate our conclusion that CMT2B proteins represent partial loss-of-function alleles with no toxic gain-of-function in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Our results show that loss of <i>rab7</i> function causes progressive and usage-dependent loss of synaptic function and neurodegeneration without affecting neuronal development or other tissues. This loss-of-function phenotype is dosage-dependent. In contrast, overexpression of the CMT2B mutant variants of <i>rab7</i> causes no neuropathy-like phenotypes, even at high levels. We conclude that the four CMT2B mutants are hypomorphic alleles of <i>rab7</i> that retain 5\u201350% of wild-type function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). We therefore propose that CMT2B is a dominant neuropathy due to partial loss-of-function. This reinterpretation of CMT2B has the significant consequence that a potential therapy may involve increasing the mutant protein function, which is opposite to the current proposal to reduce the mutant protein function."

For example, mammalian heterologous expression studies revealed that the GTP: GDP ratio is altered, which could suggest a dominant or constitutively active mutant. However, the same study revealed that, in contrast to the constitutively active variant, the total amount of both GTP and GDP bound Rab7 is dramatically decreased for the CMT2B mutant proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">De Luca et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Spinosa et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, our findings are largely consistent with the thorough biochemical characterization of the CMT2B Rab7 proteins by <a href=\"#bib23\">McCray et al. (2010)</a>. Specifically, McCray et al. found that the CMT2B proteins have no GTPase activity defect, but augmented protein activity, based on increased guanine nucleotide dissociation, hydrolysis-independent inactivation, quantitative changes on effector interactions and decreased membrane cycling. However, McCray et al. also showed that the CMT2B proteins retain sufficient wild-type function to rescue reduced <i>rab7</i> activity in HeLa cells without obvious toxic gain-of-function effects. All these findings are consistent with partial loss of function alleles. The key difference to the present study lies in the interpretation that misregulation of the disease proteins\u2019 Rab7 activity may have a dominant effect, as opposed to our simpler interpretation as partial loss-of-function."

These dominant phenotypes could be a result of overexpression in a heterologous cell line, or a <i>bona fide</i> property of the CMT2B proteins. In some cases, high levels of overexpression might at least partially explain the effects. Nonetheless, our data do not rule out the possibility of a dominant interaction with protein complexes or protein functions that are specific to vertebrate cells. However, we note that none of the studies to date has reported progressive neuronal or synaptic deterioration as a consequence of CMT2B protein overexpression in motor or sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cogli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>).

In patients, this genotype leads to slow motor- and sensory neuron degeneration with an onset between 12 to more than 40 years. In <i>Drosophila</i>, heterozygotes with an additional copy of a CMT2B chromosome are healthy and photoreceptor neurons are not sensitized to stimulation-dependent degeneration within the limits of our functional and morphological assays. The observation that this genotype is sufficient for normal human development and function for decades offers a possible explanation for this limitation of the fly model. Indeed, slow, adult-onset degeneration over a period of years is not easily mimicked in any model organism. It will be interesting to see if a <i>rab7</i> heterozygous mouse model exhibits stimulation-dependent degeneration of motor- or sensory neurons over time, or if even the lifespan of a mouse is not sufficient to model this aspect of the human neuropathy."

Our model predicts that only mutations that reduce <i>rab7</i> function within a certain range will lead to a neuropathy, explaining the rarity of these mutations and the variability of disease onset. We note that the CMT2B mutant with the least function in the fly (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), <i>rab7</i><sup><i>K157N</i></sup>, is a sporadic new mutation in a patient with the earliest reported childhood onset (12 years) of the four mutant variants (<a href=\"#bib25\">Meggouh et al., 2006</a>)."

Such accumulations and subsequent endomembrane degradative responses are hallmarks of most neurodegenerative disorders. An elevated neuronal demand for endolysosomal degradation is further highlighted by the recent discovery of a neuron-specific branch of the endolysosomal system (<a href=\"#bib42\">Williamson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Haberman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wang and Hiesinger, 2012</a>). In the case of CMT2B our findings suggest an increase of endolysosomal function as a therapeutic approach, which is opposite to the current proposal to reduce the function of the mutant Rab7 proteins. Neuronal sensitivity to <i>rab7</i>-dependent degradation may be a common factor contributing to neuronal pathology in numerous disorders with reduced degradation or increased degradative burden. Reduced endolysosomal capacity may thus contribute to pathology and increased endolysosomal function may represent a more general therapeutic opportunity."

The <i>rab7<sup>Gal4-knock-in</sup></i> chromosome was recombined on an FRT82B chromosome using G418 selection. For rescue experiments UAS-venus-<i>rab7</i> variants were introduced on the second chromosome. Flies were kept at 25\u00b0C unless otherwise indicated. Dark-reared flies were kept in the same room next to light-raised flies. For constant light raising fly vials were kept in an aluminium foil covered box that provided even illumination provided by a Leica KL1500LCD cold light source. Light intensity was adjusted to 600 Lux using a hand-held digital lux meter at the level of the fly vials, 20 cm from the light source. To reduce expression levels of the UAS-<i>rab7</i> transgenes we generated flies of the genotype UAS-<i>rab7</i>-X/+; <i>rab7<sup>Gal4-knock-in</sup></i>/tub-Gal80ts. The tub-Gal80ts stock was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center (stock number 7018). To reduce level to endogenous levels flies were kept at 22\u00b0C.

The tissues were fixed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 3.5% formaldehyde for 15 min and washed in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100. High-resolution light microscopy was performed using a Confocal Microscope (Leica SP5). Imaging data was processed and quantified using Amira 5.3 (Indeed, Berlin, Germany) and Adobe Photoshop CS6 as described (<a href=\"#bib42\">Williamson et al., 2010</a>). The following antibodies were used: Chaoptin (at 1:100), CSP (1:50), Hrs (at 1:300), Rab7 (at 1:500). Secondary antibodies used were Cy3 and Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) raised against guinea pig, mouse or rabbit.

Dissected tissues were pipetted into a drop of 0.4% dialyzed agarose (in Schneider\u2019s Medium) on a Sylgard layer. The sample was covered with a coverslip. Imaging was performed with a Leica SP5 resonant scanner, using a 63X glycerol lens. A time interval of 30 s was used for live imaging.

Each dataset was separately binarized by threshold segmentation and visually controlled for only including clearly distinct compartments under exclusion of diffuse labeling. The cumulative fluorescence intensity of all voxels inside and outside the thresholded compartments was determined for the entire cell volume. Finally, the ratio of cumulative fluorescence inside/total fluorescence was calculated for each cell. Mean ratio, standard error (SEM) and p values were calculated for each genotype."

A post-recording filter was also provided by the Clampex software. Light stimulus was provided in 1 s pulses by a computer-controlled white LED system (Schott MC1500). All ERG recordings in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> were performed in matched white- genetic backgrounds, which are significantly more sensitive to light stimulation than pigmented eyes; recordings in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a> were performed in flies with a single copy of mini-white and the same level of eye pigmentation.

The larvae were dissected in modified, ice-cold HL3.1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stewart et al., 1994</a>), containing (in mM): Sucrose 115, NaCl 70, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 11, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 10, KCl 5, Trehalose 5, HEPES 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, at pH 7.2. To avoid damaging the microscope optics, the filets were adhered to a SYLGARD 184 (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) substrate with a cyanoacrylate glue that polymerizes in water; the dissection pins were removed after glue polymerization, and the motor neurons were severed. Current clamp recordings were performed at room temperature in HL3.1. Recording microelectrodes were pulled to a sharp point with resistances between 20\u201340 M\u03a9. Only muscles 6, in segments 2\u20134, with membrane potentials between \u221265 and \u221260 mV were recorded. Voltage signals were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, LLC., Sunnyvale, CA). Signals were digitized using a Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices, LLC.), filtered at 2 kHz, and recorded using Clampex 10.2 software (Molecular Devices, LLC.). Miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs) were recorded for 60 s and analyzed using the \u2018Template search\u2019 feature of Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices, LLC.). Frequency was calculated by taking the number of events in a recording and diving by 60 s. For EPPs, stimulation was applied via the segmental motor nerve axons with a A365 stimulus isolator (WPI), under digital control of the Clampex software. Stimulus electrodes had a \u223c10 \u03bcm inner diameter after firepolishing. Superthreshold stimulation (between 3\u20134 mA, for 100 ms) was applied at 0.2 Hz for 60 s and recorded with Clampex. EPP amplitudes were measured using the Clampfit cursor function. Significance was calculated using Welch\u2019s <i>t</i> test."

The work creates a very useful in vivo model for CMT2B that can be used for further genetic and pharmacological analysis. The study is comprehensive, generates new valuable reagents, carries out multiple functional analyses (activity-dependent neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic transmission) and tries to get at the mechanism by which a loss of function in the mutant rab7 protein might result in progressive degeneration in sensory neurons in the eye. The data are generally nicely presented, though proper labels are needed in all of the figures."

In initial experiments, we only succeeded in reducing the expression levels of the disease mutant proteins to about 2-fold, despite the temperature sensitivity of the Gal4/UAS system. To obtain flies with endogenous levels of disease mutant protein expression, we performed a series of experiments introducing Gal80ts to further reduce Gal4/UAS expression of the CMT2B variants. These experiments were facilitated by the fact that the disease mutant proteins are fluorescently tagged, allowing quantitative comparison with the endogenous protein in Rab7 Western Blot. As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, we identified the conditions to generate flies that express the human disease mutant variants at levels comparable to heterozygous endogenous levels, as well as \u223c50% below endogenous levels, and up to more than 10-fold endogenous levels."

Our new data reveal that endogenous levels of the CMT2B variants and even 50% below endogenous levels are sufficient to rescue this phenotype (new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We conclude that we cannot easily mimic the precise dosage-dependence of the human condition in flies. This is consistent with our previous conclusions, as shown in the model figure (now <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>): We proposed that putative human heterozygotes, which have never been documented, are likely not viable, whereas the fly heterozygotes clearly are almost completely healthy. Adding 10-50% of a second <i>rab7</i> copy, as is the case with the CMT2B variants, permits normal human development and function for years, but is not enough to prevent slow degeneration after 12 or more years as observed in patients. In contrast, in the fly the addition of 10-50% of <i>rab7</i> function in the form of a CMT2B allele is sufficient to quantitatively rescue the degeneration phenotype within the limits our functional and morphology read-outs."

This is a clear limit of the fly model. However, we would like to note that mimicking slow, adult-onset degeneration as it occurs in patients over many years is a problem in all animal models, including mouse models for numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Even a mouse model for mildly reduced Rab7 function may not precisely mimic the dosage-dependence and slow disease progression observed in human patients, and in cell culture equivalent experiments are impossible. We discuss this and other limits of the <i>Drosophila</i> model now in the revised Results as well as an extra Discussion section entitled \u2018Limitations of the <i>Drosophila</i> model\u2019."

Not a single one of the numerous previous cell culture overexpression papers on CMT2B provided any information on the level of CMT2B protein overexpression used in these studies. Since we can precisely quantify the level of expression of the CMT2B variants (in the endogenous expression pattern in an entire organism in vivo), we have also repeated the rescue/overexpression experiment with the CMT2B proteins with more than 10-fold overexpression. As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, even more than 10-fold overexpression rescues and does not negatively affect neuronal function."

First, Rab7 CMT2B proteins at 50% less than endogenous heterozygous levels (corresponding to 25% of total Rab7 function) retain sufficient wild-type function to rescue rab7-dependent degeneration. Second, Rab7 CMT2B proteins at &gt;10-fold overexpression rescue equally well and exhibit no toxic or other obvious gain-of-function effects. Together with our quantitative colocalization and live imaging experiments that show reduced function at 10-50% wild type levels, these data corroborate our conclusion that CMT2B proteins represent partial loss-of-function alleles with no toxic gain-of-function in <i>Drosophila</i>."
