These proteins, through inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A, respectively, impair cap-dependent translation. Under stress conditions FOXO transcription factors activate 4E-BP expression amplifying the repression. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> FOXO binds the PDCD4 promoter and stimulates the transcription of PDCD4 in response to stress. We have shown previously that the 5\u2032 UTR of the <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like receptor (dINR) supports cap-independent translation that is resistant to 4E-BP. Using hippuristanol, an eIF4A inhibitor, we find that translation of dINR UTR containing transcripts are also resistant to eIF4A inhibition. In addition, the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor 5\u2032 UTRs support cap-independent translation and have a similar resistance to hippuristanol. This resistance to inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A indicates a conserved strategy to allow translation of growth factor receptors under stress conditions."

These proteins, through inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A, respectively, impair cap-dependent translation. Under stress conditions FOXO transcription factors activate 4E-BP expression amplifying the repression. Here we show that <i>Drosophila</i> FOXO binds the PDCD4 promoter and stimulates the transcription of PDCD4 in response to stress. We have shown previously that the 5\u2032 UTR of the <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like receptor (dINR) supports cap-independent translation that is resistant to 4E-BP. Using hippuristanol, an eIF4A inhibitor, we find that translation of dINR UTR containing transcripts are also resistant to eIF4A inhibition. In addition, the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor 5\u2032 UTRs support cap-independent translation and have a similar resistance to hippuristanol. This resistance to inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A indicates a conserved strategy to allow translation of growth factor receptors under stress conditions."

This response is regulated, in part, by a signaling pathway known as the insulin and insulin-like receptor pathway. In particular, stressful events inhibit a protein complex called eIF4F, which normally initiates the translation of mRNA molecules by binding to a structure on one end of the mRNA called the 5\u2032 cap. Despite this general inhibition, the production of certain other proteins\u2014including the insulin receptor itself\u2014is actually increased in response to stress."

The eIF4F complex is made up of three proteins, including one that binds to the 5\u2032 cap and a helicase that unwinds the RNA. Previous work in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i> showed that translation of this mRNA can continue even if formation of the eIF4F complex is inhibited by targeting the cap binding protein. Olsen et al. now show that translation of this mRNA is also independent of the helicase. Instead, translation is maintained under these conditions because the insulin receptor mRNA contains a sequence called an internal ribosome entry site, which allows ribosomes to bind to the mRNA without the influence of the 5\u2032 cap."

Coordinate changes in both transcription and translation occur (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sengupta et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Spriggs et al., 2010</a>). A central pathway that responds to stress stimuli by controlling both protein and RNA synthesis is the insulin and insulin-like receptor-signaling (IIS) pathway. The fundamental molecular architecture of the IIS pathway is conserved from flies to man (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Oldham, 2011</a>). When IIS signaling is high, the protein kinase AKT is activated (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ruggero and Sonenberg, 2005</a>). AKT directly phosphorylates the Foxo family of transcription factors and consequently prevents activated transcription of Foxo target genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brunet et al., 1999</a>). AKT also stimulates the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zoncu et al., 2011</a>)."

The eIF4F complex consists of eIF4E, the 7-methyl-Guanosine-cap (m7G) binding protein, eIF4A, an RNA helicase, and eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein. In addition, the RNA binding protein eIF4B can associate with eIF4F to stimulate the helicase activity of eIF4A (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ma and Blenis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zoncu et al., 2011</a>). mTOR stimulates general translation in part by inactivating translational inhibitors. mTOR phosphorylates and inactivates the translation repressor eIF4E binding protein (4E-BP) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gingras et al., 1999</a>) allowing efficient formation of the eIF4F complex. In addition, mTOR activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sarbassov et al., 2005</a>). S6K stimulates the helicase eIF4A by activating eIF4B and inhibiting programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), a known eIF4A inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Raught et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Dorrello et al., 2006</a>).

The <i>Drosophila</i> INR 5\u2032 UTRs contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that allows the message to escape 4E-BP inhibition of cap-dependent translation. This mechanism provides a functional coupling of transcription and translation in times of stress that allows amplification of insulin receptor expression (<a href=\"#bib20\">Marr et al., 2007</a>). Because IRES containing transcripts can outcompete cap-dependent transcripts under these conditions their translation is actually stimulated (<a href=\"#bib40\">Svitkin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Marr et al., 2007</a>). This leads to an effective switch of the cellular translation machinery to targets of the IIS pathway. Thus, Foxo targets impose a translational program by activation of genes that repress general translation while simultaneously activating targets that are immune to this translational control. This provides these targets with a competitive advantage allowing them to utilize the translation machinery that is freed by the general inhibition. Here we identify <i>Drosophila</i> Pdcd4 as an additional Foxo target further enhancing the coupling of transcription and translation regulation in the IIS pathway."

In an effort to determine if Foxo binds to the Pdcd4 gene in nutrient stressed animals we reanalyzed the only publically available Foxo ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) dataset (<a href=\"#bib41\">Teleman et al., 2008</a>). These experiments were performed on starved larva. We find Foxo binds the Pdcd4 gene in both the promoter and intronic regions with enrichment values as high as 16-fold over background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To corroborate this finding, we performed ChIP on genomic DNA from a cell line with an inducible Foxo cDNA gene that has been modified so the Foxo protein produced is constitutively active because it is immune to the negative regulation by insulin signaling (Foxo<sup>CA</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Puig et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Gershman et al., 2007</a>). This allows us to induce Foxo under conditions of high nutrient signaling and remove possible crosstalk from upstream signaling pathways. We tested the enrichment of genomic sequences by qPCR using primers to the Pdcd4 promoter region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) compared to a region in the first intron of CG15414, a gene just downstream of 4E-BP. We find Foxo<sup>CA</sup> binds to the promoter region of Pdcd4 at levels comparable to a well-defined direct target, 4E-BP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Junger et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Puig et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Marr et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To determine the effect on mRNA production under these conditions we performed quantitative RT-qPCR on induced cells. We find that the steady-state level of Pdcd4 mRNA is increased about threefold in cells expressing active Foxo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To determine if the effect is due to mRNA stability changes or new transcription we assayed intron-containing pre-mRNAs by RT-qPCR. Since most splicing is co-transcriptional in <i>Drosophila</i> this is a good assay for new RNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Khodor et al., 2011</a>). We find that Pdcd4 pre-mRNA is increased, indicating an increase in transcription of the gene. The increased mRNA also leads to increased protein synthesis as determined by immuno-blot with antibodies directed against <i>Drosophila</i> Pdcd4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This is likely an underestimate of the effect since these experiments are all done under high serum and insulin conditions that should result in the rapid turnover of Pdcd4 protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dorrello et al., 2006</a>)."

Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2005</a>), 4E-BP is induced by paraquat in a Foxo dependent manner. Like 4E-BP, we find that Pdcd4 is induced in response to paraquat in a Foxo dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). To determine if the effect was due to loss of general oxidative stress response or if it is Foxo specific we examined the induction of GstD1, a gene controlled by Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib23\">Misra et al., 2011</a>). We find that GstD1 is still responsive indicating that the effects at Pdcd4 and 4E-BP are Foxo-specific and not due to a loss of responsiveness in the mutant flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These results are consistent with the idea that in addition to controlling the cap-binding complex through 4E-BP, active Foxo can influence eIF4A through activation of the Pdcd4 gene in response to stress. Given that Foxo is activating transcription of the INR gene while Pdcd4 is also active, we hypothesized that since the INR mRNA is translated efficiently under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Marr et al., 2007</a>) it must be at least partially immune to diminished eIF4A activity."

In order to more accurately determine the effects of the protein in question we modified the assay so the production of the dicistronic mRNA is inducible. This allows accumulation of the experimental protein in the cell before the dicistronic mRNA is produced giving a more precise measure of the effects on the activity of the dicistronic message. The levels of expression of the second ORF relative to the first ORF are an indication of the cap-independent translation potential of the insert. To validate this assay we reproduced our previous results with 4E-BP (<a href=\"#bib20\">Marr et al., 2007</a>). As reported previously, expression of 4E-BP stimulates the translation of the second open reading frame in a reporter containing the INR 5\u2032UTR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). Expression of Pdcd4 also stimulates translation of the second ORF dependent on the INR 5\u2032UTR similar to the effects seen with the HCV IRES (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>).

Hippuristanol is a potent translation inhibitor that works in eukaryotes from yeast to human (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lindqvist et al., 2008</a>). Hippuristanol inhibits the ATPase activity and RNA binding of eIF4A (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bordeleau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lindqvist et al., 2008</a>). The small molecule binds to the protein in conserved regions V and VI in eIF4A homologues (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lindqvist et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, the effects on translation can be rescued by addition of either wild-type or mutant forms of eIF4A that are immune to hippuristanol indicating that the effects are highly specific for eIF4A (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bordeleau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lindqvist et al., 2008</a>).

The RNA reporters contain the 5\u2032 UTR from the <i>Drosophila</i> insulin receptor. In addition we include two control RNAs. One control RNA contains a non-specific UTR derived from plasmid sequences. The other RNA contains the IRES from the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., 1992</a>). This IRES does not require eIF4A activity and controls for non-specific effects on the extract (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pestova et al., 1998</a>). Under the experimental conditions, translation of the first control RNA is strongly inhibited by hippuristanol while the reporter containing the HCV IRES is completely resistant to eIF4A inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This small molecule inhibitor exposed a greatly diminished role for eIF4A in the <i>Drosophila</i> INR UTR mediated translation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). At the low and moderate concentrations of hippuristanol, the <i>Drosophila</i> INR UTR reporter retains almost complete activity comparable to the HCV UTR.

To address this, we cloned the 5\u2032 UTR from the longest mRNAs for the mouse insulin receptor (mINR) and the mouse insulin-like growth factor receptor-I (IGFR) and created firefly luciferase reporters under the control of these UTRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

To extend this finding to the mouse system and ensure that our competitive rabbit reticulocyte system was capable of supporting cap-independent translation, we assayed translation of the mINR and IGFR reporters in the presence of excess m7G cap along with our control RNA and the HCV IRES reporters described above (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). While the control RNA is inhibited by excess cap, translation from the 5\u2032 UTR of mINR and IGFR is not only resistant to excess m7G cap but the activity actually increases in the presence of excess m7G cap. This observation is common with UTRs that contain an IRES (<a href=\"#bib40\">Svitkin et al., 2005</a>). The increase in activity for both the mINR and IGFR UTRs exceeded the IRES activity of the HCV UTR.

Our findings highlight a unique characteristic of the insulin receptor and IGF receptor UTRs that differentiates them from other cellular transcripts. In addition to being immune to 4E-BP, these IRESes are resistant to eIF4A inhibition. While viral IRESes are fairly common, cellular IRESes are rare and relatively unexplored. Where it has been explored, most cellular IRESes have a strong requirement for eIF4A (<a href=\"#bib42\">Thoma et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Spriggs et al., 2009a</a>). The INR and IGFR UTRs seem to require neither eIF4E nor eIF4A. In fact, these UTRs have the lowest identified requirement for eIF4F activity of any cellular transcript thus far. In addition, they are immune to two of the most important types of translational control, namely 4E-BP control and eIF4A inhibition. Both of these features make sense given the cellular environment when these mRNAs are to be translated. The conserved resistance to eIF4E and eIF4A inhibition of the insulin receptor transcripts should make them capable of out-competing other cellular transcripts with greater need for eIF4A or eIF4E. Using these exceptional characteristics, the insulin receptor mRNA could out-compete more abundant transcripts under times of stress or when nutrients are limiting and 4E-BP and Pdcd4 are active."

If these targets are to be translated when Foxo is active they should also require mechanisms to escape 4E-BP and Pdcd4 inhibition.

Nuclei were isolated, lysed, and chromatin was sonicated to 500\u20131000 bp in length. Chromatin was incubated with polyclonal sera against full length Foxo. The chromatin/antibody mix was then incubated with protein A beads to isolate Foxo-bound chromatin from the sample. Purified DNA was assayed by qPCR to determine enrichment for genomic sites bound by Foxo. Enrichment is based on signal increase compared to a region of the genome in the first intron of CG15414 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."
