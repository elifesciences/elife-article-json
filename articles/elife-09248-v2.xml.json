Here we report significant progress in this area. We first describe de novo blind  structure predictions of unprecendented accuracy we made for two proteins in large families in the recent CASP11 blind test of protein structure prediction methods by incorporating residue\u2013residue co-evolution information in the Rosetta structure prediction program. We then describe the use of this method to generate structure models for 58 of the 121 large protein families in prokaryotes for which three-dimensional structures are not available. These models, which are posted online for public access, provide structural information for the over 400,000 proteins belonging to the 58 families and suggest hypotheses about mechanism for the subset for which the function is known, and hypotheses about function for the remainder."

Here we report significant progress in this area. We first describe de novo blind  structure predictions of unprecendented accuracy we made for two proteins in large families in the recent CASP11 blind test of protein structure prediction methods by incorporating residue\u2013residue co-evolution information in the Rosetta structure prediction program. We then describe the use of this method to generate structure models for 58 of the 121 large protein families in prokaryotes for which three-dimensional structures are not available. These models, which are posted online for public access, provide structural information for the over 400,000 proteins belonging to the 58 families and suggest hypotheses about mechanism for the subset for which the function is known, and hypotheses about function for the remainder."

It is possible to predict the structure of a protein with high accuracy if previous experiments have revealed the structure of a similar protein.

By identifying these pairs of co-evolving amino acids, it is possible to work out which amino acids are close to each other in the three-dimensional structure of the protein. This information can be used to generate a structural model of a protein using computational methods."

Starting from an extended polypeptide chain, Monte Carlo + Minimization searches through conformations with local structure consistent with the local sequence were carried out, optimizing first a low-resolution energy function favoring hydrophobic burial and backbone hydrogen bonding, and second a detailed all atom energy function describing hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and solvation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Das and Baker, 2008</a>). In the first phase, sampling was carried out in internal coordinates (the backbone torsion angles), and hence, to avoid loss of sampling efficiency by early formation of contacts between residues distant along the sequence, predicted contact information was first added for residues close along the chain and subsequently for residues with increasing sequence separation. The contact information was implemented through residue\u2013residue distance restraints whose strength and shape were functions of the strength of the evolutionary covariance between the residues (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Large numbers of independent trajectories were carried out using the <a href=\"mailto:Rosetta@Home\">Rosetta@Home</a> distributed computing project, and the lowest energy (Rosetta all atom energy plus evolutionary restraint fit) models were recombined and further optimized using a new iterative version (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) of the RosettaCM hybridization protocol (<a href=\"#bib60\">Song et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2014</a>).

Two particularly striking examples are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; the prediction for the complex 256 residue structure of T0806 is 3.6 C\u03b1-RMSD from the crystal structure (2.9 \u00c5 over 223 residues), and the prediction for the 108 residue T0824 is 4.2 C\u03b1-RMSD from the crystal structure (2.7 \u00c5 over 77 residues). The models accurately recapitulate the complex topologies of the proteins. Due to time restraints, the calculations could not be run to convergence during CASP; with additional sampling, the lowest energy model for T0806 has an RMSD of 2.1 \u00c5 over 245 residues to the experimentally determined structure. Both the co-evolution derived contacts and the new iterative hybridization protocol were critical to obtaining higher accuracy models: Rosetta calculations without constraints failed to converge (data not shown), and the ROBETTA server models generated without the hybridization step were considerably less accurate (11.6 vs 3.6 C\u03b1-RMSD for T0806 and 14.0 vs 4.2 C\u03b1-RMSD for T0824)."

As shown in<a href=\"#tbl1\"> Table 1</a>, for the 11 of the 13 proteins for which the structure prediction calculations converged, the RMSD of the predicted structure to the experimentally determined structure over the converged and constrained residues was below 4.0 \u00c5 (the RMSDs over the structurally aligned regions were all below 2.8 \u00c5). Features such as kinked, discontinuous, and re-entrant helices as well as coils within the bilayer that complicate approaches to membrane protein structure prediction that assume the accuracy of a TM helix prediction were all recovered correctly (for example, the re-entrant helices of aquaporin; the power of fragment-based approaches to model such features was noted in <a href=\"#bib44\">Nugent and Jones, 2012</a>)."

The enzyme has two integral membrane subunits (CydA and CydB) with three hemes (heme b595, heme b558, and heme d) that mediate transfer of electrons from quinol to oxygen. Using the co-evolution-guided structure prediction protocol described above, we generated models for the structures of CydA and CydB, and then docked the subunits together using inter-protein predicted contacts as described in <a href=\"#bib45\">Ovchinnikov et al. (2014)</a> to generate a model for the entire TM complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The models of CydA and CydB share the same fold\u2014a duplicated four helix bundle unit\u2014and form a pseudo symmetric heterodimer. Structure comparisons of CydA and CydB to the PDB revealed nearly full-length structural similarity to polysulfide reductase TM domain (PsrC) (PDB: 2VPX), an enzyme complex responsible for the quinone-mediated reduction of polysulfide, and structure comparisons for the four helix bundle unit revealed strong similarities to cyt b561 (PDB: 4O7G). The b595 and b558 heme-binding sites of each CydA four helix bundle have been mapped experimentally by mutagenesis: H19 ligates heme b595, and H186 and M393, heme b558. Strikingly, in our model, these residues are aligned with conserved axial ligands in cyt b561 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Residues ligating heme d have not yet been identified experimentally, but in our model, a third conserved CydA histidine, H126 structurally aligns to a known heme-binding site near the cytoplasmic surface of cyt b561. We hypothesize that this residue ligates heme d, which has been proposed to be on the periplasmic side (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), a location of heme d near the cytoplasm could explain the proton-motive force generated across the membrane. In addition to the heme-ligating residues, mutagenesis studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borisov et al., 2011</a>) have identified residues involved in quinone binding and proton flow. In our model of the structure of CydA, the quinone-binding residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, red spheres) cluster together, and the proton channel residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, blue spheres) cluster together. Two additional conserved residues with no known function (R9 and R448) are near the quinone-binding Q loop on the periplasmic surface. Thus, the CydA model agrees with extensive mutagenesis data and places the cytochrome bd\u2013I complex within the evolutionary context of other TM di-heme cytochromes."

The enzyme is a hetero-tetramer, with two copies of TtdA and two copies of TtdB (<a href=\"#bib54\">Reaney et al., 1993</a>). TtdA is homologous to the N terminus of a class I fumarase, and TtdB, to the C terminus of the fumarase. The structures of TtdA and the fumarase N-terminus have not been determined, but the structure of the fumarase C-terminal domain has been solved (PDB: 2ISB) and is structurally related to the swiveling domain from aconitase enzymes that perform similar chemistry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lauble et al., 1994</a>). The TtdB-like swiveling domain from aconitase (PDB: 1ACO) binds its substrate near the interface of the swiveling domain and another catalytic domain that binds 4Fe-4S. Given the importance of the adjacent catalytic domain as well as the domain interface in aconitase, we predicted the structure of TtdA and assembled it into the hetero-tetramer complex with a homology model of TtdB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In our complex model, three conserved TtdA cysteines (C71, C190, and C277) cluster near the TtdB interface which maybe the 4Fe-4S cluster-binding site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This potential active site also includes a conserved aspartate (D73) that might contribute to catalysis. The conserved TtdB H265 falls on the opposite side of the active site in our model and instead contributes to the active site of the second TtdB chain formed by the tetramer. Thus, our model suggests TtdA/TtdB forms an obligate tetramer that would not have been predicted by co-evolution or conservation alone."

Our predicted SatP structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>) is very similar to that of the proton-gated urea channel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The urea channel assembles into a hexameric ring with each protomer forming a channel through the center of the 6TMH fold. Conserved residues line both the channel and the protomer interface and are important for proton gating and solute selectivity. Assembly of our SatP model into a hexameric ring satisfied predicted contacts not made in the monomer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Residues that have been shown to influence the solute selectivity of SatP (Leu131 and Ala164) (<a href=\"#bib64\">S\u00e1-Pessoa et al., 2013</a>) line the channel pore of our model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Most of the conserved SatP residues line the channel at a similar depth as the constriction sites in UreI and are likely involved in similar gating and selectivity functions as their UreI counterparts. A cluster of conserved residues face the periplasmic surface and align to the periplasmic loop (PL1) in UreI that is thought to plug the channel in a proton-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hommais et al., 2004</a>). The similarity of our model to the SatP fold is not only supported by mutagenesis data but also suggests the functional importance of multimeric assembly not revealed by co-evolution or conservation analysis alone."

FtsW is an integral membrane protein that is thought to transfer lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursors from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, where it interacts with the TM portion of peptidoglycan synthetase FtsI (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fraipont et al., 2011</a>). Using co-evolutionary information for the FtsW family, and between it and FtsI, we generated a model of FtsW in complex with the TM domain of FtsI (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). The FtsW model encompasses 10 TM helices, with the last seven (TMH4-TMH10) adopting a similar topology as TMH4-TMH7 and TMH10-12 of the TM domain of STT3 (PDB: 3WAK) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). STT3 is a dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase that functions in N-glycan biosynthesis, transferring oligosaccharides from the membrane anchor dolichol-diphosphate to asparagine residues of proteins bound for secretion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matsumoto et al., 2013</a>). The FtsW substrate, lipid II, has a membrane anchor similar to that of the STT3 substrate donor: bactoprenol-pyrophosphate conjugated to disaccharide. A conserved DxH motif at the N-terminus of STT3 TMH4 coordinates a divalent metal ion in the active site. Two residues from the corresponding TMH4 of FtsW (R145 and K153) are essential for flippase activity, with the side chain of R145 overlapping the divalent metal in superpositions of the FtsW model with the STT3 structure. Other conserved FtsW residues line this site and probably contribute to function. The conserved FtsW/STT3 TMH core is similar in sequence to the <i>E. coli</i> O-antigen ligase RfaL, and our predicted structure for RfaL is similar in structure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Thus, the structure model of FtsW suggest a potential active site analogous to that of the structurally related STT3 TMH core and unites the family with another bacterial cell wall biogenic enzyme."

The YqfA sequence belongs to a large family of integral membrane proteins, with members in all three kingdoms of life. The eukaryotic members are seven-TM pass receptors for ligands such as prostaglandin and adipoQ (the progesterone-adiponectin receptor (PAQR) was predicted to be bacteriorhodopsin-like by <a href=\"#bib26\">Hopf et al., 2012</a>), while a bacterial member is associated with furfural tolerance through an unknown mechanism. The PAQR receptors belong to a larger superfamily of core seven TM-bound putative hydrolases identified as CREST (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pei et al., 2011a</a>). The CREST superfamily is characterized by conserved motifs at the end of TMH2 (SxxxH), the beginning of TMH3 (D), and the beginning of TMH7 (HxxxH). In the YqfA model, the conserved CREST motifs likely form an active site and are in the same region as the ligand-binding pocket in GPCRs (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). During the preparation of this manuscript, the structure of a homolog of YqfA was released by the PDB; our model of YqfA is very similar to this structure (TMalign score of 0.80; <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12E</a>), while the top hit of HHsearch and SPARKS-X models are not similar (TMalign score of 0.21 and 0.40).

The predicted contacts of YgdD are best accommodated in a homotrimer model (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15A,B</a>). Each YgdD molecule in the homotrimer has four TMHs with left-handed connections between helices 1, 2, 3 as well as between helices 2, 3, 4.

More strikingly, YgdD and MAPEG also exhibit the same overall homotrimer topology, both similar to the core of the heme-copper oxidase catalytic subunit (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pei et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15C,D</a>). Sequence similarity searches of YgdD by HHsearch (<a href=\"#bib55\">Remmert et al., 2012</a>) did not reveal significant hits to MAPEG proteins, but weak HHsearch matches to heme-copper oxidase members were found (e.g., 3mk7, chain A, HHsearch probability score: 41). The sequence alignment between the last two TMHs of YgdD and the last two TMHs of heme-copper oxidase members is consistent with the structural alignment between our predicted YgdD structure and the 3mk7 structure, suggesting that YgdD is evolutionarily related to heme-copper oxidases."

Each of these families have thousands of members (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, column 2), hence these models have quite broad impact. The analyses of a small subset of these structures provided here only begins to uncover the wealth of information relating to function they contain. In addition to the new structure-based interpretation of existing sequence conservation and mutational data the models enable, they illustrate the complex transformations occurring in membrane protein evolution: for example, the changes in YeiH and RarD structural element connectivity compared to previously known structures. With the advent of sensitive sequence profile\u2013profile comparison methods, much of protein structure modeling has been reduced to sequence alignment, and indeed for functional interpretation often much can be learned simply by draping the query sequence on a homologous structure; in contrast, as illustrated in the examples above, in the co-evolution-guided de novo structure prediction case, structure modeling is critical to functional insight."

The importance of this approach to structural biology over the next decade will depend on the balance between two opposing trends: as more organisms are sequenced, the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling will increase, but as more structures are determined, there are fewer families for which accurate models cannot be produced by reliable comparative modeling methods. An increase in the number of eukaryotes sequenced\u2014for example, by projects such as the recent Tara Ocean expedition (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bork et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sunagawa et al., 2015</a>)\u2014would make it possible to accurately model a large number of eukaryote-specific protein families of considerable biological interest.

For proteins not belonging to sufficiently large or diverse families but for which functional selections have been developed, it should be possible to develop experimental sequence covariation data sets by library generation, functional selection, and next generation sequencing. Significant resources were invested in the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI), with the initial goal \u2018to make the three-dimensional, atomic-level structures of most proteins easily obtainable from knowledge of their corresponding DNA sequences (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burley et al., 2008</a>)\u2019.

Each protein from these proteomes was scanned against the PDB using HHsearch (-ssm 0, from HHsuite v. 2.0.15; [<a href=\"#bib55\">Remmert et al., 2012</a>]) to identify proteins with no homologs of known structures (e-value of the top hit &gt;1). We used two versions of the PDB database, one from 01 January, 2012 and one from 31 January, 2015. For the subset that had no hits in 2015, a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was generated using Jackhmmer (-E 1E-20 -N 8, [<a href=\"#bib15\">Eddy, 2009</a>]) and the uniref90 database (<a href=\"#bib62\">Suzek et al., 2007</a>) from January, 2015. The alignments were filtered using HHfilter (-id 90 -cov 75), and positions that had more than 75% gaps were removed. To reduce redundancy, we constructed hidden Markov models (HMMs) using HHmake from each MSA and clustered the HMMs based on HH\u0394 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kamisetty et al., 2013</a>), a measure of HMM\u2013HMM similarity. Families were assigned to the same cluster if the HH\u0394 was less than 0.5. The shortest <i>E. coli</i> protein was selected in each cluster; if no <i>E. coli</i> protein was in the cluster, a representative from <i>B. subtilis</i>, <i>H. salinrum</i>, or <i>S. solfataricus</i> was selected. Families for which the (number of sequences)/(length of representative protein) were greater than four were selected for modeling as described below. If the GREMLIN-predicted contacts (see below) were sparse and primarily between residues close along the linear sequence, the alignment was regenerated at an e-value 1E-40 cutoff, and the GREMLIN calculation repeated. If this resulted in too few sequences, the family was discarded (this eliminated six families)."

To account for these dependencies, we constructed a model (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16</a>) that estimates the probability of being in contact using a pdb30 data set from PISCES (resolution limited to 2.5A or better, from 04 January, 2014; [<a href=\"#bib70\">Wang and Dunbrack, 2003</a>]), with length of at least 100 residues.

The remaining 7047 pdb chains with less than 10L sequences were saved as a test set (<a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16B</a>, <a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17</a>). The top 3L/2 scores of residue pairs with sequence separation 3 or greater were normalized by rescaling the range so that the minimal value is 0.5 and average value is 1.0. Contact prediction accuracy was found to be a simple function of the residue\u2013residue normalized coupling value, the number of sequences, the length (<a href=\"#fig16s1\">Figure 16\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and the sequence separation as shown in <a href=\"#fig16\">Figure 16</a>.

Distance restraints were implemented as sigmoidal functions of the form: restraint(d) = weight(1 + exp(\u2212slope(d \u2212 cutoff)) + intercept), where d is the distance between the constrained C\u03b2 atoms (C\u03b1 in the case of glycine), the distance cutoffs and slopes are amino acid pair specific (SI Table 3 in <a href=\"#bib31\">Kamisetty et al., 2013</a>), and the weight is the normalized Gremlin score multiplied by three to give the contact restraints roughly the same total dynamic range as the Rosetta energy. These distance restraints supplement the Rosetta energy function; the combination ensures the sampling of physically realistic structures consistent with the contact predictions. For TM proteins, the Rosetta energy function was modified to reflect the exposure of non-polar residues in the membrane-spanning regions: the lazaridis-karplus solvation energy term weight was set to zero (fa_sol = 0.00), and to compensate for the short range repulsion implicit in the solvation model, the Lennard-Jones repulsive and attractive terms were given equal weights. We found this simple approach was equally effective and considerably less computationally intensive than the RosettaMembrane approach, which requires estimating the TM region for energy evaluation."

For the benchmark set, fragments database from 2011 was used; for aquaporin, the fragments were filtered to remove any homologs with e-value &lt; 1. After the generation of fragments for aquaporin, we examined the PDB files that contributed the most to the fragment set and verified that they did not contain aquaporin-like structures. The models generated by Rosetta ab initio were refined with an iterative version of the RosettaCM (<a href=\"#bib60\">Song et al., 2013</a>) hybridization protocol used to refine models generated with contact information in CASP10 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). In each iteration, 20 models are produced by recombination and minimization. In addition to the recombination of secondary structure chunks in the input models, fragment insertion was allowed in all positions. Iterations were continued until the procedure converged. For a 200-residue protein, the average runtime to produce a single model is about 30 min for RosettaAB and about 20 min for RosettaCM."

If models converged over substructures (average pairwise TMscore between 0.5 and 0.8), the top 10 models were first expanded by recombination to a population of 1000 structures, and the top five models were input into the RosettaCM hybridization protocol. If the Rosetta ab initio calculations did not converge (average pairwise TMscore &lt;0.5), we carried out an additional 10,000 Rosetta ab initio trajectories; if the top models did not converge, we considered the structure of the protein not accurately predictable using our approach. 15 of the 121 families were eliminated at this stage.

The predictions rely on a physical model (Rosetta conformational search) guided by residue\u2013residue contacts derived from a large number of protein sequences. The latter has been an important source of progress in the field of protein structure prediction in recent years. Using evolutionary data in conjunction with a well-calibrated physical model is a more recent development. This manuscript reports atomic-details structural models of 58 proteins, each represents a large prokaryotic protein family of no 3D structures available. While the accuracy of these models will be examined against the crystal structures when they are available, there are reasons to feel optimistic given the impressive performance of the program in the CASP11 blind test. Importantly, these models are available online and some interesting lessons will be learned regardless of the outcome."

To some extent, structure prediction can supplement this. Structures of query proteins can be predicted if suitable templates can be detected. However, this approach is limited by our current ability to assign templates to the queries. This situation is changing now because of two major breakthroughs. First, protein sequence data are becoming available at ever increasing rate. With this data there are now hundreds and thousands of homologues for many proteins. With this, we can think of large protein families, rather than single proteins. The second breakthrough is the emergence of new algorithms for accurate detection of evolutionary couplings between pair of amino acids in large multiple alignment of homologues, and the ability to translate these into distance restraints on the relative locations of the amino acid pair in the 3D protein structure. The premise here is that the detected evolutionary coupling (coevolution, compensatory mutations) results from evolutionary pressure, and is therefore indicative of direct contact."

Of course the methodology is different here, but additional discussion of previous work along this line will help place the current work in an historical context. There have been structural predictions for some membrane proteins this paper discussed (e.g. adiponectin receptor and YeiH transporters). Briefly discussing these previous predictions and comparing them with the predictions by Rosetta-GREMLIN is needed."

It is necessary to directly compare the accuracy of Rosetta-GREMLIN with other leading methods, particularly EVFOLD. With such comparisons, the extent of progress in terms of prediction accuracy brought by this new method will be more clear and the authors' claims of unprecedented accuracy can be measured in specific metrics (e.g. Ca RMSD or TM score) and calibrated appropriately</i>."

However, we appreciate the question of reviewer II about how much the increased computer time required for Rosetta structure predictions increases model accuracy, and more generally, the need for a more thorough comparison to existing methods, in particular EVFOLD. We have added to the manuscript a table comparing the Rosetta-GREMLIN method to the other methods for both the CASP targets and the membrane protein benchmark. For the CASP targets, we compare to the results of Jones who made submissions for the same targets for CASP. For EVFOLD, we used the excellent EVFOLD web server since EVFOLD did not officially participate in CASP11. For the membrane protein set, we do not compare to the benchmark/results of the previously published Evfold paper, as it would be unfair, given there were far less available sequences then and a less accurate contact prediction method (mfDCA) was used. For the comparison in the paper, the alignments we used were provided as input to the Evfold-webserver, and a contact prediction method very similar to GREMLIN (PLM) was selected. The EVFOLD web server returns 50 models, we computed the CA RMSD and GDT-TS for each of them, and selected the best one. The table compares this \u201cbest out of 50\u201d selection to the single Rosetta-GREMLIN model chosen without knowledge of the correct structure as described in the text. We emphasize in the text that while the Rosetta models are more accurate, the EVFOLD models require orders of magnitude less computing time."

(Cell, 2012), which reported structure predictions, through exploiting evolutions covariance, for a relative larger number of membrane proteins without experimentally resolved structures. Of course the methodology is different here, but additional discussion of previous work along this line will help place the current work in an historical context. There have been structural predictions for some membrane proteins this paper discussed (e.g. adiponectin receptor and YeiH transporters). Briefly discussing these previous predictions and comparing them with the predictions by Rosetta-GREMLIN is needed</i>."
