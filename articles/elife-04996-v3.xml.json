                    "text": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a muscular dystrophy caused by inefficient epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array and somatic expression of the <i>DUX4</i> retrogene. DUX4 is a double homeobox transcription factor that is normally expressed in the testis and causes apoptosis and FSHD when misexpressed in skeletal muscle. The mechanism(s) of DUX4 toxicity in muscle is incompletely understood. We report that DUX4-triggered proteolytic degradation of UPF1, a central component of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) machinery, is associated with profound NMD inhibition, resulting in global accumulation of RNAs normally degraded as NMD substrates. DUX4 mRNA is itself degraded by NMD, such that inhibition of NMD by DUX4 protein stabilizes DUX4 mRNA through a double-negative feedback loop in FSHD muscle cells. This feedback loop illustrates an unexpected mode of autoregulatory behavior of a transcription factor, is consistent with \u2018bursts\u2019 of <i>DUX4</i> expression in FSHD muscle, and has implications for FSHD pathogenesis."

DUX4 is a double homeobox transcription factor that is normally expressed in the testis and causes apoptosis and FSHD when misexpressed in skeletal muscle. The mechanism(s) of DUX4 toxicity in muscle is incompletely understood. We report that DUX4-triggered proteolytic degradation of UPF1, a central component of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) machinery, is associated with profound NMD inhibition, resulting in global accumulation of RNAs normally degraded as NMD substrates. DUX4 mRNA is itself degraded by NMD, such that inhibition of NMD by DUX4 protein stabilizes DUX4 mRNA through a double-negative feedback loop in FSHD muscle cells. This feedback loop illustrates an unexpected mode of autoregulatory behavior of a transcription factor, is consistent with \u2018bursts\u2019 of <i>DUX4</i> expression in FSHD muscle, and has implications for FSHD pathogenesis."

It is unclear whether NMD-mediated autoregulation is intrinsic to normal DUX4 function or instead an abnormal consequence of inappropriate DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. However, it is interesting to consider that this mechanism might contribute to the spreading of <i>DUX4</i> expression between adjacent nuclei in a muscle fiber. Because muscle fibers contain arrays of closely spaced nuclei, the expression of DUX4 mRNA from one nucleus will distribute protein to the surrounding nuclei and induce a region of NMD inhibition.

In the absence of a direct mechanistic link between UPF1 degradation and NMD inhibition, we were unable to determine whether insufficient UPF1 protein levels are primarily responsible for DUX4-induced NMD inhibition or instead merely one of the several contributing factors. Nonetheless, as we are unaware of other reports of physiological stimuli triggering rapid UPF1 protein degradation, our data suggest that UPF1 proteolysis constitutes a potential new regulator of cellular NMD efficiency. DUX4 may prove a useful system to gain insight into the biological relevance of this mechanism for altering NMD efficiency. We previously observed that many of the most up-regulated genes following DUX4 expression in normal myoblasts are involved in the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, including numerous E3 ubiquitin ligases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Geng et al., 2012</a>).

The accumulation of abnormal RNAs may cause direct or indirect toxic effects in muscle cells due to intrinsic toxicity of abnormal RNAs or a stress response to the production of abnormal proteins. FSHD muscle is frequently characterized by a T-cell infiltrate (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arahata et al., 1995</a>), and it is possible that stabilized NMD substrates encode novel peptides with antigenic potential, contributing to an immune response (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pastor et al., 2010</a>). Production of antigenic peptides could potentially enable even a small fraction of DUX4+ nuclei to induce widespread pathology within a muscle fiber. Directly detecting or measuring DUX4-induced NMD inhibition in FSHD muscle biopsies or in bulk populations of cultured FSHD muscle cells is not feasible due to the low fraction of DUX4+ nuclei present at any given time in the absence of ectopic <i>DUX4</i> expression. With DUX4+ nuclei constituting only 0.3% of the bulk population of cultured FSHD muscle cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), changes in the ratios of NMD and non-NMD isoforms in these DUX4+ nuclei are swamped by the normal levels expressed by the vast majority of DUX4\u2212 nuclei.

Previous work had shown that mis-expression in skeletal muscle of the double homeobox transcription factor <i>DUX4</i> causes FSHD. However, little was known about the pathways by which <i>DUX4</i> expression in muscle cells leads to the muscle damage observed in FSHD. Here, the authors show that ectopic expression of <i>DUX4</i> in immortalized and primary myoblast cell lines results in increased levels of transcripts that are known or predicted to be targets of NMD, suggesting an overall reduction of NMD activity. The authors speculate that this reduced NMD activity might lead to the expression of aberrant peptides in muscles that could either be toxic or activate an immune response against the muscle cells. The authors further show that concomitant with <i>DUX4</i> expression the abundance of UPF1 protein is reduced (but not the mRNA). Since treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented the <i>DUX</i>4-induced UPF1 protein reduction, while MG132 had no effect on UPF1 abundance in cells that did not express <i>DUX4</i>, the authors concluded that <i>DUX4</i> expression in muscle cells causes the proteasome-mediated degradation of UPF1."

They go on the show that the <i>DUX4</i> mRNA is indeed targeted by NMD and that its 3' UTR is sufficient to induce NMD of a reporter gene. Together with the first part of the data, this results provide a possible explanation how occasional bursts of <i>DUX4</i> transcription can trigger and enhance <i>DUX4</i> mis-expression in these myoblast regions by an autoregulatory feedback loop that gradually inactivates NMD in the surrounding nuclei: <i>DUX4</i>-induced UPF1 degradation lowers NMD activity, which in turn leads to more <i>DUX4</i> mRNA and hence protein and thus further downregulation of NMD. This is an attractive model, and the data for the feedback loop between <i>DUX4</i> expression and NMD is compelling."
