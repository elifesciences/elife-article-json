Here we show that after ablation of <i>Sox9</i> in Sertoli cells of adult, fertile <i>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming occurs and Sertoli cells transdifferentiate into granulosa-like cells. The process of testis regression culminates in complete degeneration of the seminiferous tubules, which become acellular, empty spaces among the extant Leydig cells. DMRT1 protein only remains in non-mutant cells, showing that SOX9/8 maintain <i>Dmrt1</i> expression in the adult testis. Also, <i>Sox9/8</i> warrant testis integrity by controlling the expression of structural proteins and protecting Sertoli cells from early apoptosis. Concluding, this study shows that, in addition to its crucial role in testis development<i>, Sox9</i>, together with <i>Sox8</i> and coordinately with <i>Dmrt1</i>, also controls adult testis maintenance."

Here we show that after ablation of <i>Sox9</i> in Sertoli cells of adult, fertile <i>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming occurs and Sertoli cells transdifferentiate into granulosa-like cells. The process of testis regression culminates in complete degeneration of the seminiferous tubules, which become acellular, empty spaces among the extant Leydig cells. DMRT1 protein only remains in non-mutant cells, showing that SOX9/8 maintain <i>Dmrt1</i> expression in the adult testis. Also, <i>Sox9/8</i> warrant testis integrity by controlling the expression of structural proteins and protecting Sertoli cells from early apoptosis. Concluding, this study shows that, in addition to its crucial role in testis development<i>, Sox9</i>, together with <i>Sox8</i> and coordinately with <i>Dmrt1</i>, also controls adult testis maintenance."

                        "text": "<i>Sox</i> genes encode an important group of transcription factors with relevant roles in many aspects of pre- and post-natal development of vertebrates and other animal taxa. There are 20 <i>Sox</i> genes in vertebrates, which are classified into 9 groups. <i>Sox8, Sox9,</i> and <i>Sox10 (SoxE</i> group) are involved in many developmental processes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">Lefebvre et al., 2007</a>). All three <i>SoxE</i> genes are expressed during testis development, <i>Sox9</i> being essential for testis determination and <i>Sox9/Sox8</i> necessary for subsequent embryonic differentiation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chaboissier, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">Barrionuevo et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</a>). <i>Sox10</i> can substitute for <i>Sox9</i> during testis determination (<a href=\"#bib36\">Polanco et al., 2010</a>). Undifferentiated gonads have the inherent potential to develop into two completely different organs, either as testes or as ovaries. The decision as to which fate to follow depends on the presence/absence of sex-specific factors. In the male, the Y-linked, mammalian sex-determining factor, <i>SRY</i>, upregulates <i>SOX9</i> which triggers testis differentiation, whereas in the female, the WNT/\u03b2 -catenin signaling pathway becomes active and induces ovarian development (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2008</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib52\">Svingen and Koopman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2013</a>). Both pathways antagonize each other: the loss of either <i>SRY or SOX9</i> leads to the formation of XY ovaries (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berta et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Foster et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wagner et al., 1994</a>) whereas the absence of WNT-signaling molecules such as WNT4 or RSPO1 causes XX sex reversal (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vainio et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Parma et al., 2006</a>). Similarly, gain-of-function experiments confirmed this antagonism, as either upregulation of the testis promoting genes <i>Sox9</i> or <i>Dmrt1</i> in the XX bipotential gonad (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bishop et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vidal et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>) or ectopic activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway in the XY bipotential gonad (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maatouk et al., 2008</a>) leads to XX and XY sex reversal, respectively. Furthermore, Sertoli cell-specific conditional inactivation of <i>Sox9</i> on a <i>Sox8<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>background at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), two days after the sex determination stage, leads to <i>Dmrt1</i> downregulation with upregulation of the ovarian-specific genes <i>Wnt4, Rspo1</i> and <i>Foxl2</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Georg et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, Sertoli cell-specific ablation of <i>Dmrt1</i> at the same stage (E13.5) results in ectopic expression of <i>Foxl2</i> by postnatal day 14 (P14) and to <i>Sox9</i> downregulation by P28, including male-to-female genetic reprogramming, as revealed by mRNA profiling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matson et al., 2011a</a>). Again, gain-of-function experiments confirmed the existence of sexual antagonism after the sex determination period, as conditional stabilization of <i>\u03b2-catenin</i> in differentiated embryonic Sertoli cells (E13.5, <i>Amh-Cre</i>) resulted in testis cord disruption (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chang et al., 2008</a>). The male-vs-female genetic antagonism also persists in the adult ovary. The finding that in adult fertile females granulosa cells transdifferentiate into Sertoli-like cells after <i>Foxl2</i> ablation revealed that terminally differentiated female somatic cells require permanent repression of the male-promoting factors to maintain correct identity and function (<a href=\"#bib54\">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, transgenic expression of <i>Dmrt1</i> in the adult ovary silenced <i>Foxl2</i> and transdifferentiated granulosa cells into Sertoli-like, <i>Sox9</i>-expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lindeman et al., 2015</a>)."

In addition to cells with a Sertoli cell morphology expressing both SOX9 and FOXL2, some cells with typical granulosa cell features were also observed, including the absence of SOX9 and the presence of FOXL2. However, Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation was not unambiguously documented, as the authors used an inducible ubiquitous promoter (<i>UBC-CreERT2</i>) for <i>Dmrt1</i> ablation in adult Sertoli cells and the possible existence of genetic reprogramming was not investigated as no mRNA profiling was performed in adult mutant testes."

We show that <i>Sox9/8</i> Sertoli cell-specific knockout (SC-DKO) testes undergo testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming and Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation. The process is retinoic acid (RA)-mediated and occurs as a consequence of <i>Dmrt1</i> downregulation. SOX9/8 are necessary to maintain <i>Dmrt1</i> expression and thus to prevent <i>Foxl2</i> expression in the adult testis. Furthermore, double mutant testes exhibited complete degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and increased apoptosis, indicating that SOX9/8 are continually required for the maintenance of testis integrityy."

                                "text": "To investigate the function of <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Sox8</i> in the adult testis, we induced the Sertoli cell-specific ablation of <i>Sox9</i> in adult <i>Sox8</i> null mutant mice using the tamoxifen (TX)-inducible <i>Cre-loxP</i> mutagenesis system. We used two different <i>CreERT2</i> mouse lines, a <i>Wt1</i> knock-in line (<i>Wt1-CreERT2;</i> <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhou et al, 2008</a>), and a <i>Sox9</i> BAC-transgenic line (<i>Sox9-CreERT2;</i> <a href=\"#bib23\">Kopp et al, 2011</a>). To check the Cre recombination efficiency, we introduced the R26R-EYFP allele in both <i>Sox9-CreERT2</i> and <i>Wt1-CreERT2</i> double homozygous <i>Sox9/8</i> knockout (DKO) mutants. <i>Sox8/9</i> DKO mice fed with a TX-supplemented diet for a maximun of 30 days starting at P60 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) showed EYFP expression in a reduced number of Sertoli cells already 10 days after the beginning of TX administration (10 datx, P70) in the two <i>CreERT2</i> lines. The number of EYFP<sup>+</sup> Sertoli cells increased in both lines at later time-points, the <i>Sox9-CreERT2\u00a0</i>line showing always a higher number of positive cells than the <i>Wt1-CreERT2</i> line. From P150 (90 datx) on, the EYFP signal occupied the whole area of the seminiferous tubule section (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ba</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure\u00a01\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, the fact that the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells is very large and complex in shape, together with the severe shrinkage that <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO seminiferous tubules have undergone by this time, made it very difficult to identify individual EYFP<sup>+</sup> cells in these testes. Hence we performed immunofluorescence for SOX9 and counted the number of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells per transversal testis cord section. At P90 (30 datx) all seminiferous tubules still contained many positive cells, but the number was clearly reduced by P120 (60 datx) and even more by P150 (90 datx), when some testis cords were completely devoid of SOX9<sup>+</sup>cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Bb\u2013c</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure\u00a01 \u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). At this later stage, the number of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells per seminiferous tubule cross section decreased to 15.39 \u00b1 3.36 (37% reduction) in the testes of the <i>Wt1-CreERT2; Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox8<sup>-/-</sup> </i>[<i>Sox9/8</i> DKO (<i>Wt1</i>)] mice and to 7.49 \u00b1 3.61 (69% reduction) in those of the <i>Sox9-CreERT2; Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox8<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>[<i>Sox9/8</i> DKO (<i>Sox9</i>)] mice, when compared to controls (24.31 \u00b1 2.94) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Bd</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The fact that the number of recombinant Sertoli cells lacking <i>Sox9</i> in these mutant mice continues decreasing for several weeks after the end of the period of TX administration (30 days) suggests that many newly recombined cells appear after that time (persistence of TX in the body) and that perhaps either the <i>Sox9</i> transcript or the protein, or both, are very stable in adult Sertoli cells, so that the gene product may remain for days or weeks in the cell after the gene ablation event. We also found that the reduction of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells varied among testis cords and among animals. We selected the most affected regions of the most affected individuals for further analyses."

Mice were fed with a TX-supplemented diet during one month, between P60 (0 datx) and P90 (30 datx). After this period, mice were fed with a normal diet. The main stages studied in this work are depicted. (<b>B</b>)\u00a0Analysis of the Cre-recombination efficiency in <i>Sox9/8</i> DKO (<i>Sox9</i>) mice at p150 (90 datx). (a) EYFP is widely expressed in SC-DKO testis cords. At the same stage, the number of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells in the control (<i>Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i>) (b) is clearly higher than in the mutant (c). (d) Comparisons of the mean number of SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells per transversal\u00a0testis tubule section in control (<i>Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i>) and mutant testes. All pairwise comparisons provided statistically significant differences (two tail test, p&lt;0.001 in all cases). (<b>C</b>) Time-course of testis regression in <i>Sox9/8</i> DKO (<i>Sox9</i>) mice.

(2008)</a> reported a <i>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse line in which a progressive deregulation of spermatogenesis occurred and where male mice became sterile by P150. In contrast, our <i>Sox8</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sock et al., 2001</a>) do not show such a severe testicular phenotype and males are normally fertile even at P180. At the histological level, our <i>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice appeared normal until P120, but showed signs of germ cell desquamation (sloughing) afterwards (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4a\u2013f</a>). Genetic background differences between the two <i>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> lines may explain these phenotypic discrepancies. TX-treated controls were similar to untreated males, except between P80 (20 datx) and P120 (60 datx) and mainly at P90 (30 datx), when they showed some degenerating seminiferous tubules, but recovered afterwards (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ca\u2013f</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4a\u2013l</a>). Testes in <i>Sox9/8</i> DKO (<i>Sox9</i>)\u00a0mice were similar to the TX-treated controls at P70 (10 datx) except for a few testis tubules with enlarged lumen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Cg</a>). At P80 (20datx), only few seminiferous tubules showed signs of degeneration (shrinkage and germ cell depletion), whereas this was more frequent by P90 (30 datx). In many cases, Sertoli cell-only tubules were visible (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ch,i</a>). By P120 (60 datx), tubules had become solid testis cords whose diameter appeared even more reduced at P150 (90 datx) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Cj,k</a>). While some mice continued to exhibit this phenotype at P180 (120 datx), a subset of mice in this group was more affected. In these latter mice Sertoli and germ cells had disappeared completely (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Cl</a>). At later time points, all mice showed this severe testicular phenotype. This progressive degeneration of the testicular phenotype in <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO mice was evident when we analyzed the relative abundance of the most relevant testicular morphological features between P70 (10 datx) and P180 (120 datx) (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In contrast, Leydig cells appeared morphologically normal in mutant testes. <i>Sox9/8</i> DKO (<i>Wt1</i>)\u00a0mice exhibited a similar testicular phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4m\u2013r</a>). These results show that <i>Sox8</i> and <i>Sox9</i> alleles act redundantly in adult Sertoli cells and are necessary to maintain the integrity of the seminiferous tubules of functional testes."

                                "text": "To better define the mutant phenotype, we next studied the expression of several somatic and germ cell markers. Laminin, a principal component of the basement membrane (<a href=\"#bib40\">Richardson et al., 1995</a>) persisted in both P150 (90 datx) and P180 (120 datx) testes of SC-DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Db,c</a>). <i>Alpha smooth muscle actin</i> (<i>Acta2</i>) expressed by both peritubular myoid (PM) cells and arterialmuscle fibers was detected in the testes of both TX-treated controls and P150 (90 datx) SC-DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Dd,e</a>). In contrast, at P180 (120 datx), strong arterial ACTA2 signal persisted but that of PM cells was almost undetectable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Df</a>). This shows that acellular cords in severely affected SC-DKO testes have lost not only Sertoli and germ cells, but also PM cells. Claudin11 is a principal component of tight junctions, the main junctional structures forming the blood-testis barrier (BTB). <i>Cldn11</i> (the claudin11 gene) expression was similar between controls and double mutants before P150 (90 datx) (not shown), but it was severely reduced by P150 (90 datx) and completely absent in P180 (120 datx) <i>Sox9/8</i> mutant testes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Dg\u2013i</a>), indicating that the BTB is not functional in these testes. To proof this assumption, we tested the permeability of the BTB of P120 (60 datx) mice with a biotin tracer experiment revealing that control testes had a functional BTB, whereas that of the mutant testes had become permeable (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). We also performed immunofluorescence for both PCNA, which is expressed in mitotic spermatogonia as well as in zygotene and early pachytene, but not leptotene spermatocytes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chapman and Wolgemuth, 1994</a>), and DMC1, a meiotic recombination protein marking zygotene-pachytene spermatocytes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yoshida et al., 1998</a>). At P60 (30 datx), most mutant seminiferous tubules exhibited a clear reduction of spermatogenic activity and some spermatocytes were abnormally located in the inner region\u00a0of the tubules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Dk</a>) and not at the periphery, as seen in TX-treated control testes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Dj</a>). In P120 (60 datx) testes, spermatocytes were scarce and only proliferating spermatogonia were seen in most testis tubules (not shown), while at P150 (90 datx), both spermatogonia and spermatocytes had disappeared in most tubules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Dl</a>). These results indicate that spermatogenesis becomes disrupted in testes with Sertoli cells deficient for both <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Sox8</i>. Unlike other somatic cells, Leydig cells appear not to be seriously affected in testes from <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO mice. These cells do not transdifferentiate into theca cells, as they never express <i>Foxl2</i> (as theca cells do; not shown), and maintain the steroidogenic function for a long time after <i>Sox9</i> ablation, as deduced from the expression of P450scc, a cytochrome involved in the synthesis of testosterone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Dm,n</a>). Consistently, the testosterone-producing enzyme <i>HSD17b3</i> and the marker for adult functional Leydig cells <i>Insl3</i> are expressed at high levels in the mutant testes (<a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>)."

Contrarily, <i>Foxl2</i> is upregulated when <i>Sox9</i> is ablated in embryonic Sertoli cells of <i>Sox8</i> null mutants after the sex-determination stage (<a href=\"#bib19\">Georg et al., 2012</a>). To test whether a similar phenomenon took place in our <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO mice, we carried out immunofluorescence for FOXL2. At P90 (30 datx), FOXL2 protein was almost completely absent from mutant testes. However, by P105 (45 datx), positive cells were present in almost all testis cords, and by P150 (90 datx), the most severely affected mice showed many FOXL2-positive cells within almost all testis cords (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results show that transdifferentiation also occurs in adult <i>Sox9/8</i> DKO Sertoli cells. Accordingly, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of P150 untreated control testis, P150 (90 datx) control and mutant testis and control ovary. Our results show that SC-DKO testes exhibit a striking feminization of the testicular transcriptome. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows a Log<sub>2</sub>-fold-change heat map including the 12,380 genes detected to have significant differential expression between the five sample conditions (the complete list of genes with differential expression is shown in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). With the exception of a few gene clusters, most genes in mutant testes adopted an ovary-like expression pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Cluster analyses of all genes, both by replicates and by conditions, showed that mutants are clustered together, with no clear distinction between <i>Sox9-CreER</i> and <i>Wt1-CreER</i> lines (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Similarly, pairwise gene sets with significant differential expression at \u03b1\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05 demonstrated that the number of differentially expressed genes is higher when mutants were compared with testis controls than when compared with ovary (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Accordingly, the distance map is higher between mutant and control testis than between mutant testis and ovary (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). The same results were obtained when comparing isoforms, transcription start sites or coding DNA sequences (not shown). Expression heat maps for selected 39 ovarian somatic cell-specific genes and 33 oocyte-specific genes selected using bioGPS (biogps.gnf.org) revealed that the cell reprogramming observed in the SC-DKO testes only affects somatic cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Notably, bar plots for six genes known to be adult granulosa cell markers showed that these genes were upregulated in the mutant Sertoli cells, revealing an ovary-like expression pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In addition, within the seminiferous cords of SC-DKO testes we found a few FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells expressing the enzyme aromatase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This is evidence that, in addition to <i>Foxl2</i>, other genes normally expressed by granulosa cells are also transcribed and translated in <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO testes."

Several pieces of evidence show that FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells in our mutant testes originate from <i>Sox9/8</i> null Sertoli cells. The two gene promoters we used to drive <i>Cre</i> expression (<i>Sox9</i> and <i>Wt1</i>) are Sertoli cell-specific in the testis, indicating that transdifferentiation originates directly from this cell type. Importantly, we found that FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells always located inside testis cords with strong expression of the Cre-recombination reporter EYFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We also analyzed the expression of WT1, a Sertoli cell marker whose expression is maintained after <i>Sox9/8</i> ablation in embryonic mouse Sertoli cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</a>), and that it is co-expressed with FOXL2 in granulosa cells of immature, but not mature, follicles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chun et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ce</a>). At P90 (30 datx) we observed many WT1<sup>+</sup> Sertoli cells that have already lost SOX9 (green cells, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bb</a>). The number of WT1<sup>+</sup> SOX9<sup>-</sup> cells decreased by P150 (90 datx) <a href=\"#fig3\">(Figure 3Bc</a>), indicating that recombined Sertoli cells were being lost. This decrease in the number of WT1<sup>+</sup> SOX9<sup>-</sup> Sertoli cells coincides with an increase in the number of FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells which either retain weak WT1-staining or are WT1<sup>-</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting that FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells originate from cells previously expressing WT1, that is Sertoli cells. Altogether, these results indicate that <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO\u00a0testes experience a cell-autonomous Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation which triggers the observed testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming in these gonads."

                                "text": "Since <i>Sox9</i> is upregulated after <i>Foxl2</i> ablation in adult granulosa cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</a>) and downregulated after <i>Dmrt1</i> ablation in embryonic Sertoli cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matson et al., 2011a</a>), we investigated the expression pattern of these two genes in the testes of the <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO mutants. We found that cells coexpressing SOX9 and FOXL2 were rare at any stage analyzed [12 out of 203 FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed SOX9 at P120 (60 datx)] (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that <i>Foxl2</i> upregulation requires previous elimination of both SOXE proteins. Next, we examined the expression of both <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Dmrt1</i> in <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO testes. As <i>Dmrt1</i> is expressed in both Sertoli cells and spermatogonia of adult testes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raymond et al., 2000</a>), we used a third marker, PCNA, that labels spermatogonia as well as zygotene and early pachytene spermatocytes. Whereas all Sertoli cells in control testes showed strong staining for both DMRT1 and SOX9 (SS, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Ba</a>), mutant Sertoli cells showed varying degrees of both SOX9 and DMRT1 staining intensity, although they normally paralleled each other in intensity. Therefore Sertoli cells with a weak staining for both DMRT1 and SOX9 (WS) were also visible in these testes. Consistent with this, we found a very reduced number of cells expressing only DMRT1 at P90 (30 datx) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Bb\u2013d</a>, red cells (arrow); SOX9<sup>-</sup> DMRT1<sup>+</sup> PCNA<sup>-</sup>) and almost none at P120 (60 datx) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Be\u2013g</a>). Furthermore, in P150 (90 datx) testes, which are almost devoid of germ cells, DMRT1 immunoreactivity was almost exclusively restricted to SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Double WT1-DMRT1 staining confirmed that as early as at P90 (30 datx) many WT1<sup>+</sup> cells\u00a0(Sertoli cells) have already lost DMRT1 expression (green cells in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Cb</a>), showing that <i>Dmrt1</i> is downregulated after <i>Sox9</i> ablation and before <i>Wt1</i> downregulation occurs in SC-DKO testes. In addition, as observed for SOX9 and FOXL2 (see above), DMRT1 and FOXL2 only colocalize in a reduced number of cells in the testes of our <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO mice [16 out of 127 FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed DMRT1 at P120 (60 datx)] (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Overall, these findings support the notion that SOX9 and SOX8 are necessary for the maintenance of <i>Dmrt1</i> expression in adult Sertoli cells and that these testis-promoting factors negatively regulate <i>Foxl2</i>."

This finding suggests that both <i>Dmrt1</i> and <i>Sox9/8</i> act in the same pathway, although the possibility also exists that this coincidence between both gene expression patterns could be a secondary effect of the change in relative numbers of cell types in the SC-<i>Sox9/8</i> DKO testes.

Also, a set of genes were upregulated in <i>Dmrt1</i> mutants and downregulated in <i>Sox9/8</i> mutants (upper-left quadrant in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), which may be a consequence of 1) the age-differences between the two compared sample sets, 2) the incomplete efficiency of <i>Sox9</i> inactivation of our conditional SC<i>-Sox9</i> KO, or 3) the existence of additional roles for <i>Sox9/8</i> and/or <i>Dmrt1</i> in the adult testis."

By comparing the mRNA profiling of SC-<i>Dmrt1</i> KO and <i>SC-Sox9/8</i> DKO testes, we found a set of genes belonging to the RA-signaling pathway showing similar misexpression in both mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, green dots, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). As <i>Dmrt1</i> is downregulated in the <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO testes, we hypothesized that reducing RA levels in our <i>SoxE</i> mutants should also affect the transdifferentiation process. To test this, we treated adult SC-DKO mice with the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor WIN 18,446 just when the first FOXL2-positive cells are detected. We found a 3.5-fold reduction in the number of FOXL2-positive cells per testis cord section in the WIN 18,446-treated mice (1.80 \u00b1 2.03), compared to the vehicle (DMSO)-injected controls (6.57 \u00b1 3.52; p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 3</a>). Hence, as reported for <i>Dmrt1</i> SC-KO mice (<a href=\"#bib32\">Minkina et al., 2014</a>), the process of Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation seems to be also inhibited when RA levels were reduced in our study model."

During embryonic development the newly formed Sertoli cells can transdifferentiate to their ovarian counterparts when the testis promoting factors <i>Sox9</i> or <i>Dmrt1</i> are lost (<a href=\"#bib19\">Georg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Matson et al., 2011a</a>). The finding that <i>Foxl2</i> in the adult ovary was necessary to prevent granulosa-to-Sertoli cell transdifferentation revealed that this antagonism also operates in the adult gonad. In the adult testis, the same antagonism also appears to exist, as FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells were observed when <i>Dmrt1</i> was ubiquitously deleted (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matson et al., 2011a</a>). Here we show that Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation can be induced as well in the adult mouse testis by just deleting two <i>SoxE</i> genes<i>, Sox9 and Sox8.</i> These results evidence that <i>Sox9</i> has a crucial role, not only during sex determination and testis differentiation, but also in adult testis maintenance, where, together with <i>Sox8</i> and coordinately with <i>Dmrt1,</i> it prevents male-to-female genetic reprogramming."

                                "text": "The regulatory relationship between <i>Dmrt1</i> and <i>Sox9</i> requires further discussion. At the sex determination stage of the mouse (E11.5), both <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Dmrt1</i> are expressed in the early embryonic testis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kent et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Raymond et al., 1999</a>), but whereas early embryonic <i>Sox9</i> mutants show sex reversal (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chaboissier et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barrionuevo et al., 2006</a>), early embryonic <i>Dmrt1</i> KO mice have testes that express <i>Sox9</i> and appear histologically normal until P7 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raymond et al., 2000</a>). Thus, <i>Sox9</i> expression is independent of DMRT1 during sex determination and some time thereafter. Similarly, Sertoli cell-specific inactivation of <i>Sox9/8</i> at E13.5, shortly after the sex determination stage, leads to a rapid downregulation of <i>Dmrt1</i> that becomes already visible four days later, at E17.5 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Georg et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, <i>Dmrt1</i> ablation at E13.5 results in a very delayed <i>Sox9</i> downregulation, which is seen at P14 (one month later), coinciding with <i>Foxl2</i> upregulation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matson et al., 2011a</a>). This suggests again that <i>Sox9</i> expression is independent of <i>Dmrt1</i> in newly differentiated Sertoli cells and that the loss of <i>Sox9</i> after <i>Dmrt1</i> ablation is a secondary consequence of the upregulation of ovarian genes(s), such as <i>Foxl2</i>, in the same cells. On the other hand, several observations suggest the transactivation of <i>SOX9</i> by DMRT1: 1) DMRT1 binds near the <i>Sox9</i> locus in P28 mouse testes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Matson et al., 2011a</a>), 2) ectopic expression of <i>Dmrt1</i> in embryonic XX gonads causes XX sex reversal with upregulation of <i>Sox9</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>) and 3) <i>FOXL2<sup>-/-</sup></i> sex reversed polled goats undergo a process of transdifferentiation in which <i>DMRT1</i> expression precedes the upregulation of <i>SOX9</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Elzaiat et al., 2014</a>). In the latter two cases, however, female-promoting genes, including <i>FOXL2</i>, are either downregulated or not expressed, and thus, <i>SOX9</i> upregulation could be again an indirect consequence of the downregulation of female-promoting genes. Here we provide evidence that in the adult gonad, mutant <i>Sox9/8</i> Sertoli cells lose DMRT1, and that FOXL2 protein appears concomitant with the loss of DMRT1, consistent with the notion that <i>Dmrt1</i> expression is SOX9/8-dependent and that DMTR1 represses <i>Foxl2</i>. Additional observations support this view: 1) nearly all the genes strongly affected by the loss of DMRT1 were also affected by the loss of SOX9/8; 2) Sertoli-to-granulosa cell transdifferentiation observed in the testes of our <i>Sox9/8</i> mutant mice may be reduced by decreasing levels of RA, a signaling pathway known to be blocked by DMRT1 in Sertoli cells to prevent <i>Foxl2</i> expression and transdifferentiation into granulosa-like cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Minkina et al., 2014</a>); 3) DMRT1 can silence <i>Foxl2</i> in the absence of SOX9 and SOX8 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lindeman et al., 2015</a>); and 4) <i>Sox9</i> is upregulated in the adult ovary after the ectopic expression of <i>Dmrt1</i>, coinciding with <i>Foxl2</i> downregulation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lindeman et al., 2015</a>). Altogether, available data suggest that, like at earlier stages, a main role for SOX9/8 in adult male sex maintenance is to keep <i>Dmrt1</i> actively expressed, this latter gene having a fundamental role in repressing female-specific genes. However, these observations do not rule out the possibility that DMRT1 is also necessary for the maintenance of <i>Sox9</i> expression in the adult testis and that a feed-forward regulatory loop between <i>Sox9/8</i> and <i>Dmrt1</i> exists that ensures testis maintenance and antagonizes the feminizing action of <i>Foxl2</i>. Additional experiments (e.g. a time course of <i>Sox9</i> expression in adult SC-DKO <i>Dmrt1</i> mice) will help to clarify this issue."

In the adult testis, we have seen that <i>Sox9/8</i>-depleted Sertoli cells initially maintain WT1 expression, but this expression becomes progressively downregulated coinciding with the time-point at which <i>Foxl2</i> is upregulated. This suggests that <i>Wt1</i> retains its hierarchical position also in the adult testis, and that female-specific factors, including <i>Foxl2,</i> may be involved in its silencing. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chun et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schmidt et al., 2004</a>), we detected two types of granulosa cells in the normal adult ovary (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Ce</a>): 1) those located in antral (mature) follicles express FOXL2 but not WT1, and 2) those located in pre-antral follicles express both proteins. Thus, considering these two molecular markers, transdifferentiation of <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO Sertoli cells seems to give rise to mature follicle-type granulosa cells. This expression pattern also suggests that WT1 may play an anti-feminizing role in adult Sertoli cells."

The phenotype of mutant testes becomes ever more severe as the numbers of null alleles increase in their genotype, with extreme phenotypes observed in homozygous DKO testes 4 months after the beginning of TX treatment, at which stage seminiferous tubules have literally disappeared. As Sertoli cell proliferation stops once they obtain their adult appearance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kluin et al., 1984</a>), programmed cell death in <i>Sox9/8</i> mutants may explain their reduction in number. Consistently, we found no SOX9<sup>+</sup> apoptotic cell by P90 (30 datx), indicating that <i>Sox9/8</i> initially protects Sertoli cells from apoptosis, a role previously shown for this gene in other developing organs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheung et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seymour et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, newly differentiated FOXL2<sup>+</sup> cells did also not apoptose, showing that reprogrammed granulosa-like cells are also protected from apoptosis. However, the situation was substantially different in P150 (90 datx) mutant testes, where apoptosis was intense. At these late stages of testis regression, cord structure was dramatically compromised and even Sertoli cells still expressing <i>Sox9</i> were seen to undergo apoptosis. It is well known that the number of Sertoli cells must reach a critical threshold to organize embryonic testicular cords (<a href=\"#bib34\">Palmer and Burgoyne, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schmahl and Capel, 2003</a>). Accordingly, our results suggest that adult testis tubules also require the presence of a minimum number of Sertoli cells to be maintained. The progressive loss of Sertoli cells after <i>Sox9/8</i> ablation, either by apoptosis or by transdifferentiation into granulosa-like cells, appears to reach a point of no return at which the remaining normal Sertoli cells are unable to support the tubular structure and are also induced to apoptose. Hence, our results show that SOXE factors are necessary to maintain Sertoli cell identity and seminiferous tubule integrity, as these cells maintain all the other cell types forming the tubules, which become completely disorganized in their absence."

Also, after <i>Sox9</i> ablation in <i>Sox8</i> mutants, both developing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Georg et al., 2012</a>) and adult testes (present paper) experience downregulation and/or abnormal distribution of several important proteins required for the formation of Sertoli\u2013Sertoli and/or Sertoli\u2013germ cell adhesion complexes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In this context, it is noteworthy that spermatogenesis is halted when the functionality of the BTB is impaired (<a href=\"#bib30\">Meng et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dadhich et al., 2013</a>). Thus, in our <i>Sox9/8</i> SC-DKO mouse testes, BTB permeation and cytoskeleton impairment may give rise to a damaged intra-tubular microenvironment in which spermatogenesis is not supported anymore, germ cells undergoing both apoptosis and desquamation. Altogether, available data strongly suggest that failure of <i>Sox9/8</i> double mutant Sertoli cells to sustain testis tubule architecture is a direct consequence of altered expression of cell adhesion molecules and probably of other structural elements such as components of the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix."

The effect of adult knock-out of both <i>Sox9</i> and SOX8 was clearly awaited, given the known key roles of these genes in establishing testis fate in development. Overall this manuscript reports a tremendous amount of work with the characterization of mutant gonads at many different time-points after P60 by histology, immunohistochemistry using many relevant cell markers, and transcriptomic analyses by RNA-sequencing at one developmental stage. The results are detailed, well illustrated, well reported and convincing. The results presented here are novel and are of broad interest in understanding transdifferentiation and the stability of adult differentiated cell types"

By contrast, in an equivalent study on <i>Dmrt1</i>, Matson and colleagues treated P60 mice, carrying the UbiquitinC-cre/ERT2, by only two IP-injections of 4mg tamoxifen/mouse (Matson et al., 2011, Nature 476:101-4). And surprisingly here, after the 3-months TX-treatment the <i>Sox9</i> gene is far to be completely deleted as presented on Supplemental Materials and methods, first paragraph (with apparently a better efficiency of the <i>Sox9-Cre</i> compare with the Wt1-cre; fitting with results presented in the first paragraph of the Results section). Do the authors have an idea to explain this poor efficiency of this TX-treatment? And how are they sure to study double KO <i>Sox8/9</i> testes?"

A negative answer to this question could emerge from transcriptomic data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, as example) where TX-treated control and control testis present the same transcriptomic profile. But, uncertainty remains for TX-treatment and an eventual discrepancy between control and mutant animals. As example: it remains difficult to understand if a stage named P150 (90datx) corresponds (i) to a mouse with tamoxifen during 90 days after P60 or (ii) with tamoxifen during 30 days (from P60 to P90) then without tamoxifen from P90 to P150. In the latter case it has been better to note the stage P150 (30 datx + 60) instead of P150 (90 datx). Confusion about this arises in subsection \u201cTranscriptome analysis\u201d compared with the subsection \u201cSomatic testis-to-ovary genetic reprogramming in the absence of <i>Sox9</i> and <i>Sox8</i> in adult mouse testes\u201d; and also from sentences in the subsection \u201cTamoxifen administration\u201d compared with the legend to <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> (\"P150 (60 datx)\"); and also from the first paragraph of the Results section. Authors should clarify this point all along the text, the figures and the legends of the figures. Moreover, all along the manuscript authors write \"TX-treated controls\" instead of writing \"PXX (ZZ datx)-control\" where XX will represent the stage of observation (from 70 to 180) and ZZ the duration of TX-treatment. Authors should indicate in each case how long TX has been administered to control animals. Authors should also indicate the genotype of the control. Normally, the best control of a <i>Sox9<sup>flx/flx</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup>;Sox9-CreERT2</i>-P150 (90 datx) will be a <i>Sox9<sup>flx/flx</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i>;Control-P150 (90 datx).

The authors conclude that <i>Dmrt1</i> and <i>Sox9/8</i> likely act in the same pathway because nearly all genes strongly affected by loss of <i>Dmrt1</i> were also affected by the loss of <i>Sox9/8</i>. Although I agree this is likely to be true, this pattern of gene expression could be a secondary effect of the change in relative numbers of cell types in these whole gonad samples. Any gene KO that results in loss of Sertoli cells will likely cause this change in the observed expression pattern of known sex-determining genes regardless of which specific pathway they are affecting in the Sertoli cell."

We initially treated adult mice with TX at a concentration of 30mg/ml and 0.16 mg of TX per gram of body mass using a feeding needle for 5 consecutive days. However, <i>Sox9/8</i> double mutants displayed 90% lethality with this treatment. This is probably related to the fact that <i>Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice display an idiopathic body mass reduction and are weaker than WT ones, as reported previously (Sock et al., 2001. Idiopathic weight reduction in mice deficient in the high-mobility-group transcription factor <i>Sox8</i>. Mol Cell Biol. 21: 6951\u20136959). Then, we reduced the dose of TX (down to 0.07 mg TX / gr of body mass) and 90% of <i>Sox9/8</i> double mutants survived, but the efficiency of CRE recombination in adult Sertoli cells fell then to below 20%. Since acute/short TX treatments were clearly useless in our animal model, we then tried to feed mice with a TX-supplemented diet (40mg TX/100g Harlan 2914 diet) for one month (never for three months)."

We started using the WT1-CRE line to generate the SC <i>Sox9/8</i> DKO mice, and TX was initially administered either intraperitoneally or with a feeding-gauge needle (we obtained better results with the feeding needle). All control and mutant mice with compound homozygous and heterozygous genotypes containing less than 2 <i>Sox8</i> null alleles (either 0 or 1) tolerated well the TX treatment, but those containing 2 <i>Sox8</i> null alleles exhibited high lethality, permitting us to analyze only some few surviving animals.

Matson and col. used Ubc-CRE/ERT2 mice to delete <i>Dmrt1</i> in adult mice and they observed that after TX injection DMRT1 expression declined rapidly in germ cells while remained constant in Sertoli cells over the following 8 days (Matson et al., 2010) The mammalian doublesex homolog DMRT1 is a transcriptional gatekeeper that controls the mitosis versus meiosis decision in male germ cells. Dev. Cell 19, 612\u2013624]. In the 2011 work, they used the same mice and the same treatment, and they were able to show just a few (only 4) FOXL2+ cells within a testis cord one month after TX administration, evidencing a very low recombination efficiency in Sertoli cells. Actually, no data about the efficiency or kinetics of CRE recombination in Sertoli cells was reported in that paper. Other studies have also revealed that TX-induction of CRE-mediated recombination in adult Sertoli cells it is not an easy task with the available tools. For example, conditional inactivation of Wt1 using a CAG-CRE, revealed efficient recombination in kidney, ovary, pancreas, spleen, lung, and uterus, but not in Sertoli cells (Chau, You-Ying et al., 2011). Acute multiple organ failure in adult mice deleted for the developmental regulator Wt1. PLoS Genet 7.12: e1002404]. Here we show that the number of SOX9+ cells per seminiferous tubule cross section decreased to 37% in the testes of the <i>Wt1- Cre-ERT2; Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice and to 69% in the <i>Sox9-Cre-ERT2;Sox9<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox8<sup>-/-</sup></i> testes when compared to controls (new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This reduction is even more pronounced if we compare the Sashimi plots for <i>Sox9</i> obtained from our transcriptome data (see supplemental Materials and methods), which show a reduction of the WT <i>Sox9</i> transcripts of 57% and 80% for the <i>Wt1-Cre</i> DKO and the <i>Sox9-Cre</i> DKO lines, respectively. Thus, we disagree with the notion that we managed with low CRE recombination efficiency in our experiments. Rather, we believe we were able to develop a TX administration schedule that provides the highest CRE recombination efficiency reported to date in Sertoli cells (demonstrated with two different mouse CRE lines). We consider that this method could be a valuable tool for future gene targeting studies in adult Sertoli cells."
