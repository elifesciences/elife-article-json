Such reorganization crosses the division into separate sensory cortices (visual, somatosensory...). As its result, the visual cortex of the blind becomes active during tactile Braille reading. Although the possibility of such reorganization in the normal, adult brain has been raised, definitive evidence has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate such extensive reorganization in normal, sighted adults who learned Braille while their brain activity was investigated with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Subjects showed enhanced activity for tactile reading in the visual cortex, including the visual word form area (VWFA) that was modulated by their Braille reading speed and strengthened resting-state connectivity between visual and somatosensory cortices. Moreover, TMS disruption of VWFA activity decreased their tactile reading accuracy. Our results indicate that large-scale reorganization is a viable mechanism recruited when learning complex skills."

Such reorganization crosses the division into separate sensory cortices (visual, somatosensory...). As its result, the visual cortex of the blind becomes active during tactile Braille reading. Although the possibility of such reorganization in the normal, adult brain has been raised, definitive evidence has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate such extensive reorganization in normal, sighted adults who learned Braille while their brain activity was investigated with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Subjects showed enhanced activity for tactile reading in the visual cortex, including the visual word form area (VWFA) that was modulated by their Braille reading speed and strengthened resting-state connectivity between visual and somatosensory cortices. Moreover, TMS disruption of VWFA activity decreased their tactile reading accuracy. Our results indicate that large-scale reorganization is a viable mechanism recruited when learning complex skills."

At the systems level, experience-driven plasticity is thought to operate within the limits of sensory divisions, where the visual cortex processes visual stimuli and responds to visual training, the tactile cortex processes tactile stimuli and responds to tactile training, and so on. A departure from this rule is usually reported only during large-scale reorganization induced by sensory loss or injury (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hirsch et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lomber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Merabet and Pascual-Leone, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pavani and Roder, 2012</a>). The ventral visual cortex, in particular, is activated in blind subjects who read Braille (<a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00fcchel et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Reich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sadato et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">1996</a>) and lesions of this area impair Braille reading (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hamilton et al., 2000</a>). This visual cortex thus has the innate connectivity required to carry out a complex perceptual task \u2013 reading \u2013 in a modality different than vision. It is unclear, however, to what extent this connectivity is preserved and functional in the normal, adult brain."

Additional activations were observed in the intraparietal sulcus, supramarginal gyrus, and frontal areas (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

This contrast also revealed clusters in the middle occipital gyrus, cuneus (BA18), the left superior temporal gyrus, and frontal areas (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To determine whether these changes were due to a general activity increase for all reading conditions, we computed a whole-brain ANOVA interaction analysis of the signal change following the course for reading visual words, visual Braille words and tactile Braille words versus their respective control tasks ([tactile Braille vs. tactile control - (visual Braille vs. visual Braille control+visual words vs. visual words control)] x (after course-before course)) (see 'Materials and methods').

This regression analysis revealed one significant cluster, located in the left inferior occipital gyrus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>; MNI = -45 -76 -12, Z = 3.69, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). A similar result was obtained when we correlated single letter recognition speed with tactile Braille activations, which further supports the significance of the visual cortex in learning to read Braille (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>,\u00a0Appendix 1.4). We found no such correlations for other reading speed measures (e.g. visual Braille reading speed) or imagery activations (e.g. imagining tactile Braille; see Appendix 1.5). These observations indicate that the ventral visual activations for tactile reading cannot be explained as a by-product of imagery."

A drop in activation for the control condition was observed in the posterior attentional network (intraparietal sulcus, IPS, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, t(28)=2.76, p=0.01).

In the primary motor cortex (MNI: -39 -25 59), we observed no such drop, which suggests that the finger-movement patterns across sessions and conditions remained unchanged.

Similar to a previous visual reading study (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duncan et al., 2010</a>), we chose the lateral occipital area as an additional, negative control site, because TMS to this region evokes muscle contractions indistinguishable from VWFA stimulation. rTMS was applied while subjects performed a lexical decision task on words and pseudowords written in tactile Braille (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; 'Materials and methods'). Based on a previous visual reading study (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duncan et al., 2010</a>), we expected that stimulation to the VWFA during the performance of the task would decrease accuracy for lexical decisions on Braille words. As predicted, TMS to the VWFA decreased the accuracy of reading Braille words (t(8)=3.02, p=0.016, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

First, if the visual activations were only a by-product of mental imagery, TMS to the VWFA would not interfere with Braille reading; yet, it did (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Second, training did not produce any changes in the activations to imagining tactile Braille (Appendix 1.5). Third, activations to imagining Braille in the VWFA did not correlate with tactile Braille reading proficiency (Appendix 1.4). Thus, visual cortex activations for tactile reading cannot be explained as a by-product of visual imagery. Instead, they constitute the signature of a new, tactile script representation emerging in the visual cortex."

In the latter, the deprived auditory areas play a vital role in the deaf cats\u2019 superior visual perception. The above-mentioned studies used the same paradigms in non-deprived humans and cats, but did not find any signs of cross-modal reorganization (e.g. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in <a href=\"#bib58\">Sadato et al., 2002</a>). One could have thus expected that learning to read by touch would lead to the emergence of a tactile reading area in the somatosensory cortex. Yet, our study produced a different result. Specific responses to tactile reading emerged not in somatosensory areas, but in visual areas."

However, all the above-mentioned experiments used simple stimuli, such as gratings, and short learning periods. Our experiment was longer (9 months) and used complex stimuli - entire Braille words. Experiments that study learning-related plasticity at multiple time points (<a href=\"#bib36\">L\u00f6vd\u00e9n et al., 2013</a>) suggest that at the initial stage of Braille learning, the somatosensory cortex might have increased its response to Braille words.

Indeed, it was shown that some parts of the visual cortex can be activated during auditory or tactile tasks (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amedi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Zatorre, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Powers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Saito et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zangenehpour and Zatorre, 2010</a>). Professional pianists, for example, were shown to activate their auditory cortex when viewing mute video recordings of a piano key being pressed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Haslinger et al., 2005</a>). The behavioral relevance of such activations, however, was demonstrated only for simple tactile stimuli: grating orientation (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zangaladze et al., 1999</a>) and distance judgment (<a href=\"#bib38\">Merabet et al., 2004</a>). Our study used a controlled, within-subject design and precise behavioral measures supplemented with a causal method, TMS. Its results suggest that large-scale plasticity is a viable mechanism recruited when learning complex skills. This conclusion is congruent with a recent comparative study showing that the morphology of cerebral cortex is substantially less genetically heritable in humans than in chimpanzees (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gomez-Robles et al., 2015</a>). Such relaxed genetic control might be the reason for homo sapiens\u2019 increased learning abilities and greater behavioral flexibility."

The subjects\u2019 progress was monitored by qualified Braille teachers during monthly meetings. The course lasted 9 months. Teaching began with simple tactile recognition exercises. Next, Braille letters were gradually introduced. In the second half of the course, subjects were encouraged to focus mainly on whole-word reading. Although our Braille course was focused on tactile reading, all the subjects checked their exercises visually, which required visual Braille reading training on a daily basis.

The task was to read aloud as many words as possible in 60 s. The reading strategy was not specified. If a word was read inaccurately, it was not counted in the final score. Five different versions of the test were used during the course, each containing different words. Because we expected that word length would have a significant impact on reading speed (<a href=\"#bib69\">Veispak et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">2012</a>), the word lists were ordered such that in each version of the test, words of a specific length appeared in exactly the same order (e.g. a three-letter word followed by a five-letter word, and so on). The distribution of word frequency was also similar across all versions of the test. Additionally, during each testing session, we measured a number of single Braille letters identified in one minute. The testing procedure and timing was identical to those in the whole-words reading test. The task was to read aloud as many letters as possible in 60\u2009s. The order of the letters was counterbalanced between different versions of the test."

The signal time course for each subject was modelled within a general linear model (<a href=\"#bib16\">Friston et al., 1995</a>) derived by convolving a canonical hemodynamic response function with the time series of the experimental stimulus categories and estimated movement parameters as regressors. Statistical parametric maps of the t statistic resulting from linear contrasts of each stimulus type minus baseline were generated and stored as separate images for each subject. Contrast images were then entered into an ANOVA model for random group effect analysis. We used first level contrast of each reading condition vs. its respective control after vs. before the tactile Braille course to assess the interaction between the time point (before and after the course) and reading condition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

Thus, for each voxel in the ROI, we extracted beta values for each reading condition. Then, those beta values were correlated pairwise (visual words x visual Braille, visual Braille x tactile Braille and tactile Braille x visual Braille). As a result, for each participant, we obtained a neural similarity matrix describing how representationally similar the activity patterns associated with the three conditions were.

The first 10 volumes of each subject\u2019s scan were discarded for signal stabilization and for subjects\u2019 adaptation to scanner noise. Then, slice-timing correction and head-motion correction were applied. The magnitude of participant head motion was quantified by computing mean relative displacement (<a href=\"#bib66\">Van Dijk et al., 2012</a>) and mean frame displacement (<a href=\"#bib47\">Power et al., 2012</a>) measures. Both measures showed no difference in the magnitude of head motion between the first and second scanning session.

Nuisance regression was performed first to avoid attenuation of the signal caused by mismatch in the frequencies of the data and regressors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hallquist et al., 2013</a>). Nuisance variables included: a) white matter signal; b) cerebrospinal fluid signal; c) 24 head motion parameters: 6 parameters of the current volume, 6 of the preceding volume and a quadratic term for each of these values (<a href=\"#bib17\">Friston et al., 1996</a>, see also: <a href=\"#bib62\">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yan et al., 2013</a>); and d) a separate regressor for every volume that displayed a mean frame displacement value higher than 0.5 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Power et al., 2012</a>).

In the whole-brain analysis, for each seed, subject, and scan, we computed a voxel-wise correlation of time courses between seed regions and the rest of the brain, which was then transformed into Fisher\u2019s z value maps. In the ROI analysis, a BOLD time course was extracted for each seed, subject, and scan. The seed time courses were then correlated, creating a Pearson\u2019s r correlation coefficient for each subject and scan. Fisher\u2019s z transform was applied, to ensure normality for the t-test. Correlation coefficients were then correlated with the behavioral measure. Previous studies show that training can lead to rapid change in resting-state functional connectivity pattern (e.g. <a href=\"#bib33\">Lewis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Urner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Voss et al., 2012</a>). We thus expected that final resting-state functional connectivity reflects subjects\u2019 intensity of training in last days of the Braille course. This can be quantified as a change in Braille reading speed over last month of the course. This behavioral measure was thus used for correlation. Given our apriori hypothesis, uncorrected significance value is reported. However, the same result was obtained even when correction for multiple comparisons was applied to account for multiple behavioral sessions."

Post-hoc tests show that none of the two effects are significant on their own. In the VWFA, where the interaction is significant at p&lt;0.001, the post-hoc paired t-tests show p=0.23 for tactile Braille words (after course) vs. tactile Braille words (before course) and p=0.38 for tactile control (after course) vs. tactile control (before course).

Its lesion seems not to affect reading itself (Philipose et al., 2007). Milner et al., (1991), already reported a case study of a patient with left lateral occipital lesion who suffered from visual agnosia with reading functions relatively unimpaired. On the other hand, the LOA is known to be activated when advanced readers start reading a novel script. For example, French native speakers activated bilateral LOA when observing Chinese characters \u2013 stimuli that were not familiar to them (Szwed et al., 2014)(<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 3</a>)."

This is why TMS application to LOA does not influence reading accuracy, whereas inhibition of the VWFA does (Duncan, Pattamadilok, and Devlin, 2010, and our own results presented here). This is because, we believe, the LOA activity is not critical for visual and Braille word recognition. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the main effect in the LOA was only in the ROI analysis. When we correlated tactile Braille final reading speed with the whole-brain activity to tactile Braille words vs. control after the course we found only a small cluster of 41 voxels (p=0.005 voxel-wise, uncorrected) located in the right LOA (MNI 51 -55 12). The increase of activity in both LOA and VWFA for tactile reading suggest that visual and tactile reading share similar neural correlates along the ventral visual stream.

In both papers subjects were trained in a simple tactile discrimination task. Ptito and colleagues trained their subjects for seven days, Kupers et al. \u2013 for two days. Our experiment on the other hand was longer (9 months) and used complex, entire words as stimuli. Indeed, experiments that study learning-related plasticity at multiple time points (L\u00f6vd\u00e9n et al., 2013) suggest that at the initial stage of Braille learning, the somatosensory cortex might have increased its response to Braille words. Then, as the effects of early sensory learning consolidated in somatosensory cortex and the cortical focus of learning shifted elsewhere, in our case the ventral visual stream. Because the above-mentioned studies used simple stimuli and short learning periods, they captured only the initial reorganization in the somatosensory system."

This classification of TMS frequencies can be clearly illustrated in the motor system where low-frequency rTMS delivered to primary motor cortex reduces the amplitude of motor evoke potential (MEP) while high-frequency rTMS enhances MEP amplitude (Berardelli et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1997; Jennum et al., 1995; Maeda et al., 2000; Pascual-Leone et al., 1994; Rossi et al., 2000). However, it is less clear that these findings generalize to areas outside the motor cortex. For instance, to induce speech arrest (i.e., disruption of speech production), rTMS at rather high frequencies (4-32 Hz) has been used over the left prefrontal cortex (Epstein et al., 1996; Jennum et al., 1994; Pascual-Leone et al., 1991). Similarly, the majority of studies using either high- or low-frequency rTMS to areas involved in cognitive processes showed disruptive, rather than facilitatory, effects on behavioural measures such as reaction times or accuracy (Sliwinska et al., 2014; Gough et al., 2005; Hartwigsen, et al., 2010; Pitcher et al., 2007; Pobric et al., 2010; Romero et al., 2006; Whitney et al., 2010).

There are, however, some heuristic guidelines that helped us to constrain the choice. Low-frequency rTMS is used in off-line TMS experiments where long-lasting stimulation is believed to have an inhibitory after-effect lasting from 30-60 min, depending on the duration and intensity of the stimulation (Ridding and Rothwell, 2007). On-line experiments, such as ours, tend to use high-frequency rTMS to produce short-lasting inhibition of cognitive processes. Many studies have used 10 Hz stimulation during task performance to slow reaction times (G\u00f6bel et al., 2001) and/or induce errors (Hartwigsen et al., 2010). In fact, as mentioned in the Materials and methods section (subsection \u201cTMS protocol\u201d), we chose the specific paradigm that used rTMS at frequency of 10 Hz for 500 ms since it has proven to be very effective and robust for producing virtual lesions across different cortical areas (Bjoertomt et al., 2002; Duncan et al., 2010; G\u00f6bel et al., 2001; Hartwigsen, Price, et al., 2010; Lavidor and Walsh, 2003; Pitcher et al., 2007; Rushworth, Ellison, and Walsh, 2001), not only the Visual Word Form Area (Duncan et al., 2010)."

The pioneer work by Zangaladze et al., 1999, showed that TMS over occipital cortex interferes with tactile grating orientation task in the sighted, proved visual cortex engagement in tactile tasks. Merabet et al. (2004), demonstrated double dissociation between the engagement of somatosensory and visual cortex in tactile discrimination task in healthy sighted subjects. Low frequency rTMS applied to somatosensory cortex affected the judgment of roughness/texture, but not the distance between stimuli. rTMS to visual cortex yielded opposite results, disrupting the judgment of distance, but not roughness. Therefore, we now:"
