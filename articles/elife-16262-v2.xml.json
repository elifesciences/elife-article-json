Here we show that NG2 cells perform linear integration of glutamatergic synaptic inputs and respond with increasing dendritic calcium elevations. Synaptic activity induces rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated by low-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels under strict inhibitory control of voltage-gated A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can be global and originate throughout the cell. However, voltage-gated channels are also found in thin dendrites which act as compartmentalized processing units and generate local calcium transients. Taken together, the activity-dependent control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by A-type channels and the global versus local signaling domains make intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in NG2 cells a prime signaling molecule to transform neurotransmitter release into activity-dependent myelination."

Here we show that NG2 cells perform linear integration of glutamatergic synaptic inputs and respond with increasing dendritic calcium elevations. Synaptic activity induces rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated by low-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels under strict inhibitory control of voltage-gated A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can be global and originate throughout the cell. However, voltage-gated channels are also found in thin dendrites which act as compartmentalized processing units and generate local calcium transients. Taken together, the activity-dependent control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by A-type channels and the global versus local signaling domains make intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in NG2 cells a prime signaling molecule to transform neurotransmitter release into activity-dependent myelination."

NG2 cells are precursor cells to all oligodendrocytes, which exclusively provide isolating myelin to axons and are thereby essential for rapid conduction velocity while maintaining small axon diameter in compact brains. Recent evidence suggests that myelination is plastic and activity-dependent and that synaptic transmission to NG2 cells plays a key role in detecting patterns of activity. However, the mechanisms by which neuronal activity is integrated by NG2 cells and transformed into precisely tuned axonal conduction velocities via myelination is not known."

NG2 cells are also unique amongst glial cells as they express a large number of voltage-gated ion channels (VGCs) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chittajallu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jabs et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Karadottir et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Biase et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kukley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Clarke et al., 2012</a>). However, while it is textbook knowledge that neurons use VGCs to integrate synaptic input and to\u00a0transform it into a pattern of action potentials and associated calcium signals, the functional significance of VGCs and synaptic input in NG2 cells has so far remained obscure. NG2 cells are not capable of firing action potentials (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergles et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Biase et al., 2010</a>) and their postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are so small (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jabs et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haberlandt et al., 2011</a>) that it has been questioned whether synaptic input can even achieve a relevant depolarization to recruit VGCs. Furthermore, previous attempts to elicit calcium signals in NG2 cells by synaptic stimulation failed and led the authors to conclude that the synaptic input was too weak (<a href=\"#bib48\">Velez-Fort et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haberlandt et al., 2011</a>). Thus, at present, we do not know how NG2 cells could transform synaptic input into activity-dependent myelination."

We quantified VGC-induced changes of mock PSPs by dividing their amplitude and half-width by the amplitude and half-width of scaled passive responses (negative current injection as above) and plotted the resulting half-width- and amplitude-ratio against the membrane potential reached at the peak of the recorded mock PSPs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). These plots clearly showed that in the absence of channel blockers, the durations of mock PSPs were increasingly shortened when the membrane depolarization exceeded \u221260 mV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, black line), consistent with the low-voltage activation range of A-type channels. Near the maximally attainable average depolarization of \u221216.5 \u00b1 1.0 mV, the half-width\u00a0ratio of mock PSPs was substantially shortened to 47.1 \u00b1 3.4% (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This shortening is almost exclusively due to the action of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, whereas blocking Na<sup>+</sup> and delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels did not detectably change the duration of mock PSPs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). In contrast to the half-width, the amplitude of mock PSPs was only slightly reduced, as indicated by an amplitude ratio near 1 even for large PSPs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, black line). This linear scaling of the amplitude of mock PSPs in control conditions is a result of a balanced interplay of fast Na<sup>+</sup>\u00a0and A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>): if A-type or Na<sup>+</sup> channels are blocked,\u00a0the amplitude of mock PSPs is increased or decreased by ~15% and ~30%, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate a prominent role of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels in shaping synaptic input and suggest that even medium-sized synaptic input (\u2206 20\u201330 mV) is accelerated by A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, while the amplitude of synaptic depolarizations faithfully encodes the input strength due to mutual antagonism of A-type K<sup>+</sup> and fast Na<sup>+</sup> channels."

Action potentials are potent openers of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and elicit prominent calcium signals. Since NG2 cells do not fire action potentials (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergles et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Biase et al., 2010</a>), we wondered whether PSPs may directly trigger intracellular calcium signals, and therefore combined 2-photon Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>imaging with our mock PSP stimulation paradigm. During injection of a robust stimulus (10 mock PSPs at 100\u2009Hz), we monitored the fluorescence of the calcium indicator dye Fluo-4 (200 \u00b5M) with line-scans across proximal dendrites and the soma of NG2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). Indeed, we detected clear calcium transients in the soma and proximal dendrites (3.9 \u00b1 1.3% and 12.7 \u00b1 1.4%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals required the activation of VGCCs, as they were highly sensitive to a cocktail of VGCCs blockers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>).

In particular, the spread of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was much faster than expected from pure diffusional propagation from the soma into dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Together with the undiminished amplitude and steep rise of the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the data suggest that the membrane depolarization of the mock PSPs rapidly spreads throughout the dendritic tree and opens local dendritic VGCCs. The minimal delay and the rapid rise of dendritic Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals in NG2 cells is comparable to the fast dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded and stimulated under identical conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G and H</a>), suggesting that NG2 cells are capable of similar dendritic signal processing."

                        "text": "A train of 10 large PSPs may not happen very frequently under physiological conditions because it requires a large number of presynaptic neurons to fire in a highly synchronized manner. We therefore stimulated NG2 cells with a more realistic pattern of synaptic input. We allowed firing of presynaptic neurons to deviate from perfect synchrony and modeled a temporal distribution of presynaptic activity using a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 25 ms (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We progressively increased the number of injected Gaussian-distributed quanta (Q) and monitored intracellular calcium levels with 2-photon microscopy in line-scan mode. In the control group, Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>responses were seen only rarely (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). By contrast, when blocking A-type\u00a0K<sup>+</sup> channels, we observed larger depolarizations often carrying prominent spikelets (in\u00a0five out\u00a0of seven cells, average amplitude 40.2 \u00b1 6.7 mV),\u00a0which\u00a0were accompanied by substantial intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). When plotting the peak depolarization against the current injection strength (being similar across groups, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), voltage responses in the control and 4-AP groups\u00a0were indistinguishable as long as they did not exceed ~\u221245 mV, consistent with the threshold for recruitment of A-type channels as determined above. As expected, larger current injections (injections equivalent to &gt;600 glutamate quanta, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) much more effectively depolarized NG2 cells in the presence of 4-AP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To discriminate Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses from non-responding trials, we analyzed the line-scan profiles with a template-fitting algorithm. This analysis revealed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) that for both groups Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (filled symbols) are much more frequent if NG2 cells are depolarized beyond approximately \u221245 mV, suggesting that blocking A-type channels facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by allowing for stronger depolarizations. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were not only significantly more frequent in the presence of 4-AP (control: 9/40; 4-AP: 22/43; Fisher\u2019s exact test, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), but the responding trials also showed a significantly larger amplitude: 10.1 \u00b1 0.7% and 14.1 \u00b1 1.5% in the\u00a0control and 4-AP groups, respectively (Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Further analysis showed that the fraction of trials that\u00a0responded with a Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signal steadily increased towards unity with the quantal content of the stimulus in both groups. However, 4-AP treatment left-shifted this curve, lowered the 50%\u00a0threshold from ~1200 to ~600 quanta, and thereby strongly increased the propensity of NG2 glial cells to generate Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Interestingly, re-plotting the fraction of responding trials against the peak depolarization minimizes the difference between the two groups seen when plotting the fraction against injection strength (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), further indicating that 4-AP does not change the voltage dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal but does\u00a0change\u00a0the recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The strength of the template-fitting algorithm lies in its ability to identify clear responses\u00a0unambiguously, but as a result, 'non-responding' trials do not enter the analysis. To characterize the whole population of NG2 cell dendrites, we therefore undertook an additional analysis including all dendrite recordings. We binned trials according to stimulus strength, as illustrated\u00a0in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, but calculated the average \u2206F/F ratios across all trials. This analysis revealed a small but statistically significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the control group and also showed that dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels linearly increased with input strength when A-type K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels were blocked (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In summary, these results indicate that A-type\u00a0K<sup>+</sup> channels tightly gate the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to synaptic input to NG2 cells."

When plotting the half-width of the mock PSP voltage responses in a train (10 PSPs at 100\u2009Hz), we found a clear increase of 26.3 \u00b1 3.3% (n=7, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). This progressive broadening of PSPs is\u00a0very likely to\u00a0reflect an increasing fraction of inactivated A-type K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels as this broadening was not observed in the 4-AP-treated group (n=8, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). Such an increase in half-width is very likely to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via an increased tail current during the repolarization phase (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels opened, prolonged period with large and increasing driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Indeed, with broadened PSPs in the 4-AP treated group, we observed a significantly increased Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>response (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C and D</a>, 12.7 \u00b1 1.4% vs 24.2 \u00b1 4.2% in the\u00a0control and 4-AP groups, respectively, Student\u2019s <i>t</i>-test).

Single action potentials regularly open VGCCs and are associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of constant size. Therefore, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in neurons are proportional to the number of action potentials in a brief burst or to the frequency of action potentials in a long train (<a href=\"#bib19\">Helmchen et al., 1996</a>). NG2 cells also sum incoming electrical synaptic input but, in contrast to neurons and in the absence of action potentials, there is no threshold function for synaptic potentials.

Both locally induced and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in NG2 cells decay with a time constant on the order of seconds, while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in neurons usually return to baseline within several hundred milliseconds.

Our results demonstrate for the first time that synaptic-like (mock) depolarizations trigger robust and rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the soma and dendrites of NG2 cells. We furthermore provide evidence that the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are mediated by low-threshold VGCCs: (1) they were triggered solely by current injection; (2) they started to appear when cells were depolarized beyond \u221250 to \u221240 mV; (3) they were blocked by nickel/cadmium and by\u00a0a cocktail of the R- and T-type channel blockers SNX-482 and TTA-P2; (4) they were potentiated by blocking K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels and showed a rapid rise, implying that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source was active for only\u00a0a few milliseconds; (5) they were resistant to blocking Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>exchangers or Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by 10 \u00b5M KB-R7943 and thapsigargin, respectively. Thus, the Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals we recorded in NG2 cells are quite distinct from the\u00a0store-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations seen in astrocytes, which occur and decay over\u00a0many seconds. Haberlandt et al. reported that depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals in NG2 cells are very sensitive to thapsigargin, seemingly contradicting our findings (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haberlandt et al., 2011</a>).

This may be one of the reasons why previous publications concluded that synaptically driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in NG2 cells are unlikely to occur (<a href=\"#bib48\">Velez-Fort et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haberlandt et al., 2011</a>). By which mechanisms do A-type\u00a0K<sup>+</sup> channels gate Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals? Since the voltage-dependence of the Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signal itself remained unchanged after blocking A-type K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), it is very likely that A-type channels under control conditions render synaptic input less effective in causing Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals by shortening and decreasing the associated synaptic depolarization. In consequence, the impact of synaptic transmission on Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signaling in NG2 cells is dependent on the activity of A-type\u00a0K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels. Considering that Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>levels have been implicated in the developmental behavior and gene expression of NG2 cells, A-type K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels are\u00a0likely\u00a0to play a key regulatory role in whether and how neuronal transmitter release affects oligodendrogenesis and myelination (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pende et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Paez et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2010</a>). The fact that NG2 cells are most responsive to synaptic input from neurons when A-type channels are suppressed raises the question of\u00a0under which conditions such suppression is achieved. Activity of A-type channels can temporarily be reduced when depolarizations bring them into a state of inactivation. Thus, those patterns of synaptic input\u00a0that\u00a0maximize inactivation of A-type channels enhance the impact of axonal activity on NG2 cell behavior. Based on previous reports on the kinetics of A-type K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels (<a href=\"#bib44\">Steinhauser et al., 1994b</a>), our data allows\u00a0us\u00a0to predict that brief trains of action potentials (50\u2013100 ms) should be very effective at inactivating A-type channels and will open the 'calcium-gate' in NG2 cells. Apart from functionally and temporarily reducing A-type currents by inactivation, transcriptional regulation may be another way to control A-type current amplitude in NG2 cells. Indeed, there is evidence for developmental and reactive regulation of K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels in response to ischemia/injury (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lytle et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pivonkova et al., 2010</a>). Such regulated expression of A-type K<sup>+\u00a0</sup>channels may allow NG2 cells to permanently tune their responsiveness to incoming neuronal activity. This adaptation is\u00a0probably\u00a0required to match the responsiveness of NG2 cells to patterns of activity, which vary across regional neuronal circuits throughout the brain (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sun and Dietrich, 2013</a>)."

Such widespread responsiveness to glutamate throughout the dendritic tree indicates that NG2 cells may be capable of dendritic computation. Dendritic computation in NG2 cells is further suggested by the fact that local glutamate uncaging boosted the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response despite the small amplitude of the associated somatic voltage responses. In particular, the tiny incremental depolarization caused by adding dendritic uncaging (\u2206 2.5 mV) is far too small to significantly enhance the recruitment of VGCCs at the soma (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). This implies that the dendritic voltage excursion caused by glutamate uncaging is actually substantially larger than that\u00a0measured at the soma, and that this more pronounced local depolarization recruits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the dendrite. Considering the thin diameter of NG2 cell dendrites, such severe attenuation of dendritic voltage is not surprising (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sun and Dietrich, 2013</a>). A larger dendritic voltage excursion is also suggested by the level of the absolute depolarization of the soma (as opposed to the uncaging-induced increment in depolarization considered above), which is clearly below the voltage range typically required to reliably induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Further, all Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals recorded in dendrites \u2013\u00a0regardless of whether induced by synaptic stimulation, by\u00a0a train of mock PSPs, by gaussian distributed mock PSPs, or by glutamate uncaging \u2013\u00a0display a rapid rise, implying that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source must be very close to the optical recording site, the dendrite. Finally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals induced in the soma rapidly spread into all dendrites and reached even the distal ends with undiminished amplitudes. This can only be achieved if VGCCs are present all along the dendrites to regenerate the signal. As we did not detect any dendrites that did not generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, the data indicate\u00a0that most, if not all, dendrites of NG2 cells are equipped with VGCCs."

                        "text": "There is a similar line of argument for a dendritic localization of A-type channels in NG2 cells. Blocking these channels with 4-AP allowed glutamate uncaging to boost the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, i.e. to recruit more Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels by a stronger depolarization compared to control conditions. However, the resulting depolarization measured at the soma was negligibly increased by the K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channel blocker when compared to control conditions and thus cannot explain additional recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Therefore, application of 4-AP must have allowed for a larger depolarization of the local membrane in the dendrite in response to uncaging, which was not visible in the somatic recording. The most parsimonious explanation is that 4-AP was also acting on dendritic A-type K<sup>+</sup>\u00a0channels, which renders dendritic glutamate uncaging more effective in generating a larger local depolarization and recruiting dendritic VGCCs. Taken together, our data show that NG2 cells express voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>and K<sup>+</sup> channels in their dendrites and that these channels actively shape synaptic input as independent processing units."

Based on our present findings, we propose that synaptically\u00a0induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is well-suited to initiate actions of NG2 cells in the context of activity-dependent myelination. First, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in NG2 cells allow for optimal temporal and spatial summation of incoming neuronal input and their dependence on the functional state of A-type channels provides certain types of plasticity for synchronized activity. Second, NG2 cells seem to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in at least two different spatial domains, which may serve distinct roles in the context of activity-dependent myelination. Dendritic input, possibly even induced by an individual axon, can trigger local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Such local Ca<sup>2+\u00a0</sup>signals could be involved in stabilizing or enhancing contact sites with individual axons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hines et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mensch et al., 2015</a>) and could\u00a0enable axon-specific integration and computation. On the other hand, global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which are induced by a larger number of active synapses throughout the dendritic tree, spread within the NG2 cell and involve the soma, are particularly qualified for triggering global cellular actions, such\u00a0as division, differentiation, survival or motility of NG2 cells in response to neuronal activity. Further, our finding of local processing of synaptic input raises the question of\u00a0how local dendritic computation in NG2 cells is relevant for myelination and whether the spatial arrangement of synaptic junctions on NG2 cells affects myelination of the connected axon."

This integration builds on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in different spatial domains and appears as a specialized type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> excitability of NG2 cells. Voltage-gated\u00a0K<sup>+</sup> channels dampen Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals but this can be overcome by temporally and spatially coincident synaptic depolarizations. Thus, specific patterns of axonal activity may promote myelination by instructing NG2 cells to interact with axons or generate new oligodendrocytes."

The amplitude of this current, the quantal amplitude, was set to 12\u2009pA according to the range of values reported for miniature EPSCs previously (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergles et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kukley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Passlick et al., 2016</a>). To achieve a stronger stimulation, the current waveform was multiplied with an integer number, Q, representing the number of quanta contained in the stimulus. The electrical impact of a synapse depends on the individual passive membrane properties of the NG2 cell, membrane resistance, R<sub>in</sub>, and membrane capacitance. Because membrane resistance, but not capacitance, varies greatly among NG2 cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kukley et al., 2010</a>) and the resistance has a larger impact on the voltage response, we calculate the strength of our mock current injection as the product Q * R<sub>in</sub>. To facilitate interpretation of this product, i.e. to\u00a0determine\u00a0the quantal content, we express it in multiples of 250 M\u03a9, the population average input resistance of NG2 cells. For example, injecting 100 Q into R<sub>in</sub>=250 M\u03a9 yields Q * R<sub>in</sub>=25,000 (Q * M\u03a9) and injecting 50 Q into R<sub>in</sub>=500 M\u03a9 yields the same product, Q * R<sub>in</sub>=25,000 (Q * M\u03a9). Therefore, the stimulations are equally effective and both would be expressed as 100 Q * R<sub>in</sub> (Q * 250 M\u03a9). For simplicity, we neglected changes in Q due to varying driving force. We also injected a small inverted, hyperpolarizing EPSC waveform to produce a purely passive voltage deflection in each recording. The average hyperpolarizing response size was \u22126.4 \u00b1 0.2 mV (54 cells; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). To comparatively illustrate the amplitude and waveform of a voltage response to an arbitrarily-sized mock current injection not affected by voltage-gated channels, we multiplied the small passive response obtained in the same cell by the (negative) amplitude ratio of the arbitrary injection over the small inverted EPSC injection."

The template (length 1\u2009s, derived from the average brightness-over-time profiles across all ROIs) was slid along the profiles and at each position scaled to achieve an optimal match. The detection criterion was calculated as above at each position and the onset of response (same detection threshold as above) was read from the position of the template yielding the best detection value.

However, the impact of the work is somewhat reduced by a previous study that showed that VGCCs regulate NG2 calcium signals (Haberlandt et al., 2011). The authors' novel \"mock PSP\" approach is of interest, but the conclusions are limited to the role of A-type potassium channels modulation of VGCCs and the visualization of calcium signaling in NG2 cell processes. A more thorough characterization of mechanisms underlying NG2 cell calcium signaling and a more physiological stimulation paradigm (e.g. stimulation of synaptic input to NG2 cells) would increase the significance. Overall we think that these concerns will require substantial additional experiments that would exceed the <i>eLife</i> benchmark of 2 months. The full reviews are included below."

Furthermore, NG2 cells display significant cell process extension and most of the synapses are located on these processes. Therefore, it has been postulated that NG2 cell processes are major sites of synaptic integration in NG2 cells, but this has never been demonstrated."

It is also understandable that SNR (signal to noise ratio) for Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging experiments conducted at thin cell processes such as distal dendrites may be relatively low. However, in the context of synaptic communication, it is important that the authors address this. This is especially problematic when drawing conclusions from imaging traces beyond a binary result (responsive vs. non-responsive cells or dendrites). Example: In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a> \u2013 there does appear to be a clear increase in fluorescence in 3E \"d\" upon current injection. However, the basal calcium trace i.e. pre-current injection also seems to have changes in \u0394F/F. This can also be seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> \u2013 \"2.5 um\" vs 32.5 \"um\" [What ROI does the \"32.5 um\" trace correspond to in the panel?]. Does this unstable \u0394F/F signal constitute \"basal\" Ca<sup>2</sup> activity? Alternatively, is this simply noise or a result of averaging lesser number of dendritic pixels? Is the definition of a \"spikelet\" \u2013 also based on an objective analysis or is it based on visual inspection of the trace?"

Given that in many representative traces, the \u0394F/F signal does not return to baseline (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> \"d\", 4 D more obvious in \"12.5 um\" and \"32.5 um\", is there substantial variability in the decay constant? Similar to the claim that Ca<sup>2</sup> onset time is more or less constant across distance, does the decay constant also remain the same across distance from the NG2 cell body? Since the authors distinguish NG2 cell dendritic Ca<sup>2</sup> response from neuronal Ca<sup>2</sup> kinetics (\u2013 Discussion section), it would be appropriate to show a neuronal dendrite Ca<sup>2</sup> response as an inset in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

The authors used clever approaches to simulate the effects of synaptic inputs to NG2 cells (mock PSPs) by injecting current. The authors discovered that A-type potassium channels modify intracellular calcium events mediated via voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). They also explored calcium dynamics in the processes (and somata) of NG2 cells for the first time. These studies add to our understanding of how VGCCs regulate calcium events in both the somata and processes in NG2 cells and how A-type potassium channels modulate their activity."

These experiments show that also Cs potentiates the calcium signals in NG2 cells and thereby exclude that an effect of 4-AP on neuronal potassium channels (Cs did not reach neurons, applied from inside the NG2 cell) or on calcium channels in NG2 cells (Cs has never been shown to facilitate calcium channels) is required."
