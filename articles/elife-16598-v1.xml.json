This is possible because mobile mRNA molecules can carry genetic information from the chromosomes to other sites in the cell."

It is thus understandable why most researchers interested in mRNA localization study the process in eukaryotic cells rather than in bacteria (which, of course, don\u2019t have a nucleus). Bacterial cells are also, as a rule, smaller than those of eukaryotes. In fact, most bacteria are not much bigger than the diffraction limit of light. This means that it\u00a0is difficult to distinguish between different structures within a bacterium under a conventional light microscope, which is likely another reason why we know much less about RNA localization in bacteria."

The Harvard team solved the problem related to the bacterium\u2019s small size by combining a super-resolution microscopy technique called STORM (<a href=\"#bib3\">Huang et al., 2008</a>) with a labeling technique called FISH (short for \u201cfluorescent in situ hybridization\u201d). Their labeling approach relied on engineering fluorescent probes that bind to specific subsets of mRNAs. These probes revealed that, like in eukaryotes, different mRNAs in bacterial cells are organized at different locations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Specifically, Moffitt et al. found that mRNAs that encode proteins destined for the inner membrane of the bacterium were enriched at this membrane."

Similarly, mRNAs that encode proteins that will be release into the periplasm or beyond (blue) are found throughout the cytosol.

The SRP then shields this part of the protein, which is referred to as a signal peptide, from the watery cytosol and brings it to the membrane. In\u00a0eukaryotes, a specific part of the SRP temporarily pauses the ribosome until it reaches the membrane. The SRP in bacteria lacks this part (<a href=\"#bib2\">Halic et al., 2004</a>), yet it can nevertheless interact with an active ribosome (<a href=\"#bib6\">Noriega et al., 2014</a>).

This led Moffitt et al. to ask if membrane-localized mRNAs are less stable than their counterparts in the cytosol. The answer to this question is yes: on average, membrane-associated mRNAs have shorter lives than those in the cytosol. Inhibiting translation, which is required for localization to the membrane, counteracted this effect. Preventing the RNA-degrading enzyme complex from localizing to the membrane also protected the membrane-associated mRNAs. Further research is now required to understand the biological consequences of coupling membrane localization with enhanced breakdown of RNAs."

Both <i>E. coli</i> and elephants (as an example of a eukaryote) localize many mRNAs within their cells.
