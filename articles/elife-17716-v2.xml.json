                    "text": "The role of mammalian skin in harbouring and transmitting arthropod-borne protozoan parasites has been overlooked for decades as these pathogens have been regarded primarily as blood-dwelling organisms. Intriguingly, infections with low or undetected blood parasites are common, particularly in the case of Human African Trypanosomiasis caused by <i>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</i>. We hypothesise, therefore, the skin represents an anatomic reservoir of infection. Here we definitively show that substantial quantities of trypanosomes exist within the skin following experimental infection, which can be transmitted to the tsetse vector, even in the absence of detectable parasitaemia. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of extravascular parasites in human skin biopsies from undiagnosed individuals. The identification of this novel reservoir requires a re-evaluation of current diagnostic methods and control policies. More broadly, our results indicate that transmission is a key evolutionary force driving parasite extravasation that could further result in tissue invasion-dependent pathology."

The tissue was homogenised and RNA extracted. 100\u00a0ng of RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed and qPCR performed to estimate the cycle thresholds (C<sub>T</sub>) of the stumpy marker PAD1 and the endogenous control ZFP3. As C<sub>T</sub> is inversely proportional to amount of target cDNA in the sample and PAD1 and ZFP3 have similar qPCR efficiencies, a comparison of the delta (\u2206) of C<sub>T</sub> between PAD1 and ZFP3 transcripts reveals the relative ratio of PAD1 to ZFP3 transcripts and hence the proportion of differentiated parasites transcribing the PAD1 gene."

                    "text": "The role of mammalian skin in harbouring and transmitting arthropod-borne protozoan parasites has been overlooked for decades as these pathogens have been regarded primarily as blood-dwelling organisms. Intriguingly, infections with low or undetected blood parasites are common, particularly in the case of Human African Trypanosomiasis caused by <i>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</i>. We hypothesise, therefore, the skin represents an anatomic reservoir of infection. Here we definitively show that substantial quantities of trypanosomes exist within the skin following experimental infection, which can be transmitted to the tsetse vector, even in the absence of detectable parasitaemia. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of extravascular parasites in human skin biopsies from undiagnosed individuals. The identification of this novel reservoir requires a re-evaluation of current diagnostic methods and control policies. More broadly, our results indicate that transmission is a key evolutionary force driving parasite extravasation that could further result in tissue invasion-dependent pathology."

The tissue was homogenised and RNA extracted. 100\u00a0ng of RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed and qPCR performed to estimate the cycle thresholds (C<sub>T</sub>) of the stumpy marker PAD1 and the endogenous control ZFP3. As C<sub>T</sub> is inversely proportional to amount of target cDNA in the sample and PAD1 and ZFP3 have similar qPCR efficiencies, a comparison of the delta (\u2206) of C<sub>T</sub> between PAD1 and ZFP3 transcripts reveals the relative ratio of PAD1 to ZFP3 transcripts and hence the proportion of differentiated parasites transcribing the PAD1 gene."

The recent identification in West Africa of asymptomatic individuals with human trypanosomiasis (long-term seropositives) but undetected parasitaemia, raises the question of what role these individuals play in disease transmission (<a href=\"#bib23\">Koffi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jamonneau et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bucheton et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kanmogne et al., 1996</a>). Therapy is currently only directed towards microscopy-positive individuals and thus a proportion of the infected population remain untreated."

Xenodiagnosis experiments, in which tsetse flies are fed on microscopy-negative infected humans (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frezil, 1971</a>) or, more recently, experimentally-infected pigs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wombou Toukam et al., 2011</a>), have shown that these apparently aparasitaemic hosts contain the parasite since the tsetse flies became infected. It is uncertain where the trypanosomes reside in the host but, given the telmophagus (slash and suck) feeding habit of the tsetse fly, they could be skin-dwelling parasites ingested with the blood meal. Our findings suggest that parasites may be sufficiently abundant in the skin to allow transmission and therefore the skin may represent an anatomical reservoir of infection."

Imaging data from mouse models of infection suggest that trypanosomes sequester to major organs such as the spleen, liver and brain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kennedy, 2004</a>) and recent evidence has demonstrated trypanosomes in extravascular adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib39\">Trindade et al., 2016</a>). These adipose-associated trypanosomes appear to be a new life-cycle stage with a distinct transcriptional profile and, while tsetse bite-site associated transmission has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caljon et al., 2016</a>), and a historical study made a passing observation of localised deposition of trypanosomes in the skin matrix (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goodwin, 1971</a>), the broader role of skin-dwelling trypanosomes in transmission remains unclear. In this paper we report the investigation of a possible anatomical reservoir in the skin of the mammalian host. We provide conclusive evidence of <i>T.b. brucei,</i> (a causative agent of animal trypanosomiasis) and the human-infective trypanosome, <i>T.b. gambiense,</i> invading the extravascular tissue of the skin (including but not restricted to the adipose tissue) and undergoing onward transmission despite undetected vascular parasitaemia. We also provide evidence of localisation of trypanosomes within the skin of undiagnosed humans. The presence of a significant transmissible population of <i>T. brucei</i> in this anatomical compartment is likely to impact future control and elimination strategies for both animal and human trypanosomiases."

The presence and relative quantities of extravascular parasites were evaluated by semi-quantitative scoring of the histological samples (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) and compared to blood parasitaemia (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>). Extravascular parasites were first observed in the skin 12 days post-infection and remained throughout the experiment. Skin parasite numbers fluctuated to a lesser extent than blood parasitaemia and the apparent periodicity in the skin may be due to one particularly high data point on day 24 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Parasites were found in the dermis, subcutaneous adipose tissue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and in fascia beneath the panniculus carnosus muscle. We did not detect any particular clustering around dermal adipocytes. The presence of parasites in the skin was not associated with major inflammation (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). To confirm that skin invasion by this parasite was not strain or sub-species specific, the more virulent TREU927 strain of <i>T. brucei</i> and the human-infective <i>T.b. gambiense</i> strain, PA, were used to infect mice. Extravascular skin invasion of the dermis, subcutaneous adipose tissue and fascial planes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) was evident with associated mild to moderate inflammation (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), in some instances the degree of skin invasion in the <i>T.b. gambiense</i> infected mice was far greater than <i>T.b. brucei</i>, perhaps suggesting a greater propensity for sequestration in this sub-species."

Observed bioluminescence directly reflects the total number of living parasites in the entire organism, including blood and viscera, but the intensity of the signal decreases with tissue depth. Therefore, at the end of each experiment, mice were sacrificed and their organs were checked for bioluminescence. The presence of extravascular parasites in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues was first demonstrated by bioluminescence imaging in entire dissected skins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and was not necessarily localised to the bite site.

It is likely that once injected the parasites disseminate via the lymph and blood to the skin where they are ingested during tsetse fly pool-feeding and readily initiate cyclical development in the vector. Given the relative volume of the skin organ compared to the vasculature, it is possible, depending on the density of skin invasion, that more parasites exist in the skin than in the blood. The skin, therefore, represents an unappreciated reservoir of infection. The extravasation of trypanosomes was described previously in major organs such as liver, spleen (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kennedy, 2004</a>) and visceral adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib39\">Trindade et al., 2016</a>), but the importance of these parasites in transmission was not investigated. Here we show that these skin-dwelling trypanosomes contribute to transmission and could explain the maintenance of disease foci, despite active screening and treatment. Skin invasion for enhanced transmission is likely a powerful evolutionary force driving extravasation, suggesting that the generalised tissue penetration underlying pathogenesis (i.e. splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, CNS invasion) is a secondary epiphenomenon. A skin reservoir also presents a novel target for diagnostics (e.g. skin biopsies), allowing the prevalence of infection to be accurately determined and the identification of any previously undetected animal reservoirs of human disease."

However, disease foci persisted, with a resurgence in the number of reported cases to over 300,000 in the 1990s (<a href=\"#bib43\">World Health Organization 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Steverding, 2008</a>). Currently, HAT is approaching elimination in many areas (<a href=\"#bib42\">World Health Organization 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Simarro et al., 2012</a>). Understanding how HAT evaded elimination in the latter half of the 20th century and how it continues to persist is vital to efforts to eliminate the disease. For example, our results indicate that it may be necessary to develop novel therapeutics capable of accessing extravascular compartments. The current policy in most endemic countries is not to treat serologically positive individuals unless they demonstrate active infection, due to the long duration and high toxicity of treatment and the low predictive value of the serological tests. We suggest that this policy should be reconsidered in light of our compelling evidence that they represent a carrier population which may maintain HAT foci and explain previously thwarted efforts to eliminate this major pathogen."

Briefly, the 1.68 Kb optimised version of the North American firefly <i>Photinus pyralis</i> luciferase (<a href=\"#bib5\">Branchini et al., 2005</a>) was fused with a 10-bp sequence known as TY1-tag (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bastin et al., 1996</a>) and cloned into the pTSARib plasmid (<a href=\"#bib44\">Xong et al., 1998</a>) by using <i>Xho</i>I and <i>Hin</i>dIII restriction enzymes to obtain the pTSARib-PpyRE9H-TY1 plasmid. Finally, the 1.4 Kb coding region of the tdTomato fluorescent protein was inserted downstream using <i>Hin</i>dIII and <i>Bam</i>HI. The resulting 8.9 Kb vector, containing a blasticidin S resistance cassette, was linearised with <i>Sph</i>I to integrate the rDNA promoter locus. Bloodstream parasites were transformed with an Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burkard et al., 2007</a>), sub-cloned by limiting dilution, and clone selection was performed by measuring both bioluminescence in a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan) and fluorescence with a Muse cell Analyzer (Merck-Millipore).

In order to verify the reliability of the bioluminescent marker as well as to define the bioluminescence detection threshold of the AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTomato selected sub-clone, a parasite density / bioluminescence intensity analysis was performed in 96-micro-well plates with an IVIS Spectrum imager (Perkin Elmer). Parasite density and bioluminescence intensity were correlated when bioluminescence levels were higher than 10<sup>4</sup> p/s/cm\u00b2/sr, corresponding to about 10<sup>3</sup> parasites, allowing estimation of the parasite density from in vivo imaging over this threshold (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 1B</a>). This correlation was verified by quantification in a microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan) at the very beginning of the first in vivo experiment as well as the end of the last one, demonstrating the stability of the triple reporter expression in the AnTat 1.1E AMLuc/TY1/tdTomato selected sub-clone over time, especially after at least one full in vivo parasite cycle in the tsetse fly and the mammalian host (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 1C</a>).

The selection of the skin regions for fly feeding was based on mice bioluminescence profiles and parasitaemia. Unfed flies were discarded and fed flies were maintained as previously described. Anaesthetised mice were finally sacrificed by cervical dislocation and their skin was dissected for controlling bioluminescence with an IVIS Spectrum imager (Perkin Elmer). All the flies were dissected and checked for the presence of trypanosomes either 2 or 14 days after their meal on mouse skin by two entomologists blinded to group assignment and experimental procedures. Dissections were performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rotureau et al., 2012</a>), entire midguts were scrutinised by fluorescence microscopy to detect and count living red fluorescent parasites, and positive midguts were further treated for IFA.
