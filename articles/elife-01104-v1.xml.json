For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess the postmortem interval (PMI), but errors can range from days to months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids many of these limitations. Here we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days. Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI."

For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess the postmortem interval (PMI), but errors can range from days to months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids many of these limitations. Here we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days. Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI."

Sequencing studies have been used to highlight the significant differences between microbial communities found in different parts of the body, and to follow the evolution of the gut microbiome from birth. Most of these studies have focused on live animals, so little is known about what happens to the microbiome after its host dies. In particular, it is not known if the changes that occur after death are similar for all individuals. Moreover, the decomposing animal supplies nutrients and carbon to the surrounding ecosystem, but its influence on the microbial community of its immediate environment is not well understood."

The changes were significant and also consistent across the corpses, with the microbial communities in the corpses influencing those in the soil, and vice versa. Metcalf et al. also showed that these measurements could be used to estimate the postmortem interval (the time since death) to within approximately 3 days, which suggests that the work could have applications in forensic science."

Long-standing forms of physical evidence include fingerprints, bloodstains, hairs, fibers, soils, and DNA. However, any object can serve as physical evidence if it provides reliable insight into the activities associated with a death scene or crime. Physical evidence is often of critical importance to a criminal investigation because testimonial evidence, the statements provided by victims, suspects, and witnesses, is frequently incomplete and inaccurate (<a href=\"#bib41\">Saks and Koehler, 2005</a>). To address these limitations of testimony, an investigator will compare the statements to the interpretation of physical evidence. For example, an investigator will require a suspect to provide an alibi to describe his or her whereabouts during the time period of a crime and compare their statement to mobile phone activity."

                        "text": "One of the most difficult forms of physical evidence to establish is the amount of time that has lapsed since death, the postmortem interval (PMI). Establishing the PMI is critical to every death investigation because it facilitates the identification of victims and suspects, the acceptance or rejection of suspect alibis, the distribution of death certificates, and the allocation of assets outlined in wills. However, PMI is difficult to establish because we have a relatively poor understanding of corpse decomposition. To improve the ability to estimate PMI, forensic science has incorporated an ecological perspective. When an animal dies it becomes a large nutrient resource that can support a complex and phylogenetically diverse community of organisms (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mondor et al., 2012</a>). As this decomposer community recycles nutrients, the corpse progresses through several forensically recognized stages of decomposition, including Fresh (before decomposition begins), Active Decay, which includes Bloating and Rupture, and Advanced Decay (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carter et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Parkinson et al., 2009</a>). Biotic signatures associated with these stages of decomposition, such as the development rate of blow fly larvae (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amendt et al., 2007</a>), succession of insects (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horenstein et al., 2010</a>), and changes in the biochemistry of corpse-associated \u2018gravesoil\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tullis and Goff, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Vass et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Benninger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Horenstein et al., 2010</a>), can be used to estimate PMI. However, no method is successful in every scenario (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tibbett and Carter, 2008</a>). For example, limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and egg deposition (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tomberlin et al., 2011</a>), lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Archer and Elgar, 2003</a>), and region-specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gallagher et al., 2010</a>). Using microbial community change to track the progression of decomposition may circumvent many of these limitations because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing."

For example, from the Fresh stage to the Bloat stage, enteric microbes likely contribute to putrefaction by digesting the corpse macromolecules, which in turn generates metabolic byproducts that cause the corpse to bloat (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mondor et al., 2012</a>). Evans proposed that a major shift in microbial communities occurs at the end of bloat when the body cavity ruptures (<a href=\"#bib21\">Evans, 1963</a>), as this key event likely shifts the abdominal cavity from anaerobic to aerobic. Additionally at the Rupture stage, nutrient rich body fluids are released into the environment often increasing pH (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carter et al., 2010</a>) likely altering endogenous microbial communities. The microbiology of corpse decomposition can now be investigated in detail by utilizing sequencing advances that enable entire communities to be characterized across the timeline of decomposition. These data will not only allow us to understand the underlying microbial ecology of corpse decomposition, but also the feasibility of using microbes as evidence. We must rigorously test whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate estimates of past events such as the PMI. Recently, <a href=\"#bib38\">Pechal et al. (2013)</a> demonstrated that skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of three swine corpses over 5 days. Here, we expand upon these initial promising results by characterizing microbial community change in three external sites and one invasively sampled internal site in 40 destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days. In addition to characterizing bacterial community change of skin samples, we provide the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial communities in the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils. Furthermore, we present the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial eukaryotic community change (e.g., fungi, nematodes, and amoeba) associated with skin sites, the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils."

We characterized bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes using a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample. To characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities, we extracted DNA and sequenced partial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes for each sample. To characterize the microbial eukaryotic community of each sample, we sequenced partial 18S rRNA genes. To accurately characterize these highly diverse microbial communities, we sequenced \u223c100 base pairs of both 16S and 18S amplicons at a depth of millions of sequences using the Illumina HiSeq platform. In order to gain species and genus level taxonomic resolution of key taxa, a much longer fragment of the rRNA gene (roughly 800 base pairs for 16S amplicons and 1200 base pairs for 18S amplicons) was also sequenced at a level of thousands of sequences for a subset of early and late stage decomposition samples on the Pacific Biosciences RS platform. Together, these data allowed us to assess hypotheses long-held by the forensic community about the role of microbes in corpse decomposition, and rigorously test whether changes in microbial communities are predictable over the timeline of decomposition, which is crucial for assessing whether microbes can be used as a \u2018clock\u2019 to estimate PMI."

By using a mouse model, we were able to perform a highly replicated experiment with destructive sampling that enabled us to sample both the surface and interior of each corpse at each sampling time point. Importantly, this approach facilitated access to the abdominal cavity prior to natural corpse rupture, and thus our data addresses forensic hypotheses that the abdominal microbes play a key role in corpse decomposition (<a href=\"#bib21\">Evans, 1963</a>). This approach contrasts with typical forensic studies of decomposition where one to three donated corpses of human or swine (used as a human model) are used for experiments where only externally accessible body sites are sampled (e.g., <a href=\"#bib38\">Pechal et al., 2013</a>). A further advantage of using a mouse model system is that the large number of samples allowed us to assess to what extent the intra-individual variation of microbiota that we know is present in living humans and other mammals (<a href=\"#bib18\">Costello et al., 2009</a>) extends to microbial community change during decomposition."

Second, after the conclusion of the experiment, we measured the pH of soil samples to estimate the timeframe during which the purging of fluids or Rupture had likely occurred. It is well established that decomposition fluids are released from a body during decomposition (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carter et al., 2007</a>). These fluids are a pulse of nutrients that increase the pH of the surrounding soil. Measurements of soil pH indicated that Rupture (Active Decay) occurred between days 6 and 9 of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Overall, we concluded that the mice were in the Fresh stage on approximately days 0\u20133, the Active Decay stage on days 6\u201320 (with Bloat primarily occurring after day 3 until day 9 and Rupture occurring after day 6 and before day 9) and the Advanced Decay on days 20\u201348.

Rupture is a crucial stage during decomposition, in which bloating due to putrefaction breaks open the abdominal cavity, and is expected to result in shifts of the microbial community because the cavity becomes aerobic. Early culture-based investigations conducted without soil lent support to this assumption by showing that many bacteria exploiting a carcass are members of the gut microbiota (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ingram and Dainty, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Corry, 1978</a>). Our results also lend support to these long-held hypotheses.

However, after rupture occurs (\u223c9 days after the start of the experiment), these taxa decrease dramatically, and exposure of the abdominal cavity to oxygen allows aerobes such as members of the Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) in the families Phyllobacteriaceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, and Brucellaceae (e.g. <i>Pseudochrobactrum</i> and <i>Ochrobactrum</i>) to dominate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>).

One potential contributing factor to the nematode bloom may have been the fact that the mouse graves were relatively closed systems that would have prevented entry of organisms preying on nematodes. Future experiments with open systems will be necessary to determine the impact of higher trophic levels on community dynamics."

By regressing known postmortem interval directly on the taxon relative abundances using a Random Forests model. Random Forests is a machine learning technique that creates random decision trees based on subsets of the features (e.g., taxa) in the data, then chooses the subsets of features that are best able to classify samples into predefined groups using only part of the data. This technique has been useful in other microbial ecology studies, providing high classifier accuracy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Knights et al., 2011</a>). We discovered that the temporal change in microbial communities of the skin of the head allowed us to estimate PMI within as little as 3.30 +/\u2212 2.52 days (mean absolute error +/\u2212 standard deviation) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Regressions performed for the timeframe of 0\u201334 days resulted in the smallest mean absolute error (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>), which suggests that microbes may be more highly informative for estimating PMI during the earlier stages of decomposition, at least for the sites we sampled. However, this trend may also be due to less frequent sampling events between days 13\u201348. It may be possible to further improve error estimates with more frequent sampling."

For each sample site, we estimated the \u2018importance\u2019 of each taxon, a measure of its contribution to the PMI estimate, by removing each taxon from the predictive model and calculating the mean percent increase in mean squared error (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). For bacteria, taxa in the Order Rhizobiales were among the most important predictive taxa at each sample site. For microbial eukaryotes, <i>Oscheius</i> was the most important taxon for skin and abdominal sites and the second most important for gravesoil. Fungal taxa of the family Boletales were the most important contributors to PMI regressions for gravesoil. An analysis of models built using small numbers of highly predictive taxa indicates that 5\u201310 taxa provide approximately the same prediction accuracy as models built with all taxa, as assessed by leave-one-out analyses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

Additionally, we have provided the first bacterial high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity and gravesoil as well as the first microbial eukaryotic high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity, gravesoil, and skin sites of a decomposing animal. We also demonstrated that combining complementary sequencing technologies yields high-resolution taxonomic data. Furthermore, the approach described here has several advantages that make widespread adoption of these techniques likely in the future, including continued rapid decline in the cost of DNA sequencing and the ease and familiarity of swab-based sampling at potential crime scenes to law enforcement officers. Given the accuracy of our estimates of PMI, our work suggests a potentially expanded role for microbiological forensic indicators within the criminal justice system. However, the degree to which microbial community changes are sensitive to factors including environmental and edaphic conditions, variation in the human microbiome, and differences among host species, remain to be established in future work. It is promising that <a href=\"#bib38\">Pechal et al. (2013)</a> recently discovered a similar consistent change of skin bacterial communities on three decomposing swine in an outdoor setting. Future studies are crucial because previous forensic investigations using traditional indicators has shown that environmental parameters such as temperature, moisture, soil type, and soil texture can affect the rate at which decomposition occurs and the ability of decomposer organisms to function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carter et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2010</a>). It is likely that these parameters will affect postmortem microbial communities. Consequently, the relationship between these parameters, decomposition, and postmortem microbial communities must be understood to develop a method to estimate PMI that is admissible as physical evidence within the criminal justice system. However, the present work strongly indicates that decomposition is sufficiently reproducible as an indicator of PMI to motivate these additional studies."

To sample the internal abdominal cavity, we utilized two techniques depending on whether the abdominal cavity could hold liquid or not. In early time points (abdominal cavity integrity, day 0\u201320), we used a 26 G 1 ml syringe with 0.5 ml of saline to flush and extract microbes from the abdominal cavity.

We also sampled soil from underneath each mouse corpse during the experiment. Immediately after sampling and removing the corpse, surface soil was sampled from under the mouse for a total of four samples associated with each decomposing mouse corpse (or five samples total for mice for which two abdominal samples were taken). Additionally, we collected soil samples at days 0, 6, 20, and 48 from a set of no-corpse control soils that were set up the same as the mice graves (\u223c200\u2013300 \u00d7 <i>g</i> of soil in a clean 500 ml plastic container).

These reads were 100 bp in length. We classified sequence reads into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) on the basis of sequence similarity. Because our sample set included soil and highly decomposed material, we suspected that a substantial number of sequences would not be represented in the reference Greengenes alignment. Therefore, we utilized the QIIME software open-reference OTU picking protocol. Briefly, sequence reads were initially clustered against the February 2011 release of the Greengenes 97% reference dataset (<a href=\"http://greengenes.secondgenome.com/\">http://greengenes.secondgenome.com</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">DeSantis et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McDonald et al., 2012</a>). Sequences that did not hit the Greengenes dataset were subsequently clustered into de novo OTUs at 97% similarity with UCLUST. Taxonomy was assigned using the RDP classifier (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cole et al., 2009</a>) within QIIME retrained on the Greengenes 2011 reference dataset. The representative sequences of all OTUs were then aligned to the Greengenes reference alignment using PyNAST (<a href=\"#bib10\">Caporaso et al., 2010</a>) and this alignment was used to construct a phylogenetic tree using FastTree (<a href=\"#bib39\">Price et al., 2010</a>) within QIIME. Sequences that did not align to Greengenes with a 70% similarity threshold were assumed to be non-16S and thus artifactual and removed from further analysis. The resulting tree topology with associated branch lengths was used for subsequent diversity analyses. We removed low abundance OTU\u2019s making up &lt;0.0005% of reads in the total dataset as recommended for Illumina generated data (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bokulich et al., 2013</a>) and removed samples with less than 2500 sequences (for many downstream analyses, samples were rarified at 2500 sequences per sample)."

The dataset was further filtered to exclude all sequences assigned to vertebrate animals, as these likely correspond to the mouse host.

In both cases high quality circular consensus sequences (CCS) were used. The 16S PacBio data consists of sequences of 800\u2013900 bp in length. The taxonomic identity of the sequences was assessed by assigning sequences to OTUs using the Greengenes February 2011 release of the Greengenes (<a href=\"#bib20\">DeSantis et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">McDonald et al., 2012</a>) 97% reference dataset. Taxonomy assignments of the long PacBio reads agreed with the short Illumina reads at the family level and the long reads made is possible to determine the taxonomic identity of the reads to the genus and in most cases species level. Taxonomy of the PacBio sequences was also verified by placing sequences within a phylogenetic tree using RAxML EPA algorithm (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berger et al., 2011</a>). The 18S PacBio sequences were roughly 1200 base pairs in length. The 18S data was clustered into OTUs at 97% similarity using the open-reference protocol described above and the curated Silva 108 database. Initial taxonomy assignment was done by BLAST (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altschul et al., 1990</a>) with an e-value threshold of e-10. Taxonomy assignment was refined by placing the sequences within the Silva 108 reference tree using maximum likelihood with RAxML EPA. These resulting taxonomy assignments were used to resolve the taxonomy of highly abundant community members. Bacterial and microbial eukaryotic taxa found were sorted by abundance at each site are reported in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary File 1B</a>. Genus and species level taxonomy was reported in relevant text of the manuscript. Because PacBio data were generated from only a small subset of samples we did not use these data for comparative analyses, and all statistical analyses were conducted using the Illumina HiSeq data."

We explored taxon abundance patterns by tracking changes in the abundance of taxa over time using custom python scripts. We determined the most changing taxa by assessing abundance at final time point minus abundance at initial time point (using both percentage, count, and combined measures). We tested whether sample sites during Advanced Decay had similar taxa become abundant by comparing weighted UniFrac distances between sites in each the Fresh stage and the Advanced Decay stage. Alpha diversity was estimated using the phylogenetic diversity metric as well as Shannon diversity. These analyses were performed using the QIIME software. To assess the correlation between microbial community change and time, we performed Mantel tests (with recommended option for single factor tests: unrestricted permutation of raw data) using the software package PRIMER v6 (<a href=\"#bib21a\">Clarke and Gorley, 2006</a>). Additionally, we tested for significant changes in microbial communities between the Fresh and Advanced Decay stages for each site and data type with a PERMANOVA test in PRIMER v6 (<a href=\"#bib21a\">Clarke and Gorley, 2006</a>).

From these LOO errors we calculated the mean error, and standard deviation of the errors with units of days. We performed these regressions within each sample site separately and for bacteria and eukaryotes separately with and without the first and last time points (0 and 48 days) to determine the best body site and timeframe for predicting PMI. Since skin and soil demonstrated the best predictive power (\u2018Results\u2019), we also merged OTU tables from skin and soil sites as well as marker type to potentially further improve our PMI estimates."

In short, we want to see the text extensively revised to offer a more in-depth discussion. Not only of how specific numbers were arrived at, e.g., post-mortem interval estimates, but also of the implications of the work. Also, a more detailed discussion of how the current work represents a major leap beyond <a href=\"#bib38\">Pechal et al. 2013</a> would be welcome. As you will see, we all made individual recommendations which, after discussing amongst ourselves, feel need to be addressed. Thus, I have included them below to help guide you in the revisions. Please note that at this point we feel that aside from the revisions, no additional data collection/experiments are deemed necessary. Also, we feel that as it currently stands <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> does not add to the manuscript and should be deleted. Alternatively, if you provide a strong case for leaving it in and revise the manuscript to clarify how it supports your findings and main points, it could ultimately be useful."

Why were processes in the abdomen less consistent/reproducible than those that occurred on corpse skin? Would the appearance and abundance of generalist nematodes offer advantages because their numbers might simply reflect total bacteria and be more independent from the specific taxa present? The samples in the time series were from corpses that were \u2018incubated\u2019 under controlled conditions \u2013 would the outcome change if the environment (climate) was more variable? Were there specific taxa that were particularly good indicators of PMI (and can this approach be tested as a means to improve the usefulness of abdominal samples)? Why are the successional processes on decomposition skin more reproducible than those of the abdomen? Is this likely to be the case with other species? ... and so on. The authors can make this manuscript more interesting than it is in its present form."

Given the emphasis of the manuscript is prediction over time, I suggest explicitly marking time on the x axis throughout these figures, and including the point of rupture on all graphs.

We think it is worth noting that the environmental change that the abdominal microbial community is exposed to after rupture is much more drastic (anaerobic vs aerobic) than the skin and soil microbial communities experience. Perhaps this dramatic change in environment leads to more stochastic responses by the abdominal microbial community. We have added a brief discussion of this to the manuscript."

The overall method that we are championing here is to use the Tree of Life to the fullest extent. However, we did also include a new analysis indicating that using 5-10 highly predictive taxa provide approximately the same leave-one-out prediction accuracy as models built with all taxa (see new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).
