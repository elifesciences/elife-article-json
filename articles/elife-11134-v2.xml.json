Due to the dynamic nature of the four-protein complex it has long been refractory to structural characterization.

The structures show how the polymerase is tethered to the DNA through multiple contacts with the clamp and exonuclease. A novel contact between the polymerase and clamp is made in the DNA bound state, facilitated by a large movement of the polymerase tail domain and \u03c4<sub>c</sub>. These structures provide crucial insights into the organization of the catalytic core of the replisome and form an important step towards determining the structure of the complete holoenzyme."

                        "text": "In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, DNA replication is highly efficient with speeds of up 600\u20131000 nucleotides per second (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mok and Marians, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mcinerney et al., 2007</a>), &gt;100,000 basepairs (bp) synthesized per binding event (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yao et al., 2009</a>), and an error rate of \u223c1 per million (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloom et al., 1997</a>). Importantly, DNA replication is greatly complicated by the antiparallel orientation of the two DNA strands that need to be replicated simultaneously. To do so, DNA replication is performed by a large multi-protein complex termed the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme that synthesizes the leading strand in a continuous manner, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short fragments of \u223c1000 bp. The holoenzyme is composed of 10 subunits (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b5, \u03b8, \u03b4, \u03b4', \u03b3, \u03c4, \u03c7, \u03c8), that together with the helicase DnaB and the RNA primase DnaG form the replisome with a combined molecular weight of 1\u00a0MDa. The replisome can be divided into three functional subcomplexes that together catalyze a series of events. The helicase DnaB separates the two DNA strands (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mok and Marians, 1987</a>) and transiently associates with the RNA primase DnaG that synthesizes short RNA primers required for DNA synthesis at the lagging strand (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wu et al., 1992</a>). The clamp loader subcomplex (\u03b4, \u03b4', \u03b3, \u03c4, \u03c7, \u03c8) loads the DNA sliding clamp \u03b2, the processivity factor for the DNA polymerase, onto the DNA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stukenberg et al., 1991</a>). It furthermore connects the leading and lagging strand polymerases via its \u03c4 subunits (<a href=\"#bib30\">McHenry, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Onrust et al., 1995</a>). Finally, DNA synthesis is performed by the polymerase subcomplex that contains the DNA polymerase III \u03b1 (PolIII\u03b1), the DNA sliding clamp \u03b2, the proofreading exonuclease \u03b5, and the C-terminal domain of the clamp loader subunit \u03c4. The activity of PolIII\u03b1 is poor in isolation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maki and Kornberg, 1985</a>) and is greatly enhanced by its associated proteins. For error-free DNA synthesis the polymerase relies on the exonuclease \u03b5 that removes any misincorporated bases and decreases the error rate of DNA replication by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#bib40\">Scheuermann et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lancy et al., 1989</a>). In addition, the exonuclease strengthens the interactions between the polymerase and clamp as it binds both proteins simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib48\">Toste R\u00eago et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jergic et al., 2013</a>). For processivity, PolIII\u03b1 binds to the DNA sliding clamp (\u03b2 subunit) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stukenberg et al., 1991</a>). At the leading strand this interaction is stable and results in DNA segments of &gt;100.000 bp synthesized per binding event (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yao et al., 2009</a>). At the lagging strand in contrast, DNA synthesis is discontinuous, with an averaged length of 1000 bp synthesized per fragment, depending on the frequency of the RNA primase activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wu, Zechner and Marians, 1992</a>). This therefore requires repeated binding and release of the polymerase and clamp. Finally, the C-terminal domain of \u03c4 (\u03c4<sub>c</sub>) acts as a 'processivity switch' for the polymerase to enable repeated binding and release at the lagging strand (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Georgescu et al., 2009</a>). How this tetrameric complex of PolIII\u03b1-clamp-exonuclease-\u03c4<sub>c</sub> assembles and how it is repeatedly loaded and released during lagging strand synthesis is poorly understood."

The structure of the PolIII\u03b1-clamp-exonuclease-\u03c4<sub>c</sub> complex on the other hand has remained elusive due to its dynamic nature that forms a significant hurdle for structure determination. To overcome this, we have used a combination of site directed mutagenesis and computational classification of different structural states to determine the cryo-EM structures of the complex in both a DNA-bound and a DNA-free state to 8\u2009\u00c5 resolution. The well defined features of the cryo-EM maps enable the unambiguous fitting of the crystal structures of the individual proteins, revealing the unique interactions between the four proteins and DNA. In the DNA-bound complex, the polymerase is tethered to the DNA through multiple contacts with the clamp. The interaction with the clamp is further stabilized by the exonuclease that is wedged between the two proteins and forms a second, indirect interaction between polymerase and clamp. Strikingly, a large conformational change in the polymerase switches its tail domain from interacting with the clamp in the DNA-bound structure, to more than 30\u2009\u00c5 away from the clamp in the DNA-free structure. Finally, the processivity switch \u03c4<sub>c</sub> binds the tail of the polymerase and appears to sequester the polymerase tail away from the clamp in the DNA-free structure. Hence, our structures provide crucial insights into the regulation of the replicative DNA polymerase PolIII\u03b1 by its associated proteins clamp, exonuclease and \u03c4<sub>c</sub>. They furthermore form a crucial step towards determining the structure of the complete DNA polymerase III holoenzyme."

Therefore, to stabilize the complex we altered the sequences of the clamp binding motifs of PolIII\u03b1 and the exonuclease to increase the affinity for the clamp. For this we used sequences derived from the translesion DNA polymerase UmuC and the DNA replication initiation factor Hda that out of a panel of 15 peptide sequences were the most potent inhibitors of the interaction between the polymerase and clamp (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wijffels et al., 2004</a>) (see Materials and methods for more details). The obtained complex is &gt;100 fold more stable than the wild-type complex (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) This stabilized complex of PolIII\u03b1, clamp and exonuclease was used together with \u03c4<sub>500</sub> (the polymerase-binding domain of \u03c4: residues 500\u2013643) and a 25 base pair (bp) DNA substrate to prepare samples for cryo-EM (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Three structurally distinct groups of particles could be identified from a single data set (63,215 particles). Two of these represent the PolIII\u03b1-clamp-exonuclease-\u03c4<sub>500</sub> with and without DNA bound (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). The third class contains DNA too, but in this complex the tail domain of the polymerase and \u03c4<sub>500</sub> are not visible due to structural heterogeneity. The DNA-bound (5663 particles) and DNA-free (16,970 particles) structures were refined to 8.0 and 8.3\u2009\u00c5 resolution, respectively (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> for details). The remaining particles (40,582) were classified into the third class in which the tail domain is not visible. Due to the larger number of particles, this structure was refined to 7.3\u2009\u00c5 resolution. As this structure is otherwise identical to the complete DNA-bound complex, it will not be discussed further."

Instead, the exonuclease is wedged between the clamp and the thumb domain of PolIII\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right panel). The catalytic domain of the exonuclease is in direct contact with the polymerase thumb domain whereas the contact with the clamp is mediated via a canonical clamp binding motif that is located immediately downstream of the catalytic domain (<a href=\"#bib48\">Toste R\u00eago et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jergic et al., 2013</a>). This clamp binding motif is bound to the pocket of the clamp in a manner similar to the polymerase in the other half of the clamp (<i>cf</i>. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>) and hence both pockets of the dimeric clamp are occupied in the ternary complex. Downstream of the clamp binding motif the tail of the exonuclease follows the contours of the polymerase PHP domain, where it is disordered for a stretch of \u223c15 residues that were shown to be mobile by NMR (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ozawa et al., 2013</a>). Finally, the C-terminal helix of the exonuclease that mediates most of the binding to the polymerase (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ozawa et al., 2013</a>) packs tightly against the PHP domain of PolIII\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left and right panel), similar to the crystal structure of the PolIII\u03b1-PHP domain and C-terminal helix of the exonuclease (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ozawa et al., 2013</a>). Hence, in the ternary complex the exonuclease simultaneously binds the polymerase and clamp. By doing so it strengthens the association between the two proteins (<a href=\"#bib48\">Toste R\u00eago et al., 2013</a>), which is required for processive DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jergic et al., 2013</a>). Previously, we built an approximate model for the polymerase, clamp and exonuclease complex, using distance restraints provided by chemical cross-linking coupled to mass-spectrometry (<a href=\"#bib48\">Toste R\u00eago et al., 2013</a>). When we map the same cross-links onto the cryo-EM model we find an improved fit of the cross-links with the model, due to the conformational changes in the complex as well as the detailed information about the interactions between the proteins that could not be modeled based on the cross-links alone (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The C-terminal end of \u03c4 is in contact with the tail of the polymerase. Unfortunately, the last 23 residues of \u03c4 that bind the polymerase (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jergic et al., 2007</a>) are not part of the NMR structure and are therefore not present in our model. A second contact is found between the globular domain of \u03c4<sub>500</sub> and the fingers domain of the polymerase. This contact is mediated by residues 530\u2013535 and 562\u2013566 of \u03c4<sub>500</sub> and residues 657\u2013667 of PolIII\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Here, several positively charged residues (K831, K872, R876, R877, K881) as well as the positive charge of the helix dipole of two helices (residues 842\u2013856 and 875\u2013886) are pointed towards the DNA backbone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). At this position, the OB domain is in close proximity of the DNA but makes no contacts with it (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Instead, the OB domain forms a bridge between the PolIII\u03b1 fingers domain, thumb domain, and the exonuclease. Furthermore, while the isolated OB domain has been shown to bind to ssDNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Georgescu et al., 2009</a>), in this complex the OB domain is \u223c40\u2009\u00c5 away from the ssDNA template. The DNA furthermore interacts with the clamp that surrounds the DNA like a nut around a bolt (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Several non-specific contacts are made to the backbone of the DNA providing an electrostatic cushion for the DNA to pass through as it leaves the complex. Compared to the crystal structure of the isolated clamp bound to DNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Georgescu et al., 2008a</a>) the clamp is rotated by \u223c20\u00b0, resulting in an almost perpendicular orientation (\u223c80\u00b0) with respect to the DNA. In the 19\u2009\u00c5, negative stain EM structure of <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i> PolB, the only other known structure of a DNA polymerase in complex with clamp and DNA, the DNA runs straight through the clamp as well (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mayanagi et al., 2011</a>). <strike></strike>"

In contrast, the <i>E. coli</i> DNA polymerases Pol I, Pol II, and Pol IV have synthesis speeds of 15, 10, and 1 nt/s, respectively (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schwartz and Quake, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Indiani et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, in isolation PolIII\u03b1 has a surprisingly low affinity for DNA when compared to the other E. coli DNA polymerase (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Because of its weak binding to DNA, PolIII\u03b1 must therefore have developed a different way to keep itself correctly positioned on the DNA during rapid DNA synthesis. To this effect, PolIII\u03b1 may have evolved its uniquely long fingers domain that is more than twice as long as the other <i>E. coli</i> DNA polymerases (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These polymerases have considerably smaller fingers domains, use shorter regions of DNA contacts, and have shorter predicted distances between the polymerase active site and the clamp (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In PolIII\u03b1, the number of base pairs between the 3\u2019 end of the primer and the opening of the clamp is 22, while the predicted number of base pairs for Pol I, Pol II, and Pol IV is \u223c15. This unusually long DNA-protein contact appears to be well suited to accurately position the DNA without requiring tight binding that could slow down the translocation of the DNA. At the same time, the sequence-independent backbone contacts and the perfectly straight B-form DNA may facilitate the rapid exit of the DNA from the active site. The active site itself is wrapped tightly around the DNA where PolIII\u03b1 is the only polymerase that inserts a loop of the thumb domain into the major groove of the DNA, while the thumb domains of Pol I, Pol II, and Pol IV only have backbone contacts with the DNA (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Hence, it seems plausible that this combination of unique contacts with the DNA may have evolved to support the high speeds of DNA synthesis by PolIII\u03b1 without compromising accuracy."

                                "text": "To enable the many contacts with the DNA, the complex undergoes extensive conformational changes from the DNA-free to the DNA-bound state. Most prominent is a \u223c35\u00b0 rotation of the polymerase tail and \u03c4<sub>500</sub>, which move from a position over the polymerase active site to a position adjacent to the sliding clamp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The simultaneous movement of the polymerase tail and \u03c4<sub>c</sub> results in a 70\u2009\u00c5 displacement of the globular domain of \u03c4<sub>500</sub>. The tail of PolIII\u03b1 consists of the OB domain (residues 960\u20131071) and the C-terminal \u03c4-binding domain (residues 1079\u20131160). Together with \u03c4<sub>500</sub> they form a rigid structure that shows few changes between the DNA free and DNA bound structure, indicating that the interaction between \u03c4<sub>500</sub> and the tail of PolIII\u03b1 must be stable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As a result of the repositioning of the polymerase tail, the contact between \u03c4<sub>500</sub> and the fingers domain of the polymerase is broken and a new contact between the OB domain and the clamp is forged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The OB domain makes two new contacts with the clamp via a short helix (1035\u20131043) and a long protruding loop (1003\u20131013) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). These motifs contact the clamp at loops 24\u201328 and 275\u2013278, respectively. Hence in the DNA-bound complex, the polymerase has three points of contact to the clamp: one via the canonical clamp binding motif (residues 920\u2013925: <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>); one indirectly via the exonuclease (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>); and one contact via the OB domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Previously, it has been shown that a triple mutation in OB domain result in reduced DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Georgescu et al., 2009</a>) which was attributed to the loss of ssDNA binding by the OB domain. However, in our structure the OB domain is far away (\u223c40\u2009\u00c5) from the ssDNA overhang of the template strand. Instead, the mutations (R1004S, K1009S, R1010S) are located at the interface between the OB domain and the clamp (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and therefore could weaken the interaction between the polymerase and clamp, providing an alternative explanation for the reduced DNA synthesis."

                        "text": "Our cryo-EM structures furthermore provide a crucial insight into the structural organization of the replicative DNA polymerase and its associated proteins clamp, exonuclease and \u03c4<sub>500</sub>. They show how the clamp and exonuclease tether the polymerase to the DNA through multiple contacts. Importantly, they also reveal a large conformational change where the tail of the polymerase moves from interacting with the clamp in the DNA-bound state, to a position 35\u2009\u00c5 away from the clamp in the DNA-free state. What may be the role for such a conformational change? On the lagging strand, the polymerase repositions to a newly primed site every \u223c1000 bp. To do so, the polymerase needs to release both clamp and DNA. We propose that the switch-like movement of the polymerase tail may play a part in the release and consequent repositioning of the polymerase at the end of the Okazaki fragment. A hypothetical model describing how this could work is presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. During DNA synthesis, the tail of the polymerase is bound to the clamp, stabilizing the interaction between polymerase and clamp (marked with \u20181\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This confirmation may be further stabilized by the presence of a DNA binding region immediately upstream of \u03c4<sub>500</sub> (marked with \u20182\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jergic et al., 2007</a>). Upon encounter of a release signal, \u03c4<sub>500</sub> rebind to the polymerase fingers domain (marked with \u20183\u2019) thus sequestering the polymerase tail away from the clamp (marked with \u20184\u2019) and initiating the dissociation of the polymerase from clamp and DNA. What could serve as the release trigger? Two non-exclusive models have been proposed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li and Marians, 2000</a>). In the \u2018collision' model, the encounter with the dsDNA of the previous Okazaki fragment induces the release of the polymerase. In support of this model, it has been shown that a decreasing gap size between the 3' terminus of the lagging strand and the 5' end of the previously synthesized Okazaki fragment promotes release of the polymerase (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Georgescu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Dohrmann et al., 2011</a>). Two possible sensors for the decreasing gap on the lagging strand have been suggested. The ssDNA binding properties of the OB domain in the tail of the polymerase has been proposed to play a role in the sensing of the ssDNA vs dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Georgescu et al., 2009</a>). Yet our cryo-EM models show that the OB domain is \u223c40\u2009\u00c5 away from the ssDNA and that it is involved in binding to the sliding clamp. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the C-terminal fragment of \u03c4 may act as the sensor as it is required to release the polymerase from a decreasing gap size (<a href=\"#bib23\">Leu et al., 2003</a>). Indeed, it was found that the region in \u03c4, immediately upstream of \u03c4<sub>500</sub>, has DNA binding affinity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jergic et al., 2007</a>)."

The release trigger may either come from a collision with the previous Okazaki fragment (indicated with \u2018Collision\u2019), or a signal from other replisome components via the flexible linker of \u03c4 (indicated with \u2018Signaling\u2019). Once the polymerase-tail clamp contact has been broken, the two remaining contacts between the clamp and polymerase-exonuclease are not enough to keep the polymerase bound to the clamp. The polymerase is released from clamp and DNA and can be repositioned to a newly primed site to reinitiate DNA synthesis."

The alternative \u2018signaling\u2019 model therefore proposes that the trigger comes from one of the other components of the replisome such as the RNA primase DnaG, based on the observation that the increased primase concentration results in shorter lagging strand fragments (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wu, Zechner and Marians, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Li and Marians, 2000</a>). However, it was recently shown that the presence of a primer alone is sufficient to induce release at the lagging strand and that activity of the primase is not required (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan and McHenry, 2014</a>). How the presence of the RNA primer is signaled to the polymerase remains unclear. Yet, the fact that the \u03c4 protein is both part of the clamp loader complex that positions clamps onto the primer and simultaneously binds the polymerase makes this a suitable conveyor of the signal. While our structures do not discriminate between the type of release trigger for the lagging strand polymerase, they do now provide the means to test the precise workings of the molecular switch that enables the release of the polymerase."

Images were collected in single-electron counting mode at a calibrated magnification of 28.571x (1.76\u2009\u00c5/pixel), using a flux of 2 e/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>/sec and a total dose of 40 e/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> over a total of 20 frames. Frames were aligned and averaged using whole-image movement correction using MOTIONCORR (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Contrast transfer function parameters were calculated using CTFFIND3 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</a>). All subsequent particle picking and data processing was performed using Relion-1.3 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Scheres, 2012</a>), with the exception of the generation of the initial model, which was done using Eman2 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). A total of 1350 micrographs were recorded from which &gt;550,000 particles were picked automatically in Relion. After 2D classification, a large number of spurious particles as well as particles that show free polymerase or free clamp were removed, yielding a dataset of \u223c90,000 particles. After 3D classification a another \u223c27,000 were removed to yield a final dataset of 63,215 particles. From these, six 3D classes were calculated that were subsequently merged into the final three 3D classes of 'DNA-free' (16,970 particles), 'DNA-bound' (5663 particles) and 'DNA-bound, no tail' (40,582 particles). Particle-based movement correction and per-frame B-factor weighting to account for radiation damage and unresolved particle movement was performed in the later stages of refinement using the particle polishing option in Relion (<a href=\"#bib39\">Scheres, 2014</a>). Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard FSC-0.143 criterion (<a href=\"#bib38\">Scheres and Chen, 2012</a>) and FSC-curves were corrected for the convolution effects of a soft mask using high-resolution noise-substitution (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). All density maps were sharpened by applying a negative B-factor that was estimated using automated procedures (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>). We believe that the resolution of these reconstructions is limited by both the relatively small size of the complex (250\u2009kDa), which hampers accurate alignment and classification, and the inherent flexibility of this four-protein and DNA complex. Still, the maps are of excellent quality, with individual helices, \u03b2-sheets, and loops clearly visible in the map (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Interesting findings include: 1) showing that the rigid-body module composed of the C-terminal part of the clamp loader and the polymerase tail undergoes a large rearrangement upon DNA binding, and 2) that there is a new contact point between \u03c4 and the polymerase in the apo configuration, and different one, formed in the presence of DNA, between the OB-fold domain of the polymerase and the clamp. This work represents a highly significant advance in the science of sliding clamps, and the mechanism by which DNA polymerase functions on them. This structural study identifies an entirely new connection of the polymerase to the clamp. This new connection only occurs when the polymerase binds a primed template. The connection is in a new location, outside the two typical hydrophobic pockets on clamps that are the usual target of protein trafficking."

The quality of the EM reconstructions is very good, especially considering the small size of the complex (~250 kDa), and the heterogeneity present in the sample. The newly identified contacts between the polymerase, clamp, and \u03c4 provide a logical and long-desired molecular picture of why holoenzyme formation leads to improved processivity and potentially of how PolIII alters its structural state in response to binding DNA (which may be important for polymerase recycling during lagging strand synthesis). Overall, the work provides valuable new insights into important DNA replication events and stands to have a long-lasting impact on the field."
