However, the mechanism by which microglia contribute to the disorder is unclear and recent data suggest that microglia do not play a causative role<a href=\"#bib67\">. Here, we use the retinogeniculate system to determine if and how microglia contribute to pathogenesis in a RTT mouse model, the <i>Mecp2</i> null mouse (<i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></i>). We demonstrate that microglia contribute to pathogenesis by excessively engulfing, thereby eliminating, presynaptic inputs at end stages of disease (\u2265P56 <i>Mecp2</i> null mice) concomitant with synapse loss. Furthermore, loss or gain of <i>Mecp2</i> expression specifically in microglia (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER</sup>;Mecp2<sup>fl/y</sup></i>or <i>Cx3cr1<sup>Cr</sup></i><sup>eER</sup>; <i>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup></i>) had little effect on excessive engulfment, synapse loss, or phenotypic abnormalities. Taken together, our data suggest that microglia contribute to end stages of disease by dismantling neural circuits rendered vulnerable by loss of <i>Mecp2</i> in other CNS cell types.</a></a></a></a></a>"

However, the mechanism by which microglia contribute to the disorder is unclear and recent data suggest that microglia do not play a causative role<a href=\"#bib67\">. Here, we use the retinogeniculate system to determine if and how microglia contribute to pathogenesis in a RTT mouse model, the <i>Mecp2</i> null mouse (<i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></i>). We demonstrate that microglia contribute to pathogenesis by excessively engulfing, thereby eliminating, presynaptic inputs at end stages of disease (\u2265P56 <i>Mecp2</i> null mice) concomitant with synapse loss. Furthermore, loss or gain of <i>Mecp2</i> expression specifically in microglia (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER</sup>;Mecp2<sup>fl/y</sup></i>or <i>Cx3cr1<sup>Cr</sup></i><sup>eER</sup>; <i>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup></i>) had little effect on excessive engulfment, synapse loss, or phenotypic abnormalities. Taken together, our data suggest that microglia contribute to end stages of disease by dismantling neural circuits rendered vulnerable by loss of <i>Mecp2</i> in other CNS cell types.</a></a></a></a></a>"

However, the data have been a subject of increasing controversy (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). The initial study by Derecki et al. transplanted wild-type (WT) bone marrow (BM) into an irradiated mouse model of RTT, <i>Mecp2</i> null mouse (<i>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup>(Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Jae/y</sup>)</i>)prior to phenotypic symptom onset (~4 weeks of age)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Derecki et al., 2012</a>). When WT BM-derived microglia-like cells engrafted the CNS, many RTT-like phenotypes were arrested and lifespan was significantly increased. While data suggested that phagocytic activity of microglia may be disrupted in <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice, it remained unclear precisely how microglia were contributing to the disorder. In a follow-up study, these data were replicated using a more specific, tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver on a <i>Mecp2</i> null background (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>Cr</sup></i><sup>eER</sup><i>;\u00a0Mecp2<sup>lox\u2013stop/y</sup></i>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>). In addition, RNAseq analysis revealed abnormalities in glucocorticoid signaling, hypoxia responses, and inflammatory responses in peripheral macrophages and resident brain microglia isolated from <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice. While these data support a role for myeloid-derived MeCP2 in RTT phenotypes and pathology, another recent study demonstrated little to no effect of re-introducing MeCP2 into myeloid cells by BM chimerism in three different RTT mouse models (<i>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Jae/y</sup>, Mecp2<sup>LucHyg/y</sup></i> and <i>Mecp2<sup>R168X/y</sup>\u00a0</i>mice), or by genetic expression of MeCP2 in hematopoietic cells (including microglia) in a MeCP2 null background (<i>Vav1-Cre; Mecp2<sup>LSL/Y</sup></i>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2015</a>).

Among the functions at developing synapses, we recently showed in the retinogeniculate system that microglia contribute to the process of removing excess synapses by phagocytosing less active or \u2018weaker\u2019 presynaptic inputs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schafer et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, disrupting microglial phagocytic activity resulted in sustained increases in synapse density and connectivity into adulthood. In the current study, we hypothesized that microglia-mediated synaptic remodeling were abnormal in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with aberrant brain wiring and chose RTT to test this hypothesis. In many different RTT mouse models, synaptic circuit dysfunction can be detected often prior to presentation of significant phenotypic abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zoghbi, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Banerjee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dani and Nelson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nguyen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wood et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Noutel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Moretti et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Medrihan et al., 2008</a>).

Furthermore, we use Cre-lox technology to specifically ablate or express <i>Mecp2 in</i> microglia and determine whether these cells play a causative role in the structural and functional synaptic abnormalities.

We hypothesized that microglia were contributing to this late phase refinement by transiently engulfing synapses between P30 and P60. We first confirmed a reduction in retinogeniculate synapses in the late, juvenile brain of WT mice by immunolabeling P30-P60 LGN with antibodies against the RGC-specific presynaptic protein vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2), and the postsynaptic protein Homer1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). There was a significant reduction in the density of RGC-specific synapses (VGlut2/Homer1-positive) and a reduction in VGlut2-positive terminal size between P30 and P60 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). This was in contrast to VGlut1-positive corticocortical synapses, which remain unchanged (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I</a>). To determine whether microglia contribute to late phase synaptic remodeling in the late, juvenile brain and establish a baseline to assess whether these interactions are disrupted in phenotypic <i>Mecp2</i> null mice, we next used our established assay to monitor microglia-synapse interactions in the retinogeniculate system (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schafer et al., 2012</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib57\">2014</a>). One day prior to analysis, RGC inputs were labeled by injection of anterograde dye into both eyes, cholera toxin conjugated to Alexa dye 594 or 647 (CTB-594 or CTB-647), which is resistant to lysosomal degradation. Microglia were labeled by either genetic expression of EGFP (<i>Cx3CR1<sup>EGFP/+\u00a0</sup></i>mice) or by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific to the microglia-marker, Iba-1. Lysosomes that are specific to and within microglia were labeled with an antibody against CD68. Similar to previously published work (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schafer et al., 2012</a>), microglia preferentially engulfed RGC inputs within the LGN at P5 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) compared to older ages. However, our new data revealed a second wave of engulfment that occurred in the juvenile brain specifically at P40, which is downregulated by P50 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>) and accompanied by a transient increase in lysosomal content within microglia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Together with recent work demonstrating decreases in RGC arbor size and bouton numbers between P30 and P60 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hong et al., 2014</a>), our work suggests that microglia contribute to this fine-scale refinement by engulfing RGC presynaptic inputs at P40."

In addition, to measure lysosomal content, microglia were labeled with anti-CD68. Using these methods, we detected no significant difference in microglia-mediated engulfment of retinogeniculate presynaptic inputs in P5-P50 WT or <i>Mecp2</i> null mice compared to WT littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, in late phenotypic P56-P60 (<span class=\"underline\">&gt;</span>P56) <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice, we found significant increases in engulfed inputs and lysosomal content within microglia processes and soma compared to WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). Consistent with engulfment being specific to synaptic compartments, we observed no significant RGC death in the retina or LGN (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and we observed no changes in engulfment of other neuronal compartments including NeuN-positive somas or MAP2-positive dendrites (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition and in contrast to previously published reports (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jin et al., 2015</a>), we observed no significant changes in morphology (as measured by volume of the cell) or density of microglia, indexes of the gross, overall reactive state of these cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013F</a>). However, our analyses were restricted to microglia within the LGN, a region that was not analyzed previously (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jin et al., 2015</a>). These data demonstrate that, while microglia-mediated waves of synaptic engulfment are normal in the P5 and P40 <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null brain, engulfment is excessive in \u2265P56 mice\u2014an age corresponding to late stages of phenotypic regression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guy et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, this timing occurs after significant weakening of single fiber strength at <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null retinogeniculate synapses (<a href=\"#bib52\">Noutel et al., 2011</a>). These data suggest that microglia do not actively induce circuit defects in <i>Mecp2</i> null mice\u00a0but rather facilitate late stage circuit defects by removing previously weakened structural synapses."

We first immunolabeled retinogeniculate presynaptic terminals in P40 and P56-P60 (\u2265P56) <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null and WT littermate brains with an antibody directed against VGlut2. While there was no change in the density of VGlut2 immunoreactivity in P40 <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice compared to WT littermate controls, there was a significant decrease at \u2265P56, a time point corresponding to late-stage phenotypic regression in <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). To determine whether this reduction in VGlut2 was consistent with a loss of synapses, we further assessed P56-P60 (\u2265P56) <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice for changes in retinogeniculate synapse density defined as co-localized presynaptic VGlut2 and postsynaptic Homer1 immunoreactivity. Consistent with the reduction in VGlut2 and excessive synaptic engulfment, there was a significant decrease in retinogeniculate synapses in P56-P60 (\u2265P56) <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice as compared to WT littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)\u00a0and this synapse loss was due to loss of VGlut2-positive terminals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) versus a decrease in the postsynaptic protein Homer1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) or RGC cell death (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Retinogeniculate synapses represent &lt;10% of total synapses within the LGN (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bickford et al., 2010</a>). To assess the other more abundant excitatory synapses, we immunolabeled corticogeniculate synapses with an antibody against VGlut1 within the LGN and observed no significant difference in the density of these synapses or presynaptic terminals. (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>). In addition, we assessed VGlut2 and VGlut1-positive synapse density in a neighboring thalamic nuclei (medial geniculate nucleus, MGN; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013G</a>) and observed no significant loss of these structural synapses. These results demonstrate a specific loss of retinogeniculate presynaptic terminals in late phenotypic \u2265P56 <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null mice concomitant with increased microglia-mediated engulfment of presynaptic inputs."

Furthermore, while deficits in glutamatergic, glucocorticoid, hypoxia, and immune-related pathways have recently been reported in <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null microglia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Derecki et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">Jin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Maezawa and Jin, 2010</a>), it has remained unclear precisely how microglia were contributing to disease on a mechanistic level in vivo. Our data offer significant insight into these unanswered questions. We demonstrate that microglia excessively engulf presynaptic inputs in the <i>Mecp2</i> null LGN concomitant with loss of structural retinogeniculate-specific synapses in the same region. These data are in contrast to previously published work that has suggested microglial phagocytic activity is decreased compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Derecki et al., 2012</a>). However, this discrepancy can be explained by differences in experimental design used to measure phagocytic activity. Assays used to measure phagocytosis in previous work were in vitro in response to the addition of UV-irradiated neural precursor cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Derecki et al., 2012</a>), a context that is very different from assessing engulfment of presynaptic inputs in the retinogeniculate system in vivo. In the same study, annexin V was administered in vivo to block phagocytic activity in <i>Mecp2</i> null mice with WT BM-derived cells (<i>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup>/Lysm<sup>Cre</sup></i>), which resulted in failure of <i>WT</i> BM-derived cells to attenuate phenotypes in <i>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup>\u00a0</i>mice. However, it is unclear where and how annexin V is acting given that phagocytosis was not directly assayed in vivo and the <i>Lysm<sup>Cre</sup></i> induces expression in many myeloid-derived cell types besides microglia. Indeed, this same group published findings that loss of <i>Mecp2</i> primarily affects peripheral myeloid-derived cell numbers and gene expression early in disease and only later affects microglia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>).

The molecular mechanism driving secondary engulfment of synapses in <i>Mecp2</i> null mice and whether modulating this excessive engulfment results in attenuation of synapse loss are also\u00a0unknown. Complement-dependent phagocytic signaling is one mechanism by which microglia have been shown to engulf synapses in the healthy brain, a pathway which is\u00a0also dysregulated in disease (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schafer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stephan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib30\">Hong et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lui et al., 2016</a>). In addition, there are a number of other inflammatory genes that have been identified as dysregulated in <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null microglia and may contribute to increased phagocytic activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>). Finally, we demonstrate that microglia are largely secondary responders in two mouse models of RTT (<i>Mecp2</i> null and <i>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup></i>). It is still possible that microglia may be primary initiators of synaptic defects in other RTT models (<i>Mecp2<sup>-/+</sup>, Mecp2</i> duplication, <i>Mecp2<sup>R270X</sup><sub>\u00a0</sub></i>etc.), a mechanism recently reported in mouse models of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chahrour et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib30\">Hong et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lui et al., 2016</a>).

                                "text": "Ablating <i>Mecp2</i> expression specifically in microglia had little effect on phenotypic regression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The minimal effect observed when comparing <i>Cx3cr1<sup>CeER/+</sup>;Mecp2<sup>fl/y</sup>\u00a0</i>tamoxifen-treated mice to WT controls (<i>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;Mecp2<sup>+/y</sup></i>) is likely due to the <i>Mecp2<sup>fl/y</sup>\u00a0</i>hypomorphic allele. The <i>Mecp2<sup>fl/y</sup></i> mice have reduced <i>Mecp2</i> expression and develop RTT phenotypes in the absence of Cre-mediated recombination (<a href=\"#bib56\">Samaco et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kerr et al., 2008</a>), effects which may become apparent if the trajectory of phenotypes were assessed after P120. Similarly, expression of <i>Mecp2</i> specifically in microglia in an otherwise null animal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) had little to no effect on attenuation of any phenotype assessed. Together, our data are most consistent with the recent report that WT microglia/myeloid cells have no effect on phenotypes in <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>null or mutant mice but rather phenotypes are more likely due to loss of <i>Mecp2</i> expression in other CNS cell types such as neurons or astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lioy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Giacometti et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Luikenhuis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</a>). Our data are in contrast to two other reports from another group that demonstrate introducing <i>Mecp2</i> in microglia and other myeloid cells on a <i>Mecp2 null</i> background results in significant attenuation of phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Derecki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>). The discrepancy may result from difference in paradigms used to express <i>Mecp2</i>. For example, in our study, we induced recombination with tamoxifen in <i>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup>\u00a0</i>mice at P21-P25 and assessed phenotypes at \u2265P78. This paradigm results in purely microglia-specific expression of <i>Mecp2</i> due to ongoing hematopoiesis that replaces peripheral <i>Mecp2</i>-null cells with WT cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goldmann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yona et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, Cronk, Derecki et al. induced recombination in these same mice at 9 weeks (~P63)\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Cronk et al., 2015</a>. This late tamoxifen administration may be necessary to observe significant effects on phenotypes and may result from expression of <i>Mecp2</i> in peripheral myeloid cells. Furthermore, previous work by this same group demonstrated a significant attenuation of phenotypic regression in <i>Mecp2 null</i> mice after BM transplantation at P28 and engraftment with WT myeloid cells by ~P84 or with Cre mediated recombination (<i>Lysm<sup>Cre</sup></i>) in myeloid cells from birth\u00a0<a href=\"#bib19\">Derecki et al., 2012</a>. These paradigms also affect <i>Mecp2</i> expression in peripheral immune cells. Thus, we speculate that these divergent results may be due to differences in peripheral myeloid-derived cell-specific <i>Mecp2</i> expression, which is intriguing and worthy of future investigation. It should also be noted that we did not measure the entire panel of phenotypic abnormalities (breathing, open field, etc.) or survival so it is unknown if our results differ in these contexts. Finally, it is unclear how recently published data using a similar BM chimerism strategy but a different Cre mouse (Vav1-Cre) resulted in contradictory results and is also worthy of follow-up investigation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2015</a>)."

Our data offer significant insight into how microglia contribute to disease in <i>Mecp2</i> null mice. While microglia-specific loss of <i>Mecp2</i> is largely insufficient to induce synapse loss and phenotypic regression and gain of Mecp2 in expression in <i>Mecp2</i> null mice is insufficient to attenuate these parameters, microglia contribute secondarily by dismantling synaptic circuits in complete <i>Mecp2</i> null mice. Taken together with previously published data that single fiber strength decreases during early stages of phenotypic regression in the <i>Mecp2</i> null retinogeniculate system (<a href=\"#bib52\">Noutel et al., 2011</a>), we propose that microglia dismantle neural circuits in the late phenotypic <i>Mecp2</i> null brain by engulfing synapses previously rendered vulnerable and weakened by loss of <i>Mecp2</i> expression in, most likely, neurons.

Mice were scored on a scale from 0 to 2, with \u20180\u2019 being no phenotype, and \u20182\u2019 being severe phenotype. For gait, mice were assessed for wide-spread hind limbs and waddling while locomoting. Hind limb clasping was assessed by suspending mice by the tail and assessing clenching of hind limbs across the ventral aspect of the body. Tremor was characterized as a visible involuntary shaking and was scored based on the severity. Appearance was scored based on the presence or lack of grooming and/or hunched posture. The scores were subsequently summed to give a neurological score."

But in <i>Mecp2</i>-KO mice (that are older than 56 days) there is enhanced axonal terminal engulfment and lysosomal content in microglia. They then use global null and conditional loss- or gain-of-function alleles of <i>Mecp2</i> in combination with CX3CR1-CreER to specifically silence or rescue the expression of <i>Mecp2</i> in microglia. They find that manipulations of <i>Mecp2</i> expression in microglial have little effect on excessive engulfment, structural and functional visual circuit defects, or other general phenotypes associated with <i>Mecp2</i>-function.

This technique, the quantification of co-localized pre and postsynaptic protein signals, is appropriate; however, the provided images show that homer staining is very dense and potentially mostly not synaptic. At the resolution and magnification of the provided images it is hard to conclude whether VGlut2 and homer are truly co-localizing or is it just pure chance. Also the materials and method section describing how this quantification was done is not detailed. Where in geniculate did the pictures originate? It is important that the images were acquired from the same area in different animals so they could be comparable. How were the images acquired? Was the analysis performed on single optical sections or maximum projections? Also VGlut1 synapses were quantified as well, but no representative images are provided, so it is hard to evaluate the quality of staining on which that analysis was based."

If microglia are involved in active synaptic remodeling they should not show increased -generic- neuronal markers in their phagosomes. This point is critical also considering that in <i>Mecp2</i> null microglia there 3 times more lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Considering that only a smaller fraction contains synaptic material (compare graph in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) the authors should exclude that these vesicles contain non-synaptic material resulting from the engulfment of entire neurons."

One major issue was that attaining enough RNA or protein from microglia isolated from the LGN for qPCR or western blot was not technically feasible and/or required a large amount of animals from lines of mice that do not reproduce well. As a result, we attempted immunohistochemistry on our existing tissue (from engulfment and synapse analysis experiments) to detect <i>Mecp2</i> protein in LGN microglia. For several weeks we tried many different antibodies and staining conditions and were never able to detect <i>Mecp2</i> protein even in wild-type microglia (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a> for a subset of attempts). This is likely due to very low expression of <i>Mecp2</i> in microglia (Zhang et al. J. Neurosci 2014).

In addition, the representative images in the original manuscript (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) were maximum intensity projections as we felt this most fully demonstrated the loss of presynaptic inputs (the main conclusion). However, this was at the expense of postsynaptic staining appearing relatively non-specific and dense.

We originally chose Homer given that, out of all postsynaptic markers, it gave us the most consistent and strong signal to noise. Interestingly, retinogeniculate synapses represent &lt;10% of presynaptic inputs in the LGN (Bickford et al. J Comp Neurol2009). We have noted this in the revised manuscript. Thus, while it is appreciated that some Homer immunoreactivity could be extrasynaptic, our data are consistent with a large proportion of Homer immunoreactivity as postsynaptic and colocalized with other non- RGC (non-VGlut2 positive) terminals. This is demonstrated by increased co-localization of Homer/VGlut1 versus Homer/ VGlut2 (see updated <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 2</a>). We have also included <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 3</a> demonstrating that VGlut2 terminals also co- localize with another postsynaptic marker, anti-PSD-95, to a similar degree as Homer. Furthermore, to address whether colocalization occurs purely by chance, we rotated the VGlut2 channel 90 degrees and performed co-localization analysis. This analysis demonstrates that there is higher cumulative probability of colocalization in correctly oriented VGlut2/Homer or VGlut2/PSD-95 images as compared to those in which the VGlut2 channel was rotated (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 3</a>)."

Considering the large number of cells in the brain this cannot be considered a sensitive method and needs to be backed up by a direct visualization and quantification of neuronal (non-synaptic) material in microglia. If microglia are involved in active synaptic remodeling they should not show increased -generic- neuronal markers in their phagosomes. This point is critical also considering that in Mecp2 null microglia there 3 times more lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Considering that only a smaller fraction contains synaptic material (compare graph in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) the authors should exclude that these vesicles contain non-synaptic material resulting from the engulfment of entire neurons.</i>"
