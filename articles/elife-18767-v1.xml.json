In bacteria, these channels are built as dual-topology dimers whereby the two subunits assemble in antiparallel transmembrane orientation. Recent crystal structures suggested that Fluc channels contain two separate ion-conduction pathways, each with two F<sup>-</sup> binding sites, but no functional correlates of this unusual architecture have been reported. Experiments here fill this gap by examining the consequences of mutating two conserved F<sup>-</sup>-coordinating phenylalanine residues. Substitution of each phenylalanine specifically extinguishes its associated F<sup>-</sup> binding site in crystal structures and concomitantly inhibits F<sup>-</sup> permeation. Functional analysis of concatemeric channels, which permit mutagenic manipulation of individual pores, show that each pore can be separately inactivated without blocking F<sup>-</sup> conduction through its symmetry-related twin. The results strongly support dual-pathway architecture of Fluc channels."
