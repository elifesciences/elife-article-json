Despite considerable interest in developing \u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics for the treatment of AD, the precise mechanism by which \u03b3-secretase produces A\u03b2 has remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that \u03b3-secretase catalysis is driven by the stabilization of an enzyme-substrate scission complex via three distinct amino-acid-binding pockets in the enzyme\u2019s active site, providing the mechanism by which \u03b3-secretase preferentially cleaves APP in three amino acid increments. Substrate occupancy of these three pockets occurs after initial substrate binding but precedes catalysis, suggesting a conformational change in substrate may be required for cleavage. We uncover and exploit substrate cleavage preferences dictated by these three pockets to investigate the mechanism by which familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease mutations within APP increase the production of pathogenic A\u03b2 species."

Despite considerable interest in developing \u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics for the treatment of AD, the precise mechanism by which \u03b3-secretase produces A\u03b2 has remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that \u03b3-secretase catalysis is driven by the stabilization of an enzyme-substrate scission complex via three distinct amino-acid-binding pockets in the enzyme\u2019s active site, providing the mechanism by which \u03b3-secretase preferentially cleaves APP in three amino acid increments. Substrate occupancy of these three pockets occurs after initial substrate binding but precedes catalysis, suggesting a conformational change in substrate may be required for cleavage. We uncover and exploit substrate cleavage preferences dictated by these three pockets to investigate the mechanism by which familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease mutations within APP increase the production of pathogenic A\u03b2 species."

The amyloid beta peptides vary in size; the larger peptides tend to be more prone to forming clumps than the smaller ones and are thus more toxic to the brain."

Proteins are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids and studies using a technique called mass spectrometry show that gamma-secretase cuts APP in segments of three amino acids at a time. The size of the amyloid beta peptides produced is determined by the positions in APP that gamma-secretase selects to cut. Therefore, understanding how the enzyme works could provide new opportunities for developing drugs to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease."

A central and pathological hallmark of AD is the deposition of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaques in the brain (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hardy and Selkoe, 2002</a>). These plaques are comprised of aggregates of A\u03b2 peptides, which are formed by the sequential cleavage of the membrane embedded amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases\u2014\u03b2-secretase first removes the ectodomain of APP, then \u03b3-secretase cleaves the remaining C-terminal fragment within its transmembrane domain (TMD) to liberate A\u03b2 from cellular membranes. Via its proteolytic component presenilin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wolfe et al., 1999</a>), \u03b3-secretase processes the TMD of APP into A\u03b2 peptides of differing lengths, mostly producing a more benign A\u03b2 species 40 amino acids in length, termed A\u03b240, as well as lesser amounts of a longer, more aggregation prone and pathogenic species, A\u03b242. The total amount of A\u03b242, as well as the ratio of A\u03b242/40, are thought to be key mediators of A\u03b2 pathogenesis, a hypothesis strongly supported by the fact that nearly all the 200-plus autosomal-dominant familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin-1, -2 and APP increase the A\u03b242/40 ratio (see <a href=\"http://www.alzforum.org/mutations\">www.alzforum.org/mutations</a>)."

Both \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and a \u03b3-secretase modulator (GSM), the latter working by an unknown mechanism to influence \u03b3-secretase to produce shorter, presumably less pathogenic A\u03b2 species, have failed in recent clinical trials. The failure of GSIs is due at least in part to toxicities from cleavage inhibition of other \u03b3-secretase substrates such as Notch (<a href=\"#bib10\">Doody et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Golde et al., 2013</a>). Little is known about how \u03b3-secretase recognizes the transmembrane domain of substrates, given that no consensus amino acid cleavage motif has been identified for the more than one hundred \u03b3-secretase substrates discovered to date (<a href=\"#bib17\">Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011</a>). Unfortunately, the further development of safe and effective \u03b3-secretase targeting therapeutics has been held back by a fundamental lack of understanding of how \u03b3-secretase recognizes and cleaves the TMDs of its many substrates, especially APP. Elucidation of this basic mechanism should at the very least add to our understanding of how A\u03b2 is produced and may also aid in the development of safe and effective disease-modifying therapeutics."

Looking at the formation of these products over time, it is apparent that the TMD of APP is mostly processed via two major pathways. \u03b3-secretase predominantly initiates endoproteolysis at a so-called <i>epsilon</i> (\u03b5) cleavage site\u2014after Leu49 or Thr48, generating A\u03b249 or A\u03b248 and two different APP intracellular domains (AICD), AICD 50\u201399 or AICD 49\u201399, respectively (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kakuda et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sato et al., 2003</a>). A\u03b249 and A\u03b248 are then sequentially cleaved in increments of three amino acids to produce mostly A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, respectively (<a href=\"#bib33\">Takami et al., 2009</a>). The two major pathways are therefore A\u03b249 \u2192 A\u03b246 \u2192 A\u03b243 \u2192 A\u03b240 and A\u03b248 \u2192 A\u03b245 \u2192 A\u03b242 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fernandez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Takami et al., 2009</a>).

Importantly a shorter peptide, A\u03b238, can be formed from both major pathways, originating from A\u03b242 or A\u03b243 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Okochi et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, a third, sparingly used site of \u03b5 cleavage can lead to the production of A\u03b247, which rather than being processed to A\u03b244 is instead mostly cleaved to A\u03b243, subsequently generating A\u03b240 (A\u03b247 \u2192 A\u03b243 \u2192 A\u03b240) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Matsumura et al., 2014</a>)."

The mechanism that dictates this preferred tripeptide cleavage (and thus the driving force behind \u03b3-secretase catalysis and A\u03b2 formation) is completely unknown. In this study, we report that \u03b3-secretase tripeptide cleavage is driven by three S\u2019 pockets within the active site of the enzyme. We identify specific substrate cleavage preferences dictated by the three S\u2019 pockets and exploit these preferences to determine the predominant mechanism of each FAD mutation within the transmembrane domain of APP, including a novel mechanism in which final cleavage products are uncoupled from initial \u03b5 pathway preference."

However, oftentimes the manner in which an enzyme interacts with product (in the form of product inhibition) can be equally informative with regard to its catalytic mechanism. To this end, we asked whether the naturally produced tripeptide fragments of APP are inhibitors of \u03b3-secretase. We found that all five tripeptides produced from the TMD of APP are indeed capable of inhibiting \u03b3-secretase activity, albeit rather weakly with IC50 values ranging from ~150\u2009\u03bcM to several mM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although these binding affinities are too low for the tripeptides to be involved in any form of biologically relevant feedback inhibition, we imagined the manner in which they inhibit \u03b3-secretase could be instructive in elucidating the basic cleavage mechanism of the protease. We characterized the mode of inhibition of the most potent of the tripeptides, VIV, finding that these data fit well to a noncompetitive inhibition model, with a global R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Given that the tripeptide segments of the TMD of APP must occupy the active site of \u03b3-secretase during catalysis, we hypothesized that VIV may compete for the same binding site on the enzyme as transition-state analogs. An inhibitor cross-competition analysis reveals this is likely true, with a series of parallel lines resulting from a Yonetani-Theorell plot demonstrating mutually exclusive binding of VIV and the transition-state analog III-31-C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have demonstrated that transition-state analog inhibitors containing only two amino acids here are relatively weak inhibitors compared to those comprised of three amino acids, while adding a fourth amino acid does not achieve additional potency (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esler et al., 2004</a>). This suggests that\u00a0there are three, and only three, putative S\u2019 pockets in the presenilin active site that contribute to inhibitor binding. Of note, the SAR studies also suggest that while the putative S1\u2019 and S3\u2019 pockets are large and can accommodate amino acids of varying size, the S2\u2019 pocket is small and inhibitors with an aromatic amino acid (phenylalanine) at this position have decreased potency by two orders of magnitude compared to those with less bulky aliphatic amino acids (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esler et al., 2004</a>)."

This would provide a simple mechanism for the preferred cleavage of APP in three amino acid increments, as well as provide an explanation for why \u03b3-secretase mostly sticks to each major pathway, producing A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 after initiating cleavage of APP at either the L49 or T48 \u03b5 sites, respectively.

There was a similar predicted reduction in A\u03b240 for the M51 aromatic mutants; however, we also see an increase in A\u03b242 levels here (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), likely because the normally less used A\u03b248 \u2192 42 pathway is compensating for the reduced flux through the preferred A\u03b249 \u2192 40 pathway, as these mutants all produced roughly equivalent amounts of total A\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

As expected, Phe substitutions at V44 and I47 decreased the A\u03b242/40 ratio, while Phe mutations at I45 and T48 increased the A\u03b242/40 ratio (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). The predicted A\u03b242/40 shifts were nearly identical whether A\u03b2 levels were measured from an in vitro assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) or from a cell-based assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These results are of particular note, as I45F is a known FAD mutation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guerreiro et al., 2010</a>), likely indicating that the mechanism of this mutation is the Phe positioned in the P2\u2019 position at the A\u03b243 cut site, blocking cleavage of APP through the less pathogenic A\u03b249 \u2192 40 pathway and favoring the pathogenic A\u03b248 \u2192 42 pathway. The Phe at I45 also lies in the S3\u2019 position for A\u03b242 cleavage, likely making the precursor to A\u03b242 production a better substrate for \u03b3-secretase through a favorable P3\u2019-S3\u2019 interaction. Mutating A42 to Phe completely blocked the formation of A\u03b240 in agreement with our model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), while still allowing for the production of other A\u03b2 species (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To investigate this possibility, we utilized an antibody that specifically recognizes the free N-terminus of AICD 50\u201399 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ch\u00e1vez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2012</a>), and therefore the initiation of the A\u03b249 \u2192 40 pathway.

Although V44F and I47F cause reductions in the A\u03b242/40 ratio, they shifted initial \u03b5 cleavage away from the A\u03b249 \u2192 40 pathway\u2014nearly completely eliminating AICD 50\u201399.

Co-IP of WT and V50F-M51F C100 in complex with \u03b3-secretase reveals equal amounts of substrate bound, suggesting both substrates have a similar binding affinity for the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

A\u03b247 is primarily processed to A\u03b240 (A\u03b247 \u2192 A\u03b243 \u2192 A\u03b240) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Matsumura et al., 2014</a>), accounting for the decreased A\u03b242/40 ratio."

To determine if production of A\u03b238 occurs through the same three S\u2019 pockets used by \u03b3-secretase to achieve tripeptide cleavage, we transiently transfected HEK cells with mutant APP containing a single Phe point mutant at V39, V40, I41 or A42. Measuring secreted A\u03b238 revealed that V40F almost completely eliminated A\u03b238 production (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), demonstrating occupancy of the three S\u2019 pockets is required for A\u03b238 formation. V39F and I41F both sharply increased A\u03b238, a result we interpret as the phenylalanine mutations making the precursor to A\u03b238 a better substrate for \u03b3-secretase, as the S1\u2019 and S3\u2019 pockets are large and prefer phenylalanine over smaller amino acids (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esler et al., 2004</a>). A42F produces about as much A\u03b238 as WT, indicative of the lack of a contributory S4\u2019 pocket."

As expected, the shifts were caused by the near complete elimination of A\u03b242 for the V44F-I47F-V50F mutant and of A\u03b240 for the I45F-T48F-M51F mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Interestingly, in each case, A\u03b238 levels were produced in amounts comparable to or greater than WT. This demonstrates that A\u03b238 is capable of being produced from both the A\u03b249 \u2192 40 and A\u03b248 \u2192 42 pathways, in perfect agreement with recent MS studies that identified the precursors to A\u03b238 as being either A\u03b243 or A\u03b242 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Matsumura et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Olsson et al., 2014</a>). Surprisingly, when we blocked the production of both A\u03b243 and A\u03b242 at the same time with a V44F-I45F double mutant we not only did\u00a0not prevent the production of A\u03b238, but rather A\u03b238 levels were drastically increased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Even after blocking the first six major cleavage sites (V44F-I45F-I47F-T48F-V50F-M51F) of APP, we still observe elevated A\u03b238 compared to WT, demonstrating \u03b3-secretase is fully capable of traversing multiple phenylalanines within APP to find the especially labile amide bond between G38 and V39. It is likely that the helix-destabilizing Gly-Gly motif at G37 and G38 is the reason for this observation, making the G38-V39 bond particularly accessible for cleavage."

There are more than a dozen missense FAD mutations targeting this region of APP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), with the majority being located N-terminal and downstream of \u03b5 cleavage. To date, the currently accepted explanations for how these mutations increase the A\u03b242/40 ratio are: 1) affecting the positioning/helical stability of the \u03b3-secretase bound APP TMD such that initial \u03b5 cleavage is shifted toward T48, thus favoring the production of A\u03b242 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ch\u00e1vez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dimitrov et al., 2013</a>); or 2) influencing the reaction kinetics of \u03b3-secretase\u2019s processing of APP, leading to incomplete carboxy-trimming and therefore increased A\u03b242 over the more processed A\u03b238 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ch\u00e1vez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). As demonstrated above with the I45F FAD mutant, we now show that a third possible mechanism exists, in that sequence-specific cleavage preferences can uncouple initial \u03b5 cleavage and final \u03b3 cleavages of APP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>)."

The V50F mutation would be predicted to block \u03b5 cleavage after T48 independent of the FAD mutant\u2019s affect on subsequent cleavage events. We would therefore predict that if an FAD mutant causes an increase in the A\u03b242/40 ratio by influencing initial \u03b5 cleavage or by affecting subsequent carboxy-trimming along the A\u03b248 \u2192 42 pathway, then that same FAD mutant when paired with V50F should produce a reduced A\u03b242/40 ratio compared to WT, similar to V50F alone. Conversely, if an FAD mutant affects subsequent cleavage events independent of \u03b5 cleavage, causing uncoupling of initial \u03b5 cleavage and final \u03b3 cleavages, then the FAD-V50F double mutant should retain an elevated A\u03b242/40 ratio, similar to the FAD mutant alone."

This suggests the predominant mechanism of elevating the A\u03b242/40 ratio by FAD mutants within the TMD of APP is by shifting the preference of initial \u03b5 cleavage from the A\u03b240 to the A\u03b242 pathway, and/or by influencing carboxy-trimming. This may have been predicted, given that I45F is the only aromatic amino acid mutation to fall in the S2\u2019 pocket of one of the major cleavage pathways. The only other FAD mutation containing an aromatic amino acid, V46F, falls within the S1\u2019 and S3\u2019 pockets for the A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 pathways, respectively, therefore never clashing with the S2\u2019 pocket and not influencing the A\u03b242/40 ratio as a major pathway blocker.

Based on the data reported herein (discussed further below) and numerous other studies of \u03b3-secretase (<a href=\"#bib6\">Das et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kornilova et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2005</a>) and other intramembrane proteases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dickey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fluhrer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Moin and Urban, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Urban and Freeman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ye et al., 2000</a>), we speculate that after initial binding to \u03b3-secretase, substrate must undergo a translocation and/or conformational change in order to bind the three S\u2019 pockets within the active site and subsequently be cleaved by the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). After initial endoproteolysis, the three S\u2019 pockets guide further carboxy-trimming of the retained A\u03b2 species until it is short enough to dissociate from the complex, producing predominantly A\u03b238, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242."

Transition-state analogs containing only two amino acids for S\u2019 pocket binding inhibited \u03b3-secretase less effectively, indicating that occupancy of the S3\u2019 pocket is required for a strong interaction. This likely provides the reason why \u03b3-secretase only cleaves APP in segments of three or more amino acids, but never two. The preference for cleaving three amino acids originates from the lack of a contributory fourth S\u2019 pocket. A fourth amino acid (no matter the size) added to a transition state inhibitor neither increased nor decreased the inhibitors potency (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esler et al., 2004</a>), suggesting a fourth S\u2019 pocket doesn\u2019t contribute to \u03b3-secretase-inhibitor or -substrate interactions."

For example, in the cell-based assay, V40F, A42F and V44F generated levels of A\u03b238, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, respectively, that were actually less than mock transfected levels (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These A\u03b2 levels are orders of magnitude less than that from WT APP transfected cells, although we cannot say whether these low levels of A\u03b2 species were produced from endogenous HEK cell APP or from our transfected mutants. Similarly, we were unable to detect by MS any AICD products containing a Phe in the P2\u2019 position. Together, these data suggest that aromatic amino acids may be completely excluded from the S2\u2019 pocket and further demonstrates that substrate occupancy of the three S\u2019 pockets is an absolute requirement for catalysis."

For rhomboid, a recent study demonstrates that product-mimicking peptide aldehydes are non-competitive inhibitors of this serine intramembrane protease (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cho et al., 2016</a>), exactly like tripeptide products and transition-state analog inhibitors are for \u03b3-secretase, suggesting a common two-step mechanism between these two intramembrane proteases."

Given that this mutant effectively competes for \u03b3-secretase processing of other substrates, it must bind to the initial docking site on the enzyme for substrate.

It is likely that the helix-destabilizing Gly-Gly motif at G37 and G38 is the reason for this observation. Local helical unwinding around this position probably makes the amide bond between G38 and V39 particularly accessible for cleavage, and this may be the reason for \u03b3-secretase\u2019s normal deviation from the preferred tripeptide cleavage for A\u03b238 production. However, further investigation, including quantification of the intramembrane peptide products by mass spectrometry, will be required to prove this. In the absence of a \u03b3-secretase\u2014substrate co-complex structure, it will not be possible to definitively prove the existence of a partially unwound substrate intermediate.

This is important to note given that many of \u03b3-secretase\u2019s substrates naturally contain aromatic amino acids. The TMD of notch, for example, naturally contains three phenylalanines.

Based on this, and results from our current study, we might expect that \u03b3-secretase can chose its substrates through a complex interplay between ectodomain length, helical TMD stability and the sequence of amino acids (specifically aromatic amino acids) within substrate TMD. There may even exist non-substrates containing short ectodomains but having stable helices that are further protected from cleavage by sequential stretches of aromatic amino acids.

Here, final \u03b3 cleavages are uncoupled from initial pathway preference determined by \u03b5 cleavage. In the case of the I45F FAD mutation, the bulky Phe sterically clashes with the S2\u2019 pocket of \u03b3-secretase at the A\u03b243 cleavage site, blocking its cleavage and the subsequent production of A\u03b240.

However, we believe that substantial additional work would be required to fully answer this question, as we do not have assays in place to address this. In the current study, we rely heavily on antibodies that specifically recognize the neo-epitopes of A\u03b238, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 produced by \u03b3-secretase cleavage of the TMD of APP. Here, G37 and G38 are present in the recognition epitope of all three antibodies. Therefore, mutating these amino acids abrogates binding and recognition by these antibodies. The only way to definitively determine if mutation of these two Gly residues causes \u03b3-secretase to cleave a tripeptide instead of a tetrapeptide here is to measure by LC-MS the intramembrane tri- and tetra- cleavage fragments of APP. Earlier this year we initiated a collaboration with the Ihara group (Doshisha University, Japan) to obtain mass spec analysis on the TMD cleavage fragments of several APP mutants we have generated. They are the only group worldwide that has reported the ability to capture these highly hydrophobic fragments and quantify them by MS. This collaboration is ongoing and not yet complete. Thus, this is an important question that will likely require a follow-up study to answer completely. We are careful in this current manuscript to propose this mechanism as a possible explanation for tetra-peptide generation of A\u03b238 that is consistent with all our other data, but not one we have definitively answered."

As the reviewer correctly surmises, the key reason V50F rescues the majority of internal TMD APP FAD mutants with respect to the A\u03b242/40 ratio is because most of the FAD mutants are not a Phe (or other aromatic amino acid). There are two Phe FAD mutants, one at I45 and one at V46. The I45F mutant clashes with the small S2\u2019 pocket in the A\u03b240 pathway (therefore blocking this pathway and increasing the 42/40 ratio). In contrast, V46F falls in the S1\u2019 and S3\u2019 pockets for the 42 and 40 pathways, respectively, therefore never clashing with the S2\u2019 pocket and not influencing the A\u03b242/40 ratio as a major pathway blocker."

The 4G8 ELISA allowed for increased signal, given that it measures both \u03b1- and \u03b2-secretase cleavage products. With some mutants this increased signal was necessary to make reliable measurements (such as with the poly-Phe mutants, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). For the I45F-V50F data point in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, the amount of A\u03b240 produced was quite low, near the limit of detection of the 6E10 ELISA, possibly inflating the A\u03b242/40 ratio. We realize now this is confusing and regret omitting which ELISA detection kit we used in each figure legend (we have now done so), though we stated in the Methods section that we used both kits for each data set. To simplify this possible point of confusion for readers, we have replaced the 6E10 ELISA results in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> with the corresponding 4G8 results. There are no other differences here. To be thorough, we are now including the 6E10 data as an additional <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, as well, so reviewers and readers can compare the results from the two ELISA kits side-by-side."

We are unable to identify candidate S1\u2019-S2\u2019-S3\u2019 pockets in the general vicinity of the catalytic aspartates at this time. The solution of transition-state analog \u2013 \u03b3-secretase co-complexes by cryo-EM will likely identify these important substrate-binding pockets in the near future. Interestingly, the most recent cryo-EM structures of \u03b3-secretase have revealed the presence of an unidentified molecule situated between TMDs 2, 3 and 5 of presenilin. Intriguingly there are numerous FAD mutations in these presenilin TMDs that surround this object. It is therefore conceivable that this position makes up the initial substrate-docking site on presenilin. The true identity of the initial docking site, however, will require solving a \u03b3-secretase structure with a known substrate or helical inhibitor.
