The ability to predict whether an animal will make a given decision based on the firing of individual sensory neurons is often referred to as a \u2018choice probability\u2019. Measurements of single neurons have often been used to try to work out how the brain decodes the sensory information that is needed to carry out a specific task. However, it remains unclear whether choice probabilities really reflect how sensory information is decoded in the brain, or whether these measurements are just reflecting coordinated patterns of background \u2018noise\u2019 among the neurons as the decisions are being made."

A series of experiments was conducted to see how these neurons process information, both from the eyes and the part of the inner ear that helps control balance, to work out the direction in which an animal was moving. By performing computer simulations of the activity of groups of neurons, Gu et al. found that choice probability measurements are better explained by the models whereby these measurements did reflect the strategy that is used to decode the sensory information. Models based solely on patterns of correlated noise did not explain the data as well, though Gu et al. suggest that this noise is likely to also contribute to the observed effects."

In turn, the pattern of activation across a population of such neurons provides information about the most likely stimulus that may have occurred (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</a>). Whether or not a sensory neuron contributes to perceptual decisions generally depends on whether that neuron is selective to the stimulus dimensions relevant to the task at hand, and how much weight is given to the activity of that neuron in population decoding. One method for assessing the potential contribution of a sensory neuron to perception involves measuring the trial-by-trial covariation between neural activity and perceptual decisions, as typically quantified by computing the choice probability (CP) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Britten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dodd et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Uka and DeAngelis, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2013</a>)."

Tested properly, such effects are typically found to be independent of the stimulus value itself (<a href=\"#bib6\">Britten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Uka and DeAngelis, 2004</a>). While the phenomenology is rather consistent across many studies, the interpretation of CPs has remained controversial (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</a>). Some studies have suggested that the pattern of CPs across a population of neurons can provide insight into how responses of neurons with different tuning properties are selectively weighted in the decision process, that is selective decoding (<a href=\"#bib6\">Britten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Uka and DeAngelis, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>). Other studies have pointed out that correlated noise among neurons is necessary to observe significant CPs in large populations, suggesting that CPs are dominated by correlated noise and may not carry any useful information about decoding strategy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nienborg et al., 2012</a>). As an extreme example, neurons that are not involved in the decision process can exhibit significant CPs solely through correlations with other neurons that do contribute (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</a>). Thus, a critical issue is whether CPs can reflect selective decoding of sensory neurons."

However, experimental evidence that can dissociate these causes has been lacking. Here, we take advantage of a peculiar pattern of CPs exhibited by multisensory neurons that represent translational self-motion (i.e., heading). Some neurons in areas MSTd (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gu et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>) and VIP (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) have matched heading preferences in response to visual and vestibular stimuli (\u2018congruent\u2019 cells), whereas others prefer widely disparate headings (\u2018opposite\u2019 cells). Opposite cells could be decoded such that they provide evidence in favor of either their visual or their vestibular heading preference. We showed previously that congruent and opposite cells have CPs with opposite polarities in a visual heading discrimination task (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2013</a>), and we suggested that this may result from selectively decoding both congruent and opposite cells according to their vestibular heading preferences (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 2008</a>). This system provides a valuable test bed for exploring the roles of noise correlations and selective decoding in producing CPs."

We generated a population of 1000 hypothetical neurons with cosine tuning for heading. All neurons in this population had tuning curves with the same amplitude and width, but differed in their heading preferences. For simplicity, half of the neurons preferred leftward heading (\u221290\u00b0) while the other half preferred rightward heading (+90\u00b0) so that tuning curves for any pair of neurons had either identical slopes or opposite slopes around a straight-forward heading reference. Other distributions of heading preferences (e.g., uniform or bimodal) did not substantially alter our conclusions. We used a maximum likelihood decoder (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sanger, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jazayeri and Movshon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fetsch et al., 2011</a>) to estimate heading from simulated population activity, and we required the population activity to discriminate between headings that were slightly leftward or rightward relative to a straight-forward reference heading. Specifically, a likelihood function over heading was computed from the population activity on each trial. The decoder then made a \u2018leftward\u2019 choice if the area under the likelihood function for leftward headings exceeded the area under the curve for rightward headings, and vice versa for a \u2018rightward\u2019 choice. We then computed each model neuron's CP for the ambiguous stimulus condition (i.e., straight forward motion, 0\u00b0, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), and we explored how correlated noise and selective decoding affected CPs."

For the \u2018pure-correlation\u2019 model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), only correlated noise is needed to produce CPs that are significantly different from the chance level of 0.5. In this model, we divided the population of neurons into two groups, each of which contained an equal number of neurons preferring leftward and rightward headings. The first group of neurons (pool 1 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) contributed to the decoder's heading report (decoding weight = 1), while responses from the other group (pool 2) were ignored by the decoder (decoding weight = 0). We then examined the CPs of pool 2 neurons as a function of their correlations with pool 1. Although the signals from pool 2 neurons did not contribute to the decoder output, they still exhibited significant CPs as long as their noise was correlated with that of pool 1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</a>)."

Specifically we assumed that noise correlations among pairs of model neurons are a linear function of their tuning similarity, or signal correlation (<i>r</i><sub><i>signal</i></sub>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, insets). In this correlation structure, neurons with similar heading tuning (positive <i>r</i><sub><i>signal</i></sub>) generally have positive noise correlations, whereas neurons with dissimilar tuning (negative <i>r</i><sub><i>signal</i></sub>) tend to have negative noise correlations. This correlation structure was applied to all pairs of neurons, regardless of whether they were from pool 1 or pool 2. For the simulations, the average noise correlation across all neurons was close to zero, consistent with some previous findings (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gu et al., 2011</a>), but the results are not sensitive to this mean value (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). Rather, the critical factor is the slope of the relationship between r<sub>noise</sub> and <i>r</i><sub><i>signal</i></sub> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2013</a>): larger slopes lead to greater CPs among pool 2 neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Hence, in this pure-correlation model, CPs of pool 2 neurons are driven exclusively through correlations with neurons in pool 1 that contribute to the decision process (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2010</a>)."

In this case, significant CPs for pool 2 neurons require that these neurons make a contribution to the decision (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We manipulated two aspects of the contribution of each pool 2 neuron to the decoder output: magnitude and polarity. The magnitude reflects how strongly each neuron's activity influenced the decoder and was implemented mathematically by multiplying each neuron's contribution by a value in the range [0\u20131]. If the weight value is 1, then pool 2 neurons contribute equally as pool 1 neurons. As the weight is reduced toward zero, the contribution of pool 2 neurons diminishes and eventually is eliminated. The polarity (or sign) of the weight determines whether each neuron provides the decoder with evidence for (positive polarity) or against (negative polarity) its heading preference. It may appear counterintuitive to consider that neurons might provide evidence against their stimulus preference, but the need to consider this case will arise later in the multisensory version of the model due to the presence of opposite cells. These neurons have different heading preferences for the two sensory modalities, so they can provide evidence in favor of their stimulus preference for one modality or the other."

Interpreting responses as evidence in favor of the preferred heading produces CP &gt;0.5 (solid curves) while decoding responses as evidence against the preferred heading leads to CP &lt;0.5 (dashed curves). Hence, the two models generate CPs for pool 2 neurons through different mechanisms. In the pure-correlation model, CPs of pool 2 neurons are produced through correlations with pool 1 neurons that are involved in the decision process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

For example, both visual (optic flow) and vestibular signals provide information about the direction of self-motion, or heading (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angelaki and Cullen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Britten, 2008</a>). Previous studies have reported that neurons in multiple cortical areas (e.g., MSTd, VIP, VPS) are tuned for heading, and tend to prefer either the same or opposite headings defined by optic flow and vestibular cues (<a href=\"#bib29\">Page and Duffy, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gu et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2011b</a>). We refer to these as congruent cells and opposite cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For opposite cells, the preferred heading is different for the two sensory modalities, thus raising the fundamental question of how these cells may be decoded. In a multimodal heading discrimination task (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 2008</a>), we showed previously that CPs of MSTd neurons have a peculiar dependence on the congruency of visual/vestibular heading tuning (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For congruent cells (cyan symbols in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), CPs were consistently &gt;0.5 when heading judgments were based on either vestibular or visual cues. In contrast, CPs for opposite cells tended to be &gt;0.5 in the vestibular task condition but &lt;0.5 in the visual condition (magenta symbols in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We suggested previously (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 2008</a>) that this peculiar pattern of CPs might result from decoding the responses of MSTd neurons according to their vestibular heading preferences, a form of selective decoding. In what follows, we evaluate whether this pattern of CPs is compatible with a multisensory version of either the pure correlation or selective decoding models described above."

For simplicity, these neurons again preferred either leftward or rightward headings. In the pure-correlation model, only pool 1 neurons (congruent cells) provided inputs to the decoder\u2019s decision process, whereas pool 2 neurons (opposite cells) were given no weight. However, opposite cells can still exhibit CPs as long as they are correlated with congruent cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). For a pair of neurons that includes an opposite cell, correlated noise could depend on the similarity of vestibular tuning between the members of the pair or on the similarity of visual tuning (or on both, as discussed further below). If correlated noise is dependent on the similarity of vestibular tuning (i.e., vestibular signal correlation), opposite cells show CPs that are &gt;0.5 in the vestibular condition and &lt;0.5 in the visual condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), roughly similar to experimental data from MSTd neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The intuition for this result is straightforward. When a congruent cell fires more spikes than average, an opposite cell that shares the same vestibular tuning will also fire more spikes than average and will have a CP &gt;0.5 in the vestibular condition. In the visual condition, this correlation structure will lead to an opposite cell responding more when the animal chooses its non-preferred visual heading, thus producing a CP &lt;0.5. Note that this prediction of the pure correlation model only mimics real data if opposite cells are correlated with congruent cells having matched vestibular heading preferences."

Finally, correlations between the two pools of the pure-correlation model could depend on the similarity of heading preferences for both the visual and vestibular modalities (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>). If correlated noise depends equally on both visual and vestibular signal correlations (i.e., <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a> with <i>a</i><sub><i>vestibular</i></sub> = <i>a</i><sub><i>visual</i></sub>), then correlations between opposite cells and congruent cells become effectively zero because the two terms of <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a> cancel.

Because we assume <i>a</i><sub><i>vestibular</i></sub> = <i>a</i><sub><i>visual</i></sub> in <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>, the resulting effective noise correlation between mixed pairs of congruent and opposite cells will be zero (denoted by \u2018 \u00d7 \u2019 between the two pools in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, use of the selective-decoding model with this particular correlation structure effectively eliminates correlated noise between the two pools while allowing the decoding weights of pool 2 to vary. Under these conditions, non-zero decoding weights must be applied to pool 2 in order to observe CPs for opposite cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Note that, for the selective decoding model, we do not consider situations in which correlated noise between the two pools depends only on vestibular or visual heading preferences. In such cases, there would be correlated noise between pairs of neurons drawn from the two pools, and the CPs of opposite cells would depend on both readout weights and noise correlations. Thus, the two models would no longer be conceptually distinct. We shall evaluate these assumptions in the following sections."

With regard to polarity (or sign) of the decoding weights, decoding responses of opposite cells with respect to their vestibular heading preference led to CP &gt;0.5 in the vestibular condition and &lt;0.5 in the visual condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), which was similar to that seen in the real data. On the other hand, if responses of model neurons were decoded with respect to their visual heading preferences, the pattern of CPs across stimulus conditions would reverse and would be incompatible with that observed for MSTd neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In the pure-correlation model, CPs of opposite cells arise solely through correlations with congruent cells having matched vestibular tuning, even though opposite cells do not contribute directly to the decision. In the selective decoding model, there is no effective correlation between mixed pairs of congruent/opposite cells (i.e., no correlated noise between pools). In this case, to qualitatively match the pattern of CP results from real neurons, the activity of opposite cells must be given weight in the decoding and these cells must be decoded selectively according to their vestibular preferences. Another way to summarize the distinction between models is that the pure correlation model mimics experimental CP results by virtue of modality specificity in the structure of correlated noise, whereas the selective decoding model achieves this by modality specificity in the decoding weights."

Noise correlations were linearly dependent only on the similarity of vestibular tuning, as in the pure-correlation model. This produced correlations between the two pools (congruent and opposite cells), unlike in the selective decoding model. In addition, a readout weight was assigned to the opposite cells, as in the selective decoding model. Under these conditions, we found that the predicted patterns of CPs largely resembled those from the pure-correlation model, as if the decoding weights on pool 2 played little role (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In the following analyses, we only considered comparisons between the pure-correlation model and the selective decoding model, as these are conceptually distinct.

The Gu et al. dataset consisted of 129 single neurons that were not recorded simultaneously. Thus, to generate model population responses for decoding analyses, we generated responses for a model population of 1000 neurons, each of which had visual and vestibular tuning curves that were obtained by drawing data (with replacement) from the sample of 129 real MSTd neurons. Responses of the 1000 model neurons on each simulated trial were generated from a covariance matrix that was based on the two different correlation structures described in the previous section, with parameters that were obtained by fits to the MSTd data. This yielded noise and signal correlations similar to those described in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>).

However, unlike the simple hypothetical model of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, real neurons exhibit a range of congruencies between visual and vestibular tuning. To explore a range of possible relative weightings of opposite cells, we used a sigmoidal function (having a single parameter called the Readout Index, RI) to selectively weight the contributions of congruent and opposite cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). For RI values near 1.0, all neurons contribute equally to the decoder output, regardless of congruency. As RI declines, opposite cells are given gradually less weight in the decoding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). For small values of RI, opposite neurons in the selective decoding model show CPs that approach 0.5, as expected since these neurons are given little weight in the decision process. However, as RI increases, the average CP for opposite cells increases in the vestibular condition and decreases in the visual condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). For RI values near 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), the pattern of CPs across the population of simulated neurons resembles that exhibited by MSTd neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

We now consider whether the models make distinct predictions regarding CPs for the combined condition, in which visual and vestibular cues are presented together. As described previously (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 2008</a>), when animals judge heading based on congruent combinations of visual and vestibular cues, congruent cells tend to have CPs &gt;0.5, whereas opposite cells have CPs that cluster around the chance level of 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interestingly, although the average CP of opposite cells was approximately 0.5 for both models in the combined condition (pure-correlation model: 0.486 \u00b1 0.13 SD; selective decoding model: 0.491 \u00b1 0.06 SD), the SD of CP across the population of opposite cells was much greater for the pure-correlation model than for the selective decoding model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Indeed, a non-parametric test showed that the dispersion of the CPs was significantly greater for the pure correlation model (p&lt;&lt;0.001, Ansari\u2013Bradley test). The reason for this difference is apparent: CPs of opposite cells in the pure correlation model clearly have a bimodal distribution (p<sub>uni</sub>&lt;&lt;0.001, p<sub>bi</sub>&gt;0.05, modality test, middle column of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In contrast, CPs of opposite cells in the selective readout model have a unimodal distribution centered around 0.5 (p<sub>uni</sub>&gt;0.05, modality test, right column in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), which is similar to that seen for MSTd neurons (p<sub>uni</sub>&gt;0.05, modality test, left column in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Indeed, for real MSTd neurons, congruent cells tend to have low thresholds and high CPs whereas opposite cells tend to have high thresholds and low CPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>; R = \u22120.65, 95% CI: [\u22120.47 to \u22120.78], p&lt;&lt;0.001, linear regression). Although both models also show a similar dependency of CP on neuronal sensitivity in the combined condition (p&lt;&lt;0.001, linear regression, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>), the strength of the correlation is significantly weaker for the pure correlation model (R = \u22120.41, 95% CI: [\u22120.32 to \u22120.48]) than for the selective readout model (R = \u22120.67, 95% CI: [\u22120.61 to \u22120.72], <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). This also appears to be largely due to the bimodal distribution of CPs for opposite cells in the pure correlation model, which is not observed for the real MSTd data.

In the vestibular condition, the decoder's discrimination threshold decreased modestly as more weight was applied to opposite cells because more cells contribute to the likelihood function (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, blue curve). In the visual condition, because heading was decoded with respect to the vestibular preference of each neuron, a greater contribution of opposite cells tends to drive the decoder to make choices that are opposite to that being signaled by congruent cells. Consequently, predicted thresholds in the visual condition rise precipitously as opposite cells are given more weight (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, red curve). From these data, we can see that a Readout Index value of \u223c0.5 produces roughly matched visual and vestibular heading thresholds, similar to the animals\u2019 behavior (arrow in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). With this weighting of opposite cells, the selective decoding model predicts similar heading thresholds for vestibular (2.33\u00b0 \u00b1 0.04\u00b0, mean \u00b1 SEM) and visual (2.40\u00b0 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0) conditions, as well as thresholds in the combined condition (1.58\u00b0 \u00b1 0.01\u00b0) that are very close to the optimal prediction (1.57\u00b0 \u00b1 0.02\u00b0, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, green and brown curves). Critically, we note that the value of the readout index (0.5) that allows the selective-decoding model to mimic behavioral performance is the same value that we separately found to produce a pattern of CPs that approximates the experimentally observed data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,G</a>). Thus, converging lines of evidence suggest a readout in which opposite cells contribute, but substantially less than congruent cells."

Not surprisingly, as the population size is varied in the simulations, predicted psychophysical thresholds decline as a function of population size in all stimulus conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In our simulations, performance reaches a plateau at a population size of a few hundred neurons, and is roughly comparable to the animals' behavioral performance over a broad range of pool sizes. It must be noted that the extent to which performance asymptotes with population size is likely to depend on the exact structure of correlated noise, the extent to which the true decoder has full and accurate knowledge of the correlation structure, the extent to which correlated noise mimics stimulus variations and thus can be removed by decoding, and the degree of heterogeneity of the tuning curves in the population (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ecker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, however, the key experimental features that we have sought to understand here are related to the sign of CP for opposite cells and not simply the magnitude of CPs; thus, the basic qualitative nature of our findings is not likely to be altered by the considerations above."

Both the pure-correlation model and the selective decoding model could account for the peculiar finding that opposite cells show CPs that are systematically &gt;0.5 in the vestibular condition and &lt;0.5 in the visual condition (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). However, three main features of our findings favor the selective decoding model over the pure correlation model. First, the pure correlation model predicts a pattern of correlated noise that is inconsistent with experimental data from area MSTd, whereas correlated noise in the selective decoding model depends on congruency of tuning in a manner that is similar to that exhibited by pairs of MSTd neurons. Second, the pure correlation model predicts that CPs for opposite cells in the combined condition should be bimodally distributed, which is inconsistent with data from MSTd and with a broad range of predictions of the selective decoding model. Third, with modest weight given to opposite cells, the selective decoding model predicts a pattern of psychophysical sensitivity across stimulus conditions that closely matches the behavioral data from monkeys. Together our findings indicate that, although correlated noise is essential to observe CPs in large neural populations, selective decoding can play important roles in shaping patterns of CPs and behavioral performance."

While the measurement itself is straightforward, the interpretation of CPs has been varied and somewhat controversial (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nienborg et al., 2012</a>). One possible interpretation of a significant CP is that variability in the response of a sensory neuron drives variability in perceptual decisions across trials\u2014this is the so-called \u2018bottom-up\u2019 interpretation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Parker and Newsome, 1998</a>). If this were true, then CPs would at least partially reflect the contribution of each neuron to the decision, and would be shaped by selective decoding of sensory signals. Along these lines, some studies have suggested that the pattern of CPs observed reflects the strategy by which sensory signals are decoded to perform specific tasks (<a href=\"#bib36\">Uka and DeAngelis, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>).

If this is the case, then the pattern of CPs need not be directly related to the way that sensory signals are decoded to perform a task. Regardless of the relative roles of bottom-up and top-down signals in generating CPs, it is broadly recognized that CPs should not be observable in large neural populations unless noise is correlated among neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen and Newsome, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nienborg et al., 2012</a>).

Multisensory representations may have advantages for studying CPs because of the presence of neurons that show opposite tuning for the two cues. If such neurons are decoded as providing evidence in favor of either their visual or vestibular heading preference, then the sign of their CP (whether it is &gt; or &lt;0.5) may reverse depending on the decoding strategy. We suspect that this feature of our model system has provided us with additional leverage to dissociate models that emphasize correlations vs selective decoding."

This accounts for opposite cells having CPs &lt;0.5 in the visual condition, as seen in the real data. Why might responses be decoded according to the vestibular heading preference? One possibility is that this allows the system to estimate heading in a manner that is robust to the presence of moving objects in a scene. Indeed, we have recently shown that a strategy of decoding both congruent and opposite cells according to their vestibular preferences can provide a near-optimal solution to the problem of marginalizing over object motion in order to extract heading in a robust manner (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, adjusting the relative weighting of opposite to congruent cells can allow the population code to tradeoff robustness to object motion against increased sensitivity during cue integration (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the selective decoding strategy that we employ here may provide a flexible way to decode self-motion signals efficiently under conditions in which moving objects may or may not distort optic flow."

In each trial of the discrimination task, the monkey experienced forward motion with a small leftward or rightward component. At the end of each trial, the monkey made a saccadic eye movement to report his perceived motion as leftward or rightward relative to straight ahead. Across trials, heading was varied in fine steps around straight ahead. Nine logarithmically spaced heading angles were tested for each monkey, including an ambiguous straight-forward direction (monkey A: \u00b19\u00b0, \u00b13.5\u00b0, \u00b11.3\u00b0, \u00b10.5\u00b0 and 0\u00b0; monkey C: \u00b116\u00b0, \u00b16.4\u00b0, \u00b12.5\u00b0, \u00b11\u00b0, and 0\u00b0).

We have also tried alternative decoders that are based on Gaussian noise, such as the Fisher linear discriminant (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</a>), and the results are almost identical. Thus, the details of the spiking statistics have little effect on our conclusions. Second, this formulation does not assume that the decoder has knowledge of the structure of correlated noise among neurons in the population, that is, a factorized decoder (<a href=\"#bib2\">Averbeck et al., 2006</a>). While this assumption very likely affects the absolute sensitivity of the decoder, it is unlikely to alter the basic pattern of predicted results regarding CPs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gu et al., 2010</a>). However, further investigation is needed to systematically examine the detailed differences between decoders with and without knowledge of correlations, as well as the effects of different forms of correlated activity. Given these assumptions, our decoder is optimal in the maximum-likelihood sense, and does not otherwise assume a specific (and perhaps substantially suboptimal) \u2018pooling model\u2019, as was done in some previous simulations of CPs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>)."

If the summed likelihood for rightward headings was greater than that for leftward headings, the decoder would report \u2018right\u2019, and vice versa. Choice probability for each neuron in the simulated population was consequently computed for the ambiguous straight-forward heading (0\u00b0) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Britten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2008</a>).

CPs is a measure of the covariation, in trial-by-trial-basis, between neural activity and behavior, typically in a decision task. As is well explained by the authors, the origins of CPs could originate from pure correlated noise of pairs of neurons as estimates of a neuronal population or by selective decoding, the neural response to a stimulus parameter(s) and its relation to behavior. According to the authors there is an historical debate of whether CPs, originate from pure correlated noise from neurons or by the selective decoding in a neuronal population. Here the authors use both simulations in artificial neurons biologically constrained and then tested the simulated results from real data of MSTd neurons, which are known by the authors; these neurons are associated with heading responses to visual flow and vestibular perturbations. The results of both simulations and real data are that MSTs neurons best conform to a selective decoding computation, although pure correlated noise contributes to selectivity."

However, we believe that other computational goals come into play, specifically the problem of dissociating self-motion from object motion. This is now discussed in more detail; decoding a mixed population of congruent and opposite cells may provide a near optimal solution to the problem of estimating heading in the presence of objects, which can be framed as a marginalization problem. In this light, such a decoding scheme becomes less surprising. We are currently working on another manuscript that describes these issues in much greater detail."

On the other hand, including opposite cells adds robustness to object motion, and we have shown (in preliminary form) that titrating the proportion of opposite cells (i.e., the Readout Index) allows one to tradeoff cue integration against robustness to object motion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). We now make this point in the Discussion and this will be explored in detail in a manuscript that is currently in preparation. Whether such a tradeoff in optimality of cue-integration would be observed behaviorally in the presence of moving objects is something that we cannot address at this time, but is something that we would like to study in the future."

In addition to just comparing the small samples of neurons that were classified as matched vs mismatched congruency, we now perform a model comparison using the data from all 127 pairs of neurons, which gives us substantially greater power. Specifically, we fit the data with two models: r_noise = a*r_signal_vestibular, and r_noise = a*r_signal_vestibular + b*r_signal_visual. Accounting for the extra free parameter, we find that the data highly favor the latter model which is consistent with the assumption of the selective decoding model (p=0.0003, sequential F-test). This section of the text has been extensively revamped, and the new results now appear in a modified <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, while the original <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a, b</a> have become figure supplements."

It has been argued in the literature that CPs may be determined solely by how neurons are correlated with each other, and that CPs may not at all reflect how neurons are decoded (we have colleagues who believe this very strongly). So the key issue at stake here, as we have now clarified in the manuscript (see other replies above), is whether there is evidence that the pattern of CPs in influenced by the manner in which neurons are decoded, and we think that the balance of evidence we present makes a reasonably strong argument in favor of this. As also discussed in the text, we think that our particular model system gives us additional power to test these predictions, due to the fact that opposite cells can be decoded either in favor of their visual or vestibular heading preference."
