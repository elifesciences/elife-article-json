Calculating these structures requires high performance computing clusters, a resource that may be limiting to many likely cryo-EM users. To address this limitation and facilitate the spread of cryo-EM, we developed a publicly available \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 computing environment on Amazon's elastic cloud computing infrastructure. This environment provides users with single particle cryo-EM software packages and the ability to create computing clusters with 16\u2013480+ CPUs. We tested our computing environment using a publicly available 80S yeast ribosome dataset and estimate that laboratories could determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures for $50 to $1500 per structure within a timeframe comparable to local clusters. Our analysis shows that Amazon's cloud computing environment may offer a viable computing environment for cryo-EM."

Calculating these structures requires high performance computing clusters, a resource that may be limiting to many likely cryo-EM users. To address this limitation and facilitate the spread of cryo-EM, we developed a publicly available \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 computing environment on Amazon's elastic cloud computing infrastructure. This environment provides users with single particle cryo-EM software packages and the ability to create computing clusters with 16\u2013480+ CPUs. We tested our computing environment using a publicly available 80S yeast ribosome dataset and estimate that laboratories could determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures for $50 to $1500 per structure within a timeframe comparable to local clusters. Our analysis shows that Amazon's cloud computing environment may offer a viable computing environment for cryo-EM."

Recent advances in cryo-EM data collection and analysis, however, have transformed single particle cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kuhlbrandt, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bai et al., 2015</a>), allowing it to achieve resolutions better than 5 \u00c5 for samples ranging in molecular weight from the 4 MDa eukaryotic ribosome (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2013</a>) to the 170 kDa membrane protein \u03b3-secretase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). These high-resolution structures are the result of a new generation of cameras that detect electrons directly without the need of a scintillator, which results in a dramatic increase in the signal-to-noise ratio relative to CCD cameras, the previous most commonly used device (<a href=\"#bib17\">McMullan et al., 2009</a>). In addition to direct electron detection, the high frame rate of these cameras allows each image to be recorded as a \u2018movie\u2019, dividing it into multiple frames. These fractionated images can be used to correct for sample movement during the exposure, further increasing the quality of the cryo-EM images (<a href=\"#bib5\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Scheres, 2014</a>)."

As the number of laboratories using cryo-EM increases, and as existing laboratories begin to pursue high-resolution cryo-EM, gaining immediate access to a high performance cluster may become difficult. For instance, while there are government-funded high performance clusters in the United States (e.g., XSEDE STAMPEDE), it may take up to a month for a user application to be reviewed (Rogelio Hernandez-Lopez, personal communication). Assuming that the application is approved, these clusters may not have appropriate software installed, which further delays data processing. Finally, the user will have a set limit for the number of CPU hours available per project, requiring a new application to be submitted to access the cluster again. All of these problems can be circumvented by using Amazon's EC2 infrastructure, which provides immediate, cost-effective access to hundreds of CPUs with no geographic restrictions."

He writes: \u201cThe first issue is an Amazon trick. The r3.8xlarge instances are marketed as \u201c32 vCPUs\u201d. Actually this is 32 threads running on 16 cores when you read the fine print. For image processing this is generally 18-20 \u201cCPUs\u201d worth of compute power for the \u201c32 vCPUs\u201d. CPU-hr/mo/yr normally measure core-hours, not thread hours. This is a factor of \u223c1.8. If the authors disagree, I would encourage them to run a scalability test on a small problem on a single 32 vCPU instance. Perusing the Amazon site, the cost of a single r3.8xlarge instance with 16 physical cores is currently $2.80 for on demand use, rather than the $0.35 quoted by this manuscript. While it is possible to reduce this by up to \u223c50% through contract prepurchase, the only mechanism I can see for getting the price anywhere close to the cited level is by bidding on unused hours, which can mean substantial delays. Currently the purchase price for an equivalent cluster is \u223c$350/core ($175/thread), or \u223c$7500 for a node almost identical to the $2.80/hr instance. Anyway, by my calculation, when you take all expenses into account, EC2 is about 3-5x more expensive than owning a cluster. However, if the Amazon price were suddenly 10x lower, this would be compelling. If my cost analysis is in error, I would be honestly grateful to see a correction, as it would substantially alter how we operate.\u201d"

There are no reported CPU costs for the entire processing procedures of these structures in the literature. However, on the RELION wiki (<a href=\"http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php/FAQs#Computational_issues\">http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php/FAQs#Computational_issues</a>) it is stated: \u201cWe do 3.x Angstrom ribosome reconstructions from say 100-200 thousand particles in approximately two weeks using around 200-300 cores in parallel\u201d.

Many data sets will contain several hundreds of thousands of particles, and each 2D or 3D classification or refinement run will cost in the order of 100-200$ each (based on your estimates for gamma-secretase and mitoribosome). As in a typical project one would run multiple of these jobs, real costs will quickly reach more than a thousand dollars per structure, even when using the $0.35/hour bidding rate. This is perfectly well acceptable and still competitive with buying a local cluster. But discussing such values in the paper will prevent unpleasant surprises when PIs start receiving EC2 bills."

Currently the purchase price for an equivalent cluster is \u223c$350/core ($175/thread), or \u223c$7500 for a node almost identical to the $2.80/hr instance. Anyway, by my calculation, when you take all expenses into account, EC2 is about 3-5x more expensive than owning a cluster.

Currently, major universities have invested heavily in computing infrastructures, which are absent from many universities around the world. Therefore, as more labs begin to use cryo-EM software, they will need access to larger computing resources.
