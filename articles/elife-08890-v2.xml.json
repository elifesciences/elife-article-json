In addition, ~35% of mRNA coding genes are translated upstream of the primary protein-coding region (uORFs) and 4% are translated downstream (dORFs). Translated lncRNAs preferentially localize in the cytoplasm, whereas untranslated lncRNAs preferentially localize in the nucleus. The translation efficiency of cytoplasmic lncRNAs is nearly comparable to that of mRNAs, suggesting that cytoplasmic lncRNAs are engaged by the ribosome and translated. While most peptides generated from lncRNAs may be highly unstable byproducts without function, ~9% of the peptides are conserved in ORFs in mouse transcripts, as are 74% of pseudogene peptides, 24% of uORF peptides and 32% of dORF peptides. Analyses of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of these conserved peptides show that some are under stabilizing selection, suggesting potential functional importance."

In addition, ~35% of mRNA coding genes are translated upstream of the primary protein-coding region (uORFs) and 4% are translated downstream (dORFs). Translated lncRNAs preferentially localize in the cytoplasm, whereas untranslated lncRNAs preferentially localize in the nucleus. The translation efficiency of cytoplasmic lncRNAs is nearly comparable to that of mRNAs, suggesting that cytoplasmic lncRNAs are engaged by the ribosome and translated. While most peptides generated from lncRNAs may be highly unstable byproducts without function, ~9% of the peptides are conserved in ORFs in mouse transcripts, as are 74% of pseudogene peptides, 24% of uORF peptides and 32% of dORF peptides. Analyses of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of these conserved peptides show that some are under stabilizing selection, suggesting potential functional importance."

For example, translation of the uORFs in the yeast <i>GCN4</i> gene strongly inhibits translation of Gcn4 under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hinnebusch, 2005</a>). However, during amino acid starvation, ribosomes reinitiate translation at the canonical AUG codon, thereby permitting increased synthesis of Gcn4 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hinnebusch, 2005</a>). In human cells, bioinformatic analyses and limited functional testing indicate that uORFs can inhibit protein production, but genome-wide functional analysis has yet to be performed (<a href=\"#bib7\">Calvo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2013</a>)."

In particular, ribosome profiling in mammalian cells reveals many reads derived from lncRNAs and 5\u2019 UTRs, and lncRNAs and 5\u2019UTRs can be co-purified with 80S ribosome, indicating that these transcripts are translated (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">2014</a>). However, unlike canonical protein coding-genes translated from mRNAs, many lncRNAs do not have a predominant ORF based on the ribosome release or disengagement scores (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chew et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Guttman et al., 2013</a>). However, due to a variety of limitations, previous analyses typically did not explicitly identify in-frame translated ORFs, and they identified only several hundred translated regions that do not correspond to canonical protein-coding regions. Importantly, ribosome profiling reads do not necessarily represent its active translation, due to potential artifacts from non-ribosomal entities and scanning ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guttman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ingolia et al., 2014</a>)."

RibORF can effectively distinguish in-frame ORFs from overlapping off-frame ORFs, and it can distinguish reads arising from RNAs that are not associated with ribosomes. Using RibORF, we identify thousands of translated ORFs in lncRNAs, pseudogenes, and mRNA regions upstream (5\u2019UTRs) and downstream (3\u2019UTRs) of protein-coding sequences. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic noncoding RNAs are translated, and that some of these translated products are likely to be biologically meaningful based on their evolutionary conservation."

As snoRNAs are located in nucleus, they should not be accessible to translation machinery located in cytoplasm. Indeed, the sequence reads in the snoRNAs map to a very narrow region and are comparable in the cycloheximide- and harringtonine-treated samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), indicating they do not represent translated regions of these RNAs. To exclude reads that do not represent active translation, we developed a Percentage of Maximum Entropy (PME) approach to measure the uniformity of read distribution across codons in a candidate ORF (See Experimental Procedures). A PME value of 1 represents uniform read distribution, indicative of real translation, while smaller values indicate skewed distribution with a minimum value of 0 indicating reads at a single location, expected for reads not derived from translated RNA. As expected, candidate ORFs from short noncoding RNAs show drastically lower PME values, as compared to canonical protein coding ORFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Low PME values indicate RNAs that are not translated, but rather are protected in non-ribosomal protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ji et al., 2015</a>)."

First, we used PhastCon scores based on 44-vertebrate Multiz alignment (<a href=\"#bib46\">Siepel et al., 2005</a>) to measure conservation of ORF nucleotide sequence among species (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Second, we used the PhyloCSF score to study the protein-coding potential of ORF sequences based on 29-mammal genome alignment (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lin et al., 2011</a>)(<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Third, we checked the conservation of human peptides in mouse transcripts at the amino acid level and defined them to be conserved if two homologous ORFs encode peptides with a BLASTP alignment E-value &lt;10<sup>-4</sup> (False Discovery Rate &lt; 0.0005 for all types and lengths of ORFs; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s5\">5</a>, and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Fourth, for lncRNA peptides conserved between human and mouse, we computed the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution rates of the homologous nucleotide sequences. The Ka/Ks ratio is a commonly used parameter to infer the direction and magnitude of natural selection on peptide sequences (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hurst, 2002</a>). A ratio smaller than 1 indicates a significant number of nucleotide sequence changes that do not result in protein sequence changes, indicating that the protein is under stabilizing (negative) selection and likely to be functional. For these analyses, we excluded the 30 lncRNAs that encode peptides conserved in mouse protein-coding genes and likely to be pseudogenes mis-annotated by GENCODE (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

The pattern is consistent for translated ORFs with different lengths, suggesting that some peptides might be functional.

The 97 aa peptide is conserved in mouse homologous transcript Chd3os, while the 37 aa peptide is not. Interestingly, human lncRNA peptides conserved with mouse peptides encoded by lncRNAs have Ka/Ks ratios significantly lower than 1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). The low Ka/Ks ratios were not due to our BLASTP E-value cutoff (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). 20 such lncRNAs express peptides with Ka/Ks values smaller than 0.5, and 12 have values &lt; 0.3.

However, in accord with previous results linking uORFs to decreased protein levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Calvo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barbosa et al., 2013</a>), the translational efficiency of mRNA coding regions is slightly lower for genes containing uORFs (p&lt;10<sup>-34</sup>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), even though RNA levels of uORF-containing genes somewhat higher than genes lacking uORFs (p&lt;10<sup>-200</sup>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

These are enriched for 'transcription regulators' (p&lt;10<sup>-8</sup>;\u00a0Fisher\u2019s Exact Test; 237 genes are in the pathway 'regulation of transcription; GO:0045449'), particularly zinc finger transcription factors (p&lt;10<sup>-9</sup>; Fisher\u2019s Exact Test), and protein kinases (p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>; Fisher\u2019s Exact Test; 45 genes are in the pathway 'protein kinase cascade GO:0007243'). Interestingly, many AP-1 transcription factors (ATF4, ATF5, ATF2, and JUN) have high usage of uORFs, similar to the yeast homolog Gcn4. For example, ATF4 contains 3 uORFs and 1 overlapping uORF, and the uORF expression is over 300-fold higher than the canonical ORF under normal growth conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). However, under stress conditions, ATF4 efficiently re-initiates translation of the canonical ORF, thereby resulting in higher protein expression (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vattem and Wek, 2004</a>). Many other regulatory genes (e.g. RELA, PTEN and DICER1) also show high uORF usage and suppressed translation of the canonical protein regions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The major determinant of uORF translation efficiency is its start codon as 84% of highly translated uORFs (&gt;three-fold higher than canonical ORFs) use AUG as start codon, while only 32% of poorly translated uORFs (&gt;three-fold lower than canonical ORFs) use AUG (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>)."

First, with one exception (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bazzini et al., 2014</a>), they did not use 3-nt periodicity to identify translated ORFs, but rather relied on the longest ORF length and/or maximum read density, which does not provide clear evidence for in-frame translation. Second, with one exception (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ingolia et al., 2014</a>), they did not filter the many reads that arise from non-ribosomal complexes and hence are irrelevant to identifying translated proteins. Third, we account for the variable distances between the 5\u2019 end of the sequenced fragment and the ribosome A-site that arises due to imperfect RNase trimming of RPFs, and include RPFs with variable lengths into analyses for maximum sequencing read usage and codon coverage. Alignment of A-sites is critical for observing optimal 3-nt periodicity that characterizes translated regions. With this step, we can observe clear 3-nt periodicity for each codon in well expressed translated ORFs. Fourth, with approaches using harringtonine or lactimidomycin treatment to block translational elongation and hence map the translation initiation site (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2012</a>), additional experiments are required, read peaks are often not precisely located at the start codons, and many genes do not show efficient ribosome pausing at start codons. In addition, the ribosome profiling datasets involving mammalian cells that have been analyzed to date were generated by a polyA tailing procedure that causes inaccuracies in determining the true 5\u2019 end of the RPF."

The distinction between translated and untranslated lncRNAs is strongly correlated with whether they are or not in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the translation efficiency of lncRNAs is comparable to that of mRNAs, indicating that simple access of an RNA to the translation machinery in the cytoplasm is a major determinant of how well it is translated. In this regard, lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, capped, and polyadenylated, and hence are largely indistinguishable from mRNAs with respect to translation. It is unclear why some lncRNAs are predominantly nuclear, whereas others are predominantly cytoplasmic, but it seems unlikely that this is simply a matter of chance. It will be interesting to study whether nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of lncRNAs can be regulated during biological processes.

Our results do not indicate that all of the conserved peptides are biologically functional, nor do they identify specific peptides as being functional. Most likely, functional peptides are those with the lowest Ka/Ks ratios, but these ratios need to be corrected for the number of substitutions analyzed for a given conserved region and the probability that they occur by chance.

Nevertheless, at the suggestion of the Reviewers, we perform a standard 80S/polysome experiment and show that all 7 RNAs tested that encode non-canonical, translated ORFs indeed are associated with 80S and/or polysomes (new <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Untranslated control RNAs are not associated with either the 80S or polysomes. The alternative explanations for the data mentioned in Review and discussed below are implausible; they are inconsistent with the very-well understood translation mechanism <i>and</i> the data."
