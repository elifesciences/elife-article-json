We developed a multiscale formalism that relates the characterizations of each cell process to tissue growth and morphogenesis. Having validated the formalism on computer simulations, we quantified separately all morphogenetic events in the <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal thorax and wing pupal epithelia to obtain comprehensive statistical maps linking cell and tissue scale dynamics. While globally cell shape changes, rearrangements and divisions all significantly participate in tissue morphogenesis, locally, their relative participations display major variations in space and time. By blocking division we analyzed the impact of division on rearrangements, cell shape changes and tissue morphogenesis. Finally, by combining the formalism with mechanical stress measurement, we evidenced unexpected interplays between patterns of tissue elongation, cell division and stress. Our formalism provides a novel and rigorous approach to uncover mechanisms governing tissue development."

We developed a multiscale formalism that relates the characterizations of each cell process to tissue growth and morphogenesis. Having validated the formalism on computer simulations, we quantified separately all morphogenetic events in the <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal thorax and wing pupal epithelia to obtain comprehensive statistical maps linking cell and tissue scale dynamics. While globally cell shape changes, rearrangements and divisions all significantly participate in tissue morphogenesis, locally, their relative participations display major variations in space and time. By blocking division we analyzed the impact of division on rearrangements, cell shape changes and tissue morphogenesis. Finally, by combining the formalism with mechanical stress measurement, we evidenced unexpected interplays between patterns of tissue elongation, cell division and stress. Our formalism provides a novel and rigorous approach to uncover mechanisms governing tissue development."

An important challenge in biology is to understand how the behaviors of each individual cell can act together to generate a large and reproducible change at the scale of entire tissues and organs.

The relative contributions of these cell processes varied a lot in both space and time. Further experiments then used mutant flies with defects in cell division to analyse the impact of cell division on the other cell processes and the eventual shape of the tissue. Finally, Guirao et al. showed that there are unexpected interactions between the patterns of tissue growth, cell division and the mechanical forces in the tissue."

In this context, the development of quantitative methods is essential to determine the role in tissue and organ development of each cell process, in particular cell divisions, cell rearrangements, cell size and shape changes and apoptoses (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rauzi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Blanchard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aigouy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tomer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Krzic et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Economou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Heller et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Khan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zulueta-Coarasa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Monier et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lau et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rozbicki et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Etournay et al., 2015</a>). However, a general formalism valid in two and three dimensions and allowing to unambiguously decompose tissue growth and morphogenesis into the parts due to each cell process is still needed. Building such a formalism is critical to define the roles of each process and advance our understanding of how gene activities and mechanical forces cooperate in controlling cell dynamics to regulate the growth, shaping, repair or homeostasis of monolayered or three-dimensional cohesive tissues. In particular the lack of a general formalism has impeded a comprehensive characterization of the role of cell divisions and of their orientations during tissue development."

So far, two fundamental properties of cell division have been reported during the morphogenesis of proliferative tissues. First, the orientation of cell divisions has been shown to play a key role in tissue elongation, either by being an anisotropic source of force, or by reducing mechanical stress (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baena-L\u00f3pez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Saburi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aigouy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Quesada-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ranft et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gibson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aliee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Legoff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Campinho et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wyatt et al., 2015</a>). Second, cell division orientation has been reported to be mainly oriented along the direction of mechanical stress (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fink et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Legoff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Campinho et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wyatt et al., 2015</a>). These conclusions were mainly drawn from the observation of tissues where cell divisions are the major contributor of tissue elongation or where cell divisions, tissue deformation and mechanical stress display a common preferred orientation. Yet, embryos, as well as many other tissues or organs, are heterogeneous: cell divisions display rates and orientations varying in space and time, and they are concomitant to other morphogenetic processes such as cell rearrangements, cell size and shape changes and apoptoses. One of the broad challenges in developmental biology is therefore to test and generalize these proposed functions of cell divisions in more heterogeneous contexts."

The method took advantage of the links joining the centroids of a cell and its neighbors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Graner et al., 2008</a>). Measuring the changes of position, size and direction of links, as well as link swapping, yielded a quantification of cell rearrangements and cell size and shape changes characterized by an amplitude, an anisotropy and an orientation. This enabled to separately measure cell rearrangements and cell size and shape changes during tissue development. Generalizing the method to incorporate the remaining biological cell processes, in particular cell divisions and apoptoses, is not straightforward since these cell processes can substantially\u00a0modify the cell and link numbers. We therefore developed a novel formalism that takes into account the changes in link number and which disentangles the measurement of each cell process during tissue development (See Appendix for detailed information and comparison with previous approaches)."

Whenever needed, the subdivision of these main cell processes can be further refined, for instance in a mono-layered tissue to distinguish apoptoses from live cell extrusions, or to distinguish simple rearrangements through four-fold vertices from those with five-fold vertices or higher. Furthermore, introducing cell divisions and apoptoses naturally enables the addition of the other cell processes changing the number of cells such as: (i) the integration of new cells in epithelium sheets (<math id=\"inf6\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">N</mi></math>); (ii) the fusion (coalescence) of cells (<math id=\"inf7\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">C</mi></math>), and (iii) the in/outward cell flux (<math id=\"inf8\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">J</mi></math>), representing the cells entering and exiting the microscope field of view or the boundaries of the tissue of interest (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>).

A deformation rate is thus expressed as the inverse of a time, e.g. 10<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0h<sup>-1</sup> represents a 1% change in dimension within one hour. It can be decomposed into two parts. First (left): an isotropic part that relates to local changes in size. The isotropic part can either be positive or negative, reflecting a local isotropic growth or shrinkage of the tissue. The rate of dilation is represented by a circle, the diameter of which scales with the magnitude of the rate. Positive and negative dilations are represented by circles filled with white and grey, respectively. Second (right): an anisotropic part that relates to local changes in shape. The anisotropic part of the deformation rate quantifies the local contraction-elongation or convergence-extension (CE) without change in size. It can be represented by a bar in the direction of the elongation, the length and direction of which quantify the magnitude and the orientation of the elongation. (<b>e</b>) Workflow used to quantify tissue development. Image analysis leads to characterization of cell contours (segmentation), and lineages (tracking) in the case of movies. Our formalism yields an identification of each cell-level process and its description in terms of cell-cell links (see\u00a0a\u2013b) and a quantitative measurement of their associated deformation rate (see\u00a0c\u2013d). Averaging over time, space and/or movies of different animals yields a map of each quantity in each region of space at each time with a good signal-to-noise ratio (see <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>)."

During pupal metamorphosis, the <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal thorax (notum, yellow dashed box in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>) is a monolayered cuboidal epithelial tissue. From 10\u2009h after pupa formation (hAPF), it undergoes several morphogenetic movements associated with cell divisions, cell rearrangements and cell size and shape changes as well as delaminations, which can be due to live cell extrusions or apoptoses (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Marinari et al., 2012</a>). An important feature of this tissue is its heterogeneity, which enables to simultaneously investigate the various mechanisms driving morphogenesis and their interplays. Furthermore, applying our formalism on this tissue will provide a valuable resource since it is a general model to uncover conserved mechanisms that regulate planar cell polarization, tissue morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis and tissue mechanics, and to perform genome-wide RNAi screen (see for example [<a href=\"#bib51\">Mummery-Widmer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Olgu\u00edn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Marinari et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Antunes et al., 2013</a>])."

We segmented and tracked the cells of the whole movie (~3 10<sup>6</sup> cell contours with a relative error below 10<sup>-4</sup>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3a</a>). The display of cell displacements, as well as the tracking of cell patches deforming over time enable to visualize the heterogeneity of tissue growth and morphogenesis between 14 and 28 hAPF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3b,c</a>). Directly measuring the rate and orientation of cell divisions, we found that ~17 10<sup>3</sup> divisions take place during the development of the tissue, and that both the cell division rates and orientations display major variations in space and time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c,e</a>). Cell division rate is higher in the posterior part of the tissue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) and many regions harbor oriented cell divisions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). Division orientation is represented by a bar (<math id=\"inf100\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">o</mi></msub></math>, Appendix C.3.2), the length and orientation of which represent respectively the cell division orientation anisotropy and main orientation in each region. In particular, in the central posterior part of the tissue the orientation of cell divisions is medial-lateral, while in a more anterior and lateral domain cell divisions are oriented at roughly 45\u00b0 relative to the anterior-posterior axis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>, boxes). While these descriptions of tissue development by following patches of cells, cell division rate and orientation are essential, we now explain how the formalism enables to rigorously tackle three major steps to quantitatively study the morphogenesis of an epithelial tissue: (i) measure the local CE rates associated with each process for one animal; (ii) determine the average and the variability of cell dynamics over several animals; and (iii) measure the components of each cell process CE rate along tissue morphogenesis."

The results were also plotted as 14 h average maps on the last image analyzed to quantify the growth and morphogenesis of each patch between 14 and 28 hAPF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f\u2013j</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). We find that tissue dilation mainly occurs through divisions, cell size changes and apoptoses, the dilation rates of the other processes being negligible (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While the dilation rates are critical to study important processes such as apical constriction or local tissue growth, we focus here on the CE rates to illustrate how the formalism enables to better understand the role of cell processes in morphogenesis, with a focus on oriented cell divisions. The tissue CE rate <math id=\"inf109\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math> map demonstrates that the tissue undergoes various CE movements, in particular in its posterior medial and lateral domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>, boxes). As expected, the cell division orientation (<math id=\"inf110\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">o</mi></msub></math>) and division CE rate (<math id=\"inf111\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math>) maps (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e,g</a>) show strong similarities (alignment = 0.94). Importantly, the formalism now enables to compare directly the division CE rate <math id=\"inf112\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math> to the other CE rates. First, the <math id=\"inf113\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf114\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math> CE rates are roughly aligned in the medial posterior region, while they have clearly different orientations in the lateral domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f,g</a>). Second, both cell rearrangements (<math id=\"inf115\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi></math>) and cell shape changes (<math id=\"inf116\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi></math>) have strong CE rates in many domains where cell divisions are also oriented (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g\u2013i</a>). Third, while cell delaminations are spatially regulated and numerous (~2.5 10<sup>3</sup>), their CE rates (<math id=\"inf117\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">A</mi></math>) are negligible, and\u00a0their effect is mostly isotropic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3j</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1e</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2e</a>). Therefore, tissue CE mostly occurs through oriented divisions, rearrangements and cell shape changes. Together this shows how our formalism enables to express quantitatively the relevant information extracted from millions of cell contours over space and time and to separately measure and represent the CE rates of the tissue and of each cell process at the scale of groups of cells in a whole epithelial tissue."

This method uses reliable landmarks (for space registration) and prominent, stereotyped rotational movements (for time registration); and it can be applied to mutant conditions and to other tissues (see Materials and methods and below for mutant conditions). Upon space-time registration, each deformation rate measured in each cell patch in 5 hemi-notum movies can be averaged to yield average maps of an archetype hemi-notum representing the dynamics of\u00a0~7 10<sup>6</sup> cell contours, i.e. ~23 10<sup>6</sup> links, 40 10<sup>3</sup> divisions, 5.4 10<sup>3</sup> delaminations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). For each process and in each region of the archetype hemi-notum, the corresponding biological variability is measured by quantifying its variations between hemi-nota in each region. This was used to determine whether each CE rate was significant in a given region (plotted in color or grey, respectively). Collectively, these approaches yield average maps of the tissue CE rate <math id=\"inf124\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math> and of the main cell process CE rates (<math id=\"inf125\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math>, <math id=\"inf126\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi></math>, and <math id=\"inf127\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">A</mi></math>) that can be superimposed for comparison (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a>).

Measurements are averaged over sliding time windows of 2 h and spatially over the region (h) 1, (i) 2, (j) 3, (k) 4. In region 1, one can distinguish three phases where tissue morphogenesis mostly occurs via: (14\u201318 hAPF) cell rearrangements as divisions and cell shape changes nearly cancel out; (18\u201323 hAPF) cell shape changes, and it reaches its peak; (23\u201326 hAPF) oriented cell divisions as cell rearrangements and cell shape changes cancel out. In region 2, the same temporal phases can be distinguished: (14\u201318 hAPF) the effect of divisions is almost cancelled by cell shape changes; (18\u201322 hAPF) only weak changes occur; (22\u201326 hAPF) cell rearrangements and cell shape changes add up and morphogenesis becomes significant. In region 3, like in region 1, the two waves of oriented cell divisions can be seen clearly with <math id=\"inf165\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi><mrow><mi></mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo>/</mo></mrow></msub></math> peaks occurring around 16 and 23 hAPF, but here both division waves have a negative component along tissue CE rate. Cell rearrangements and cell shape changes make up for the negative sign of divisions, thereby mostly accounting for tissue morphogenesis in this region. In region 4, from about 18 hAPF onwards, the tissue CE rate significantly increases and almost perfectly overlaps with cell shape change CE rate, meaning that tissue morphogenesis solely occurs via cell shape changes."

The measurements show that the cell division component (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>) can either be strongly positive in some regions (regions 1 and 2) or strongly negative in others (region 3). In contrast, cell rearrangements and cell shape changes mainly have positive components along tissue morphogenesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f,g</a>). In regions 1 and 2, the positive component of cell divisions corresponds to the one described in the literature, namely that cell divisions and tissue elongation are oriented in the same direction. Conversely, our measurements in region 3 show that cell divisions have a negative component corresponding to divisions taking place mostly orthogonally to the direction of tissue elongation. The measurements of cell rearrangements and cell shape components show that the elongation of the tissue in this region results from the strongly positive components of cell shape changes or of cell rearrangements (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f,g</a>). Finally in region 4, although most cells divide once, the cell division component is small relative to that of cell shape changes that almost completely accounts for tissue deformation in that region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013g</a>)."

The important deformations of cell patches over time show that wing morphogenesis is heterogeneous as well, displaying strong tissue deformations in the anterior and posterior domains of the wing, and milder deformations in the medial domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5b</a>). To characterize quantitatively these deformations of the tissue and relate them to cellular processes occurring in this wing, we applied our formalism to this pupal wing between 15 and 32\u2004hAPF and determined maps of averaged tissue CE rates <math id=\"inf192\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math> and cell processes CE rates <math id=\"inf193\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math>, <math id=\"inf194\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi></math>, <math id=\"inf195\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf196\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">A</mi></math> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b\u2013e</a>), as well as their projections onto <math id=\"inf197\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math> direction, <math id=\"inf198\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\"></mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo>/</mo></mrow></msub></math>, <math id=\"inf199\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\"></mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo>/</mo></mrow></msub></math>, <math id=\"inf200\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\"></mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo>/</mo></mrow></msub></math>, <math id=\"inf201\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\"></mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo>/</mo></mrow></msub></math> and <math id=\"inf202\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">A</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\"></mi><mo mathvariant=\"bold\" rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo mathvariant=\"bold\">/</mo></mrow></msub></math> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f\u2013i</a>). Even on a single wing, all CE rate maps display heterogeneous but smooth patterns over time, showing that this scale of space-time averaging (40<math id=\"inf203\"><mo>\u00d7</mo></math>40\u2009\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, 2\u00a0h) is also suitable for the wing (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5c\u2013f</a>). These measurements confirmed the observed heterogeneity in tissue morphogenesis by evidencing major tissue CE rates in anterior and posterior domains of the wing, with a tilt of about\u2004\u00b145\u00b0 with respect to the horizontal axis, respectively, and smaller CE rates in the medial domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b,f</a>). The CE rates of cell processes <math id=\"inf204\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math>, <math id=\"inf205\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi></math>, <math id=\"inf206\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi></math> display smooth and heterogeneous maps while displaying different patterns in space (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c\u2013e</a>), while the CE rate of <math id=\"inf207\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">A</mi></math> is negligible (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). Like in the dorsal thorax, rearrangements and cell shape changes mainly have positive components along tissue CE rate and they make up most of tissue morphogenesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f,h,i</a>). Like in the dorsal thorax, oriented cell divisions in the wing display more variety in their component along tissue morphogenesis than <math id=\"inf208\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf209\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi></math>: <math id=\"inf210\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math> has positive components along <math id=\"inf211\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math> in anterior and posterior wing domains, where tissue morphogenesis is the strongest, while it has negative components in the medial wing domain, where morphogenesis is milder (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,g</a> box). Together our analyses of morphogenesis in the notum and the wing illustrate how our formalism enables the quantitative characterization of morphogenesis in various epithelial tissues."

This indicates that suppressing proliferation not only makes oriented division CE rate vanish, but also has an indirect impact on both cell rearrangements and cell shape changes.

                                "text": "To better understand this last point, and more generally the effect of oriented cell divisions, we used computer simulations. We compared our previous simulation of cell divisions oriented along the horizontal axis of tissue elongation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6k</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6a</a>) with simulations where only the pattern of divisions has been modified in two distinct ways: (i) we aligned all cell divisions along the vertical axis, namely orthogonally to tissue elongation, thereby leading to a negative component of <math id=\"inf265\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math> (<math id=\"inf266\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\"></mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo>/</mo></mrow></msub></math> &lt; 0) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6l</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6b</a>), thus mimicking our observation in region 3 of the wild-type tissue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>); (ii) we suppressed divisions (<math id=\"inf267\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\"></mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\">/</mo><mo>/</mo></mrow></msub></math> = 0, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6m</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6c</a>), mimicking our observation in <i>trbl<sup>up</sup></i> tissue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). In both cases, we found that modifying the pattern of divisions impacts simultaneously <math id=\"inf268\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math>, <math id=\"inf269\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">R</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf270\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi></math> in addition to <math id=\"inf271\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6l,m</a>). When divisions are orthogonal to tissue elongation, cell rearrangements, and to a lesser extent cell shape changes, are greatly increased along the direction of deformation, but they only partly compensate the CE rate of horizontally oriented divisions in the initial simulation, thereby resulting in reduced tissue elongation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6l</a>). When divisions are suppressed, cell rearrangements and cell shape changes are moderately increased along the direction of deformation, and compensate even less horizontally oriented divisions, thereby resulting in further reduced tissue elongation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6m</a>). These two simulations therefore recapitulate two aspects of our experimental observations: (i) how divisions orthogonal to the tissue CE rate in wild-type have a negative component along tissue morphogenesis, as found in some regions of the wild-type tissue (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>, region 3); (ii) how divisions, regardless of their orientation, can facilitate tissue elongation by indirectly impacting cells rearrangements and cell shape changes, as observed in <i>trbl<sup>up</sup></i> tissue where proliferation is severely reduced and tissue deformations are globally decreased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6h</a>)."

This \u2018junctional stress' gathers all forces (regardless of their biological origin, including cortical and cytoplasmic forces) transmitted between cells via adherens junctions. The relevance of junctional stress quantification to understand tissue development has been demonstrated by methods such as laser ablation (for review see [<a href=\"#bib57\">Rauzi and Lenne, 2011</a>]) or optical trapping of cell junction (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bambardekar et al., 2015</a>).

We improved our method to make it numerically more robust and efficient, thereby enabling the determination of cell pressures, junction tension and junctional stress over the whole tissue (see Materials and methods, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The stress has an isotropic part related to the pressure represented by a circle (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Its anisotropic part has an amplitude and a direction of traction represented by a bar, and a direction of compression (of\u00a0equal magnitude and perpendicular, the display of which is redundant). Even on a single animal, the junctional stress maps vary smoothly over time and space, and are symmetric with respect to the midline, revealing the quality of the signal-to-noise ratio (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1c</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4f</a>). We then performed their ensemble average over several animals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>) and compared the anisotropic part of the junctional stress maps and of the CE rate maps of the different processes measured by the formalism. Focusing here on divisions, the analysis confirms that on average cell division orientation aligns well with junctional stress orientation, even in such a heterogeneous tissue (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, alignment = 0.87). Moreover, the division CE rate, which is more relevant to tissue morphogenesis, is also well correlated with junctional stress orientation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>, alignment = 0.73)."

In particular, we can exclude that a positive or negative component of cell divisions would be due to distinct relationships between division CE rate and stress orientations. Indeed, cell divisions have a positive component in region 1 and 2, while cell division CE rate <math id=\"inf284\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">D</mi></math> is either poorly aligned (region 1, alignment = 0.16) or well aligned (region 2, alignment = 0.97) with junctional stress orientation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). In addition to regions where stress, division CE rate and tissue elongation are well aligned (region 2, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), we also find regions where, although cell divisions and junctional stress remain well aligned (region 3, alignment = 0.94, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>), the tissue CE rate (<math id=\"inf285\"><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi></math>) is almost orthogonal to divisions and stress (alignment = -0.88, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>), mostly occurring through cell rearrangements and cell shape changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f,g</a>). Altogether our results illustrate how the combination of the formalism and a stress inference method enables to uncover additional interplays between cell divisions, stress and tissue elongation. This sets the stage for in-depth spatial and temporal investigations of the interactions between each cell process and mechanical stress during tissue development."

The formalism is free from assumptions regarding biological mechanisms, modeling or external forces and it has numerous advantages. Its unified and separate measurements of the contributions of each cell process to tissue growth and morphogenesis significantly help describe and quantify the mechanisms governing tissue development. These measurements have been validated with computer simulations. They can be easily represented on spatial and temporal maps or graphs to describe the interplay between divisions, cell rearrangements, cell shape and size changes and apoptoses, as well as the interplays between cell processes and junctional stress, thus facilitating their comparison in wild-type and mutant conditions. In combination with the recent advances in light microscopy, genetics and physical approaches, our unified framework and methods provide a basis for comprehensive analyses of the mechanisms driving tissue development."

The tracking relied on the comparison between cells in one image and the following, based on overlap of cells as well as centroid positions.

We thus observe that for these five hemi-notum movies the rescaling is not crucial. The variability in tissue scale for these wild-type tissue movies is lower than the variability in macrochaetae positions (not shown). After rescaling, the residual dispersion is slightly lower than the initial one: the standard deviation of macrochaetae position becomes 4.5\u2009\u03bcm along <math id=\"inf381\"><mi>x</mi></math> and 5.5\u2009\u03bcm along <math id=\"inf382\"><mi>y</mi></math>.

In the region of the tissue located near the origin of axes, we observed that the rotation rate systematically passed through a maximum during the development: this rotation peak could be used as a biological reference time. For that purpose, the rotation rate was measured and spatially integrated over a rectangular reference window. Plotting this average\u00a0versus frame number yielded a bell-shaped curve (shown in Figure S4 of [<a href=\"#bib11\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>]). We applied a time translation to each movie so that these curves overlapped. We matched the portion of the curve which had the steepest slope: we thus used the time corresponding to 3/4 of the peak value, in the ascent (rather than the maximum itself, which by definition had a vanishing slope). Its average value was 18:40 hAPF. Hereafter, \u2018hAPF' indicates the time after this temporal translation has been applied. For instance, after synchronization, the maximum of the contraction-elongation and rotation rates were consistently found at 19:20 and 19:40 hAPF, respectively. This determination reached a <math id=\"inf386\"> <mo>\u00b1 </mo></math> 1 interframe (i.e. <math id=\"inf387\"> <mo>\u00b1 </mo></math>5\u2009min) relative precision. After this synchronization, we determined that the period of time included in all movies was 13:55-27:55 hAPF (hereafter and in the main text, rounded to \u201814-28 hAPF\u2019), corresponding to 169 frames, 68 interframes analyzed in what follows. Global time averages were performed over all these frames. Sliding window averages were performed over 2\u2009h every 5 min. The macrochaetae were again manually determined at the time 16h30 APF determined with this synchronization. To improve the precision, the time and space registration was iterated: it changed only slightly, evidencing the robustness of this double registration. The <i>trbl<sup>up</sup></i> tissues were synchronized with the same procedure as the wild-type tissue, up to a <math id=\"inf388\"><mo>\u223c</mo></math>10\u2009min precision. For experiments performed at 29\u00b0C, the development is accelerated. This was taken into account by dividing time intervals by 0.9 (as determined with <math id=\"inf389\"><mrow> <mo>\u00b1 </mo><mn>0.05</mn></mrow></math> precision by the widening of the wild-type tissue rotation peak [<a href=\"#bib11\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>])."

Each cell is defined as a set of pixels, here on a 2D square lattice; their number defines cell area. The pixelisation of the calculation lattice can be chosen to match the resolution of experimental images. A cell shape changes when one of its pixels is attributed to another cell instead. We used periodic boundary conditions, with external medium surrounding cells (a state without adhesion or area and perimeter constraints). We use here a simple version where cells minimise their surface energy. Energy minimisation uses Monte Carlo sampling and the Metropolis algorithm, as follows. We randomly draw (without replacement) a lattice pixel and one of its eight neighboring pixels. If both pixels belong to different cells, we try to copy the state of the neighboring pixel to the first one. If the copying decreases the total energy, we accept it, and if it increases the total energy, we accept it with a probability &lt;1 known as \u2018fluctuation allowance\u2019."

Stretching the pattern and allowing for cell shape relaxation led to oriented rearrangements. Affinely stretching the pattern by direct image manipulation using an image treatment software instead of Potts simulations (hence not followed by any cell shape relaxation) led to strong cell shape changes. Delaminations were obtained by gradually decreasing the cell target area. Cell integration movie was produced by reversing the order of images of delamination simulation movie. Fusions were forced on cells by random removal of cell-cell junctions (the same image was gradually Gaussian-blurred then thresholded), and cells were then let to relax their shapes. Boundary flux was implemented by gradual removal of successive external cell layers. Rotation of the cell patch\u00a0was achieved by direct image manipulation. A simulation movie is made with 241 frames, 240 interframes. It would be analogous to a experimental movie of 240 <math id=\"inf418\"><mo>\u00d7</mo></math> 5 min, or 20\u2009h.

Several descriptive terms, such as cell or tissue polarity, oriented cell divisions, convergence-extension, or intercalation, have an underlying common point: their quantitative description refers to an amplitude, an anisotropy and a direction. The mathematically robust objects that encompass simultaneously these informations are the tensors, which also offer the advantage to be valid in spaces of two, three or any dimensions. Using tensors is particularly important in a heterogeneous tissue like the notum, where morphogenetic flows of various amplitude, direction and anisotropy occur at different locations."

While these classical descriptions of the cell division rate and orientation are essential, we need to quantitatively determine to which extent they contribute to tissue morphogenesis. Characterizing divisions using tensors can result in a better description of oriented cell divisions and a better understanding of their effects. Similarly, if a cell rearrangement is followed immediately by its inverse (which often occurs either in reality, or as an artifact when segmenting a short junction), this leads back to the initial state, and their opposite effects cancel out; while if two rearrangements occur in the same direction, their effects cumulate. Counting cell rearrangements as integer numbers leads to <math id=\"inf502\"><mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> rearrangements in both examples, while a tensor analysis better captures in each case its actual impact to morphogenesis."

Cell processes are described statistically rather than with details.

If we had directly adapted the formalism presented in the above papers (Section A.2), the tensor describing cell shape and size changes would have been strongly affected by the changes in cell and link numbers, and would thus have lost a clear interpretation.

Although the initial and final states of those two simulations are almost identical, in case (i) both tissue strain <math id=\"inf795\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></math> and geometrical strain <math id=\"inf796\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></math> are null (within segmentation errors), in sharp contrast to case (ii) where significant tissue and geometrical strains are measured leading to <math id=\"inf797\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi><mo>*</mo></msup><mo>=</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></math> (within segmentation errors). <math id=\"inf798\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></math> definition (<a href=\"#equ78\">Equation 72</a>) is therefore one of the main innovations and improvements of this formalism.

These forces can be internal ones such as active cytoskeletal forces, viscous dissipation or cytoplasm pressure, or external ones such as interactions with another cell layer or solid substrate. It is written as part of classical mechanics of deformable materials; the latter describes the deformation of patches (usually called \u2018Representative volume elements\u2019 or RVE), large enough that the material appears continuous (i.e. without signatures of cell-scale correlations at patch scale), and small enough so that each measurement is rather homogeneous over the patch, and that it represents a small fraction of the whole material. In this spirit, we determine the deformation self-consistently at the patch scale, i.e. coarse-grained over several cells, through statistics over links between neighbor cell centers. Our formalism is directly written for arbitrary finite deformation, in both 2D and 3D, in analogy with classical continuum mechanics; it is not restricted to homogeneous or small deformations, or to small or large numbers of cells. As they should, deformation measurements vanish for rigid body movements, namely if the tissue translates or rotates as a whole."

Each measurement meaningfully and unambiguously quantifies its associated biological process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). Our measurements of tissue and cell process strains are obtained by averaging over the relevant biological space and time scales. The quantities we define, expressed in the same relevant unit (dimensionless strain or rate of deformation per unit time), can be separately measured. These quantities add up to yield the growth and morphogenesis at the patch scale (enabling to reconstruct the development at the tissue scale), as reflected in the balance equation (<a href=\"#equ21\">Equation 15</a>) where the total material deformation rate is expressed as sum of the respective deformation rates associated with each individual cell process. In addition, since links are the very objects whose creation and disappearance define a change in neighbor relationships (such as cell divisions, rearrangements, or apoptoses/delaminations), our description of these processes is versatile, enabling to deal with four-fold or higher vertices, distinguish cell rearrangements which involve four or more cells, and similarly distinguish apoptoses/delaminations which involve four or more cells."

Their motivation is that the deformation of such a triangle can be unambiguously defined and determined.\u00a0Currently, their formalism has been developed in 2D with triangles, and it could in principle be generalized to 3D using tetrahedrons. Our formalism, although we used it here to study 2D epithelial tissues, has been directly written in a way which is independent of the space dimension, and is therefore valid in both 2D and 3D."

This term is related to\u00a0correlations between cell elongation and tissue rotation, or between cell elongation and cell area change.\u00a0It captures local inhomogeneities of shear in the patch and arises for instance when neighboring cell rows slide with respect to each other. This correlation term appears when averaging over the triangles tiling a patch of tissue. Indeed, in the simple case of tissue patch deforming in the absence of topological changes, the shear of a given triangle is exactly equal to its (corotational) change of elongation. When averaging the shears and elongations of triangles over the patch, the tissue shear (defined as the average triangle shear over the patch) is now equal to the (corotational) change of average triangle elongation, plus this extra correlation term. Therefore, this\u00a0term already exists without topological changes occurring and remains even when averaging at large scale. When this correlation term contributes significantly to tissue shear, their formalism and ours should yield different measurements of the other terms quantifying cell processes."

Since the time interval between two images is finite rather than infinitesimal, deformations are finite rather than infinitesimal; treating deformations as small might result in errors which accumulate when cumulating deformations over several time intervals.

It would also be useful to compare the impact on the balance equation of cell fluxes either occurring at the boundaries of the tissue, of the field of view, or of each Eulerian grid compartment (for different compartment sizes).
