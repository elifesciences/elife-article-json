Despite this intriguing ability, their mechanism is unknown. In this study, we show that <i>angptl2</i> overexpression is sufficient to expand definitive HSPCs in zebrafish embryos. <i>Angptl1/2</i> are required for definitive hematopoiesis and vascular specification of the hemogenic endothelium. The loss-of-function phenotype is reminiscent of the <i>notch</i> mutant <i>mindbomb (mib)</i>, and a strong genetic interaction occurs between <i>angptls</i> and <i>notch</i>. Overexpressing <i>angptl2</i> rescues <i>mib</i> while overexpressing <i>notch</i> rescues <i>angptl1/2</i> morphants. Gene expression studies in ANGPTL2-stimulated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells showed a strong <i>MYC</i> activation signature and <i>myc</i> overexpression in <i>angptl1/2</i> morphants or <i>mib</i> restored HSPCs formation. ANGPTL2 can increase NOTCH activation in cultured cells and ANGPTL receptor interacted with NOTCH to regulate NOTCH cleavage. Together our data provide insight to the <i>angptl</i>-mediated <i>notch</i> activation through receptor interaction and subsequent activation of <i>myc</i> targets."

The loss-of-function phenotype is reminiscent of the <i>notch</i> mutant <i>mindbomb (mib)</i>, and a strong genetic interaction occurs between <i>angptls</i> and <i>notch</i>. Overexpressing <i>angptl2</i> rescues <i>mib</i> while overexpressing <i>notch</i> rescues <i>angptl1/2</i> morphants. Gene expression studies in ANGPTL2-stimulated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells showed a strong <i>MYC</i> activation signature and <i>myc</i> overexpression in <i>angptl1/2</i> morphants or <i>mib</i> restored HSPCs formation. ANGPTL2 can increase NOTCH activation in cultured cells and ANGPTL receptor interacted with NOTCH to regulate NOTCH cleavage. Together our data provide insight to the <i>angptl</i>-mediated <i>notch</i> activation through receptor interaction and subsequent activation of <i>myc</i> targets."

Through a series of experiments, Lin et al. show that angiopoietin-like proteins interact with Notch and help transform Notch into its active form, which is necessary for blood stem cell growth. Lin et al. also found that both angiopoietin-like proteins and Notch affect the same signaling molecules. This suggests that the two proteins may work together as part of the same molecular pathway. The work suggests an alternative method to activate Notch for blood stem cell stimulation during processes such as bone marrow or cord blood transplantation."

An important goal in studying stem cells is to identify factors that can expand HSPCs in vitro, while maintaining their self-renewal capacity. Scientists have turned to clues during embryonic hematopoietic development to identify novel factors that regulate this expansion. Developmental hematopoiesis occurs in at least two distinct phases, in which an initial transient wave produces mainly primitive erythrocytes and myeloid cells, followed by a definitive wave which produces long-term HSPCs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Orkin and Zon, 2008</a>). Ontogeny studies across species have identified the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region as the site from which definitive HSPCs arise (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dieterlen-Lievre, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Tavian et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jaffredo et al., 1998</a>). Recent studies using time-lapse imaging in live zebrafish embryos and live mouse thick tissue sections revealed that HSPCs bud off from the endothelium lining the ventral wall of the developing dorsal aorta (DA) prior to entering circulation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bertrand et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boisset et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</a>). Subsequent to their birth in the AGM, HSPCs migrate to the fetal liver where they undergo significant expansion in vivo (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ema and Nakauchi, 2000</a>) before colonizing the bone marrow and provide life-long supply of all blood cells."

They are synthesized as \u223c300 kD full-length precursor proteins that undergo a series of proteolytic cleavages in order to become fully activated. Prior to translocating to the cell surface, NOTCH is first cleaved by furin-like convertases in the trans-Golgi compartment, resulting in a heterodimer composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain and the C-terminal-transmembrane/intracellular domain, bound through noncovalent linkage. Canonical NOTCH activation requires its obligatory interaction with NOTCH ligands belonging to the Delta/Serrate/Jagged/LAG-2 (DSL) family (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fortini, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</a>). Several studies support a model in which ligand binding followed by endocytosis creates a mechanical force that alters the conformation of a juxtamembrane NOTCH negative regulatory region (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</a>). This permits cleavage of NOTCH by ADAM/TACE (a disintegrin and metalloprotease/tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 converting enzyme) at Site 2 (S2), generating the membrane-anchored NOTCH extracellular truncation (NEXT) fragment. NEXT is a substrate for the \u03b3-secretase complex, which cleaves Site 3 (S3), releasing the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) to freely translocate into the nucleus to interact with DNA binding protein CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1)/RBPj\u03ba and initiate transcription of target genes."

To determine whether <i>angptls</i> and <i>notch</i> genetically interact, we injected <i>angptls-</i>MO into a <i>notch</i> reporter line, <i>Tg(Tp1bglob:eGFP)</i><sup><i>um14</i></sup> where eGFP is expressed under the control of a <i>notch-</i>responsive element consisting twelve <i>RBPj\u03ba</i> binding sites (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parsons et al., 2009</a>). Seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <i>angptls-</i>MO morphants had reduced eGFP expression, suggesting that <i>zangptls</i> are required for <i>notch</i> signaling. We then evaluated whether forced expression of constitutively active <i>notch</i> could rescue <i>angptls-</i>MO morphants. We observed that <i>angptls-</i>MO injected into heatshock-inducible double Tg, <i>Tg(hsp70:Gal4;UAS:NICD)</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Scheer et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Burns et al., 2005</a>) restored <i>cmyb-</i> and <i>runx1-</i>positive HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and data not shown). Surprisingly, <i>mib</i> embryos, normally devoid of HSPCs, crossed to <i>Tg(hsp70:zangptl2)</i> also rescued <i>cmyb-</i> and <i>runx1-</i>positive HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and data not shown) at 36hpf upon heatshock. Together, these genetic relationships between <i>zangptls</i> and <i>notch</i> place <i>zangptl</i> signaling downstream of <i>mib</i> but upstream of <i>notch</i> activation/<i>NICD</i> formation during zebrafish definitive hematopoiesis."

                                "text": "While we know that ANGPTLs has direct effects on several mammalian cell types in culture (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kubota et al., 2005</a>) but because they are secreted factors, the lack of their endogenous receptor identification in zebrafish limits our ability to assess which endogenous cell population they act upon. The mammalian ANGPTL receptor was identified to belong to a large superfamily of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>). Our attempts at establishing the zebrafish orthologue did not yield any likely candidate, due to the high similarity between the structural and functional domains for all members within this family and is thus beyond the scope of this paper. Despite this, we can extrapolate from whether <i>notch</i>, through which <i>zangptls</i> signal, can exert in a cell autonomous fashion on the endothelial cells or HSPCs during hematopoiesis. To do this, we utilized a transient overexpression system to image the AGM in live embryos by time-lapse spinning disk confocal microscopy. Because HSPCs in the AGM originate from the once <i>kdrl-</i>positive hemogenic endothelium, we first addressed whether <i>notch</i> has an effect on endothelial cells. We microinjected transposon-based vectors (Tol2) containing a <i>draculin</i> (<i>drl</i>) promoter driving eGFP and a 6.4-kb <i>kdrl</i> promoter driving expression of either constitutively active <i>NOTCH</i> (<i>NICD</i>, derived from human <i>NOTCH1</i>) or eGFP (as control) into <i>Tg(kdrl:Hras-mCherry);casper</i> embryos. The latter is a pan-vascular Tg line (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chi et al., 2008</a>) that expresses membrane-bound mCherry in all endothelial cells and is bred into the transparent <i>casper</i> (<a href=\"#bib70\">White et al., 2008</a>) background for ease of imaging without interference from developing melanocytes. <i>Drl</i> is expressed very early (\u223c3 ss) and marks all blood, vascular and cardiac lineages during zebrafish development (Mosimann C et al., submitted). Its sustained expression well before and throughout the onset of hematopoiesis would hence serve as a marker for all cells expressing the Tol2 vectors (GFP<sup>+</sup>). We screened embryos with similar degree of GFP mosaicism to image from \u223c28hpf for 24 hr in the AGM and scored only the number of budding GFP<sup>+</sup> cells that lined the ventral floor of the DA (also mCherry<sup>+</sup>). In the single frames (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) of AGM budding time-lapse videos (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1 and 2</a>), we very rarely observe any AGM budding from GFP<sup>+</sup>/mCherry<sup>+</sup> hemogenic endothelium in the control embryos (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In contrast, there was significantly more AGM budding events in embryos injected with constitutively active <i>NOTCH</i> (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) (ranges for eGFP: 0\u20132; <i>NICD</i>: 0\u20136), all of which are depicted in the <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> graph. These results highly suggest that <i><i>NOTCH</i></i> can exert a cell autonomous effect on hemogenic endothelial cells destined to become HSPC."

The Runx1+23 enhancer element was identified in mouse to be highly expressed in the hematopoietic clusters in the AGM but unlike endogenous <i>Runx1</i>, it is expressed in only a very small subset of the underlying endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nottingham et al., 2007</a>). The <i>Tg(Runx1+23:NLS-mCherry)</i> Tg line expresses a nuclear localized (NLS) mCherry mainly restricted to HSPCs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tamplin et al., 2015</a>). We also detected nearly no mCherry mRNA expression in the hemogenic endothelial cells of <i>Tg(Runx1+23:NLS-mCherry)</i> embryos at 36hpf by WISH (data not shown) justifying its use to drive expression of our transgenes specifically in budded HSPCs. Newly born HSPCs colonize the CHT starting at \u223c48hpf and expand tremendously until 80hpf in vivo. For these reasons, we scored the total number of transgene-positive (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells in the CHT at 72hpf to determine whether <i>NOTCH</i> could cell autonomously expand budded HSPCs. Shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, we can readily observe significantly higher number of double positive HSPCs in which <i>NOTCH</i> is constitutively expressed compared to the control eGFP transgene injected siblings. These results are tabulated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and strongly indicated that <i>NOTCH</i> can exert cell autonomous effects on HSPCs. From these results in zebrafish, even though we cannot conclude whether <i>zangptls</i> themselves act cell autonomously on both endothelial cells and HSPCs, their downstream effector <i>notch</i> act cell autonomously."

Moreover, <i>Myc</i> is also critical in the regulation of hematopoietic/vascular development (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wilson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Laurenti et al., 2008</a>). Conditional <i>cMyc</i> knockout in hematopoietic lineages resulted in severe cytopenia at E11.5 and lethality at E12.5 in mice (<a href=\"#bib24\">He et al., 2008</a>), and <i>Myc</i>-deficient HSPCs are functionally defective, unable to engraft in recipient mice (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wilson et al., 2004</a>). To first establish the role of <i>myc</i> during zebrafish definitive hematopoiesis, we performed morpholino knockdown of <i>myc</i> and observed a significant reduction in <i>cmyb-</i>positive HSPCs in the AGM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting its requirement. Next, to determine whether <i>myc</i> is downstream of <i>notch</i> during this process, we overexpressed <i>myc</i> in <i>mib</i> embryos and found partially restored <i>cmyb-</i>positive HSPCs in the AGM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

We next carried out experiments in cultured cells to help dissect the mechanisms through which <i>zangptls</i> may act. First, to examine the molecular signaling downstream of ANGPTL, we performed gene expression studies on ANGPTL2-stimulated human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells using the Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. More than 3700 genes were differentially regulated with significant <i>q</i> value &lt;0.05 (False Discovery Rate (FDR), Benjamini-Hochberg). In order to assess the biological significance of this signature, it was compared to 5562 gene sets in the Broad Molecular Signature Database using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). 284 gene sets showed a highly significant positive enrichment score (ES) with FDR&lt;0.05, indicating that these sets contained genes that positively correlated with our expression phenotype, that is, upregulated in ANGPTL2-treated cells (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The top 20 gene sets were then chosen to perform a Leading Edge Analysis, in which the most significant subset of contributing genes from each gene set was cross-compared. We identified several clusters of genes/gene sets that contained direct <i>MYC</i> targets, contained a <i>MYC</i> signature, contained <i>MYC/MAX</i> binding motif, or were upregulated when <i>MYC</i> was upregulated. Despite a wide range of disease state responses or experimental parameters represented in these 284 gene sets, the strongest correlation was found with those relating to <i>MYC</i> signaling, an example of which is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>. In concordance with the GSEA analysis, the ANGPTL2 signature was analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and <i>MYC</i> was again predicted to be one of the top upstream regulators in an active state (p-value of 2.89E-16). The compelling results from these bioinformatics analyses provided independent evidence to corroborate with our genetic data above, placing <i>myc</i> downstream of <i>zangptls</i> signaling during zebrafish hematopoiesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

Similar to the previously published ChIP-seq data (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2011</a>), we found enrichment for <i>ETS, RUNX1</i>, and <i>ZNF143</i> motifs, the latter containing an embedded consensus sequence for <i>CSL/RBPj\u03ba</i> (indicated by the red box in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), in the sites bound by NOTCH. GREAT (Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) analysis revealed in some instances, that significantly more regions in our NOTCH ChIP-seq data set fall within the regulatory domains of <i>MYC</i> target genes or genes that are involved in the regulation of <i>MYC</i> targets (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Further pathway analyses using IPA revealed <i>\u200bMYC</i>-related genes forming the second highest ranking network as well as placing <i>\u200bMYC</i> as a significant upstream regulator in an active state (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), again implying that those gene regions that were bound by NOTCH are indicative of <i>\u200bMYC</i> being positively regulated. GSEA analysis comparing the ANGPTL2 microarray signature to the NOTCH ChIP-bound <i>\u200bMYC</i> targets showed a strong and significant enrichment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), suggesting that the gene expression of <i>\u200bMYC</i> targets identified from the ANGPTL2 microarray overlapped significantly with those bound by NOTCH. Together with our genetic data and the fact that these informatics analyses revealed converging signaling on <i>\u200bMYC</i> activation by ANGPTL2 and NOTCH points to the likelihood that ANGPTL2 signaling may affect NOTCH activation."

Because the rate-limiting S2 cleavage step gives rise to the transient product, NEXT, which is then very rapidly cleaved by \u03b3-secretase at S3 to generate the terminal fragment, NICD, we sought to determine whether ANGPTL2 can regulate S2 cleavage. To better detect NEXT accumulation, we treated ANGPTL2-stimulated human endothelial cells with the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, DAPT to block S3 cleavage to allow NEXT buildup. Endothelial cells have a more robust NOTCH response and because we hypothesized that <i>angptls</i> can regulate hemogenic endothelial cells in zebrafish, we felt that using human endothelial cells maybe more suitable to use in our studies. As observed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, ANGPTL2 stimulated an increase in NICD in endothelial cells (as in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) in vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells and this increase was blocked by DAPT. Blocking upstream of S3 at S2 using two different inhibitors of S2 cleavage (TAPI-2, a broad spectrum ADAM and TACE inhibitor; and SB-3CT, a non-competitive inhibitor for TACE) results in inhibiting NEXT and NICD formation. In control DMSO-treated cells, ANGPTL2 also stimulated the generation of NEXT fragment and this was further enhanced by treatment with DAPT, thus establishing that ANGPTL2 may regulate NOTCH activation via S2 cleavage."

Thus, to eliminate the possibility that the ANGPTL2-mediated increase in NICD products is due to obstructed NICD degradation, we post-treated ANGPTL2-stimulated cells with DAPT to prevent further cleavage of NOTCH receptor. If the increase in NICD product following ANGPTL2 treatment is a result of NICD degradation blockade and not a result of NOTCH receptor cleavage as we postulated above, it follows that post-ANGPTL2 treatment with DAPT should inhibit any de novo NOTCH receptor cleavage resulting in sustained levels of NICD. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, we first measured NICD protein levels and found that ANGPTL2 stimulated an increase in NICD as previously observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>). At 1 hr post-ANGPTL2 treatment, cells were treated with either DMSO (blue bar) or DAPT (red bar). Though NICD level continued to remain high in the DMSO group, it started to decrease starting at 2 hr in the DAPT group suggesting that blocking de novo S3 cleavage was sufficient to bring ANGPTL2-stimulated NOTCH activation down to a basal state (at 4 hr of DAPT). We can conclude from this study that the rise in NICD levels induced by ANGPTL2 is a result of NOTCH receptor cleavage as opposed to interference with NICD degradation."

Typical of the Ig superfamily, of which includes more than 850 members, LILRB2 contains 4 Ig domains in its extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TM), and 3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its intracellular domain (ICD). Since proper compartmentalization of membrane receptors with signaling molecules is critical for coordinating and eliciting downstream cascades, we hypothesized that for ANGPTL2 to facilitate NOTCH cleavage, this interaction needs to occur proximal to NOTCH. To test this, we first transfected HEK293T cells with full-length <i>LILRB2</i> and/or <i>NOTCH1</i> and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) for NOTCH or LILRB2.

In our present study, we defined the essential role of <i>zangptl1</i> and <i>2</i> during developmental hematopoiesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), likely through regulation of <i>notch</i> signaling in the hemogenic endothelium. To our knowledge, this is the first time <i>zangptls</i> has been shown to activate <i>notch</i>. The current model for <i>notch</i> specification of HSPCs during development has mostly been suggested to be a cell-autonomous one (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hadland et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Burns et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Robert-Moreno et al., 2005</a>). Our live imaging data from transient <i>Tg(drl:eGFP;kdrl:NICD)-</i>injected embryos resulting in significantly more budding HSPCs in the AGM of DA corroborate with this. More recently, studies have revealed an additional and separate role for somite-derived <i>notch</i> signaling during HSPC specification that occurs much earlier than previously thought (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clements et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kobayashi et al., 2014</a>). Based on our genetic data in zebrafish in which we observed a tight genetic interaction between <i>zangptls</i> and <i>notch</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we believe that <i>zangptls</i> exert their effects on definitive hematopoiesis during the vascular specifications of the axial vessels including the DA, when it coincides with the highest endogenous expression of <i>zangptl2</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Though it remains to be determined, information on the spatial/temporal expression pattern of the yet unidentified <i>zangptl</i> receptor would solidify this premise. There are receptors in zebrafish with similar domains as the mammalian receptor, but there is no obvious orthologue. Nevertheless, our current proposed model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) extrapolated from our genetic data places <i>zangptl2</i> downstream of <i>mib</i> as <i>Tg(hsp70:zangptl2)</i> crossed into <i>mib</i> can rescue its hematopoietic defect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). <i>Zangptl2</i> acts upstream of <i>notch</i> activation, that is, generation of <i>NICD</i>, as forced expression of <i>NICD</i> from <i>Tg(hsp70:Gal4;UAS:NICD)</i> can rescue <i>angptls-</i>MO morphant phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Interestingly, loss of <i>notch</i> signaling in <i>angptls-</i>MO-injected <i>notch</i> reporter embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) indicates that <i>zangptls</i> are required for <i>notch</i> signaling but also raises questions as to whether <i>notch</i> ligands needed to be present for <i>zangptls</i> to regulate <i>notch</i> activation. One of the <i>notch</i> ligands, <i>deltaC,</i> has considerable overlapping expression both spatially and temporally with <i>notch</i> in the developing DA, suggesting that it may play a role during the formation of the hemogenic endothelium and the subsequent generation of HSPCs. <i>DeltaC</i> expression<i>,</i> normally absent in the DA of <i>mib</i> was similarly rescued in <i>Tg(hsp70:zangptl2);mib</i> (data not shown). This restoration of <i>notch</i> ligand in the <i>mib</i> by <i>zangptl2</i> overexpression was intriguing, and it remains to be established whether this restored <i>notch</i> ligand is functional in the absence of <i>mib</i>."

(<b>B</b>) Using cultured cells to further explore the mechanism by which ANGPTL2 can regulate NOTCH signaling, we found that ANGPTL2 can stimulate NOTCH receptor cleavage at S2 and S3, leading to transcription of target genes. This was dependent on the ANGPTL receptor, LILRB2, as ANGPTL2 can induce recruitment of LILRB2 to NOTCH."

However, <i>myc</i> has not been studied in zebrafish hematopoiesis. We found that not only is <i>myc</i> required during HSPC formation in the AGM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), overexpression of exogenous <i>myc</i> in embryos lacking <i>zangptls</i> (<i>angptls-</i>MO) or <i>notch</i> (<i>mib</i>) signaling could similarly rescue AGM defects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,B</a>). This puts <i>myc</i> downstream of <i>zangptls</i> and <i>notch</i> signaling. Through independent gene expression analysis, we found <i>MYC</i> to be highly activated upon ANGPTL2 stimulation in human CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Furthermore, we ran GSEA comparing our ANGPTL2-induced gene expression signature to the set of <i>MYC</i> target genes whose regulatory elements were bound by NOTCH from our ChIP-seq data and found significant overlap (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This implies that the set of <i>MYC</i> targets downstream of ANGPTL2 and NOTCH signaling is highly similar, supporting our hypothesis that ANGPTL may signal partially through NOTCH."

                        "text": "To test this hypothesis, we utilized cultured mammalian cells to directly investigate the mechanism by which ANGPTL2 may act on NOTCH. We first discovered that purified ANGPTL2 ligand added to cells can rapidly induce NOTCH activation, measurable using three different assays: a luciferase reporter assay (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), qPCR of known NOTCH target genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and Western blotting for the NOTCH cleavage product NICD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Of particular note, when we used different drugs that block certain cleavage events, we found that ANGPTL2-stimulated S2 cleavage of NOTCH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Interestingly, this step occurs at the cell surface when NOTCH engages with its ligands. Although the precise mechanism in which ANGPTL2 mediates NOTCH cleavage is subject to further investigation, our assumption that this level of regulation must occur in close proximity led to our surprising discovery that human ANGPTL2 receptor, LILRB2, can interact with NOTCH (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1,2</a>). These preliminary results from co-IPs certainly suggest that ANGPTL signaling occurs in very close proximity to NOTCH. Such co-IP experiments do not definitively signify that there is direct physical interaction and do not address the stoichiometry of this potential interaction. Nevertheless, ANGPTL2-mediated NOTCH cleavage appears to be dependent on LILRB2 signaling, as sh-LILRB2 knockdown resulted in diminished NICD generation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This demonstrates a functional interaction. A more thorough mapping of the interactions between these two surface receptors will shed light on the mechanism by which ANGPTL2 can regulate NOTCH activation. An attractive speculation as to why this interaction may occur would be to potentially facilitate or even poise the NOTCH receptor for more efficient cleavage, as depicted in the model proposed in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>. This also raises an intriguing possibility of whether LILRB2 can physically alter NOTCH interaction with its ligand or whether ANGPTL2 signaling can influence NOTCH ligand availability. Indeed several studies have suggested that Notch receptors oligomerize at the cell surface at sites of DSL ligand contact from neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luty et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nichols et al., 2007</a>). The recruitment of LILRB2 to NOTCH may facilitate this clustering process although the stoichiometry of LILRB2 to NOTCH remains to be established."

Furthermore, these expansions were effectively abrogated when cells were treated with a combination of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 blocking antibodies, suggesting that they were at least partially NOTCH mediated. This supports that the ANGPTLs and NOTCH can interact in another cell type such as human cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. In conclusion, our studies of ANGPTL-mediated activation of NOTCH presented here have uncovered an important genetic, physical, and functional interaction of these two signaling pathways that are critical for hematopoiesis."

Briefly, sequences were aligned using ELAND software to NCBI Build 36 (UCSC hg18) of the human genome. Only sequences that mapped uniquely to the genome with zero or one mismatch were used for our analysis. Analysis methods were based on previously published methods (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Guenther et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marson et al., 2008</a>). Each read was extended 200 bp toward the interior of the sequence fragment, based on the strand of the alignment. Across the genome the number of ChIP-seq reads was tabulated in 10 bp bins, and the genomic bins that contained statistically significant ChIP-seq enrichment were identified by comparison to a Poissonian background model. Assuming background reads are spread randomly throughout the genome, the probability of observing a given number of reads in a 1-kb window can be modeled as a Poisson process in which the expectation can be estimated as the number of mapped reads multiplied by the number of bins into which each read maps, divided by the total number of bins available. Enriched bins within 200 bp of one another were combined into regions. The Poissonian background model assumes a random distribution of background reads. However, significant deviations from this expectation have been observed. Some of these non random events can be detected as sites of apparent enrichment in negative control DNA samples creating false positives. To remove these false-positive regions, negative control DNA from whole-cell extract (Input DNA sample) was sequenced. Enriched bins and enriched regions were defined as having greater than fivefold density in the experimental sample compared with the control sample when normalized to the total number of reads in each data set. This served to filter out genomic regions that are biased to having a greater than expected background density of ChIP-seq reads. Enriched regions within 5 kb upstream or downstream of the body of the gene were called bound. Additionally, data files that contain genome browser tracks showing genome-wide ChIP-seq density and enriched regions for all experiments are available on NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database under GEO accession number GES63010."

Enriched regions from the NOTCH ChIP-seq were imported into Genomic Regions Enrichment Annotations Tool (GREAT) (<a href=\"#bib44\">McLean et al., 2010</a>) and genomic regions that are associated with putative genes were used to generate terms that include gene ontology, phenotype data and human disease, pathway data, gene expression, regulatory motifs, and gene families.

But the reviewers have one major objection with the manuscript that needs to be attended to. The reviewers find that the vast array of experiments reported in this manuscript fail to decisively prove the mechanistic details of the model presented. As reviewers are not able to pin-point a single experiment that will resolve this issue, and it is only the authors who know how best to present their data, it is unclear how the reviewers should advise the authors on this manuscript. Suggestions ranged from presenting only the zebrafish data to concentrating on one aspect of the mechanism. It is the policy of <i>eLife</i> to either clearly state specific, doable, experiments or not accept the manuscript. Yet, we find that the high quality of the experimental results and the importance of the conclusions, if properly justified, make a compelling case for <i>eLife</i> as the appropriate journal for this manuscript. It is the Reviewing editor\u2019s impression that at the core of this indecision is the fact that experiments performed in zebrafish and human cell lines are all intermingled together with conclusions from one applied to results from the other, leaving the reader with the impression that the model is not well substantiated. In some cases, additional justification from unrelated experiments could be trimmed. One possibility is to first state all the results from the zebrafish experiments, filling up any holes with new experiments, if possible and then pointing out, with a schematic diagram, the parts of the pathway that have been uncovered. Then state which steps were either confirmed or gaps in the mechanistic details filled in by experiments in the cell line system. Then create a final compound diagram that distinguishes the contributions from the two systems. Of course, the authors may have a better way to create a more focused manuscript, but it is clear that the reviewers have asked for a more critical analysis of what the data do and do not support; not just a rearrangement of the same paragraphs. Presented below are details of some of the other major concerns, but the authors should attempt to resolve them only if they are willing to also make the mechanistic aspects firmer."

Our data simply suggests an additional layer of regulation on Notch afforded by Angptls. We have revised our manuscript to reiterate this point. The zebrafish <i>angptl</i> receptor has not been identified. The human LILRB2 belongs to the Ig superfamily, which encompasses more than 850 members. Within this family, LILRB2 is found to be encoded in a large leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) region of chromosome 19, comprising of <i>KIRs</i>, <i>LILRs</i>, <i>CEACAMs</i>, <i>PSGs</i>, <i>Siglec</i> genes and other extended LRC genes, all of which shared highly similar structure, containing anywhere from 1 to 4 Ig domains in the extracellular region and 1-3 ITAM/ITIM domains intracellularly. Because they are all clustered on 19q13.4, we did extensive bioinformatics searches to find the zebrafish orthologue for LILRB2 but could not discern between the highly similar family members. When we scanned this gene region for synteny, we also could not find the LILRB2 orthologue as a large portion of the region where it could potentially reside within the zebrafish genome seemed to be translocated or deleted. We understand that it would help better interpret our data if we identified the LILRB2 orthologue but we feel that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We have highlighted our text in the manuscript about the current lack of a zebrafish receptor."

We have examined the expression of Notch ligands on the cell membrane in our cultured human endothelial cells and found high levels of Jag1 and lower levels of Jag2, DLL1 and DLL4, which did not seem to change when stimulated by Angptl2. To examine the effect of Angptl2 on signaling by canonical Notch ligands would require disruption between Notch and each of these ligands (by knockdown or specific blocking antibodies).

Because the gene expression of <i>deltaC</i> during development can be regulated by a genetic loop of <i>notch</i> pathway self-activation (Holley et al, 2002 [Her1 and the Notch Pathway Function within the Oscillator Mechanism that Regulates Zebrafish Somitogenesis, Development 129:1175-83]), we viewed this rescue of <i>deltaC</i> expression as a marker for restored <i>notch</i> circuitry in <i>mib</i> by <i>zangtl2</i> overexpression.
