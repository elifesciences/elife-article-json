Here, we report the first connection between the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26 and human pathology, by demonstrating that Cx26 hemichannels with the mutation A88V, linked to Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome, are both CO<sub>2</sub> insensitive and associated with disordered breathing in humans."
