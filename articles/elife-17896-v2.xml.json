However, little is understood about the cellular mechanism through which paternal mitochondria, delivered from sperm, are eliminated from early mammalian embryos. Autophagy has been implicated in nematodes, but whether this mechanism is conserved in mammals has been disputed. Here, we show that cultured mouse fibroblasts and pre-implantation embryos use a common pathway for elimination of mitochondria. Both situations utilize mitophagy, in which mitochondria are sequestered by autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. The E3 ubiquitin ligases PARKIN and MUL1 play redundant roles in elimination of paternal mitochondria. The process is associated with depolarization of paternal mitochondria and additionally requires the mitochondrial outer membrane protein FIS1, the autophagy adaptor P62, and PINK1 kinase. Our results indicate that strict maternal transmission of mitochondria relies on mitophagy and uncover a collaboration between MUL1 and PARKIN in this process."

Because sperm deliver mitochondria into the egg during fertilization, mechanisms likely exist to eliminate paternal mitochondria from the early embryo. Uniparental inheritance of mitochondria ensures that only one haplotype of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exists in the offspring, a phenomenon with considerable biomedical implications. It underlies the maternal inheritance of diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carelli and Chan, 2014</a>) and enables the use of mtDNA sequences to track human migrations during evolution. Mouse studies suggest that extensive heteroplasmy, the co-existence of more than one haplotype of mtDNA, is genetically unstable and associated with physiological abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sharpley et al., 2012</a>)."

Most of our knowledge has come from invertebrate model organisms. The phenomenon has been most decisively dissected in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, where paternal mitochondria are eliminated by mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al Rawi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sato and Sato, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>), a process in which mitochondria are engulfed by autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for destruction. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, paternal mitochondrial elimination involves autophagic components but occurs independently of PARKIN (<a href=\"#bib34\">Politi et al., 2014</a>), a Parkinson\u2019s disease-related E3 ubiquitin ligase that is central to the most heavily studied mitophagy pathway (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</a>). However, it is unclear to what extent these insights from invertebrate model organisms extend to mammals. Consistent with a role for autophagy, sperm mitochondria from mice are ubiquitinated (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sutovsky et al., 1999</a>) and, after fertilization, are immuno-positive for P62 and the ATG8 homologs LC3 and GABARAP (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al Rawi et al., 2011</a>). However, a subsequent study in mouse disputed the role of autophagy in elimination of paternal mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib19\">Luo et al., 2013</a>). The association of LC3 with paternal mitochondria was observed to be transient and occurred well before paternal mitochondrial elimination. In addition, it was found that paternal mitochondria were segregated unevenly to blastomeres during early embryonic cell division. Based on these results, the authors rejected the role of autophagy and advocated a passive dilution mechanism whereby murine paternal mitochondria are stochastically lost due to uneven segregation to the cells of the embryo (<a href=\"#bib19\">Luo et al., 2013</a>)."

In <i>C. elegans</i>, the functional role of autophagy was revealed by the persistence of paternal mitochondria in embryos depleted for core autophagy genes, such as the ATG8 homologs LGG-1 and LGG-2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al Rawi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sato and Sato, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). A similar approach is not feasible in mouse, however, because disruption of basal autophagy results in embryonic arrest at the four-cell stage (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tsukamoto et al., 2008</a>), well before paternal mitochondria are normally eliminated."

To obtain a set of candidate mitophagy genes, we first characterized the requirements for mitophagy in cultured cells. These experiments led to the realization that two E3 ubiquitin ligases, PARKIN and MUL1, synergistically function in degradation of mitochondria. We then used a gene disruption approach in early embryos to show that mitophagy mediates the degradation of paternal mitochondria."

When male <i>PhAM</i> mice were mated with wild-type females, the resulting embryos contained brightly fluorescent paternal mitochondria. At 12 hr post-fertilization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the paternal mitochondria were found in a linear cluster, reflecting their original, compact organization in the sperm midpiece. At 36 hr after fertilization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), this cluster began to disperse in cultured embryos, and thereafter, well-separated individual mitochondria were visible within blastomeres. Over the next 2 days, paternal mitochondrial content progressively decreased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). At 84 hr after fertilization, the majority of embryos had lost all paternal mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Quantification of these results showed a reproducible and progressive loss of paternal mitochondria between 60 and 84 hr post-fertilization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). To determine whether this pattern is specific to paternal mitochondria, we additionally mated <i>PhAM</i> female mice with wild-type males, resulting in embryos with fluorescent maternal mitochondria. In these embryos, there was no reduction in the maternal mitochondrial content between 60 and 84 hr post-fertilization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We microinjected one-cell stage zygotes with lentivirus encoding mCherry and control shRNA or shRNA targeting the core autophagy gene <i>Atg3</i>. In embryos injected with lentivirus, the mCherry reporter was expressed within 48 hr of injection (60 hr post-fertilization). When nontargeting shRNA was expressed, development of the embryo was unaffected, and Dendra2-positive mitochondria were eliminated by 84 hr with the usual kinetics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). In embryos injected with shRNA against <i>Atg3</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>), however, embryo development was arrested at the four-cell stage, consistent with a previous report using <i>Atg5</i>-null oocytes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tsukamoto et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, treatment of embryos with bafilomycin, an autophagy inhibitor, arrested embryonic development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>). In both cases, the treated embryos showed persistence of paternal mitochondria at 84 hr. However, due to the early disruption of embryonic development, it was not possible to conclude if autophagy has a specific role in elimination of paternal mitochondria. This result indicated that disruption of core autophagy genes in this system is not a viable experimental approach. We therefore decided to focus on mitophagy-specific genes. We injected embryos with lentivirus encoding shRNA against <i>Parkin</i> (<i>Park2</i>), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is central to the most studied pathway for mitopahgy (<a href=\"#bib10\">Durcan and Fon, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</a>). Such embryos show loss of paternal mitochondria by 84 hr after fertilization, suggesting that the process occurs in the absence of PARKIN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a>)."

                                "text": "Given the negative results with PARKIN, we turned to cultured cells, where the role of specific proteins in mitophagy could be more readily analyzed. Our strategy was to identify, in cultured cells, a small set of mitophagy genes, which could then be re-analyzed in early embryos. To monitor mitophagy, we constructed a dual color fluorescence-quenching assay based on an EGFP-mCherry reporter localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Normal mitochondria are yellow, having both green and red fluorescence in the matrix, whereas mitochondria within acidic compartments show red-only fluorescence, due to the selective sensitivity of EGFP fluorescence to low pH. A similar approach using a mitochondrial outer membrane EGFP-mCherry reporter has been effective for monitoring mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2013</a>). When mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured with a moderate concentration (10 mM) of glucose, a condition in which their metabolism relies largely on glycolysis, they showed few red-only mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We previously defined a glucose-free, acetoacetate-containing culture formulation that induces MEFs to substantially upregulate OXPHOS activity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mishra et al., 2014</a>). When cells were cultured for 4 days in this OXPHOS-inducing medium, many cells exhibited numerous red puncta (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This observation is consistent with a study showing that glucose-free conditions promote increased turnover of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib21\">Melser et al., 2013</a>) and likely reflects the higher turnover of mitochondria when the activity of the respiratory chain is elevated. <i>Atg3</i> knockout MEFs did not form red puncta under the OXPHOS-inducing condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>), indicating that formation of red puncta is dependent on the core autophagy machinery. Consistent with this idea, the level of lipidated LC3, another core component of the autophagy pathway, was elevated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Moreover, the red-only puncta co-localized extensively with mTurquoise2-LC3B, suggesting that they represent mitochondrial contents within the autophagosome pathway (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, arrows). In addition, a subset of the red puncta co-localize with LAMP1, likely indicating later intermediates that have progressed to lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In contrast, in glycolytic medium, mTurquoise2-LC3B did not co-localize with mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In addition, we found that p62 (SQSTM1), a protein implicated in autophagy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pankiv et al., 2007</a>) and mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib37\">Seibenhener et al., 2013</a>), localized to mitochondria only under the OXPHOS-inducing condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Unlike LC3B and LAMP1, however, P62 was localized to both red punctate mitochondria and elongated yellow mitochondria. These results indicate that the OXPHOS-inducing condition results in an increase in mitophagy intermediates."

However, <i>Parkin</i> knockout MEFs had normal mitophagy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>), a surprising observation given that PINK1 is known to operate upstream of PARKIN (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Park et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). This observation suggests that another molecule may compensate for the loss of PARKIN. Recently, the mitochondrial E3 ligase MUL1 (MULAN/MAPL), has been shown to act parallel to the PINK1/PARKIN pathway in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of mitofusin (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yun et al., 2014</a>). We hypothesized that MUL1 might work in parallel with PARKIN in OXPHOS-induced mitophagy, such that its presence would maintain mitophagy in the absence of PARKIN. Indeed, knockdown of <i>Mul1</i> by either of two independent shRNAs in the <i>Parkin</i> knockout cell abolished mitophagy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). In contrast, knockdown of <i>Mul1</i> alone did not inhibit mitophagy. Inhibition of mitophagy due to loss of PINK1 or PARKIN/MUL1 prevented co-localization of LC3 with mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These results reveal that MUL1 and PARKIN have redundant functions in mitophagy. We found a similar redundancy of MUL1 and PARKIN function in mitophagy induced by depolarization of mitochondria with CCCP (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)"

At 60 hr post-fertilization, the photo-converted signal in maternally labeled embryos had spread widely into other mitochondria, resulting in a dramatic reduction in mean pixel intensity (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>).

First, we find in two biological systems\u2014OXPHOS-induced mitophagy in cultured cells and paternal mitochondrial elimination in pre-implantation embryos\u2014that PARKIN and MUL1 work synergistically to promote degradation of mitochondria by autophagy. Previous work showed that PARKIN and MUL1 have partially redundant roles in controlling the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of mitofusin (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yun et al., 2014</a>). Our results show that this collaboration extends to the process of mitophagy. In MEFs, we find that both PARKIN and MUL1 regulate the levels of ubiquitin on mitochondria in response to OXPHOS conditions, and removal of both is necessary to cause a substantial reduction of ubiquitination. In a mitophagy assay where PARKIN is overexpressed, polyubiquitination of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins leads to their proteasomal degradation, which in turn is required for turnover of mitochondria by autophagy (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chan et al., 2011</a>)."

Similarly, the redundant role of MUL1 may also explain why, in <i>Drosophila</i>, PARKIN is dispensable for paternal mitochondrial elimination (<a href=\"#bib34\">Politi et al., 2014</a>). In future work, this insight may help to uncover the in vivo functions of PARKIN."

It is unclear whether MEFs cultured under OXPHOS conditions bear any physiological relation to the early embryo. Nevertheless, we find that the genetic requirements for removal of paternal mitochondria in the embryo mirror those of MEFs undergoing mitophagy in response to OXPHOS induction. Although previous studies had shown that paternal mitochondria in mouse embryos co-localized with autophagy markers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al Rawi et al., 2011</a>), the functional relevance of these localization studies has been challenged and a passive mechanism for loss of paternal mitochondria has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carelli, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Luo et al., 2013</a>). By identifying several molecules necessary for paternal mitochondrial elimination, our studies provide functional evidence for the role of mitophagy in this process."

However, we do not have direct evidence that membrane depolarization has a functional role in paternal mitochondrial degradation."

One recent idea is that uniparental inheritance of mitochondria ensures that offspring contain only one haplotype of mtDNA. When mice with approximately equal proportions of two wild-type haplotypes of mtDNA were generated, they were found to have behavioral and cognitive abnormalities compared to homoplasmic counterparts (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sharpley et al., 2012</a>). However, it is unclear to what extent this experimental result is relevant for a case in which paternal mitochondria were not eliminated. Sperm contain many fewer mitochondria (at least a thousand fold) compared to the oocyte, and therefore, the ensuing heteroplasmy levels would be very low. The identification of molecules essential for paternal mitochondrial elimination may facilitate further examination of this issue."

If the zygote has a more glycolytic metabolism, and the machinery identified here required an enhanced OXPHOS metabolism, how accurate can the identified machinery be? Clearly, some core elements such as Parkin and Mulan have been identified and are sufficient to modulate mitophagy in zygotes but these questions regarding the appropriateness and relevance of the culture medium must be addressed."

From your data you do not demonstrate that the loss of membrane potential is instrumental here. It is possible that the loss of membrane potential is an epiphenomenon, unrelated to the autophagy of paternal mitochondria, since the machinery of mitophagy you report herein has not been identified in the context of loss of membrane potential. It would thus be helpful to at least validate your identified mitophagy machinery under an induced membrane potential defect. Formal assessment in the zygotes of the membrane potential in maternal mitochondria should also be provided."

If, in some instances, this was not the case, then you must clarify how cells and/or mitochondria were selected and whether corrections were made for different number of cells per embryos of different ages. In addition, it was not clear what the level of detection is of Dendra-containing mitochondria in the microscope. Is the precision of your method and probe sufficient to confirm that one counted object equals one organelle? Also not clear from the manuscript was how you deal with detection of two mitochondria that are the fragmented/fissioned daughters of a parental organelle.

However, a valuable approach to at least provide support to the specificity of the mechanism for the paternal mitochondria would be to compare intra- vs. inter-species mitophagy. Indeed, the phenomenon of paternal mitochondrial incompatibility applies only to intra-specific matings in that in inter-specific matings the paternal mitochondria survive, at least in mice (Kaneda et al., PNAS 92:4542, 2015). Consequently, an inter-specific mating should essentially abrogate all the relevant phenomena found here in the intra-specific mating (e.g. the decay of Dendra signal), thereby strongly supporting your conclusions."

In mammals, the debate remains as to whether paternal mitochondria are eliminated by stochastic dilution (related to the random partition of mitochondria during cell division) or mitophagy, and while these two processes are not mutually exclusive, it has been quite difficult to demonstrate a role for mitophagy in the destruction of paternal mitochondria. To clarify this fundamental issue, the authors used a mutant mouse in which all mitochondria are labelled with a fluorescent protein. By using a mutant male mouse crossed with a female wild-type mouse, the authors were able to readily identify and monitor paternal mitochondria in mouse zygotes. The authors confirmed that the number of paternal mitochondria declined over time and that by ~84 hrs post-fertilization, zygotes were devoid of any paternal mitochondria. As anticipated, using cells deficient in core autophagy factors such as ATG3 did stop embryo development and thus was not an unusable strategy to determine whether mitophagy was involved. Thus, the authors thought to use MEF cells to acquire further molecular insights into mitophagy to ultimately be able to target mitophagy rather than global autophagy, which they believed would be better tolerated by the embryo. Accordingly, they took a variety of MEF lines which were either constitutively deficient or were subjected to silencing strategy to knockout or knockdown key factors of mitochondrial fission/fusion as well as mitophagy such as Parkin and PINK1. To induce mitophagy, the authors exposed the different MEF lines to a glucose-free acetoacetate containing culture medium, and under these experimental conditions they found that: fusion/fission factors may modulate mitophagy but were not key factors except for <i>Fis1</i> which was found to be a regulator. They also found Parkin in a redundant manner with another E3 ligase, MUL1, which was also instrumental in mitophagy induced by this particular culture medium. Other known factors such as PINK1, P62, and <i>Tbc1d15</i> were all also implicated. With this information in hand, the authors went back to the zygotes and by emulating each of the molecular situations that were attenuating mitophagy in MEF, they consistently found that the elimination of paternal mitochondria was reduced. The authors concluded that their study provides compelling evidence that in mammalian cells, the elimination of paternal mitochondria in zygote and maternal mitochondria in MEFs used the same machinery of mitophagy and involved the cooperation between Parkin and MUL1."

One is thus left with the question of, if both processes are involved, what is the relative contribution of each to the elimination of paternal mitochondria? Unless overlooked, could the authors assess the decline by blocking cell division so that only mitophagy could be monitored?"

PINK1, <i>Fis1, Tbc1d15</i>, and p62 are also shown to be necessary, since silencing of any of these components of the mitophagy pathway causes impairment of sperm mitochondria degradation. The findings were somehow similar to those in MEF cells subjected to OXPHOS stress in acetoacetate medium. The main significance of the findings is in the reaffirmation of the role of mitophagy in maternal inheritance of mtDNA, which had been proposed and then negated in previous literature. The structure of the study is somehow unusual, because sperm and oocyte experiments are alternated with MEF experiments, which almost constitute two different stories. While the general mechanism of mitophagy may be conserved in oocytes and MEFs in OXPHOS medium, the specificity of the process for sperm mitochondria elimination is unexplained by this mechanism. On the other hand, some key information missing in this study could help clarifying the process. Overall, this is an interesting study, but mechanistic details are still lacking."

This question may be addressed by using the same mutant mouse line but this time using female mutants crossed with wild-type males and while the number of maternal mitochondria may be large, you may be able to limit your quantitation by photoconverting Dedra in discrete areas of the zygote or by quantifying a fixed number of fields.</i> "
