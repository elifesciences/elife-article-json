Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Roman Giger and colleagues at the University of Michigan School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine report additional evidence for a link between ASDs and dysfunctional synapses (<a href=\"#bib3\">Duan et al., 2014</a>)."

The <i>SEMA5A</i> gene encodes a transmembrane protein called Semaphorin 5A that is important for guiding the branches of neurons during development (<a href=\"#bib6\">Kantor et al., 2004</a>). Consistent with a prominent role of synapses in ASDs, Giger and colleagues\u2014who include Yuntoa Duan and Shih-Hsiu Wang as joint first authors\u2014report that deleting the <i>Sema5A</i> gene from mice results in an increase in the density of synapses and in increased transmission of excitatory signals across synapses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The increase in synaptic density appears in granule cells in a region of the brain called the dentate gyrus, which is found in the hippocampus."

This occurs in granule cells that developed in the embryo and have matured, and also in granule cells that formed during adulthood. In the absence of Semaphorin 5A, the density of synapses increases (right). Wild-type mice (bottom left) prefer to interact with an unfamiliar mouse (light brown) over a familiar mouse (dark brown). In contrast, <i>Sema5A</i> knockout mice (bottom right) show greater preference for a familiar mouse, which mimics the social anxiety seen in autism spectrum disorders."

Alterations in ASD genes related to synaptic function typically result in deficits in social interactions in mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ey et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this previous work, Duan, Wang et al. report that mice in which the <i>Sema5A</i> gene has been \u2018knocked-out\u2019 perform poorly in a social preference task, but show normal levels of performance in several other learning tasks or behaviours. Such specific deficits suggest that different behaviours observed in ASDs may be underpinned by distinct biological processes. However, it is not clear how an increase in the synaptic density in granule cells of the dentate gyrus leads to deficits in social interactions."

From this perspective, treatment during adulthood would be of limited value. However, several studies over the last decade using mouse models of autism and related disorders have challenged this perspective. For several of these mouse models, treatment with drugs enable adult mice to overcome both their cognitive and social interaction deficits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ehninger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Castren et al., 2012</a>). Duan, Wang et al. find that treating neurons grown in the laboratory with a fragment of the Sema5A protein fused to another molecule for only two hours decreases the density of synapses. This suggests that the structural abnormalities in neurons that are thought to underlie ASDs are highly plastic and amenable to manipulation on short time scales. However, it remains to be seen whether such rapid effects are also observed in living mice and whether they are capable of mitigating the behavioural deficits."

Towards this end, Duan, Wang et al. identified a protein called plexin-A2 (or PlxnA2) as the receptor that mediates the effects of Semaphorin 5A on synaptic density. They find that Semaphorin 5A binds to plexin-A2 to restrict the growth and density of synapses in individual neurons. Like <i>Sema5A</i> knockout mice<i>, PlxnA2</i> knockout mice have more synapses on the granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, synapse density was not affected by over-production of Semaphorin 5A in neurons with the <i>PlxnA2</i> gene deleted when grown in vitro. This suggests that the plexin-A2 protein may be a useful target to explore with respect to developing novel therapeutics for ASDs and other disorders in which there is an increase in synaptic density."

Of the most perplexing is how changes in synapse number or function lead to specific deficits, such as difficulties with social interaction, and do not have more general behavioural effects. Of potentially greater consequence is whether or not treatment, pharmacological or otherwise, will be beneficial in older children and adults. Our search for the physiological basis of ASDs promises not only to eventually yield treatments for these disorders, but also to deepen our understanding of normal workings of synapses."
