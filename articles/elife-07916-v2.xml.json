While prior studies have reported dysregulation of effector and memory cells, little is known about the effects on na\u00efve T cell populations. We performed a cross-sectional study of chronic hepatitis C (cHCV) patients using tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment to study antigen-specific inexperienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., tumor or unrelated virus-specific populations in tumor-free and sero-negative individuals). cHCV showed normal precursor frequencies, but increased proportions of memory-phenotype inexperienced cells, as compared to healthy donors or cured HCV patients. These observations could be explained by low surface expression of CD5, a negative regulator of TCR signaling. Accordingly, we demonstrated TCR hyperactivation and generation of potent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses from the altered T cell repertoire of cHCV patients. In sum, we provide the first evidence that na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are dysregulated during cHCV infection, and establish a new mechanism of immune perturbation secondary to chronic infection."

While prior studies have reported dysregulation of effector and memory cells, little is known about the effects on na\u00efve T cell populations. We performed a cross-sectional study of chronic hepatitis C (cHCV) patients using tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment to study antigen-specific inexperienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., tumor or unrelated virus-specific populations in tumor-free and sero-negative individuals). cHCV showed normal precursor frequencies, but increased proportions of memory-phenotype inexperienced cells, as compared to healthy donors or cured HCV patients. These observations could be explained by low surface expression of CD5, a negative regulator of TCR signaling. Accordingly, we demonstrated TCR hyperactivation and generation of potent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses from the altered T cell repertoire of cHCV patients. In sum, we provide the first evidence that na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are dysregulated during cHCV infection, and establish a new mechanism of immune perturbation secondary to chronic infection."

In particular, it has been shown that chronic infection skews memory/effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stelekati and Wherry, 2012</a>), and drives virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells towards an \u00ab exhausted \u00bb phenotypic state, as marked by high expression of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) molecule (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim and Ahmed, 2010</a>). Chronic infections have also been reported to impair immune responses to unrelated infectious microbes in mouse models (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stelekati and Wherry, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Richer et al., 2013</a>), as well as in humans infected with HCV (<a href=\"#bib37\">Park and Rehermann, 2014</a>). This phenomenon correlates with a interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) transcriptional signature, suggesting an indirect effect of systemic type I IFN secondary to innate immune activation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stelekati et al., 2014</a>). Following from these observations, we hypothesized that chronic infection may alter the T cell preimmune repertoire, which plays an important role in shaping the adaptive immune responses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</a>). Employing a newly validated approach for the study of low-frequency (&lt; 10<sup>\u20135</sup>) antigen-specific T cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alanio et al., 2010</a>), we evaluated this prediction in patients with chronic viral infection of the liver."

                        "text": "The \u03b1/\u03b2 T cell preimmune repertoire is defined as the set of mature but antigen inexperienced lymphocytes that circulate in blood and secondary lymphoid organs, ready to be activated by cognate high-affinity peptide-class I MHC (pMHC) complexes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jenkins et al., 2010</a>). They are maintained in the periphery by survival factors such as IL-7, as well as transient contacts with low affinity non-cognate pMHC complexes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sprent and Surh, 2011</a>). Over the last decade, studies using newly-developed tetramer-enrichment assays - sensitive enough to detect and track antigen-specific populations prior to immunization - have provided new insights into the impact of preimmune repertoire heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jenkins et al., 2010</a>). First, the number of antigen-specific T cells (i.e. precursor frequency) is not equivalent across inexperienced populations, with the absolute number positively correlating with the magnitude of responses that are induced upon priming (<a href=\"#bib35\">Obar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Moon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kwok et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schmidt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kotturi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tan et al., 2011</a>). Second, antigen-inexperienced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations contain variable proportions of memory-phenotype (MP) cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Legoux et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Su et al., 2013</a>). These cells have been explained in the literature as a result of cross-reactivity or homeostatic proliferation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sprent and Surh, 2011</a>). Cross-reactivity is now recognized as an essential feature of the T-cell receptor (TCR) / MHC interaction (Mason et al., 1998), and a major determinant of virus-specific MP cells in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire of unexposed healthy donors (<a href=\"#bib49\">Su et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively, homeostatic proliferation may occur in settings of lymphopenia (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones et al., 2013</a>). Finally, differential CD5 expression by antigen-specific T cell populations has been shown to dictate clonal recruitment and expansion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fulton et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tabbekh et al., 2013</a>). To date, the impact of non-heritable influences such as human chronic viral infection on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the preimmune repertoire remains unknown."

                        "text": "In our study, we focused on patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection (cHCV), which show CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib37\">Park and Rehermann, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005</a>). In particular, HCV-specific responses are typically (i) weak \u2013 both in term of numbers and function, (ii) of low avidity, and (iii) blocked in their differentiation into central memory cells, despite the availability of cognate pMHC complexes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Park and Rehermann, 2014</a>). cHCV is to date the only chronic viral infection that can be cured, offering the unique possibility to interrogate the reversibility of immune perturbations post-viral clearance (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pol et al., 2013</a>). Herein, we applied the highly sensitive tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment (TAME) technique for investigating at the antigen-specific level the impact of chronic viral hepatitis infection on the CD8\u2009T cell preimmune repertoire (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alanio et al., 2010</a>). Although precursor frequencies were similar to healthy controls, we observed significant impairments of the preimmune repertoire in cHCV patients. Inexperienced T cell populations contained increased proportions of MP cells. This correlated with na\u00efve-phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells having lower surface expression of CD5, which accounted for a lower threshold for TCR signaling and the generation of potent immune responses from cHCV patients. Importantly, the positive effect of chronic infection on na\u00efve T cell recruitment into immune responses is transient, as cHCV patients who clear their virus following successful therapy (referred to as Sustained Virologic Responders or SVR) can experience a reversion towards a healthy na\u00efve T cell repertoire within 2 years. These data provide the first evidence for chronic infection resulting in the bystander dysregulation of the antigen-specific preimmune repertoire in humans, and highlight the added benefit of early viral clearance in patients with chronic HCV infection."

Healthy donors from the blood bank were included as controls. Total lymphocyte numbers were within the normal range for all tested patients (median 2.2\u00a0+/-\u00a00.6\u00a0G/l). Within the CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte population, we observed similar percentages of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, absolute numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> were significantly increased in our cohort of cHCV (KW p&lt;0.0001), translating into increased absolute numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in cHCV patients (KW p=0.0002) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We further subsetted the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells according to their surface expression of CD45RA and CD27. Based on prior studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alanio et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">De Rosa et al., 2001</a>) and our confirmatory experiments using 5 phenotypic markers for na\u00efve or memory T cells, we determined that co-expression of high levels of CD45RA and CD27 were sufficient to classify na\u00efve T cells in both HD and cHCV patients (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Decreased percentages of na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells have previously been reported in cHCV (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shen et al., 2010</a>). Here, we confirmed these findings in age- and CMV- matched chronically infected patients (KW p=0.0007, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Interestingly, we found that after correcting for the higher CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers in cHCV patients, the absolute numbers of na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were within the normal range as determined by the study of healthy donors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We therefore interpreted the lower proportion of na\u00efve T cells to simply be a result of an expansion of the memory cell compartment."

                                "text": "To directly test this prediction, we isolated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and measured the frequency of signal joint TCR excision circles (sjTREC), by-products of TCR rearrangement, and previously validated as a measure of thymic production (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clave et al., 2009</a>). Confirming previous studies, we found a significant decrease in sjTREC content of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (MW p=0.01, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). To address the bias due to differential na\u00efve T cell number, we isolated CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD27<sup>+</sup> na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and assessed sjTREC frequencies. Surprisingly, we also observed within the na\u00efve compartment a significantly lower sjTREC content in cHCV patients as compared to HD (MW p=0.03, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To further characterize this phenotype, we assessed the V\u03b2 distribution within the na\u00efve repertoire of cHCV patients. cHCV patients showed a biased repertoire with increased representation of selected V\u03b2 families. A representative example of V\u03b2 usage plotted as percentage accross the 24 tested families, and ordered by increasing size from one cHCV patient and one HD is shown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To compare distributions, Lorenz curves were constructed as a graphical representation of the diversity of the repertoire (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Inequality measurements in the V\u03b2 distribution, comparing cHCV patients to HD, indicated proportions of na\u00efve T cells being altered in their V\u03b2 usage. In brief, for a given percentage (x) of the 24 V\u03b2 chains, Lorenz curves indicate the proportion of the T cell population that have V\u03b2 chains among the 24 * x% least abundant ones. An equal distribution is represented as the dotted line. By contrast, an extreme, unequal distribution is shown in red, as in the case of a T-cell lymphoma where &gt;90% of the TCR repertoire is explained by one particular V\u03b2 chain (red line). We included Gini coefficient as a numeric measure of Lorenz curve\u2019s based observations. It corresponds to the ratio of the area between the line representing equal use of all V\u03b2 chains (dotted line) and the observed Lorenz curve to the total area below the line representing equal use. The higher the coefficient, the more unequal is the distribution. In line with our observation, we found Gini coefficients increased in cHCV patients (M-W p=0.03, see Material and Methods for details of calculation) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). These data support an overall perturbed na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire in cHCV patients, with increased peripheral expansion of selected populations."

Specifically, we utilized TAME to enumerate and subdivide Mart1-specific T cell populations. While similar absolute numbers of Mart1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in our respective study groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), SVR and cHCV patients showed a more differentiated phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), defined by fewer CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD27<sup>+</sup> and increased proportions of memory-phenotype (MP) cells (KW <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Of note, these MP cells were mostly of central-memory (CD45RA-CD27+) phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Also, when considering only na\u00efve-phenotype Mart1-specific cells, precursor frequencies were still comparable across the different study groups (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We were able to purify sufficient numbers of Mart1-specific na\u00efve- and memory- phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from one HCV patient to perform an immunoscope analysis on the V\u03b2 chain usage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In line with our data in bulk T cells populations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), we observed a restricted repertoire of Mart1-specific na\u00efve T cells, with evidence of an expanded V\u03b2 clonotype in memory cells. These data argue in favor of MP cells being the progeny of a perturbed na\u00efve T cell repertoire. Although they could be expanded in response to either specific or non-specific signals, we favor the latter hypothesis based on prior knowledge of Mart1 antigen pattern of expression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pittet et al., 1999</a>)."

                                "text": "To establish a mechanistic understanding of our findings, we considered the key homeostatic factors governing maintenance of the na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jenkins et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ho and Hsue, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hazenberg et al., 2000</a>). We hypothesized that an altered threshold for TCR activation could explain the differentiation phenotype of inexperienced T cells. CD5 expression has been shown to correlate with the threshold of activation in mice (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grossman and Paul, 2015</a>). It is typically high on na\u00efve T cells, showing diminished levels as a function of T cell differentiation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We observed phenotypic changes (i.e. low CD5 expression) that were significant for the comparison between CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD27<sup>+</sup> na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in cHCV vs\u00a0HD (KW p=0.02, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). Based on its role in regulating TCR signaling, we predicted that lower CD5 expression on na\u00efve T cells would result in their hyperactivation upon stimulation. This was tested functionally by evaluating TCR signaling in na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, stimulating cells with low doses of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs. While only weak induction of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) could be observed in HD during the first hour of stimulation, TCR stimulation induced a strong p-ERK signal in na\u00efve cells from seven of sixteen cHCV patients tested (histograms from one responding cHCV and one HD are shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; MW p=0.03, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Using the same stimulation protocol, we investigated expression of activation markers (<i>i.e.,</i> CD25, CD69) measured after 24\u00a0hr stimulation. Consistent with p-ERK data, we observed higher percentages of cells expressing CD25 on na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cHCV as compared to HD (representative example from one cHCV and one HD are shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>; MW p=0.02, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Similar results were obtained for CD69 analysis (data not shown). We also observed increased percentages of na\u00efve CD8\u2009T cells undergoing activation-induced cell death \u2013 as assessed by active caspase 3 staining after 24\u2009hr - in cHCV patients as compared to HD (MW p=0.002; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These findings are all consistent with strong TCR engagement despite the use of low doses of cross-linking antibodies in cHCV patients."

When PBMCs from HD were exposed to blocking anti-CD5 Abs (\u03b1CD5) prior to TCR stimulation, we observed (i) increased levels of p-ERK after 5 min (Wilcoxon p=0.007, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), (ii) increased CD25 expression after 24\u2009hr (Wilcoxon p=0.03, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), and (iii) increased percentages of dying na\u00efve CD8\u2009T cells as assessed by active caspase 3 staining after 24\u2009hr (Wilcoxon p=0.003) (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

These data provide direct evidence for a negative role of CD5 on TCR-induced activation and activation-induced cell death, and support the concept that CD5 molecule is responsible, in part, for the hyperactivation phenotype observed in naive T cells of cHCV patients. Together, these data support a model where low expression of CD5 on na\u00efve T cells in cHCV patients results in dysregulation of the homeostatic TCR threshold."

We demonstrated lower absolute numbers of Mart1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in HBV patients (MW p=0.003, <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>) and increased frequencies of MP Mart1-specific cells (MW p=0.03, <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>) as compared to HD, but (ii) similar levels of CD5 expression (MW p=<i>ns</i>, <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5D</a>), and (iii) a similar a activation profile of bulk na\u00efve T cells as compared to HD (MW p=<i>ns</i>, <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5E</a>). These results indicate that different persistent viral infections of the liver can trigger distinct preimmune repertoire perturbations. Additional studies will be required to fully evaluate the heterogeneous disease pathogenesis of HBV infections as reflected by the observed immune phenotypes."

Conversely, a decreased threshold for TCR activation, secondary to sustained cytokine production, leads to diverse autoimmune manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis patients (<a href=\"#bib45\">Singh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deshpande et al., 2013</a>). With respect to chronic infection, functional defects in the na\u00efve T cell compartment have also been documented in HIV-infected individuals, with non-cognate activation of T cells correlating with disease progression (<a href=\"#bib13\">Favre et al., 2011</a>).

Despite these altered phenotypes, the absolute number of antigen-specific cells was comparable to healthy donors. Of note, cHCV patients are not thought to experience altered thymic output. As such, our findings provide direct evidence that MP antigen-specific T cells can arise in non-lymphopenic humans."

This finding has been reported for human viral peptide / MHC restricted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in unexposed donors (<a href=\"#bib49\">Su et al., 2013</a>). While cross-reactivity is a possible explanation for our findings, we demonstrate in cured patients that the antigen-specific inexperienced T cell populations are restored to a na\u00efve phenotype. This result will need to be confirmed in a larger longitudinal cohort study. It favors an alternative model, where homeostatic proliferation accounts for the perturbed na\u00efve T cell repertoire in cHCV patients. Supporting this conclusion, we note the evidence for rapid reversibility to a healthy preimmune repertoire after transient lymphopenia (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with our findings, Jones et al. studied multiple sclerosis patients and showed an anti-CD52 (also known by alemtuzumab) treatment-induced narrowing of the V\u03b2 repertoire and the dilution of sjTREC after treatment, with a complete restoration of normal levels two years post-therapy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones et al., 2013</a>)."

This effect is mediated by inflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rau\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>). Our results extend this concept to na\u00efve T cells and introduce CD5 downregulation as a mechanism for hyperreactivity. CD5 tunes the TCR signaling threshold in peripheral T cells, with na\u00efve cells expressing higher levels than central memory or effector T cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tabbekh et al., 2013</a>). In mice, Hawiger <i>et al</i> demonstrated that anti-CD5 blocking antibodies, or the use of CD5<sup>-/-</sup> transgenic MOG-specific T cells, resulted in higher sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalitis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hawiger et al., 2004</a>). In B cells, CD5 has also been shown to regulate activation and low CD5 expression correlates with high sensitivity to activation induced cell death (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tabbekh et al., 2013</a>). In line with these findings, we demonstrate an increased sensitivity of CD5<sup>lo</sup> na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to TCR ligation in cHCV patients. We further provide direct evidence that this hypersensitivity phenotype can be partially reproduced in HD by blocking CD5. While not evaluated in our patient cohort, we propose that elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines may be responsible for the altered CD5 expression on na\u00efve cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Park and Rehermann, 2014</a>). Finally, we applied our strategy for evaluating preimmune repertoire perturbations to other clinical conditions, and demonstrate in cHBV patients that a distinct persistent infection of the liver triggers a different preimmune signature. This observation may be related to the differing innate inflammation induced as a result of infection (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duffy et al., 2014</a>)."

Given the important role for cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of autoimmune manifestations (<a href=\"#bib36\">Palermo et al., 2001</a>), we speculate that circulating self-reactive effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may contribute to the systemic immune activation observed during chronic HCV infection, and account for some of the extra-hepatic autoimmune-like manifestations (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). If our prediction is correct, the ability to restore a physiologically normal preimmune repertoire in cured patients may thus justify early treatment as a means to limit immune-mediated manifestations of the disease. Further investigation in longitudinal cohorts is warrented to confirm these hypotheses, as well as assess the impact on the generation of non-self-specific responses (e.g., in the context of vaccination)."

TCR-V\u03b2 families were classified in increasing order of percentage usage. The Lorenz curve was constructed as a graphical representation of the diversity of the repertoire (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alanio et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">De Maio, 2007</a>). After ordering V\u03b2 chains by abundance, from lowest to highest, the Lorenz curve shows the cumulative distribution : for a given percentage (x) of the 24 V\u03b2 chains, it indicates the proportion of the T cell population which have V\u03b2 chains that are among the 24 * x% least abundant ones. Gini coefficient was calculated as the ratio of \u00ab area between the line representing equal use of all V\u03b2 chains (dotted line) and the observed Lorenz curve \u00bb to \u00ab total area below the line representing equal use \u00bb. As such, the higher the Gini coefficient, the more unequal the distribution is."

IFN versus DAA would make an important difference. Also, cells from the healthy subjects were at least partially obtained from buffy coats. Depending on how those are obtained (leftovers from the blood bank?) this could also influence both cell numbers and phenotype. Furthermore, nothing is known about age and other clinical parameters for HD, yet those could have significant impact on results (often HD tend to be younger)."

The authors found an increased proportion of pre-immune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited a memory phenotype (rather than the expected na\u00efve phenotype) in chronically infected HCV patients. This correlated with decreased CD5 expression, increased stimulation following TCR stimulation and increased caspase 3 cleavage following activation, suggesting increased sensitivity to TCR stimulation and activation-induced cell death. In vitro mechanistic studies showed that blocking CD5 on CD8 T cells from healthy donors recapitulated aspects of the increased sensitivity to TCR stimulation phenotype seen for CD8 T cells from chronic HCV patients. Furthermore, the authors showed that na\u00efve CD8 T cells from chronic HCV patients had decreased TREC levels and a more restricted V\u03b2 repertoire, indicative of a perturbed na\u00efve CD8 T cell repertoire in chronic HCV patients. Overall, the study has been well designed and the findings add important information to our knowledge of memory phenotype CD8 T cells in humans in the context of chronic viral infection. However, there are some issues with the manuscript that are detailed below."

In which case the acquisition of non-na\u00efve phenotype is not a surprise. These concerns are partly offset by additional analysis of hCMV specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), since the frequency of this population is the lowest of all the specificities studied (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), making it more difficult to be confident about apparent phenotypic differences.

However, the data shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> do not make a strong case that CD5 expression levels are the root cause of the increased TCR sensitivity of the na\u00efve cells from cHCV patients. The experiments presented show that blockade of CD5 leads to an enhanced response by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells \u2013 in line with many previous studies. What is needed is to test whether this blockade would normalize the differences in sensitivity between T cells from HD and cHCV donors. To be specific, the authors need to apply anti-CD5 blockade to <i>both</i> HD and cHCV T cells and determine whether TCR hypersensitivity is now equivalent between the groups (supporting the authors' idea that CD5 expression levels are the key determinant). Alternatively, they may find that T cells from cHCV patients still show the same degree of enhanced reactivity following TCR engagement \u2013 a result that would imply that CD5 blockade increases sensitivity by both populations to the same extent, and that other features of the cells from cHCV patients are responsible for their enhanced sensitivity."

At the same time (if I understood the new information about absolute T cell counts correctly), absolute T cell counts were performed using different methods in HD vs SVR and cHCV patients, raising the possibility that the differences in absolute CD3 numbers as shown in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a> could be a result of different methodology.

We have modified the Discussion in order to make the point that the proposed link to the extra-hepatic manifestations observed in cHCV patients is speculative and will need to be evaluated in longitudinal cohort studies. If our prediction is correct, the ability to restore a physiologically normal preimmune repertoire in cHCV patients may justify early treatment as a means to limit immune-mediated manifestations of the disease. We have also performed new experiments that reinforce our prior observations. With respect to antigen-specific inexperienced T cells being more prone to activation, this has been directly tested using ex vivo expansion as readout. We found MART-1 specific T cells from cHCV patients more abundant and possessing greater effector function (i.e., Granzyme B expression) after cognate peptide stimulation, comparing with healthy controls (see revised <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6 A-D</a>). These findings indicate that qualitative alterations of the CD8 T cell preimmune repertoire in cHCV patients do indeed impact critical aspects of induced immune responses. It also reinforces our conclusion that lower threshold for TCR activation on na\u00efve T cells might trigger antigen-independent T cell differentiation in cHCV patients. As discussed below, our initial results were confirmed when testing virus-specific T cells, reactive to viral antigens for which the donors had not been exposed (e.g., HIV, Ebola)."

Following our initial discoveries in cHCV patients, we were prompted to evaluate our findings in an alternative viral hepatitis disease state. We were fortunate to have access to a bio-repository of HBV samples that permitted rapid testing, however samples were indeed limited, with ~5x107 PBMCs being available per patient. We therefore restricted our analysis to: (i) Mart1-specific T cell phenotype and numbers, (ii) CD5 levels on bulk na\u00efve T cells, and (iii) CD25 and active caspase 3 percentages after 24 hours of activation with CD3/CD28 antibodies, parameters that we identified in the cHCV cohort as the best biomarkers of a perturbed T cell repertoire. As discussed, we demonstrated lower absolute numbers and intermediate proportions of memoryphenotype Mart1-specific cells in cHBV patients, and a similar CD5 expression and T cell activation as compared to HDs. Based on these findings, we believe that different persistent viral infections can trigger distinct T cell repertoire perturbations.

As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2</a>, CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> gated na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express the highest levels of CCR7 and lowest level of HLA-DR markers. We also demonstrate a high degree of correlation between percentages of CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> and CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These data were confirmed in cHCV patients, with &gt;95% bulk and Mart1- specific CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also expressing CCR7. We now provide these data in the manuscript as a supplementary figure (Figure S1B). Regarding the concern related to Figure S1, we confirm that there is a minor population (9%) of CD127 negative cells in the displayed CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> gate. These cells are &gt;99% CD45RO negative and CCR7 positive, which we believe allows us to be confident that they are indeed na\u00efve T cells. Interestingly, they express lower levels of CD27 as compared to other na\u00efve cells. Our interpretation is that this subpopulation corresponds to activated na\u00efve T cells that have shed surface CD27, as previously described in the context of graft-versus-host disease (Poulin, 2003)."

Our interpretation is that the shift in the CD45RA/CD27 phenotype of inexperienced T cells is accompanied by clonal selection \u2013 and thus not a reflection of abnormal surface expression. However, we believe this does not inform us on the mechanism of expansion, i.e. specific vs. aspecific (homeostatic) differentiation, both being described as triggering clonal selection (Mikszta et al., 1999; Qi et al., 2014).
