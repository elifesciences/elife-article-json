Here, we report endocytic sorting signals for the receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), comprising two \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs, that direct it to degradation in lysosomes. These signals are recognized by two HECT-domain ubiquitin E3 ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2, which are induced by Shh and become enriched in Caveolin-1 lipid rafts in association with Ptch1. Smurf-mediated endocytic turnover of Ptch1 is essential for its clearance from the primary cilium and pathway activation. Removal of both Smurfs completely abolishes the ability of Shh to sustain the proliferation of postnatal granule cell precursors in the cerebellum. These findings reveal a novel step in the Shh pathway activation as part of the Ptch1 negative feedback loop that precisely controls the signaling output in response to Shh gradient signal."

Here, we report endocytic sorting signals for the receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), comprising two \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs, that direct it to degradation in lysosomes. These signals are recognized by two HECT-domain ubiquitin E3 ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2, which are induced by Shh and become enriched in Caveolin-1 lipid rafts in association with Ptch1. Smurf-mediated endocytic turnover of Ptch1 is essential for its clearance from the primary cilium and pathway activation. Removal of both Smurfs completely abolishes the ability of Shh to sustain the proliferation of postnatal granule cell precursors in the cerebellum. These findings reveal a novel step in the Shh pathway activation as part of the Ptch1 negative feedback loop that precisely controls the signaling output in response to Shh gradient signal."

Binding of Shh to Ptch1 alleviates the Ptch1 inhibition of Smo, allowing the signal to propagate to three Gli proteins, the transcriptional effectors of the pathway, and activate the expression of target genes, including pathway components Ptch1 and Gli1 themselves. Since Gli1 is a potent activator of Shh target genes, its induction by the ligand ensures that pathway activation will attain the intended effect in a positive feedback loop. On the other hand, induction of the inhibitory Ptch1 amounts to a negative feedback control, which was regarded crucial to the interpretation of the Shh gradient signal (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ribes and Briscoe, 2009</a>). In effect, Ptch1 serves two roles in Shh signaling: first, it acts cell autonomously in suppressing the downstream pathway, and second, the excessive Ptch1 induced by Shh acts as a sink in limiting the spread of the ligand, thereby affecting the neighboring cells in a non-cell autonomous fashion (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Struhl, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Torroja et al., 2004</a>). However, it is not clear what counteracts the induction of Ptch1 to achieve the precision of the regulation."

It is known that ligand engagement of <i>Drosophila</i> receptor Ptc triggers its internalization and membrane presentation of Smo, but membrane trafficking of Ptch1 and Smo in mammalian cells has an added complexity in that Shh signals through the primary cilium (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huangfu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Corbit et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Goetz and Anderson, 2009</a>), a microtubule-based membrane protrusion that emanates from the interphase centrioles (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lefebvre and Rosenbaum, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pazour and Witman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nachury et al., 2010</a>). The prevailing model for mammalian Shh activation entails Ptch1 exiting from and Smo translocating into the primary cilium (<a href=\"#bib62\">Rohatgi et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kovacs et al., 2008</a>). Some data suggest that Smo trafficking through membranous compartments is controlled by small lipids and the sterol-sensing domain of Ptch1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Martin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bijlsma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Corcoran and Scott, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yavari et al., 2010</a>). Since the structural framework of Ptch1 resembles that of bacterial amino acid transporters (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carstea et al., 1997</a>), it is conceivable that Ptch1 controls Smo activity or trafficking through such a small molecular intermediate. However, little evidence is available to account for how Ptch1 internalization through endocytosis is regulated, and it is unclear whether ciliary trafficking and endocytosis are obligatorily coupled (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nachury et al., 2010</a>)."

At various steps of the endocytic pathway, from the plasma membrane to the endosomes, receptors can be sorted to the proteolytic lumens of lysosomes, leading to desensitization, or back to the plasma membrane for a rapid recovery of cellular responsiveness. In addition to the classical Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, recent advances indicate that membrane receptors are also internalized through lipid rafts (<a href=\"#bib38\">Le Roy and Wrana, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lajoie and Nabi, 2010</a>), which are specialized membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin and stabilized by Caveolin 1 (Cav-1) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2007</a>). Unlike the Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, cargos of caveolae were shown to be unloaded to late endosomes, thereby bypassing early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib57\">Quirin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hayer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sandvig et al., 2011</a>).

Here, we present evidence that Smurf1 and Smurf2 are the Ubiquitin E3 ligases that promote Ptch1 movement from lipid rafts to late endosomes for subsequent degradation in lysosomes. This movement is essential for Ptch1's clearance from primary cilia, Shh pathway activation, and the role of Shh in sustaining the proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors. In light of the negative feedback control of Shh signaling by Ptch1, this destruction system would allow the level of signaling output to be set precisely according to the level of the Ptch1 protein."

                                "text": "The C-terminal tails of <i>Drosophila</i> Ptc and mouse Ptch1 play an important role in determining its membrane distribution and stability, possibly through the highly conserved \u2018PPXY\u2019 motif (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kawamura et al., 2008</a>), which is recognized by the WW domain frequently found in HECT-domain E3 ligases (<a href=\"#bib44\">Metzger et al., 2012</a>). Mammalian Ptch1 contains an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal \u2018PPXY\u2019 motif and a second one in the third intracellular loop (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whereas Ptch2 does not and is quite stable (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kawamura et al., 2008</a>). Under a confocal microscope and in transfected murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Ptch1-GFP was primarily detected in punctate vesicles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), consistent with what was reported in COS and HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Incardona et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Karpen et al., 2001</a>); a large proportion of these Ptch1-GFP vesicles were likely to be endosomes (see below and in <a href=\"#bib43\">Martin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Incardona et al., 2002</a>). In light of the ubiquitination control of endocytosis, we suspected that the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs of Ptch1 might be the signal that regulates its turnover through endosomes and lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine how Ptch1 engages the endocytic pathway by focusing our attention at the rim of the plasma membrane, where treatment with conditioned medium (CM) from HEK293 cells expressing the N-terminal signaling fragment of Shh (ShhN) for 1 hr rendered some of the Ptch1-GFP vesicles also positive for Cav-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), a specific marker of lipid rafts. To quantify the colocalization, we sampled 10 randomly selected rim areas from different cells imaged for each data point and calculated the colocalization coefficient. The results indicated that ShhN almost doubled the colocalization coefficient between Ptch1-GFP and endogenous Cav-1 from 0.37 \u00b1 0.04 to 0.68 \u00b1 0.04 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Blocking late endosome/lysosome passage with chloroquine (Chlq) and concanavalin A (ConA) or lysosomal proteolysis with leupeptin (Leu) showed similar effects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, the mutant Ptch1\u03942PY-GFP that lacks both \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs exhibited a higher level of colocalization with Cav-1 than its wildtype counterpart even without ShhN treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Some of the Ptch1-GFP vesicles at the plasma rim were also positive for Clathrin heavy chain that marks the Clathrin-coated pits, but in contrast to the ligand-inducible enrichment in Cav-1 lipid rafts, the fraction of Ptch1-GFP in Clathrin-coated pits was affected neither by ligand treatment nor deletion of the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). To complement the confocal imaging experiments, we conducted a co-sedimentation experiment in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient and found that both Ptch1-FLAG and Ptch1\u03942PY-FLAG co-sedimented with Cav-1 in 20% and 25% buoyancy fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), indicating that when expressed exogenously, Ptch1-FLAG can find its way into Cav-1 positive lipid rafts even without Shh induction. Thus, both deletion of the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs and blocking endocytosis cause Ptch1 to accumulate in lipid rafts."

A small portion of Ptch1-FLAG appeared to turnover via lysosomes as indicated by the moderate level of accumulation in the presence of lysosomal inhibitor Chlq (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, lanes 1 and 2).

In the absence of ShhN, Ptch1-GFP and Rab7-RFP could be readily detected together in punctate vesicles, and ShhN treatment drastically increased that colocalization as indicated by colocalization coefficient, which increased from 0.29 \u00b1 0.03 to 0.51 \u00b1 0.02 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

In <i>Drosophila</i>, the role of Ptc in ligand sequestration has been shown to be separable from that of signaling based on analyses of certain mutants (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Struhl, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Torroja et al., 2004</a>). However, we observed that when re-expressed in <i>Ptch1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs, the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motif mutants accumulated in the primary cilium, in contrast to their wildtype counterpart; ShhN treatment effectively forced Ptch1-GFP to exit the primary cilium, but it was less effective against these mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Ciliary accumulation of the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motif mutants is likely a consequence of their inability to endocytose, rather than a specific defect of ciliary export, since these mutants also accumulate in lipid rafts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) and blocking endocytosis with high concentration of leupeptin showed a similar effect without or with ShhN treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Combined with results from the stability experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), this observation indicated that these two \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs play an equivalent role in regulating Ptch1 function in cilia. To support this notion, we made temporal measurements of endogenous Smo translocating into the primary cilium, which is an obligatory early event of Shh signaling and was reported as concurrent to the exit of Ptch1 therefrom (<a href=\"#bib62\">Rohatgi et al., 2007a</a>). In <i>Ptch1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs, immunofluorescence staining showed that Smo was constitutively present in the primary cilium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), as expected (<a href=\"#bib14\">Corbit et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rohatgi et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kovacs et al., 2008</a>). Re-introducing Ptch1-GFP cleared Smo out of the primary cilium, but ShhN treatment allowed Smo to move back in to nearly its full extent within 4 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Conversely, ShhN treatment triggered the ciliary export of Ptch1 at a rate comparable to that of Smo import (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, and compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Re-introducing \u03942PY, on the other hand, only allowed a substantially lower level of Smo to be imported back into cilia after ShhN treatment and \u03942PY was itself resistant to Shh-induced export (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a>)."

To determine if Ptch1 endocytosis impinges on downstream pathway activation, we measured the ability of Ptch1-GFP or \u03942PY to confer Shh inducibility to the 8xGliBS-luc reporter in <i>Ptch1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs. When co-transfected with Ptch1-GFP, the 8xGliBS-luc reporter showed a robust inductive response to ShhN, resulting in a dose\u2013response curve typical of a substrate-enzyme relationship; however, this reporter was barely induced by ShhN when it was co-transfected with \u03942PY (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The Shh signaling blockade imposed by \u03942PY could be by-passed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sufu (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), a downstream negative regulator, suggesting that the blockade is pathway-specific and occurs upstream of Sufu function. So far all our evidence points to inability of the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motif mutants to undergo Shh-induced endocytosis rather than a defect in their intrinsic activity. Indeed, in <i>Ptch1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs, these mutants were equally effective as wildtype Ptch1 or cyclopamine in suppressing 8xGliBS-luc reporter independent of the Shh ligand (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Finally to address the effect of the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs deletion on the non-cell-autonomous function of Ptch1, we designed a \u2018mixing\u2019 experiment, in which <i>Ptch1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs re-expressing wildtype Ptch1-GFP or \u03942PY-GFP were mixed at 5 to 1 ratio with a line of stable NIH3T3 cells harboring the genomically integrated 8xGliBS-luc reporter (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). In the presence of limiting amount of ShhN (1:64 dilution of the conditioned medium), \u03942PY showed a robust inhibition of the ligand-induced reporter activity in the neighboring cells; however this effect was nullified at high ShhN concentration (1:16 dilution) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

We expressed mouse Nedd4 and Nedd4l together with Ptch1-FLAG in HEK293 cells, and found that neither one promoted Ptch1 degradation, and several other HECT-domain E3 ligases including Wwp1, Wwp2, Huwe1, Herc1, Herc3, Herc4, Herc6, Hecw1, and Hecw2 also showed no effect, but co-expression of Smurf1 or Smurf2 did (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>).

Since the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motif mutants accumulated in cilia, we asked if knockdown of either Smurf or both with siRNAs could augment the ciliary localization of Ptch1-GFP.

To assess the role of Smurfs in Shh signaling, we quantified the transcriptional responses of endogenous Gli1 by RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) and RT-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) in MEFs with different Smurf genetic background, and found that silencing Smurf1 and Smurf2 simultaneously in wildtype MEFs completely abolished Shh induction of Gli1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). MEFs that lack one of the two <i>Smurf</i> genes still mounted a considerable Gli1 transcriptional response to ShhN; however, silencing the remaining <i>Smurf2</i> allele in <i>Smurf1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> or <i>Smurf1</i> allele in <i>Smurf2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MEFs, respectively, led to marked curtailment of Gli1 activation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Expression of Smurfs showed a compensatory upregulation in response to the loss of the other Smurf in these MEFs as reported (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yamashita et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tang et al., 2011</a>), but surprisingly, ShhN induced expression of both Smurfs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>). During the course of this investigation, we generated <i>Smurf1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;Smurf2</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> mice, which will be described in detail elsewhere. In <i>Smurf1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;Smurf2</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> MEFs, Ad-cre infection-mediated ablation of conditional <i>Smurf2</i><sup><i>fl</i></sup> alleles severely dampened the Gli1 transcriptional response to ShhN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). Similarly, two other Shh signaling responses, namely Shh-induced ciliary import of Smo and Gli3, were also affected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). Since we could rescue Shh induction of GliBS-luc responses in Ad-cre infected <i>Smurf1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;Smurf2</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> MEFs (<i>Smurfs</i> null) by reintroducing wildtype Smurf1 or Smurf2 but not mutant Smurf1CA or Smurf2CG cDNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), or by siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>Suppressor of fused</i> (<i>Sufu</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), an essential downstream negative regulator of Shh signaling, the observed defects of GliBS-luc induction have to be Smurfs and Shh pathway specific. Taken together, the above results show that simultaneous inactivation of both <i>Smurf</i> genes and removal of the \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs of Ptch1 have congruent effects on various Shh signaling events, and indicate that a common Smurf function is required at a step upstream from the control of the ciliary import of Smo."

A number of evidence demonstrates that this is the case. First, in non-permeabilizing MEFs, we found exogenously expressed Ptch1-RFP colocalized with the ligase deficient, GFP-tagged Smurf2CG mutant in Cav-1 positive lipid rafts at the rim of the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Although first identified as modulators of TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling, Smurfs are preferentially localized in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kavsak et al., 2000</a>) and play a crucial function in maintaining genomic stability (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blank et al., 2012</a>). Serendipitously, we found that treatment with ShhN ligand or co-expression with Ptch1-RFP each caused Smurf2GFP to move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In light of the Shh induction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>), these results indicate that Shh signaling could increase the cytoplasmic pool of Smurfs. Third, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis showed that Ptch1-CFP was localized in close proximity with Smurf1-YFP or Smurf2-YFP at punctate intracellular vesicles in MEFs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), and ShhN treatment enhanced this colocalization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). However, \u03942PY-CFP failed to generate FRET with Smurf2-YFP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). Theses result were further corroborated in the discontinuous sucrose gradient sedimentation experiment described earlier, in which the ligase-deficient Smurf2CG-Myc co-sedimented in the Cav-1-containing 20\u201325% sucrose fractions readily with Ptch1-FLAG, whereas \u03942PY was inefficient in bringing Smurf2CG-Myc into these fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Finally, using co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that Ptch1 specifically binds either Smurf1 or Smurf2, and Ptch1 mutants lacking either PY-1 or PY-2 motif can still bind Smurfs, albeit with reduced affinity; however, \u03942PY completely lacks affinity for either Smurf1 or Smurf2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

The induction by Shh is likely a function of ligand-binding, rather than a signaling outcome, as the loop2 mutant Ptch1 that lacks the ability to bind Shh (<a href=\"#bib7\">Briscoe et al., 2001</a>) completely lost the capacity to respond to ShhN treatment in wildtype MEFs, although it was more stable in <i>Smurf</i>-null MEFs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>).

More than half of the double null embryos that we generated failed to gastrulate and those rare embryos that did escape seldom passed Theiler stage 13, thus precluding a thorough analysis of the neural tube phenotype where Shh function is well characterized. To address the physiological relevance of Smurf regulation of Ptch1 endocytosis, we examined the role of Smurfs in sustaining the proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs), which has an absolute requirement for Shh. For this purpose, we cut cerebellar slices from P7 <i>Smurf1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>;Smurf2</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> pups and cultured them for 12 days in vitro as described (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kapfhammer, 2010</a>). Anti-NeuN immunofluorescence staining revealed that the number of post-mitotic granule cells were severely reduced in slices infected with Ad-cre viruses (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>), suggesting that Shh signaling was compromised there. We also isolated GCPs from cerebella of normal P7 pups of the C57/B6 strain, and cultured them in vitro. In the presence of ShhN, GCPs grew healthily for at least 5 days, but siRNA knockdown of <i>Smurf1</i> and <i>Smurf2</i> simultaneously blocked GCP proliferation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10B</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>). To ascertain that the effect of Smurf knockdown was Shh-pathway specific, we repeated the above experiment using IGF1, which is capable of sustaining the proliferation of GCPs in lieu of Shh (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fernandez et al., 2010</a>), and found that knockdown of <i>Smurfs</i> had no effect on IGF-1-induced GCP growth (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

                        "text": "Shh plays a fundamental role in setting up the body plan during embryogenesis, and is also critical in guiding stem cell differentiation for maintaining tissue homeostasis in the adult. Cell surface reception of Shh signaling is a multistep process that entails, but is not limited to, ligand engagement, reciprocal movements of Ptch1 exiting from and Smo translocating into the primary cilium, and activation of the G-protein-coupled Smo by still-controversial mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ogden et al., 2008</a>). The central task of this process is to sense and convert incremental changes in the Shh gradient into corresponding levels of signaling output, thereby allowing the positional cues to be executed. In this study, we extended our knowledge of the Shh signaling activation process by revealing a ubiquitination switch that regulates Ptch1 endocytosis, which is essential in clearing Ptch1 from its site of action in the primary cilium, and to ligand sequestration, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib29\">Incardona et al., 2000</a>). Our data demonstrate that ubiquitination of Ptch1 mediated by the two \u2018PPXY\u2019 motifs is controlled by HECT-domain E3 ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2, which are induced by Shh (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>) and redistributed into the cytoplasm under Shh influence (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Shh also promotes the association of Ptch1 and Smurfs in intracellular vesicles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), most likely the Cav-1 positive lipid rafts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), as well as ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) and endosomal entry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>), leading to lysosomal turnover (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1F, 8A\u2013D</a>). So, an increase in the Shh signal strength would cause a corresponding increase in both the production of Ptch1 and its rate of turnover en route from the primary cilium to the lipid rafts and to the endosomes/lysosomes. This regulatory scheme is reminiscent of an electronic amplification circuit, in which a feedback loop added to an open-loop amplifier has the effect of stabilizing the gain and increasing the linearity of the output signal to a given range, which can be controlled by adjusting the feedback strength. By analogy, Shh induction of Gli1 can be viewed as the open-loop amplifier, with Ptch1 providing the negative feedback. In this wiring logic, the graded Shh morphogenic signal can be stably transformed into stepwise output responses tailored for a predetermined cell fate specification. Without endocytosis, Ptch1 would accumulate in the primary cilium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), thus hampering Smo import and function. More importantly, without Ptch1 removal/degradation, the amplitude of Shh signaling would be restricted by the accumulation of newly synthesized inhibitory Ptch1. Oversupplied Ptch1 could also impact on signaling in neighboring cells through non-cell autonomous inhibition. So, Ptch1 endocytosis plays a crucial role in setting the output range of Shh signaling."

                        "text": "The presence of Ptc in membranous vesicles has long been noted in <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Capdevila et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Denef et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ramirez-Weber et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>), but its significance was not fully appreciated and regulation unknown. Ptc or Ptch1 is a 12-pass transmembrane protein, whose internal sequence spanning from IV to X transmembrane domains resembles the resistance, nodulation, division (RND) family of bacterial proton-driven transporter and the sterol-sensing domain found in SREBP and NPC1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carstea et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Taipale et al., 2002</a>). Substantial evidence in the literature suggests that Ptch1 inhibition of Smo occurs by way of small molecular intermediates that may be transported by Ptch1 through the membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Di Guglielmo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bijlsma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yavari et al., 2010</a>). Perhaps it is not a coincidence that we found Ptch1 exits the primary cilium and enters the endocytic pathway via cholesterol and sphingomyelin-rich lipid rafts, whereas Smo was shown previously to enter the primary cilium via Clathrin-coated pits when induced by Shh (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kovacs et al., 2008</a>). It is possible that Ptch1 and Smo are required to be sorted into different membranous compartments and to keep a mutually exclusive presence in the primary cilium, so that a cross-membrane imbalance of the small molecular intermediates is attained. The RND/sterol-sensing domain is critical to Ptch1 function as multiple inactivating mutations in this region have been found in <i>Drosophila</i> as well as in Gorlin syndrome patients (<a href=\"#bib43\">Martin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Strutt et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Taipale et al., 2002</a>). However, although certain RND mutants of <i>Drosophila</i> Ptc accumulate in endosomes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Martin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Strutt et al., 2001</a>), this domain may be more important to Ptch1 function than to its endocytic turnover, since we found that combining a RND mutation with the 2-PY deletion did not alter the latter's impact on Ptch1 stability (data not shown)."

                        "text": "Through cDNA-mediated screens, we have identified Smurf1 and Smurf2 as the E3 ligases responsible for generating the sorting signal for Ptch1 endocytosis. Although subsequent experiments indicated that deletion of one <i>Smurf</i> gene was not sufficient to inactivate Shh signaling, siRNA-mediated knockdown of either <i>Smurf1</i> or <i>Smurf2</i> was enough to dampen the 8xGliBS reporter response in transfected MEFs. This apparent discrepancy is likely to be reconciled by the mutual, compensatory upregulation of either of the two <i>Smurf</i> genes upon the loss of the other, resulting in the adaptation of single-<i>Smurf</i>-knockout MEFs for a robust Shh signaling response. On the other hand, such an adaptive response might not have been established in time under the conditions found in transiently transfected MEFs in response to siRNA-mediated knockdown. The observation of Shh induction of Smurf expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>) and cytoplasmic pivoting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) further implicated Smurfs in Shh signaling. Previously, <i>Drosophila</i> Ptc was shown to interact with and regulated by Nedd4 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lu et al., 2006</a>), another HECT-domain E3 ligase. In addition, the mouse Ptch1 was also shown to bind Nedd4, but this interaction triggers apoptosis through ubiquitination of Caspase 9 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fombonne et al., 2012</a>). It is likely that Ptch1 is regulated by multiple E3 ligases with different functional outcomes. Recently, <i>Drosophila</i> DSmurf was identified as a Ptc-interacting partner in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, and shown subsequently as a specific E3 ligase that regulates Ptc stability (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2013</a>). However, DSmurf was shown to promote Ptc turnover in the presence of activated Smo<sup>SD</sup>, bind Smo, and prefer ligand-unbound Ptc as a substrate (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2013</a>). We did not observe interaction between mammalian Smurfs and Smo by Co-IP experiments (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and found that Shh induction of Ptch1 turnover proceeded unabatedly even in the absence of Smo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,H</a>). In Huang et al., when ectopically expressed in the anterior compartment of the wing disc, activated Smo<sup>SD</sup> induced massive amount of Ptc; these two proteins could form a complex at the high levels, much like their mammalian counterparts do when overexpressed in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stone et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Taipale et al., 2002</a>). Perhaps, DSmurf could recognize this unnatural complex and triggers a proteasomes-mediated degradation, even specifically."

In any event, our work presents a rather comprehensive view of the Shh pathway activation process. Considering two neighboring cells in a given Shh influence field (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>), the cell that receives lower Shh input (upper cell) encounters a stronger feedback inhibition due to lower endocytic turnover of Ptch1, resulting in a lower level of Shh signaling output represented by Gli1. In the cell that receives higher Shh input (lower cell), although the synthesis of Ptch1 is induced, upregulation of Smurfs and the induction of colocalization in lipid rafts ensure a faster Ptch1 turnover such that the level of Ptch1 feedback inhibition is actually low, resulting in higher pathway activity. The endocytic turnover also has impact on the ligand sequestration role of Ptch1 through controlling the availability of the ligand \u2018sink\u2019 on cell surface. In this regard, the Smurf-mediated endocytosis of Ptch1 is an essential signaling event, and it is theoretically possible to block Shh function both cell and non-cell autonomously using Smurf inhibitors, thus opening a new route for Shh-targeted cancer treatment."

To assay for Ptch ubiquitination in vitro, an ubiquitination assay was modified from a previously described procedure (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tang et al., 2011</a>). Ptch1-FLAG was captured from transfected HEK293 cell lysates using anti-FLAG agarose. After a thorough wash, the Ptch1-bound agarose was divided into three aliquots. Empty anti-FLAG agarose was used as a control. The in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed by incubating either Ptch1-bound agarose or control agarose at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr with ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBE1, E2-conjugating enzyme UbcH5c, HA-Ub and ATP (all from Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA) in the presence or absence of purified His6-Smurf2 or His6-Smurf2CG. After the incubation, the supernatant was removed, the agarose thoroughly washed, and the Ptch1-FLAG eluted using the FLAG peptide (Sigma).

They provided evidence that Shh promotes Ptch1 enrichment in the lipid rafts and that the PPXY sorting signals (PY motifs) in Ptch1 promotes endocytosis and degradation of Ptch1. They further showed that the PY motifs are required for Shh-induced ciliary exit of Ptch1 and optimal Hh pathway activation. They identified Smurf 1 and 2 as two E3 critical ligases that promote Ptch1 ubiquitination and degradation through the PY motifs. Interestingly, they found that the expression of Smurf1/2 is upregulated in response to Shh. By using FRET and CoIP, they provided evidence that Smurf and Ptch1 physically interact depending on the PY motifs. Finally, they showed that genetic ablation of Smurf1 and 2 specifically affected Shh-induced proliferation of GCPs. Overall, the experiments were well executed and the data are convincing. The work is complementary to a recent publication that mainly described a role of Smurf in targeting Drosophila Ptc (Huang et al., PLOS Bio 2013), and represents an important advance in the field, allowing one to compare and contrast the fly and mammalian systems. However, the authors should address the following concerns either by discussion or by additional experiments before publication is recommended."

Although Shh-induced upregulation of Smurf could contribute, other mechanisms may exist. Have the authors examined whether Shh promotes the binding of Smurf to Ptch1? For example, does Shh treatment increase the FRET between GFP-Smurf2CG and Ptch1-RFP shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A-C</a>? On the other hand, Smurf-mediated degradation of Ptch1 could be Shh independent, as suggested by Casali (Science Signaling, 2010). For example, Ptch1\u03942, which has the Shh binding domain deleted (Briscoe et al., Mol Cell 2001), might still be regulated by Smurf/PY. Furthermore, Huang et al suggested that Smurf prefers degrading ligand-unbound Ptc (Huang et al., PLOS Bio 2013). How could the authors reconcile their finding that Shh promotes Ptch1 degradation? Could they examine whether Ptch1\u03942 is degraded more or less effectively by Smurf than Ptch1 in the presence of Shh?"

This Smurf1/2-mediated trafficking of Patched is also important for its exit from primary cilia during pathway activation. Using cultured cells including MEFs knockout for Smurf1&2, the authors show that this trafficking event is, in turn, important for the ciliary accumulation of Smoothened and for the activation of Gli-mediated transcription. The authors show that the Shh-promoted proliferation of granule cell progenitors requires Smurf1 and Smurf2, suggesting an important function of this regulatory mechanism in a well-characterized physiological context dependent on Hedgehog ligands."

These results are strongly supported by the experiments in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> showing a reduction of neural progenitors in cerebellar slice cultures knockout for Sf1 and Sf2 and an inability of Shh to promote the in vitro proliferation of granule cell progenitors when Sf1 and Sf2 are knocked out.

For example, according to their model, Hedgehog ligands are shown to promote the localization of Patched in caveolae, a transitory localization that promote the Smurf dependent ubiquitination of Patched and its endosomal routing to the lysosomes where it is degraded. First of all, although scattered evidence suggests that caveosomes and endosomes may physically interact in specific contexts, the authors present their evidence supporting a role of Rab proteins and endosomal trafficking in promoting Patched exit from caveolae as a well defined and accepted mechanism. However, caveolae-mediated endocytosis is most often described to be separate from endosomal sorting. Although this could represent a novel sorting mechanism for cell surface receptors, the characterization of this process needs to be strengthened and better discussed."

Our previous and new data indicate that Shh promotes the Smurf-mediated endocytosis of Ptch1 in several ways. First, Smurfs are preferentially localized in the nucleus in normal cells (Kavsak et al., Mol Cell 6:1365-75, 2000) and play important roles in maintaining the genomic stability (Blank et al, Nature Medicine 18:227-34, 2012). In the revised manuscript, we show that Shh promotes a re-pivoting of Smurf2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Second, our data also show that Shh induces Smurfs expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E, 5G</a>). So, these two events should lead to an increase of the effective cytoplasmic concentration of Smurfs. Third, as requested, we conducted a new FRET experiment and found that Shh indeed promotes the colocalization of Ptch1 and Smurf2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Fourth, we further add new data showing that ShhN treatment enhances the ubiquitin modification of Ptch1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>), consistent with our data showing that Shh promotes Ptch1 turnover (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

However, comparing their <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and 4E</a>, one could find that the intensity of Ptc staining at the A/P boundary was also reduced by DSmurf, notwithstanding the fact that Ptc is normally high at the boundary. On the other hand, since the authors did not examine the distribution of Hh in the disc that received the ectopically expressed Smo<sup>SD</sup>, it would be an unsupported assumption that the elevated Ptc in the A compartment was still in the unbound form. After all, the Hh ligand is normally restricted to the compartmental border by the high level of Ptc there. If the border stripe of high level Ptc was made to expand, Hh zone should expand with it. Furthermore, it is well known in the field that Ptc and Smo, when over-expressed, tend to form a nonphysiological complex (Stone et al, Nature 384:129, 1996, and Taipale et al, Nature 418:892, 2002).This raises a possibility that the nonphysiological Ptc-Smo complex could trigger an \u201cunfolded protein response\u201d of some sort that leads to the DSmurf-mediated destruction.

In particular, the authors provide significant experimental data examining the subcellular localization of PTCH1 and the role of two PPXY motifs in regulating PTCH1 localization turnover, and downstream effects on HH pathway function. While, overall the results appear to be of high quality, there are some issues with both interpretation of the data and proper acknowledgement of previous work that the authors must address</i>."

Two essential examples include the recent publication of work identifying a role for Smurfs in regulating Drosophila Ptc turnover (Huang et al., PLOS Biology, 2013), and work from Tom Kornberg that defined a role for the PPXY motif in regulating the turnover of vertebrate PTCH1 (Kawamura et al., JBC, 2008). These two papers directly impact the current study by Yue et al., and this work should be considered in the context of these previous studies</i>."

However, the authors miss an opportunity to distinguish between the ligand-dependent and ligand-independent effects of PTCH1 in the HH pathway. They should use these cells and constructs to examine the ability of PTCH1 or PTCH1\u03942PY to antagonize SMO in the absence of ligand. That is, Ptch1-/- MEFs display constitutive HH pathway activation; however, re-expressing PTCH1 rescues this pathway activity. The question is whether PTCH1\u03942PY is equally effective? Do the authors observe equivalent antagonism of SMO in these cells? Or is PTCH1\u03942PY a more effective antagonist of SMO than wt PTCH1? These are straightforward questions to address since the authors have all the necessary tools and reagents in hand</i>."
