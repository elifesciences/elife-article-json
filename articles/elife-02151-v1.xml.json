Although the cytoplasmic cluster is essential for normal chemotaxis in some organisms, its structure and function remain unknown. Here we use electron cryotomography to image the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor cluster in <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We show that just like transmembrane arrays, cytoplasmic clusters contain trimers-of-receptor-dimers organized in 12-nm hexagonal arrays. In contrast to transmembrane arrays, however, cytoplasmic clusters comprise two CheA/CheW baseplates sandwiching two opposed receptor arrays. We further show that cytoplasmic fragments of normally transmembrane <i>E. coli</i> chemoreceptors form similar sandwiched structures in the presence of molecular crowding agents. Together these results suggest that the 12-nm hexagonal architecture is fundamentally important and that sandwiching and crowding can replace the stabilizing effect of the membrane."

Although the cytoplasmic cluster is essential for normal chemotaxis in some organisms, its structure and function remain unknown. Here we use electron cryotomography to image the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor cluster in <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We show that just like transmembrane arrays, cytoplasmic clusters contain trimers-of-receptor-dimers organized in 12-nm hexagonal arrays. In contrast to transmembrane arrays, however, cytoplasmic clusters comprise two CheA/CheW baseplates sandwiching two opposed receptor arrays. We further show that cytoplasmic fragments of normally transmembrane <i>E. coli</i> chemoreceptors form similar sandwiched structures in the presence of molecular crowding agents. Together these results suggest that the 12-nm hexagonal architecture is fundamentally important and that sandwiching and crowding can replace the stabilizing effect of the membrane."

The next step is to understand how chemical binding causes these arrays to send their signals to the motor. A complete understanding of this signaling system may ultimately allow scientists to re-engineer it to draw bacteria to targets of medical or environmental interest, such as cancer cells or contaminated soils."

Briefly, ligands bind to the periplasmic domains of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), either directly (<a href=\"#bib32\">Milburn et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Englert et al., 2010</a>) or via periplasmic binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tam and Saier, 1993</a>). This results in conformational changes that traverse the length of the MCP, through one or more HAMP (histidine kinases, adenyl cyclases, MCPs, and some phosphatases) domains and the cytoplasmic coiled-coil signaling domain to either activate or inactivate a histidine kinase, CheA, bound at the distal tip (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kentner and Sourjik, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</a>)."

In <i>E. coli</i>, CheA is a 5-domain (P1-P5) protein that functions as a homodimer. When activated by the MCP in unfavorable environments, CheA undergoes autophosphorylation and then transfers the phosphoryl group to one of two response regulators. One of these, CheY, binds the flagellar motor when phosphorylated, switching the motor\u2019s direction from clockwise to counter-clockwise and thus increasing the frequency of tumbling to find a more favorable direction (<a href=\"#bib50\">Turner et al., 2000</a>). The other response regulator, CheB, is a methylesterase whose activity is stimulated by phosphorylation. Its activity is opposed by the constitutively active methyltransferase CheR and the balance of these two activities determines the methylation state of specific glutamate residues in the MCPs. These methylations confer adaptation on the system, modulating its response based on recent environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kleene et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Toews et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lupas and Stock, 1989</a>)."

The best-studied case is <i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i>, in which there are three operons, two of which are essential for normal chemotaxis in laboratory conditions. One of these operons, CheOp<sub>2</sub>, encodes components of the chemotaxis array associated with the transmembrane MCPs. The other, CheOp<sub>3</sub>, encodes components of a cytoplasmic chemotaxis cluster including CheB, CheR, CheY, CheW, two atypical CheA proteins (CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Porter et al., 2008</a>), and a soluble chemoreceptor, TlpT. Each of the CheA proteins in the cluster lacks canonical domains compared to <i>E. coli</i> CheA: CheA<sub>3</sub> contains only the P1 and P5 domains separated by a 794 amino acid sequence of unknown structure, whereas CheA<sub>4</sub> lacks the P1 and P2 domains. CheA<sub>4</sub> can transfer phosphoryl groups to P1 of CheA<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Porter et al., 2008</a>). Both CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub> are required for chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wadhams et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Porter et al., 2008</a>). A second MCP homolog lacking any transmembrane domain, TlpC, is encoded in CheOp<sub>2</sub>. Fluorescent fusions of both TlpT and TlpC localize to a single cytoplasmic focus at mid-cell, which divides and is segregated during cell division (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wadhams et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2003</a>). CheA<sub>3</sub> and CheA<sub>4</sub>, along with CheW<sub>4</sub> and a CheR, also localize to this cytoplasmic cluster (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wadhams et al., 2003</a>). CheW<sub>4</sub> and TlpT are required to form the cluster, and the positioning of the cluster depends on the ParA homolog PpfA, which is encoded next to TlpT in CheOp<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#bib47\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>). PpfA is a chromosome-associated ParA-like ATPase and controls the localization and segregation of the cytoplasmic cluster through an interaction with the N-terminus of TlpT, which is thought to stimulate the ATPase activity of PpfA in a ParB-like manner (<a href=\"#bib38\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>). Sequence analysis of TlpT suggests that the 567 amino acid protein forms a classical MCP coiled-coil structure (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander and Zhulin, 2007</a>). The 580 amino acid TlpC lacks significant homology to the canonical MCP structure and lacks a recognizable HAMP domain or methylation region."

To gain confidence in our identification, we used a strain in which some cytoplasmic chemotaxis components are overexpressed. This strain exhibited chemotaxis in swim plate assays, indicating that the limited overexpression did not significantly impair chemotactic function. By fluorescence light microscopy (FLM), short cells contained single fluorescent foci and long cells two foci, as expected (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wadhams et al., 2002</a>). In tomograms of cryosections of these cells, we observed similar structures to those seen in WT cells but with greater length, appearing in cross-section as a curved, double-layered sandwich approximately 27 nm wide (measured from density peak-to-peak; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>)."

Since whole <i>R. sphaeroides</i> cells are too thick and dense to image by ECT with high resolution, we flattened them by gentle lysis. However, unlike transmembrane receptors that remain well-organized following cell lysis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Briegel et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2013</a>), fluorescent foci were not observed after lysis, indicating disruption of the cytoplasmic receptor cluster. We reasoned that in the absence of membrane, the density of the cytoplasm might play an important role in stabilizing cytoplasmic clusters. We therefore added molecular crowding agents, either polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000) or polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP), to the lysis protocol and used this approach to image an <i>R. sphaeroides</i> strain overexpressing the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor TlpT fused to YFP. We observed preservation of TlpT-YFP signals by FLM after lysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). We then froze lysed cells on an EM grid and localized a single TlpT-YFP signal by cryo-FLM, then imaged the indicated location at high resolution by ECT. We observed that the fluorescence signal corresponded to the structure previously identified (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013F</a>), further verifying that these are indeed cytoplasmic chemoreceptor arrays containing TlpT."

In this study, we describe the structure of cytoplasmic chemoreceptor arrays in two distantly related bacterial species, <i>R. sphaeroides</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i>. Notably, cytoplasmic arrays in both species display a hexagonal arrangement of receptor-trimers-of-dimers, with 12 nm center-to-center spacing that is identical to that of transmembrane chemoreceptor arrays, suggesting a fundamental utility for this architecture. Whereas the transmembrane array is embedded in the membrane with a CheA/W baseplate at the receptors\u2019 membrane-distal tips and ligand-binding domains in the periplasm, the cytoplasmic arrays assemble as a sandwich, with two CheA/W baseplates flanking two sheets of MCPs that interact in the middle, presumably at their ligand-binding domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). No membrane is associated with these arrays. The identity of the outer baseplates as CheA/W is supported by our observation of the same structure in in vitro preparations from <i>E. coli</i>, where only three proteins are present: receptor fragments, CheA, and CheW. The similarity of the array organization in membrane-bound and cytoplasmic clusters suggests a common organizational theme, in which either the membrane or the crowded environment of the cytoplasm provides necessary stability to the conserved architecture of a 12 nm hexagonal array of receptor-trimers-of-dimers."

However, the fact that naked receptors form hexagonal arrays (zippers) suggests that the receptors have an intrinsic propensity to form hexagonal arrays, perhaps by providing hydrophobic binding sites arranged on the outside of the trimer with the proper symmetry for hexagonal assemblies. It is likely an oversimplification to say that the array organization is provided primarily by the base plate \u2013 the structure of the receptor trimer of dimers is essential too."

Interestingly, the authors show that these structures, previously demonstrated to localize to discrete foci in cells, all share a common back-to-back architecture of hexagonally packed arrays. They propose that the (periplasmic, in membrane-bound arrays) ligand binding domains are thus minimally exposed to the cytosol. Through the finding that soluble domains of <i>E. coli</i> receptors form a similar structure, the authors argue that it may represent a default, low-energy configuration of chemoreceptor arrays rather than a specific evolutionary adaptation. However, the biological significance of this architecture is not discussed. Moreover, the interesting finding that the <i>R. sphaeroides</i> structure is curved is clouded by the lack of data from wild-type cells \u2013 the authors acknowledge this curvature may be due to the fluorescent proteins fusions."
