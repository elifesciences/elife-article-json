However, while single mRNAs can be imaged and their movements tracked in single cells, it has not yet been possible to determine whether these mRNAs are actively translating. Therefore, we imaged single \u03b2-actin mRNAs tagged with MS2 stem loops colocalizing with labeled ribosomes to determine when polysomes formed. A dataset of tracking information consisting of thousands of trajectories per cell demonstrated that mRNAs co-moving with ribosomes have significantly different diffusion properties from non-translating mRNAs that were exposed to translation inhibitors. These data indicate that ribosome load changes mRNA movement and therefore highly translating mRNAs move slower. Importantly, \u03b2-actin mRNA near focal adhesions exhibited sub-diffusive corralled movement characteristic of increased translation. This method can identify where ribosomes become engaged for local protein production and how spatial regulation of mRNA-protein interactions mediates cell directionality."

However, while single mRNAs can be imaged and their movements tracked in single cells, it has not yet been possible to determine whether these mRNAs are actively translating. Therefore, we imaged single \u03b2-actin mRNAs tagged with MS2 stem loops colocalizing with labeled ribosomes to determine when polysomes formed. A dataset of tracking information consisting of thousands of trajectories per cell demonstrated that mRNAs co-moving with ribosomes have significantly different diffusion properties from non-translating mRNAs that were exposed to translation inhibitors. These data indicate that ribosome load changes mRNA movement and therefore highly translating mRNAs move slower. Importantly, \u03b2-actin mRNA near focal adhesions exhibited sub-diffusive corralled movement characteristic of increased translation. This method can identify where ribosomes become engaged for local protein production and how spatial regulation of mRNA-protein interactions mediates cell directionality."

Previous work has shown that MS2 binding sites (MBS) inserted adjacent to the zipcode sequence in the 3'UTR of \u03b2-actin mRNA can be used to label and track the movement of single mRNA molecules (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fusco et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Yamagishi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lionnet et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2012</a>). Previous studies identified that mRNA: (1) exhibited multiple movement profiles (directed, diffusive, and corralled), (2) zipcode sequences facilitated directed transport of \u03b2-actin mRNA along microtubules, and (3) zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) delivered \u03b2-actin mRNA to leading edge adhesions where it could dwell for more than a minute. ZBP1 was previously shown to deliver its mRNA target in a translationally silenced state by blocking the 60S ribosomal subunit from initiating translation. Once the RNA-protein complex (RNP) localized to the cell periphery, Src kinase phosphorylated the 396 tyrosine to relax translation repression (<a href=\"#bib14\">H\u00fcttelmaier et al., 2005</a>). How translating mRNA can be retained within this compartment is still unclear, although evidence has suggested that the elongation factor 1\u03b1 (EF1\u03b1) may act to anchor mRNA to formins and thereby the leading edge actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2002</a>). Accordingly, the actin cytoskeleton was previously shown to be necessary for mRNA localization and maintenance at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sundell and Singer, 1991</a>). A recent report also argued that the RNP size is the main determinant of localization and therefore the architecture of the cytoplasmic microenvironment is a major factor in RNA retention at the leading edge (<a href=\"#bib37\">Yamagishi et al., 2009</a>). Our results suggest that delivery to a local site for increased translation may inherently increase \u03b2-actin mRNA dwell times and determine cell polarity and consequent directed motility (<a href=\"#bib27\">Park et al., 2012</a>)."

Recently, an approach was developed using binding sites in the coding region that indicated when the first ribosome passed through the mRNA, but this biosensor detected only the pioneer round of translation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Halstead et al., 2015</a>). Our goal in this work was to derive an approach that could be used to deduce the likelihood of the translational state at any given time of any fluorescently tagged mRNA. The work presented here describes a method for mapping the quantitative mobility features of a fluorescently tagged mRNA while it is associated with ribosomes to determine whether it is being translated, using multi-spectral live cell imaging. This approach mines data sets consisting of thousands of single mRNA tracks to extract the correlations between mRNA-polysome movements and the cytoplasmic nanoenvironment (for instance, mRNA near focal adhesions were found to move in a more corralled fashion). A novel method for tracking ribosomes simultaneously with labeled mRNA resulted in a high-resolution spatial map of mRNAs actively interacting and moving with ribosomes. mRNAs that travel with ribosomes were likewise found to move slower and be more spatially confined. When translation inhibitors were used to dissociate ribosomes from mRNA, the average diffusion coefficient of \u03b2-actin mRNA increased. Therefore it is possible to map regions of active translation based on movement profiles within a given cellular compartment."

Constitutive expression of tdMCP-GFP labeled all endogenous \u03b2-actin mRNA derived from a mouse in which 24 MS2 binding sites (MBS) were inserted into both alleles of the <i>Actb</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lionnet et al., 2011</a>). Cells were transfected with paxillin-mCherry to label focal adhesions and spatially distinguish the cell\u2019s leading edge (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We tracked both fast and slow moving mRNAs with TIRF excitation at a frame time of 35 ms (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We used mRNA trajectories with lifetimes beyond 105 ms (three consecutive frames) to build a \u03b2-actin mRNA diffusion map, in which all trajectories were given equal weight, regardless of their duration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">1G</a>, see materials and methods for more details). Spatially averaged mRNA diffusion maps distinguish cell compartments that channel or restrict mRNA movement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Previous work suggested that a subset of dwelling mRNAs around focal adhesions represented sites of increased translation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2012</a>). In order to verify that we could detect this effect in our assay, we identified the positions of each focal adhesion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and partitioned tracks that localized to adhesion complexes. Diffusion maps revealed that mRNA movement around adhesions was indeed slower (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A single-diffusive component fit of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves determined that \u03b2-actin mRNA at adhesions moved on average 37% slower (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig1s2\">2B</a>). However, the CDF curves are much better fit by a linear combination of two states, a faster one with an apparent diffusion coefficient of\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s,\u00a0and a slower one with a coefficient of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). This two-component fit constitutes a straightforward method capable of de-convolving the entire dataset and estimating the percentage of the two mRNA species, fast and slow. Near focal adhesions, the population of fast mRNA species falls from 60% to 50% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which indicates that around focal adhesions mRNAs diffuse slower and dwell longer on average (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> depicts the mean square displacement (MSD) curves of adhesion-localized mRNAs, which plateaus at a much lower level. This plateau demonstrates a significant shift towards a corralled movement profile (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This local confinement may indicate that \u03b2-actin mRNAs are trapped in areas of localized translation around focal adhesions."

In order to test this, we dissociated ribosomes from \u03b2-actin mRNA with puromycin and hippuristanol, both drugs that disrupt mRNA-ribosome interactions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Joklik and Becker, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bordeleau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Darnell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). After treatment, \u03b2-actin mRNA trajectories showed a significant shift of movement towards the faster diffusing population (<a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>). The average CDF from five separate acquisitions after puromycin treatment fit well with the linear combination of two CDFs, but now with ~90% of mRNAs being in the fast population state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Likewise, the MSD curve as well as the histogram of average apparent diffusion coefficients also displayed a significant shift to faster diffusion after puromycin treatment when compared to steady state \u03b2-actin mRNA movement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>). This global shift in mRNA diffusion behavior at the leading edge of cells is also apparent when comparing the local apparent diffusion maps between mRNA trajectories without puromycin treatment, as well as after addition of puromycin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig2\">2E</a>). The translation initiation inhibitor hippuristanol showed the same increase in mRNA diffusion after 1 \u03bcM treatment for 20 min (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>)."

Stable expression of fluorescently labeled L10A has been shown to label ~40% of ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). Ribosomes could be tracked for an average lifetime of ~200 ms (6.2 frames) after applying 405 nm activation energy. Since a small amount of activation was used in order to track single ribosome molecules, only a small fraction of total ribosomes were tracked. Ribosomes exhibited heterogeneity in diffusive motion, much as with \u03b2-actin mRNA (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Ribosome movement in cells at steady-state is best fit with the same two-component fit as mRNA: with a linear combination of a fast apparent diffusion coefficient of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s,\u00a0and a slower one with a coefficient of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s. A two-component fit of experimentally obtained CDFs of ribosome trajectories reveals that ribosomes collectively show a shift towards a slower diffusion component as compared to \u03b2-actin mRNA (56% vs. 42%, respectively) and suggests most ribosomes actively engage in translation throughout the cytoplasm (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig2\">2F</a>). With the addition of puromycin, a significant increase in ribosome diffusion was observed just as with \u03b2-actin mRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), and the population of faster ribosomes increased to 73% (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

The adhesion protein vinculin was\u00a0tagged with the MS2 capsid protein dimer (vinculin-MCP)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2012</a>). MBS mRNA binds to vinculin-MCP, and\u00a0allowed us to observe ribosome movement at sites where \u03b2-actin mRNA is immobilized. When \u03b2-actin mRNAs are tethered to focal adhesions, ribosomes diffused significantly slower (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Tracking of ribosomes in cells with \u03b2-actin mRNA tethered to adhesions shifted the movement of ribosomes towards corralled diffusion (63% vs. 56% slow, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Puromycin addition increased the movement of ribosomes in cells with mRNA tethered to adhesions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). This is also the case for ribosomes in cells with non-tethered cytoplasmic \u03b2-actin mRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>, and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">9</a>), suggesting that sptPALM of ribosomes in the TIRF field can identify ribosomes actively engaged and translating \u03b2-actin mRNA. In order to investigate this possibility further, we set out to perform dual-color tracking of \u03b2-actin mRNA and ribosomes. We reasoned that translating mRNAs should appear as mRNA particles moving while associated with a ribosome. Analyzing co-moving particles should therefore allow characterizing translation compartmentalization in migrating fibroblasts."

Whereas all endogenous \u03b2-actin mRNA molecules in the cell are detected using our tdMCP-GFP labeled reporter system, only a few ribosomes (on average 10 molecules/frame) can be tracked at each given time using the sptPALM technique. Consistent with this experimental limit, only a subset of \u03b2-actin mRNA were identified as co-moving with ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). We hypothesized those mRNAs that co-moved with ribosomes were likely loaded with multiple ribosomes and may exhibit slower movement. Consistent with this, diffusion analysis showed a shift towards slower movement in the co-moving mRNA population (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). mRNAs found to co-move with ribosomes shifted towards slower (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and more corralled movement (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), an indication that these mRNAs were in polysomes and were\u00a0more likely to dwell locally. Likewise, ribosomes found to co-move with \u03b2-actin mRNA trended slower and more corralled, reminiscent of mRNA localized to focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a> compared to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Together, the analysis of the mobility and co-movement of mRNA and ribosomes provide a detailed picture of the translational landscape inside live cells, capable of identifying translational hotspots (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,G</a>)."

In order to address this question, we set out to test previous findings showing that \u03b2-actin mRNA localized to adhesion complexes, presumably synthesizing protein to enhance focal adhesion stabilization and directed migration (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2012</a>). In order to further investigate the localized translation near focal adhesions, expression of paxillin-mCherry in cells with mRNA and ribosomes allowed three-color colocalization analysis of co-moving trajectories near adhesions (<a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). Adhesions were identified and bleached before tracking of mRNA and ribosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, lower panel). This allowed us to analyze all co-moving mRNAs near adhesions separately. Consistent with this prediction, a majority of ribosome-bound mRNA near the focal adhesions diffused slower than ribosome-bound mRNA away from focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), and much slower than mRNA detected without ribosomes, where the two-component fit to the CDF revealed only 34% of slow-moving mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

HMM-Bayes fits two diffusive motion states with different diffusion coefficients and automatically annotates the individual steps of each trajectory as corresponding to either the high diffusion state (blue) or the low diffusion state (green) (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> to <a href=\"#fig4\">F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">3</a>). In contrast to mean-square-displacement analysis that averages heterogeneous motion over predetermined temporal windows within each trajectory, HMM-Bayes automatically annotates stochastic motion dynamics, including the possibility of directed or active transport, without any user-supplied averaging parameters. Unlike our trajectory-averaged analysis, HMM-Bayes can provide insight into switching rates and lifetimes of the fast (D1) and slow (D2) diffusive states. It revealed that the slow diffusing state D2 is much longer lived for co-moving ribosomes (1.3 s) as compared to mRNAs that are not observed to be co-moving (0.3 s), consistent with translating ribosomes having a higher propensity to dwell at sites of translation (compare <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a> with <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3C</a>). Interestingly, all three species have fast diffusing states D1 with similar lifetimes of ~0.5 s (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">3B</a>), which may suggest that away from sites of active translation\u00a0all three species explore the cytoplasmic nanoenvironment in similar ways."

The transient slow state is both more abundant and more stable for co-moving ribosomes at focal adhesions, which suggests that translating ribosomes have higher propensity to dwell within specific nanoenvironments close to focal adhesions. While the microscopic mechanism of transient translational confinement is unknown, this local ribosome confinement can be enhanced by artificially tethering \u03b2-actin mRNA to focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>).

Simultaneously imaging PATagRFP labeled ribosomes along with the labeled mRNA allowed for co-movement analysis of single mRNAs and associated ribosomes.

We demonstrate an approach that can be applied to any mRNA\u00a0in living cells to\u00a0determine whether that mRNA is associated with polysomes at a precise location. This also allows for nanometer resolution on mRNA-protein interactions within the cell. HMM-Bayes analysis applied to the co-movement single molecule tracking\u00a0data provides an additional level of information. For instance, unlike mRNA transport in the dendritic processes of neurons, active or directed transport mediated by molecular motors was not detected. We can now also identify the spatial location where individual mRNAs transition into a slower moving\u00a0(translating) state. This differentiation is essential in order to investigate mechanisms of local regulation, for instance whether physical structures or proteins contact the molecule of interest."

The transient slow states are enriched at microenvironments close to focal adhesions, areas known for a dense meshwork of actin fibers and actin binding proteins. The translating complex may co-translationally associate with structures like filaments, adhesion associated proteins, chaperons, enzymes or other organelles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Condeelis and Singer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kramer et al., 2009</a>). It is unlikely that the slow diffusing state represents a population of translating mRNAs that remain corralled for the entirety of protein synthesis since the lifetime is much shorter (a few seconds) than the time it takes to translate the actin mRNA (~ 1 min). However, the disappearance of the slow state upon ribosome disassembly indicates that the translation cycle may be involved. For instance, transitions between the slower and faster states occur on the same order as translation initiation rate (~ 0.1\u20130.5\u2009s<sup>\u20131</sup>) for the \u03b2-actin mRNA (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schwanh\u00e4usser et al., 2011</a>). This suggests a potential connection to a single, short-lived state of the translation cycle, such as the deposition or release of initiation complex proteins. Interestingly, these functionally important yet transient interactions mediate local confinement at the cell leading edge and are reminiscent of the weak and transient nuclear interactions observed to play an important role in transcriptional initiation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cisse et al., 2013</a>). Hence, single molecule tracking is a robust method to identify spatial heterogeneity of movement both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Izeddin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Spille et al., 2015</a>). Understanding the frequency of state transitions and their local nanoenvironment will be essential in future live cell imaging studies."

Since there are additional RNA labeling systems, like PP7 stem loops which work orthogonally to MS2, it is now reasonable to test the dynamics of translational regulation for many of the reported target mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hocine et al., 2013</a>). New results from microarray data, deep sequencing, and other biochemical approaches will require live cell tracking\u00a0approaches to experimentally validate where and when these mRNAs localize (<a href=\"#bib29\">Poon et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Patel et al., 2012</a>). Development of sptPALM probes with greater photostability will enable longer-term imaging concomitant with MS2-based labeling, and future advances in imaging systems that can simultaneously track single molecules in three channels will allow any RNA of interest to be characterized. The PATagRFP-L10A ribosome-tracking construct can be used to map co-movement and diffusion characteristics of any uncharacterized mRNA. In particular, it would be advantageous to simultaneously track and map mRNA and ribosomes in neurons where local translation at the synapse is thought to contribute to information processing. Importantly, once the diffusion characteristics of mRNA in polysomes have been defined, it will not be necessary to use labeled ribosomes to verify that translation is occurring. Conversely, mapping ribosome diffusion in areas of the cell would reveal regions of higher translation. Therefore assessing diffusion coefficients using single particle tracking will provide new detailed information on translation."

This localization appears to surround the focal adhesion complexes (FACs) nearest to the lamellipod (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2012</a>). By tethering the \u03b2-actin mRNA to all FACs indiscriminately to vinculin we inhibit cellular\u00a0motility since mRNA\u00a0localization cannot generate any asymmetry among the focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katz et al., 2012</a>). We have shown that \u03b2-actin is preferentially translated in the leading edge (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). Here, we have investigated the translation of individual \u03b2-actin mRNAs by tracking their co-movement with ribosomes at high spatiotemporal resolution in live cells. The results corroborate and extend the hypothesis that actin\u00a0translation in general is preferred around the focal adhesion complex. This localized translation could generate a more concentrated supply of not only actin, but also\u00a0the many proteins associated with focal complex formation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</a>), the proteins that nucleate actin such as Arp2/3 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mingle et al., 2005</a>), and possibly FAC proteins as well. Hence the assembly of the complex starting with integrin association may be aided co-translationally, promoting 'waves' of actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Case and Waterman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Case and Waterman, 2015</a>). Therefore, we suggest that models of cell motility (<a href=\"#bib6\">Danuser et al., 2013</a>) should consider the role of localized RNPs in facilitating cell motility by assembly of multipolypeptide complexes at adhesion sites."

However, translation events are only observed when a \u03b2-actin mRNA is translated by a ribosome containing L10A-PATagRFP, and when the fluorescence of this PATagRFP molecule is activated by our violet laser. Two potential concerns arise: (1) Only a small unrepresentative fraction of ribosomes might contain the PATagRFP-L10A. This is not the case: in a previous publication from our group (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wu et al., 2015</a>), we showed that labeled L10A is successfully incorporated into ~40% of the total ribosome population. (2) Only low numbers of PATagRFP-L10A molecules can be fluorescently activated at any given time. Since we must limit our photoactivation laser powers to a regime where we avoid overlap between individual ribosome molecules, we cannot observe all ribosomes simultaneously and this prevents us from observing the absolute number of ribosomes per mRNA, or any other metric that would depend on the degree of labeling of the various species. We first ensured through an ad-hoc co-moving detection algorithm that all co-movement events were stringently selected (the algorithm was introduced by our group in an earlier publication:\u00a0<a href=\"#bib11\">Halstead et al., 2015</a>). This is important because false positives could affect our mobility measurements. Biologically specific co-moving events are apparent when looking at the pooled distances between mRNAs and ribosomes (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). High stringency runs the risk of detecting too few trajectories to build robust statistics. We ensured this is the case by acquiring vast numbers of trajectories: in a typical experiment, we would detect ~9000 individual mRNA trajectories, out of which ~5% passed the co-moving test. This represents ~450 co-moving events, from a single movie. The aggregate data for co-movement analysis come from many movies in different cells, and therefore represent thousands of co-moving events."

HMM-Bayes analysis was performed on pooled sets of trajectories; thus the motion parameters (diffusion coefficients) were inferred considering all trajectories together, but state sequence annotations were inferred separately for each trajectory.

However, strategies for monitoring localized translation in vivo are just now being developed. Localized translation of actin at the leading edge of motile cells has served as a powerful model system for studying these phenomena. Elegant work from the Singer lab has used MS2 coat protein-GFP fusions together with arrays of MS2 binding sites inserted into the 3'UTR of the actin message to visualize individual actin messages in a live cell. These studies have revealed different dynamics of the actin message depending on its location as well as the presence of two distinct sub populations one with faster and a second with a slower diffusion constant. In the present study, the authors develop an approach for monitoring translation of the MS2-GFP actin messages. Specifically they argue that messages being translated show significantly different kinetics of translation than non-translating messages and thus the diffusion properties can be used to report on the translation state of a labeled message. While it is not clear that there are major new functional insights directly emerging from the present dataset (beyond the important conclusion that translation impacts mRNA dynamics), the approach does represent a technical tour de force and gets at information that would otherwise be very difficult to obtain. The authors' connection between translation and the diffusion properties of a message is based on a number of highly suggestive correlations. For example, they show that messages with correlated movement with large ribosomal subunits (and thus are presumably being translated) show slower movement. Additionally, an inhibitor of translation (puromycin) leads to enhanced actin message movement and localizing the actin message to a region of high translation also slow its dynamics."

The authors use their developed methods to examine mRNA movement in mouse cells; they have previously engineered an actin gene with multiple MS2 coat protein binding sites in the 3'UTR, allowing binding of an expressed fluorescent MS2 coat in high copy for sensitivity. Using this mRNA, they can track temporally the spatial localization of the mRNA. They have done this previously, and noted different populations of mRNAs with different diffusion times. Here they use a second color in their microscopy, and by labeling ribosomal large subunits, can correlate mRNAs with ribosomes. Their results show quite clearly that ribosome occupancy is correlated with slower diffusion and localization to focal points where actin synthesis is high. The data are rigorously analyzed (and quite nicely using multiple models including a sophisticated HMM-Baysian approach. In short, I really liked this manuscript."

To my knowledge, this is the first in vivo examination of the coupled behavior of ribosomes and mRNAs, and as such, deserves publication in eLife. The authors use their developed methods to examine mRNA movement in mouse cells; they have previously engineered an actin gene with multiple MS2 coat protein binding sites in the 3'UTR, allowing binding of an expressed fluorescent MS2 coat in high copy for sensitivity. Using this mRNA, they can track temporally the spatial localization of the mRNA. They have done this previously, and noted different populations of mRNAs with different diffusion times. Here they use a second color in their microscopy, and by labeling ribosomal large subunits, can correlate mRNAs with ribosomes. Their results show quite clearly that ribosome occupancy is correlated with slower diffusion and localization to focal points where actin synthesis is high. The data are rigorously analyzed (and quite nicely using multiple models including a sophisticated HMM-Baysian approach. In short, I really liked this manuscript.</i> "

Since I view this manuscript as foundational to many future studies, this change is essential.</i> "

We have also altered our estimation of translation initiation. We note that the data to estimate this value was based on a population study (Schwanhausser et al., Nature 2011) and therefore the quoted number might be different from our single-molecule data: their values were calculated based on total populations of proteins and mRNAs, which would include non-translating species such as nuclear mRNAs."
