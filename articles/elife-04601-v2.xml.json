The most common membrane constriction system in prokaryotes is based on the tubulin homologue FtsZ, whose filaments in <i>E. coli</i> are anchored to the membrane by FtsA and enable the formation of the Z-ring and divisome. The precise architecture of the FtsZ ring has remained enigmatic. In this study, we report three-dimensional arrangements of FtsZ and FtsA filaments in <i>C. crescentus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> cells and inside constricting liposomes by means of electron cryomicroscopy and cryotomography. In vivo and in vitro, the Z-ring is composed of a small, single-layered band of filaments parallel to the membrane, creating a continuous ring through lateral filament contacts. Visualisation of the in vitro reconstituted constrictions as well as a complete tracing of the helical paths of the filaments with a molecular model favour a mechanism of FtsZ-based membrane constriction that is likely to be accompanied by filament sliding."

The most common membrane constriction system in prokaryotes is based on the tubulin homologue FtsZ, whose filaments in <i>E. coli</i> are anchored to the membrane by FtsA and enable the formation of the Z-ring and divisome. The precise architecture of the FtsZ ring has remained enigmatic. In this study, we report three-dimensional arrangements of FtsZ and FtsA filaments in <i>C. crescentus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> cells and inside constricting liposomes by means of electron cryomicroscopy and cryotomography. In vivo and in vitro, the Z-ring is composed of a small, single-layered band of filaments parallel to the membrane, creating a continuous ring through lateral filament contacts. Visualisation of the in vitro reconstituted constrictions as well as a complete tracing of the helical paths of the filaments with a molecular model favour a mechanism of FtsZ-based membrane constriction that is likely to be accompanied by filament sliding."

These findings suggest that these two ring components by themselves are able to generate both the structures and force required for cell constriction.

During prokaryotic cell division the cell membrane and the cell envelope constrict, eventually leading to cell separation. In most bacteria and archaea, this is guided by a ring structure containing the bacterial tubulin homologue FtsZ protein (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">L\u00f6we and Amos, 1998</a>), which polymerises in a GTP-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1994</a>). During constriction, the FtsZ ring decreases in diameter through an unknown mechanism. The C-terminal tail of FtsZ links it to other components of the divisome, an ensemble of many proteins that facilitates essential functions during the cell division process, most importantly remodelling of the cell envelope. Components of the divisome engage in cell wall synthesis (PBPs), synchronisation with chromosome dimer resolution (FtsK), lipid II cell wall precursor flipping (FtsW or MurJ), and many components currently have no known function (reviews: <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Errington, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lutkenhaus et al., 2012</a>)."

FtsA is a bacterial actin-like protein that forms domain-swapped, canonical actin-like protofilaments that are membrane associated through FtsA's C-terminal amphipathic helix (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">van den Ent and L\u00f6we, 2000</a>). Several cellular regulatory processes influence the onset and progression of cell division through mechanisms that directly act on FtsZ. For example, SulA is induced during the SOS stress response and sequesters monomers, stopping FtsZ polymerisation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). In <i>E. coli,</i> both nucleoid occlusion and the oscillating, pole-protecting MinCDE system contain components that inhibit FtsZ function within the ring directly (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernhardt and de Boer, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dajkovic et al., 2008</a>)."

Essentially, three different approaches have been taken to validate the models: in vivo imaging of FtsZ constrictions using fluorescently labelled proteins. Electron cryotomography of frozen hydrated cells without labelling and, thirdly, in vitro reconstitution experiments with pure, fluorescently labelled proteins. The most recent results emanating from those studies are that the rings appear to show strong fluorescence intensity variations that may suggest that the FtsZ ring is discontinuous (<a href=\"#bib19\">Holden et al., 2014</a>). Equally, tomography data have been interpreted to show scattered individual FtsZ filaments, some precise distance away from the membrane (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Reconstitution experiments with FtsZ and FtsA showed dynamic behaviour and liposome constrictions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Osawa and Erickson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Loose and Mitchison, 2014</a>).

When a log-phase culture was plunge-frozen and imaged, many dividing cells could be found. At the division sites, a series of dots arranged in a single line were found (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top). Careful analysis of cellular tomograms (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom) revealed that the dots were in fact 2D projections of filamentous structures encircling the cell and likely forming a continuous ring, disrupted in the images at the top and bottom by the missing wedge of the tomography method. The filaments were at a distance of 15 \u00b1 2 nm from the inner membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2007</a>). The long-standing problem of the missing wedge in electron tomography caused by our current inability to tilt the specimen much beyond 65\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom, white triangle, see also <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for more details on the missing wedge problem related to this study) makes it impossible to follow features all the way around the cell's perimeter. It is important to note, however, that the protein filaments are visible and uninterrupted everywhere the missing wedge allows it, as can be gauged from the disappearance of the cell membrane and envelope (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We could detect the filamentous rings in 20 out of 28 dividing cells after tomography. Of the 8 without obvious filamentous structures, the division had progressed too far in 3 and 5 were of poor quality because of the cell's orientation with respect to the tilt axis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, the finding of complete rings is supported by the fact that perfect coincidence of any hypothetical gaps in constricting rings with the missing wedges in all of the analysed tomograms, found after all in entirely random orientations, would be remarkably implausible."

(<b>J</b>) Removing the C-terminal FtsA-binding sequence of FtsZ renders it unable to maintain a fixed distance to the IM and FtsZ filaments that were observed within the cytoplasm. (<b>K</b>) Removing the C-terminal flexible linker of FtsZ makes it prone to form multiple layers of filaments that form complete rings or helices. Tomography using this construct works better because it produces small minicells. (<b>L</b>) A closer inspection of the area marked with the black arrowhead in G shows beads along the filament as illustrated by the schematic drawing with a repeat distance of 4 nm as expected for FtsZ filaments.

(<b>A</b>) Simulation of the effects of the missing wedge. Modified from <a href=\"#bib45\">Palmer and L\u00f6we, (2013)</a>. A phantom image resembling a cell envelope was reconstructed for a full \u00b190\u00b0 range and a \u00b160\u00b0 range, the latter being typical for tilt series acquisition. (<b>B</b>) Schematic drawings explaining the angle (blue) between the tilt axis (red) and the cell axis (black dashed line) and the missing wedge angle (green). The former can be anything between 0 and 90\u00b0, whereas the latter can be anything between 0 and 180\u00b0. Tilt series for the <i>C. crescentus</i> study (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>) were obtained using the \u00b165\u00b0 range. (<b>C</b>) Examples of the effects of different orientations of cells in the microscope with respect to the tilt axis on the missing wedge. Cells that were aligned with the tilt axis produced the most complete tomograms since the cell thickness stayed constant over the angular range. High tilts of those perpendicular to the tilt axis did not provide any useful information since the effective cell thickness in the electron beam increased. Shown are projections along the long axis of the cell. It is important to note that the angle between the tilt axis and the longitudinal axis of the cell is crucial in order to obtain high quality tilt series, other factors such as cell thickness, ice thickness, and membrane invagination progression also affect the quality of the resulting tomograms significantly.

(a) Introducing extra amino acids into the flexible linker (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buske and Levin, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gardner et al., 2013</a>) within FtsZ that separates the globular N-terminal domain of FtsZ from the small C-terminal helix that binds FtsZ's membrane anchor, FtsA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ma and Margolin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>), increased the distance between the FtsZ ring and the IM from 16 nm to a somewhat variable 16\u201321 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013C</a>). (b) Removing the C-terminal FtsA-interacting helix and replacing it with a membrane-targeting sequence (mts) from MinD protein (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2003</a>) shortened the distance from the IM to 10 nm. No constrictions of the cells were observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>). Therefore, despite it having been used in earlier studies (<a href=\"#bib40\">Osawa et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Osawa and Erickson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Loose and Mitchison, 2014</a>), we agree with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib40\">Osawa et al., 2008</a>) that this construct is non-functional in vivo and we did not include it in our subsequent in vitro investigations below. (c) Removing the C-terminal FtsA-interacting helix from FtsZ detached the filaments from the membrane, making them appear throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4E</a>). (d) Finally, removing most amino acids between the C-terminal FtsA-interacting helix and the globular body of FtsZ caused a minicell phenotype. Because of their size, minicells produce tomograms of higher quality and it was possible to determine the longitudinal subunit repeat of the filaments to be around 4 nm, very close to the expected value of 4.2 nm for FtsZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K and L</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Erickson et al., 1996</a>). We conclude that the filament localisations reacted to our perturbations as expected for FtsZ and the subunit repeat was the same as for all known FtsZ protofilaments. The minicell tomogram (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>) is another indication that the filaments most likely encircle entire cells."

Providing just these two proteins in excess (twofold to fourfold total vs WT) produced a severe phenotype with many extra constrictions visible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Since in these cells the normal FtsZ to FtsA ratio had been altered to be close to 1:1, from normally 5 FtsZ:1 FtsA (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rueda et al., 2003</a>), FtsA filaments became visible at the constricting division sites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>).

We avoided fluorescently tagged proteins as they have been shown to introduce artefacts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Margolin, 2012</a>). We therefore used completely unmodified TmFtsZ and TmFtsA proteins from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i>, both of which are easy to obtain and handle and have crystal structures available (<a href=\"#bib39\">Oliva et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">van den Ent and L\u00f6we, 2000</a>). It should be noted that extra care had to be taken in order to obtain proteins that did not have their disordered but important C-terminal tails cleaved during purification. Just to confirm that TmFtsZ and TmFtsA formed structures similar to the <i>E. coli</i> counterparts in vivo, we over-expressed TmFtsZ and TmFtsA in <i>E. coli</i> and imaged the sample by electron cryotomography (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Minicells were formed and, at constriction sites, they contained filaments that closely resembled the filament arrangement observed here for <i>E. coli</i> FtsA and FtsZ over-expression in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The distance of TmFtsZ to the IM was shorter at 12 nm; this was expected because the linker between the very C-terminal TmFtsA-interacting helix and the body of TmFtsZ is much shorter, measuring around nine amino acids. Minicell formation might indicate that TmFtsA and TmFtsZ interacted with the <i>E. coli</i> cell division machinery or even supported membrane constriction on their own, but we did not investigate this further."

Reactions containing liposomes and proteins, as indicated, were vitrified and imaged by conventional 2D transmission electron cryomicroscopy. When no protein was added, the liposomes appeared as almost perfect circles (spheres in projection) and the bilayers were clearly visible as a double line, 5 nm apart (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, top, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). The addition of TmFtsA alone led to the formation of an additional layer, probably consisting of only partly polymerised protein, and no strong deformations were observed. TmFtsZ alone did not cause deformations or generation of an additional layer (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). But when both TmFtsA and TmFtsZ were added, two extra layers, in addition to the liposome bilayer, became visible (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Particularly in the presence of nucleotide, strong negative curvature was induced, leading to deformations of the liposomes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As was suggested previously, the co-polymerisation of FtsZ and FtsA will lead to bending and curvature because the subunit repeat lengths of FtsZ and FtsA are roughly 4 and 5 nm, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>).

Lowering of the detergent concentration by dilution led to spontaneous liposome formation with most of the proteins on the inside.

The liposomes were around 300 nm in diameter, similar to that of a small bacterial cell. The protein filaments were arranged into three distinct structures: arcs that were mostly single filaments, presumably formed by the co-polymerisation of TmFtsZ and TmFtsA, showing the characteristic curvature caused by the repeat mismatch (<a href=\"#bib54\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>); spirals with decreasing curvature that appeared in perfectly spherical areas of the liposomes; and rings of filaments, appearing as bands in projection, formed around liposome constriction sites, with varying diameters. It is very important to note that constrictions only appeared where there were rings of filaments. Filaments within the liposomes had very different curvatures, for example in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, filaments seemed to go round the liposome at a very large diameter, compared to the ones in the constriction zone further to the left."

The FtsA filaments were again sandwiched between the liposome membrane and the FtsZ filaments, just as in the images obtained with <i>E. coli</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,G</a>). The architecture is easily explained with TmFtsA-binding to the inside of the liposome membrane via its amphipathic helix, presumably polymerising, and FtsZ polymerising on top of FtsA, binding to it via its C-terminal FtsA-binding peptide (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>). Nucleotide presence had some influence on the appearance of these constricted liposomes as GTP addition produced the most bilobed liposomes. Constriction itself, however, was largely nucleotide hydrolysis independent since not adding any nucleotide produced constrictions as well, and they appeared even tighter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Therefore, despite not being strictly required for constriction, we believe that the nucleotide only has an influence on the appearance thereof and this might be due to the fact that FtsZ forms much longer filaments with polymerisation-inducing GTP added and this would enable the filaments to span larger liposomes when the process starts. Given that TmFtsZ is a hyperthermophilic protein, significant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is not expected."

Because contrast was very high, the ring of filaments could be traced in most tomograms all around the inside of the liposome and this revealed that the filaments were not totally equidistant and often came into contact. This was also true for the in vivo situation in <i>C. crescentus</i> (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) where the distance between the filaments (grey arrow) changes around the ring.

When the filaments were investigated end-on, they appeared to always be arranged close to 90\u00b0 with respect to the liposome membrane tangent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which was also observed for the filaments in cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,G</a>). All of these features are best demonstrated in <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>, which provides an overview of the constriction and filament architectures and should be consulted to appreciate these findings properly."

Note that our images derived from tomographic volume data have not been segmented, they are volume representations of the actual 3D tomographic data. Arcs (also on the outside) are filaments made of both FtsA and FtsZ, whose curvature is determined by the mismatch in TmFtsA and TmFtsZ polymers subunit spacing (5 nm vs 4 nm, see also <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> &amp; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Dome-like structures are slightly helical spirals of condensing TmFtsZ filaments attached to the membrane by TmFtsA. Importantly, only complete rings seem capable of constriction force generation. The ring might consist of overlapping filaments (as in the stereo view and <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>) or maybe a continuous helix of double filaments (bottom panel, middle liposome with black arrowheads, see also <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>).

Normally, there is around five times more FtsZ in cells than FtsA, therefore only a few FtsA molecules may be sandwiched in between the IM and FtsZ filaments (which form more easily than FtsA filaments), upper panel. As curvature increases, the mismatch of the FtsA (orange) and FtsZ (grey) repeats (5 vs 4 nm, respectively) makes it possible to add more FtsA since the double filament \u2018wants\u2019 to bend. Full occupancy of both FtsA and FtsZ in the double filament leads to a curvature of about 60 nm. This mechanism could be another source of energy for constriction in addition to or alternative to the condensation energy gained from filament overlap (mechanism <b>B</b>) in the discussion."

A more detailed view using sphere representation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) shows, again, that the filaments within a ring were not exactly equidistant (black arrows) but came into direct contact only at certain points. Fitting the FtsA crystal structure into the map as well revealed two closely associated filaments and showed that the outline fit of the tomographic density is extremely good, although exact orientations and locations of the subunits along the filament of the molecules can only be guessed in most places given the resolution limit. It should be noted, though, that peaks appear in many places indicating the centre positions of individual FtsZ molecules (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2013source data 1</a>, a PyMOL session file)."

It consists of at least four individual filaments (right, atoms shown as spheres) with varying lateral interfilament distances (right, atoms shown as spheres, black arrows). (<b>C</b>) FtsZ filaments are single protofilaments, but they tend to pair in doublets. A precision manual fit of the TmFtsA polymer crystal structure (PDB 4A2B) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>) in addition to 3VO8 FtsZ polymer crystal structure was performed in a region of very good density. The fit is excellent and dimensions and distances match well with CcFtsZ, EcFtsZ, and TmFtsAZ in vivo situations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,E, 2E,G</a>). (<b>D</b>) Left: in the ring-like structures (black), force (red arrows) is perpendicular to the membrane (blue), leading to constriction. Middle: during constriction, the ring develops into two helical spirals, leading to forces pushing membrane inwards, and this might explain how abscission is accomplished since membranes will presumably not fuse while the protein filaments are in between (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> bottom right and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a> for an example of this in liposomes). Right: the domes we observed do not deform liposomes because the force generated is almost perfectly tangential to the membrane. (<b>E</b>) Constriction force generation and filament sliding. In the discussion, three different energy sources for constriction are listed: maximising filament overlap, repeat mismatch within FtsA\u2013FtsZ copolymers (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and filament shortening and turnover due to nucleotide hydrolysis by FtsAZ. While it is currently not obvious which of these or if a combination of the three mechanisms drives constriction, it seems clear to us that constriction, at least in the liposome reconstitution experiments, requires filaments to slide past each other as is depicted in two dimensions. Since also unmodified wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) show closed continuous rings at division sites, we would assume the same holds true in vivo. Filament sliding can also explain the spirals on lipid monolayers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and spirals in the dome-like structures with liposomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The schematic drawn is a simplification into two dimensions, of course, in vivo and in vitro FtsZ filaments overlap in the third dimension, forming single-layered bands since each filament is anchored to the membrane."

Given that the filament architectures observed here in <i>C. crescentus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> and in constricting liposomes are so similar, we would suggest that the model we propose should be valid for both in vitro and in vivo, at least at some primordial level. FtsA forms (partial) filaments between the membrane and FtsZ filaments, and the filaments together encircle the constriction site while forming a single-layered small band of filaments. The entire structure is slightly helical, and shorter filaments overlap to form a continuous, closed ring."

Previous analysis of <i>C. crescentus</i> cells by cryo-ET also showed that the FtsZ ring consists of overlapping filaments inside the inner membrane, although not all cells showed continuous rings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Equally, results obtained with super resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques (<a href=\"#bib19\">Holden et al., 2014</a>) showed punctuated fluorescence, possibly indicating non-continuous rings. We think it is important to point out that fluorescence microscopy only images the labelled species and intensity fluctuations within the ring may have arisen from using non-functional GFP fusions and/or their over-expression. Or fluctuations coming from overlapping filaments may have been over-emphasised during image analysis because of very low signal-to-noise. Unfortunately, currently, cellular tomography data are too weak to be able to trace individual filaments and their ends with confidence, so we have no direct evidence from our in vivo data for the length of individual FtsZ filaments making up continuous rings."

This has been proposed before to be theoretically sufficient for the constriction process (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lan et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The lateral spacing of 6.5\u20138 nm between filaments we report here is slightly larger than the thickness of FtsZ filaments and presumably also FtsA filaments (<a href=\"#bib35\">Matsui et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Szwedziak et al., 2012</a>). Previous in vitro work reported an interfilament distance of 5 nm using FtsZ-mts; however, this was after negative staining and dehydration and no constrictions were observed, possibly due to lateral interactions being too tight (<a href=\"#bib36\">Milam et al., 2012</a>). In <i>C. crescentus</i> cells, the lateral spacing between filaments was found to be 9.3 nm previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2007</a>)(<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2007</a>) and we report here distances of \u223c7.8 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) in <i>C. crescentus</i> and \u223c6.8 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) in <i>E. coli.</i> AFM using only FtsZ, but observing spiral condensation, provided an even larger distance of 12 nm (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mingorance et al., 2005</a>). All of these measurements are averages with large variances. One may conclude that the filaments in the FtsZ ring interact transiently and direct contact is localised to only a few small regions within the ring at a time. This could facilitate the constriction process since the filaments have to be free to slide. It was suggested previously that instead of forming many intermolecular solid bonds, which would lead to avidity and a barrier to sliding, an attractive force over a longer distance would keep the filaments apart while interacting (<a href=\"#bib20\">H\u00f6rger et al., 2008</a>). This is more akin to the liquid state of matter, where many transient homotypic interactions, counteracted by thermal motion, lead to a fluid situation without absolute order but still keeping the molecules together."

We speculate that when constriction starts at large diameters (1 \u00b5m in <i>E. coli</i>), longer GTP-induced FtsZ filaments are needed to reach reliably around the cell in order to produce overlap for the ring and 'force engagement' to start the process. However, increasing overlap, developing as the constriction progresses, might lead to a kinetic barrier of sliding through avidity and the filaments would then have to be shortened. Formally this provides a third possible driver of constriction, at least for large constriction distances."

However, it has been reported that the GTP hydrolysis-deficient FtsZ(D212G) mutant generates prominent constrictions of tubular liposomes in vitro (<a href=\"#bib43\">Osawa and Erickson, 2011</a>) and functions in cell division in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Trusca et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Osawa and Erickson, 2006</a>).

So far, wall-less bacterial L-forms have not shed light on this interdependence of cell wall synthesis and the FtsZ ring since artificial L-forms were found to divide by blebbing, most likely a mechanism that is not actively supported by cellular machinery (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leaver et al., 2009</a>). FtsZ-based cell division is not functioning in these L-forms and we suggest this may be because L-forms are too large for Z-rings to close, given the amounts of FtsAZ present."

That is actually about half the filaments shown in the figures. This claim should therefore be re-examined and clarified. The text further claims that the lack of complete rings in several cells could be explained by their orientation with respect to the tilt axis. A single sentence should be added simply listing the angular orientations of the cells with and without apparently complete rings so readers can see how consistent the trend is. Representative tomographic volumes should be deposited in a suitable database upon publication."

FtsZ and FtsA will co-polymerise, until the repeat mismatch makes that energetically unfavourable at a given bending angle (curvature). This 'desire' to continue to polymerise leads to further bending and we would propose that there will first be short stretches of FtsA that then elongate when fully constricted (panel 1F might show a bit of FtsA filaments, actually, since there are additional filaments at 8 nm distance from the membrane)."
