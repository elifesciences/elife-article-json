Diffuse invasion of the brain parenchyma, including along preexisting blood vessels, is a leading cause of therapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that ephrin-B2 mediates GSC perivascular invasion. Intravital imaging, coupled with mechanistic studies in murine GBM models and patient-derived GSC, revealed that endothelial ephrin-B2 compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells. In contrast, upregulation of the same ephrin-B2 ligand in GSC enabled perivascular migration through homotypic forward signalling. Surprisingly, ephrin-B2 reverse signalling also promoted tumourigenesis cell-autonomously, by mediating anchorage-independent cytokinesis via RhoA. In human GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts, <i>EFNB2</i> knock-down blocked tumour initiation and treatment of established tumours with ephrin-B2-blocking antibodies suppressed progression. Thus, our results indicate that targeting ephrin-B2 may be an effective strategy for the simultaneous inhibition of invasion and proliferation in GBM."

Diffuse invasion of the brain parenchyma, including along preexisting blood vessels, is a leading cause of therapeutic resistance, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that ephrin-B2 mediates GSC perivascular invasion. Intravital imaging, coupled with mechanistic studies in murine GBM models and patient-derived GSC, revealed that endothelial ephrin-B2 compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells. In contrast, upregulation of the same ephrin-B2 ligand in GSC enabled perivascular migration through homotypic forward signalling. Surprisingly, ephrin-B2 reverse signalling also promoted tumourigenesis cell-autonomously, by mediating anchorage-independent cytokinesis via RhoA. In human GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts, <i>EFNB2</i> knock-down blocked tumour initiation and treatment of established tumours with ephrin-B2-blocking antibodies suppressed progression. Thus, our results indicate that targeting ephrin-B2 may be an effective strategy for the simultaneous inhibition of invasion and proliferation in GBM."

Ephrins are found on the surface of both tumor cells and blood vessels. Normally, the blood vessels use these proteins to block the spread of normal brain cells. However, tumor cells override this normal anti-tumor mechanism and become able to spread along the blood vessels."

Using antibodies to block ephrin-B2 in tumors greatly reduced tumor size and extended survival in mice with glioblastoma tumors.

In addition, GBM contain subpopulations of cells with stem cell properties termed glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC), which are able to self-renew, differentiate into tumour-bulk cells and reconstitute a phenocopy of the original lesion upon transplantation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Venere et al., 2011</a>). It is therefore increasingly recognized that GSC are critical players in tumour initiation and progression. Furthermore, GSC were shown to be intrinsically resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy and more invasive than non-stem tumour cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Venere et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sadahiro et al., 2014</a>).

Invasion along the perivascular space is a favourable migration route because endothelial cells secrete chemoattractants, which actively recruit tumour cells to the vasculature (<a href=\"#bib67\">Montana and Sontheimer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cuddapah et al., 2014</a>). In addition, the perivascular space is enriched in migration-promoting ECM components and is fluid-filled, thereby opposing little physical resistance to invading tumour cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Gritsenko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cuddapah et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, within GBM, GSC are particularly prone to perivascular invasion, likely due to their similarities with normal neural progenitors, which preferentially migrate along blood vessels during development and after injury in the adult (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cuddapah et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Watkins et al., 2014</a>). In agreement with this, GSC reside in perivascular niches and the majority of invading cells migrate along the host vasculature in xenograft GSC models of both mouse and human origin (<a href=\"#bib29\">Farin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zagzag et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Calabrese et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Winkler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Watkins et al., 2014</a>)."

Vascular co-option plays crucial roles during initial tumour growth, seeding of satellite lesions and tumour recurrence following therapy. Second, association with the perivascular niche provides GSC with important self-renewal and survival signals, which support GSC tumour-propagating abilities and therapeutic resistance (<a href=\"#bib14\">Charles and Holland, 2010</a>). Therefore, interactions with the vasculature, particularly within the GSC compartment, are critical throughout gliomagenesis and were indeed proposed as promising therapeutic targets for GBM treatment, but the mechanisms remain poorly defined (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cuddapah et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vehlow and Cordes, 2013</a>)."

However, GSC also significantly differ from their normal counterparts, in that they harbour transforming mutations that drive their tumourigenic properties, including deregulated proliferation and increased invasiveness (<a href=\"#bib28\">Engstrom et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, the comparison of GSC carrying known mutations to otherwise genetically matched normal NSC, should inform disease mechanisms, enable genotype-phenotype correlation and may identify new therapeutic targets for GBM."

Using this system, we identified ephrin-B2 as a critical driver of perivascular invasion. ephrin-B2 is a member of the Eph/ephrin family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-bound ligands, a fundamental cell communication system with widespread roles in tissue development, maintenance and disease (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pasquale, 2010</a>). Activation of Eph receptors by ephrin ligands on adjacent cells modulates cell behaviour, including migration, proliferation and stemness, by eliciting forward signalling downstream of Ephs and reverse signalling downstream of ephrins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kullander and Klein, 2002</a>). Deregulation of the Eph/ephrin system contributes to the pathogenesis of many types of cancer, including GBM (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pasquale, 2010</a>).

In contrast, transformation to GSC-like cells overrides this tumour-suppressive mechanism to drive perivascular invasion. We show that this is caused by upregulation in GSC-like cells of the same ephrin-B2 ligand, which desensitizes the cells to vascular confinement by constitutively activating Eph forward signalling non-cell-autonomously. Furthermore, we discovered that ephrin-B2 reverse signaling also elicits tumour cell proliferation in the absence of normal anchorage signals by driving Rho-A-dependent cytokinesis in a cell-autonomous manner. Consistent with these important roles, ephrin-B2 overexpression was sufficient to fully transform immortalised NSC to the same extent as oncogenic Ras. In human GBM specimens, high Ephrin-B2 levels were detected in perivascular tumour cells with GSC features at the infiltrative tumour margin, indicative of a role in the GSC compartment in primary tumours. Remarkably, <i>EFNB2</i> knock-down in primary human GSC isolated from patient material or treatment of established tumours derived from these GSC with anti-ephrin-B2 single chain blocking antibodies strongly suppressed tumourigenesis, by concomitantly inhibiting vascular association and proliferation. Thus, ephrin-B2 may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of GBM."

We used two complementary strategies for this. First, we used a \u2018classical\u2019 transformation paradigm previously shown to drive gliomagenesis in vivo, whereby NSC were immortalised with SV40 large-T antigen (imNSC1) and transformed with RasV12 (herein referred to as GSC1) to inactivate <i>Trp53</i> and <i>Rb</i>, and mimic the increased Ras signalling that results from <i>Nf1</i> loss, respectively (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blouw et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hahn et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sonoda et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Huszthy et al., 2012</a>). This approach allowed us to readily test candidate effectors by transforming NSCs isolated from mice carrying the specific mutation, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blouw et al., 2003</a>). In the second approach, we induced transformation by defined genetic changes in the same pathways to rule out artifacts of oncogene overexpression. <i>Nf1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> NSCs were immortalised with p53 shRNAs and ectopic CDK4 to inactivate p53 and the p16/RB axis, respectively (imNSC2), and transformed by Cre-mediated <i>Nf1</i> deletion (herein referred to as GSC2)."

In contrast, GSC1 and GSC2 retained stem cell properties in vitro as judged by high clonal efficiency in neurosphere culture and differentiation into glial and neuronal lineages upon mitogen withdrawal (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013c</a>). Furthermore, both cell types (but not their immortalised controls) formed colonies in soft agar (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c,d</a>) and gave rise to highly aggressive tumours upon intracranial transplantation in immunocompromised mice (5/5 animals, 100% penetrance, median survival 24d for GSC1 and 38.5 for GSC2), whereas GSC1 also did so in syngeneic animals (5/9 animals, 56% penetrance, median survival 73d), indicative of a more aggressive phenotype. Consistent with their stem-like properties, clonal dilution experiments revealed that as little as 100 cells of either line was sufficient to generate aggressive tumours (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). Importantly, the tumours recapitulated the histopathology and gene expression signatures of human GBM, including presence of necrosis, neovascularization, nestin and Sox2 expression and a\u00a0strong enrichment in the Verhaak mesenchymal subtype gene signature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a\u2013d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kleihues, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Verhaak et al., 2010</a>).

GFP-labeled GSC1 or imNSC1 were injected at a mimimum depth of 150\u2013200 \u03bcm into the cortex of syngeneic recipients under a chronic cranial window and 5\u20137 days later their migration in relation to Dextran-TxRed-labeled blood vessels was imaged over a period of 6\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e,f</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Holtmaat et al., 2009</a>). Although imNSC do not form tumors long-term, the cells were still present, viable and migratory at this time-point, as indicated by morphology and motility outside of the perivascular space. Consistent with previous reports, both cell types readily associated to the vasculature (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kokovay et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Farin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nagano et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Watkins et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Winkler et al., 2009</a>). However, while individual GSC1 migrated out of the tumour mass along blood vessels, resulting in cell scattering, imNSC remained in stationary groups (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e,f</a>). GSC1 perivascular migration was independent of their position relative to the tumour bulk or cell density, with single cells migrating from the main tumour as efficiently and at similar speed as GSC1 migrating at a distance from the tumour margin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1h</a>). Similarly, rare sparse imNSC further away from the tumour margin failed to migrate along blood vessels (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1h</a>). Importantly, this effect was not due to a general impaiment in imNSC migration, as these cells migrated to a similar extent as GSC in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1i</a>). This suggests that signals from the vasculature compartmentalises non-tumourigenic cells to restrict their migration, whereas transformation overrides these signals to enable perivascular spread."

                                "text": "To test this more directly and identify potential effectors, we developed an in vitro cell migration assay that mimics the response of infiltrating GBM cells to initial contact with endothelial cells. We seeded both imNSC/GSC models and primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (bmvEC) in separate wells of culture inserts and assessed migration of the two cell types towards each other following insert removal by time-lapse microscopy. Remarkably, this assay closely recapitulated in vivo migratory patterns, in that endothelial cells strongly repelled and compartmentalised imNSC forming a sharp boundary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Similar effects were observed with normal NSC, indicating that compartmentalisation is not caused by immortalisation, but rather reflects the response of normal cells to the vasculature (not shown). In contrast, GSC1 were refractory to compartmentalisation and migrated over the endothelial monolayer, giving rise to an uneven and longer boundary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The behavior of GSC2 was identical to GSC1, confirming that it is a general property of transformed cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h</a>). Eph/ephrin signalling is one of most important mediators of cell-cell contact-dependent boundary formation and we reported that endothelial ephrin-B2, the most abundant ephrin-B2 in the endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1j</a>), induces cell sorting of normal NSC (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cayuso et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ottone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gale et al., 2001</a>). We therefore tested the role of ephrin-B2 in endothelial-induced compartmentalisation by assessing imNSC1 migration towards recombinant ephrin-B2-Fc. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1i</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>, ephrin-B2-Fc compartmentalised imNSCs, but not GSC, to the same extent as endothelial cells. This effect was highly specific and was not due to general differences in migration between imNSC and GSC cells because imNSC migrated onto Fc peptides, ephrin-A1 or ephrin-A5-Fc ligands to a similar extent as GSC cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1i</a>). Conversely, <i>Efnb2</i> knock-down in endothelial cells disrupted boundary formation against imNSC, indicating that endothelial ephrin-B2 is both necessary and sufficient for compartmentalisation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1j</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1j</a>)."

Normal NSC controls were included to rule out p53 and Rb-dependent changes unrelated to perivascular migration. We found that p53 and Rb inactivation did not change Eph/ephrin expression substantially. In contrast, elevated Ras signalling, triggered by either RasV12 expression or <i>Nf1</i> loss, strongly downregulated three Ephs (<i>Epha4, Ephb1</i> and <i>Ephb2</i>) and upregulated two ephrins (<i>Efna5</i> and <i>Efnb2</i>) in both models. However, western analysis indicated that of these genes, only <i>Ephb1</i>, <i>Ephb</i>2 and <i>Efnb2</i> changed significantly at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) and were thus further assessed in migration assays against ephrin-B2-Fc. Surprisingly, we found that re-introduction of <i>Ephb1</i> or <i>Ephb2</i> by overexpression in GSC1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) did not affect migration towards recombinant ephrin-B2-Fc, indicating that changes in the complement of Eph receptors do not underlie unimpeded migration, as in other systems (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Astin et al., 2010</a>). Instead, genetic deletion of <i>Efnb2</i> in GSC1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>) fully rescued boundary formation in response to ephrin-B2-Fc and endothelial cells in vitro and blocked perivascular migration in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013e</a>). Conversely, <i>Efnb2</i> overexpression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>) conferred imNSC1 with the ability to migrate over recombinant ephrin-B2 and a cultured endothelium and to escape vascular compartmentalisation in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013e</a>). Together, these results show that ephrin-B2 upregulation downstream of Ras underlies GSC evasion of ephrin-B2-mediated endothelial repulsion and invasion along the vasculature."

We noticed that, although all GSC cells eventually migrated over ephrin-B2-Fc, a proportion of the cells (~20%) are repelled on first contact (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). Repelled cells invariably migrated towards ephrin-B2-Fc either as single cells or in small groups (&lt;2 contacts), whereas non-repelled cells migrated in larger groups (&gt;3 contacts) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). This was not the case in imNSC cultures, where all cells were equally repelled, regardless of the number of homotypic cell-cell interactions at initial contact. This suggested that homotypic cell-cell interactions among GSC, mediated by intrinsic ephrin-B2, might underpin evasion of extrinsic ephrin-B2 repulsion. To test this, we repeated the migration assay under conditions that disrupt GSC cell-cell contacts by inhibiting cadherin-based junctions (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ottone et al., 2014</a>). Both culture in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> media and dominant-negative N-cadherin overexpression completely disrupted cell-cell junctions without affecting cell motility (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>)\u00a0and blocked GSC migration over ephrin-B2 ligands, indicating that homotypic cell-cell interactions are specifically required (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>)."

Ectopic expression of a C-terminal truncated form of ephrin-B2 (\u0394C<i>Efnb2</i>), which lacks reverse signalling (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pfaff et al., 2008</a>), promoted imNSC migration over ephrin-B2-Fc to the same extent as full-length <i>Efnb2</i>, demonstrating that forward signalling between neighboring cells is responsible (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). Indeed, western analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>) indicated that while imNSC controls displayed low basal levels of activated Eph receptors (p-Eph), GSC exhinited constitutively high levels of p-Eph, despite their reduced levels of EphB1 and EphB2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) and no increase in other ephrin-B2 receptors in these cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> and not shown). High basal p-Eph could be mimicked by ephrin-B2 overexpression in imNSC and reduced to basal control levels by culture in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). In addition, the high phosphorylation levels of Ephs in GSC appeared to be saturating, as, in contrast to imNSC, co-culture with endothelial cells or treatment with recombinant ephrin-B2 failed to further activate Eph receptors in these cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). Importantly, Eph desensitization was again entirely dependent on endogenous ephrin-B2 because genetic deletion of <i>Efnb2</i> in GSC fully restored Eph stimulation by exogenous ephrin-B2. Consistent with the known ability of Ephs to trigger repulsion (<a href=\"#bib3\">Astin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pasquale, 2010</a>), such high basal levels of activated Eph resulted in GSC undergoing much greater scattering and faster migration than imNSC following homotypic collisions in sparse monocultures, in an ephrin-B2-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c,d</a>). Thus, high ephrin-B2 levels in GSC result in constitutive activation of Eph forward signalling and desensitization to exogenous stimulation."

Parallel Fc-treated cultures served as controls. Remarkably, we found that ephrin-B2-Fc (but not Fc) pretreatment enabled migration over the ephrin-B2 boundary, confirming that activation of Eph forward signaling on first contact with exogenous ephrin-B2 is the mechanism involved. In agreement with these findings, immunofluorescence analysis of GSC1-derived orthotopic tumours revealed high pEph levels in cells migrating along blood vessels at the tumour edge, indicating that constitutive forward signaling also contributes to perivascular invasion in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>)."

We used immunocompromised mice for these experiments because the incomplete tumour penetrance of GSC in syngeneic animals precludes rigorous assessment of their tumourigenicity in the syngeneic model. Strikingly, quantitative imaging and survival analysis revealed that, while imNSC1 did not form tumours and GSC1 formed tumours at full penetrance, <i>Efnb2</i> deletion strongly suppressed GSC1 tumour growth and, conversely, <i>Efnb2</i> overexpression was sufficient to fully transform imNSC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,b</a>). Specifically, imNSC1-<i>Efnb2</i> tumours resulted in a similar median survival as GSC1 (28d). In contrast, all imNSC animals survived tumour-free beyond 200 days and 7 out of 9 animals of the GSC1<i>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></i>cohort developed lesions with much slower kinetics, while the remaining 2 mice remained tumour-free, as confirmed by post-mortem examination. These effects were not due to a general loss of stem-like properties due to ephrin-B2 deletion, as clonal efficiency remained unaffected in GSC<i>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>).

Consistent with our results in vivo , the majority of imNSC1 and GSC1 <i>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></i> remained as single cells in soft agar and only less than 5% of the cells generated small colonies, as previously reported for NSC, again indicating that immortalised cells behave like NSC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gursel et al., 2011</a>). Instead, imNSC1-<i>Efnb2</i> and GSC1 formed large colonies at similar high efficiency, indicating that ephrin-B2 drives anchorage-independent proliferation. Intriguingly, and in contrast to its role in perivascular invasion, ephrin-B2 effects on proliferation were dependent on reverse signalling and independent of homotypic cell-cell contact. Indeed, imNSC1-\u0394C<i>Efnb2</i> did not form colonies in suspension and imNSC1-<i>Efnb2</i> overexpressing DN-Ncadherin formed colonies at similar efficiency as GFP-controls, demonstrating that Eph forward signalling is dispensable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>).

In contrast, cells with intact ephrin-B2 reverse signalling (imNSC1-<i>Efnb2</i> and GSC1) had similar low percentages of EdU<sup>+</sup> binucleated cells in both suspension and attachment culture.

We therefore assessed Src and RhoA in ephrin-B2-mediated anchorage-independent cytokinesis by measuring levels of their activated forms (phosphorylated Src, p-Src, and GTP-bound RhoA) in suspension by western blot and pull-down assays, respectively. p-Src was undetectable in suspended imNSC1, imNSC-<i>Efnb2</i> and GSC1 and, similarly, levels of activated FAK, a critical Src substrate, were also reduced (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>), indicating that Src does not play a role in our system. In stark contrast, levels of active RhoA were low in suspended cells that lacked ephrin-B2 reverse signalling (i.e. imNSC, imNSC1-\u0394C<i>Efnb2</i> and GSC1<i>Efnb<sup>-/-</sup></i>) but greatly increased in cells that express high levels of full-length ephrin-B2 (i.e. imNSC1-<i>Efnb2</i> and GSC1), suggesting the involvement of RhoA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). To further test this, we overexpressed constitutively active (RhoA-V14, which increases levels of active GTP-bound RhoA, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) and dominant negative (RhoA-N19, which inhibits activation of endogenous RhoA, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Qiu et al., 1995</a>) forms of RhoA in imNSC1/GSC1<i>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and imNSC1-<i>Efnb2/</i>GSC1, respectively, and assessed the ability of the cells to proliferate anchorage-independently by FACS. Remarkably, RhoA-V14 could rescue the cell-cycle arrest of imNSC1 and GSC1<i>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup>,</i> whereas RhoA-N19 arrested imNSC1-<i>Efnb2</i> and GSC1 in G2/M (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that ephrin-B2 drives anchorage-independent cytokinesis of GSCs through RhoA-mediated reverse signalling."

We thus sought to determine the relevance of these findings to human GBM (hGBM). To this end, we first examined Ephrin-B2 levels at the infiltrative margin of 10 GBM patient specimens and correlated them with GSC marker expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1a</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Two of these tumours were the original lesions from which G19 and G26 human GSC lines used below have been isolated. Serial sections were stained with H&amp;E; and with antibodies against Ephrin-B2 and ALDH1, a stem cell marker which labels GSC in perivascular and hypoxic niches (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rasper et al., 2010</a>). All tumours presented cytoplasmic and membranous Ephrin-B2 expression in 25 to 90% of the tumour cells, as well as neurons, inflammatory cells and vascular endothelial cells, as reported (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gale et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sawamiphak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ottone et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, ALDH1 expression was less abundant, with expression detected predominantly in neoplastic cells surrounding blood vessels, in perinecrotic regions and at the infiltrative tumour margin, as expected from a stem cell marker (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rasper et al., 2010</a>). Weaker ALDH1 expression was also detected in reactive astrocytes and endothelial cells. Importantly, many perivascular ALDH1<sup>+</sup> neoplastic cells at the infiltrative tumour margin co-expressed ephrin-B2. Thus, ephrin-B2 is expressed in stem-like cells invading along blood vessels in primary human tumours."

In addition, analysis of 402 GBM from the TGCA dataset classified according to Verhaak et al. and corrected for <i>IDH1</i> status, indicated that <i>EFNB2</i> expression levels are highest in mesenchymal and classical GBM subtypes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib74\">Verhaak et al., 2010</a>).

First, we xenotransplanted luciferase-tagged SCR or sh<i>EFNB2</i> G26 cells intracranially in nude mice and monitored tumour growth and disease-free survival by bioluminescence imaging and survival analysis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a\u2013c</a>). We found a dramatic impairment of tumour growth in the <i>EFNB2</i> knock-down group relative to control, in that vector-transduced G26 formed GBM in all animals (as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib28\">Stricker et al., 2012</a>) whilst <i>EFNB2</i> knock-down cells gave rise to slower growing tumours in only 2 out of 10 animals, with the other 8 mice remaining tumour-free for &gt;1 year. To investigate the mechanisms responsible and confirm the generality of these findings, we repeated these experiments using both G26 and G19 lines and examined vascular association and proliferation of the GSC by immunofluorescence and FACS analysis at 10 days following implantation, a time point at which knock-down cells could still be detected by bioluminescence (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). SCR GSC associated with the vasculature at this early time point (and at later stages of tumour growth), resulting in vascular co-option, as reported (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Watkins et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, vascular contact was severely compromised in knock-down cells. Furthermore, similar to GSC1<i>Efnb2<sup>-/-</sup></i> murine cells, <i>EFNB2</i> downregulation resulted in a marked decrease in proliferation, accompanied by an arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell-cycle, indicative of a cytokinesis block (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e,f</a>).

For this, we took advantage of an Ephrin-B2 blocking scFv antibody fragment (B11) we previously developed (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abengozar et al., 2012</a>). Migration and methylcellulose assays in vitro confirmed that B11 effectively inhibits Ephrin-B2 signalling in GSC1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). Luciferase-tagged G26 cells were implanted intracranially in immunocompromised mice and 13d later, once sizeable, exponentially growing tumours had formed, but prior to the onset of neoangiogenesis, B11 was administered intravenously for a total of 9 consecutive days, as reported (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abengozar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Binda et al., 2012</a>). This treatment regimen enabled us to assess direct effects of B11 on the tumour cells in the absence of confounding anti-angiogenic effects known to result from ephrin-B2 inhibition (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sawamiphak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abengozar et al., 2012</a>). Efficient delivery of the scFv across the blood/tumour barrier to the tumour cells was confirmed in parallel animals using Alexa-680 labelled B11 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Remarkably, B11 strongly suppressed tumour growth in all animals without any evidence of toxicity, with three of six animals showing complete regression, as judged by quantitative bioluminescence imaging, survival analysis and post-mortem examination of the injected brains (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a\u2013c</a>). Analysis and quantification of the tumours immediately following treatment also revealed that, in contrast to vehicle-treated control tumours, invading tumour cells failed to associate with and coopt the vasculature (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>). Furthermore, proliferation was reduced in B11 tumours relative to controls, with B11 samples containing many Ki67<sup>+</sup> multinucleated cells, indicative of a cytokinesis defect (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>). Therefore, B11 suppresses G26 tumourigenicity through inhibition of ephrin-B2-dependent perivascular invasion and anchorage-independent proliferation, independent of angiogenesis. We conclude that Ephrin-B2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human GBM and its inhibition might be an effective strategy for curtailing GBM progression and recurrence."

Here, using a novel mouse \u2018progression series\u2019 that mimics transformation of normal NSC to mesenchymal GSC, we identified ephrin-B2 as a critical driver of GSC perivascular invasion. Interestingly, a role for ephrin-B2 and its phosphorylation in the tumour cells has been previously linked to GBM invasiveness, albeit not in the context of GSC. This suggests that ephrin-B2 might promote invasion both by generally enhancing cell-intrinsic invasive potential through reverse signalling (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nakada et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tu et al., 2012</a>) and, also, by specifically enabling perivascular spread through forward signalling as we have shown here."

A similar role for Eph/ephrin signalling in constraining migration of premalignant cells was reported in colorectal cancer, where ephrin-B ligands in the surrounding normal tissue inhibit invasion of incipient lesions through activation of EphB receptors in the tumour cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cortina et al., 2007</a>). Our study is also consistent with work by Astin et al., which reported that ephrin ligands on stromal cells repel normal and non-metastatic prostate cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Astin et al., 2010</a>). Thus, the present work further strengthens the notion that ephrins expressed in normal tissues act as tumour-suppressors during early tumourigenesis by promoting tumour confinement and identifies the vasculature as a critical mediator of these effects. It is tempting to speculate that ephrin-B2-mediated vascular compartmentalisation might be a more general tumour-suppressive mechanism, limiting the spread of premalignant lesions across many cancer types."

Mechanistically, we found this to be dependent on the upregulation of ephrin-B2 in the GSC themselves, which elicits constitutive activation of Eph forward signalling in the tumour through homotypic cell-cell interactions. Consequently, this promotes perivascular spread in two ways. First, constitutive Eph activation increases repulsion between the tumour cells within the tumour bulk, thereby promoting GSC motility and scattering of single cells away from the tumour, a hallmark of GBM migration (<a href=\"#bib72\">Vehlow and Cordes, 2013</a>). Second, it desensitizes the cells to extrinsic ephrin-B2 repulsion, thereby circumventing vascular confinement and permitting cells that have detached from the tumour mass to continue their migration along the vasculature (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). Thus, invasive GSC augment their tumourigenic potential by \u2018hijacking\u2019 the same signalling pathway through which the vasculature suppresses tumourigenesis in normal tissues. Intriguingly, the mechanism of invasion we identified here, differs from what has been reported for colorectal and prostate cancer in the studies mentioned above (<a href=\"#bib3\">Astin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cortina et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, while in those systems tumour spread depended on the downregulation of Eph receptors in a cell-autonomous manner, in our GBM model non-cell-autonomous constitutive activation of Eph forward signalling is responsible, suggesting that the mechanisms that evade ephrin repulsion during tumour progression might be critically dependent on cancer type."

Indeed, lgT-immortalised stem cells overexpressing <i>Efnb2</i> formed aggressive tumours with nearly identical kinetics to Ras-transformed cells and genetic deletion of <i>Efnb2</i> in GSCs significantly delayed tumourigenesis. We demonstrate that these effects depend on the surprising and previously unknown ability of ephrin-B2 to drive anchorage-independent proliferation through the activation of cytokinesis in a RhoA-dependent manner. It is of note that, in contrast to perivascular invasion, these ephrin-B2 effects are mediated by reverse signalling and independent of cell-cell contact, indicating that ephrin-B2 drives two key aspects of GBM tumourigenesis through a complex interplay of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). Previous studies in endothelial and smooth muscle cells have reported a similar cell-cell contact- and Eph-independent role for ephrin-B2 reverse signalling in driving acto-myosin contractility and cell spread, respectively (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bochenek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Foo et al., 2006</a>). We currently do not know how RhoA becomes activated downstream of ephrin-B2. A potential candidate is Dishevelled, which mediates activation of Rho/ROCK by ephrin-B1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib69\">Tanaka et al., 2003</a>). It would be interesting to explore the role of Dishevelled in our system in the future."

Indeed, <i>EFNB2</i> knock-down prior to implantation abrogated tumour initiation and treatment of pre-existing intracranial tumours with Ephrin-B2 blocking antibodies, under conditions that mimic human therapeutic paradigms, strongly reduced the growth and expansion of pre-formed tumours. Significantly, both approaches curtailed tumour growth by impairing both vascular association and cytokinesis. In patient samples stratified by GBM subtype, <i>EFNB2</i> levels were highest in mesenchymal and classical tumours and correlated, inversely, with survival specifically in mesenchymal GBM. This is in agreement with our mesenchymal mouse models and analysis of human GSC lines, which revealed a robust correlation between <i>EFNB2</i> and mesenchymal gene expression levels. This recurrent correlation is particularly noteworthy, as <i>EFNB2</i> was previously identified as a component of the core mesenchymal gene network (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carro et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that convertion to the mesenchymal signature is associated to progression, radioresistance and recurrence and is thus a fundamental driver of GBM malignancy (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ozawa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhat et al., 2013</a>)."

As such, by harnessing the complexity of the Eph/ephrin system, inhibition of ephrin-B2 would in itself be an effective \u2018combinatorial therapy\u2019, capable of suppressing two critical GSC-intrinsic properties, namely perivascular invasion and proliferation, and might thus represent an attractive strategy for blocking GBM progression and recurrence.

The eyes were coated with Lacri-lube (Allergan) to prevent dehydration, an underlying heat pad used to maintain body temperature (37\u00b0C). To prevent dehydration isotonic saline solution was administered (i.p.) during long imaging sessions. Depth of anaesthesia was closely monitored. To visualize blood vessels a 3000MW dextran-Texas Red conjugate was injected intravenously prior to imaging. A pulsed laser beam with a wavelength of 910 nm was used to ensure that both GFP-tumour cells and Texas Red showed sufficient signal intensity. Each imaging session lasted for no longer than 60 min and mice were imaged up to four times daily with cells imaged every 20 min . After image acquisition individual frames were aligned and the displacement of single cells measured using ImageJ software."

Preoperative structural MRI was available in all patients; the T2-weighted FLAIR sequences were reviewed to assess the extent of invasion into normal tissue. All patients underwent maximally safe surgical debulking and the isolated tissues were extensively sampled in order to represent the bulk of the tumour along with its infiltrative component in the surrounding grey matter. Specifically, areas representative of the invasive front of the tumour were chosen from each case. The tissues were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24\u2009hr and then processed using standard method to produce paraffin sections. Sequential three-micron sections cut from each selected block and were used for immunoperoxidase immunohistochemistry. Immunostainings were performed following a standard protocol. Briefly, the sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehyadrated in decreasing alcohols to distilled water. Antigen retrieval was performed incubating the sections for 20\u00a0min in steam-heated sodium citrate buffer (10\u00a0mM Sodium Citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6) at 90\u00b0C or 1\u00a0mM EDTA at pH 8. Following antigen unmasking, endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS at -20\u00b0C for 15 min. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with the following primary antibodies: anti-EphrinB2 (clone EFR-163M hybridoma supernatant 1:4, CNIO)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Abengozar et al., 2012</a>), anti-ALDH1 (monoclonal, BD Bioscience, dilution 1:500), anti-ALDH1 (mouse, clone 44, BD biosciences). The ephrin-B2 antibody gave robust membrane and cytoplasmic staining and labelled the endothelium, confirming specificity. Nuclear labelling was however detected in some tumour cases, a feature not present in control samples. Only membranous and cytoplasmic staining was scored as positive in the analysis of the tumours. The SuperSentitive IHC detection system from BioGenex (Fremon, CA, USA) was used to visualise antibody binding following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haemalum."

Using two complementary methods, SV40-T antigen + RasV12; or NF1-KO + p53-KD + CDK4 over-expression, the authors transformed NSCs into GBM stem cells (GSCs). After grafting into syngeneic mice, it was found that while GSCs migrated along blood vessels, control immortalized NSCs (imNSCs) failed to do so. Then it was shown that ephrin-B2 is sufficient and necessary for endothelial cells (EC) to repel imNSCs, using an in vitro compartmentalization assay. To investigate why GSCs were not repelled by vasculature, the expression levels of all Ephs and ephrins were examined in GSCs vs. imNSCs. It was found that ephrin-B2 is over-expressed in GSCs, and knockout of which led to repulsion by endothelial cells in vitro and loss of perivascular migration in vivo. Furthermore, over-expression of ephrin-B2 in imNSCs conferred them migratory activity over ECs in vitro and in vivo. Next it was shown that homotypic cell-cell interactions among GSCs helped them overcome the repulsion by endothelial cells, through constitutively elevated forward signaling to desensitize Eph receptors to exogenous stimulation. Pre-stimulation of imNSCs with ephrin-B2-Fc allowed them to overcome EC repulsion, further supporting this notion. Next it was shown that reverse signaling of ephrin-B2 also plays an important role in malignancy. Mechanistic studies showed that ephrin-B2 over expression led to anchorage-independent cytokinesis through RhoA-mediated reverse signaling. Finally, the human relevance of the study was demonstrated with data showing that both ephrin B2 knockdown and anti-ephrin-B2-scFv antibody treatment suppressed human GSC tumorigenesis in grafted mice."

To accomplish this the authors use two models in which they can generate GSCs by RTK activation and p53/RB inactivation, and compared the properties of these cells to similar neural stem cells. Interestingly, they demonstrate that the GSCs, but not NSCs, are able to drive tumorigenesis, and they show that upregulation of ephrinb2 in these cells causes this tumorigenesis by two distinct processes: increase in cell proliferation and increasing perivascular invasion. Remarkably, these two processes are regulated by distinct ephrin-B2 mediated molecular mechanisms. Cell proliferation is mediated by reverse ephrin-B2 signaling by activation of RhoA whereas perivascular invasion is regulated by forward ephrin-B2 signaling onto neighboring cells causing desensitization to this pathway. This manuscript represents a tour de force in our understanding of both cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of malignant cell progression. The authors use elegant in vitro and in vivo models and demonstrate both the necessity and the sufficiency of overexpression of ephrin-B2 in the ability of these cells to proliferate and invade. This provides a significant advancement in our understanding of how tumor cells proliferate and interact with their surroundings."
