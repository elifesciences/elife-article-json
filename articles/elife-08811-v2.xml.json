Five conserved tubulin cofactors/chaperones and the Arl2 GTPase regulate \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin assembly into heterodimers and maintain the soluble tubulin pool in the cytoplasm, but their physical mechanisms are unknown. Here, we reconstitute a core tubulin chaperone consisting of tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2, and reveal a cage-like structure for regulating \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Biochemical assays and electron microscopy structures of multiple intermediates show the sequential binding of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer followed by tubulin cofactor TBCC onto this chaperone, forming a ternary complex in which Arl2 GTP hydrolysis is activated to alter \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin conformation. A GTP-state locked Arl2 mutant inhibits ternary complex dissociation in vitro and causes severe defects in microtubule dynamics in vivo. Our studies suggest a revised paradigm for tubulin cofactors and Arl2 functions as a catalytic chaperone that regulates soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin assembly and maintenance to support microtubule dynamics."

Five conserved tubulin cofactors/chaperones and the Arl2 GTPase regulate \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin assembly into heterodimers and maintain the soluble tubulin pool in the cytoplasm, but their physical mechanisms are unknown. Here, we reconstitute a core tubulin chaperone consisting of tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2, and reveal a cage-like structure for regulating \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Biochemical assays and electron microscopy structures of multiple intermediates show the sequential binding of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer followed by tubulin cofactor TBCC onto this chaperone, forming a ternary complex in which Arl2 GTP hydrolysis is activated to alter \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin conformation. A GTP-state locked Arl2 mutant inhibits ternary complex dissociation in vitro and causes severe defects in microtubule dynamics in vivo. Our studies suggest a revised paradigm for tubulin cofactors and Arl2 functions as a catalytic chaperone that regulates soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin assembly and maintenance to support microtubule dynamics."

This activates the enzyme activity of Arl2, which releases the energy needed to alter the shape of the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin.

Polarity and dynamic instability are fundamental features of the MT polymer, originating from the head-to-tail polymerization of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nogales et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alushin et al., 2014</a>). The \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer contains two GTP-binding sites: an inactive non-exchangeable site (N-site) on \u03b1-tubulin, which is suggested to stabilize \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers during their biogenesis, and an active exchangeable site (E-site) on \u03b2-tubulin, which is stimulated to hydrolyze GTP upon \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin incorporation into MT lattices at the plus ends (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nogales et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alushin et al., 2014</a>). GTP hydrolysis at the E-site leads to dynamic instability (catastrophe) at MT plus ends, due to the strain induced by the curvature of individual protofilaments (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alushin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brouhard and Rice, 2014</a>). Intracellular MT dynamics critically relies on a tightly controlled pool of soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers in the cytoplasm. Despite their importance, the mechanisms for biogenesis, maintenance, and degradation of soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers remain poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tian and Cowan, 2013</a>)."

Biogenesis and degradation of the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin heterodimer are non-spontaneous processes that rely on five highly conserved tubulin cofactor (TBC) proteins: TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, TBCD, and TBCE (described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lewis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lundin et al., 2010</a>). Orthologs of these proteins have been identified in all eukaryotes studied to date (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lewis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lundin et al., 2010</a>). The maintenance of a concentrated pool of tubulin dimers by the TBC proteins is essential for proper MT dynamics in eukaryotic cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tian et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lewis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lundin et al., 2010</a>). The TBC proteins' functions are finely balanced: their loss or their overexpression are both lethal in most eukaryotes, stemming from a complete loss of the MT cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib59\">Steinborn et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lacefield et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jin et al., 2009</a>). In budding yeast, the first identified <span class=\"underline\">c</span>hromosomal <span class=\"underline\">in</span>stability (CIN) phenotypes, showing severe mitotic spindle defects due to loss of MTs, were ultimately traced to loss of TBC proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hoyt et al., 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Antoshechkin and Han, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Steinborn et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lacefield et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jin et al., 2009</a>). In humans, missense mutations in TBCE and TBCB are linked to hypo-parathyroidism facial dysmorphism (also termed Kenny-Caffey syndrome) and giant axonal neuropathy, in which developmental defects are observed due to impairment of MT cytoskeleton function (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parvari et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). In addition to the five conserved TBC proteins, the small Arl2 GTPase (<span class=\"underline\">A</span>DP <span class=\"underline\">R</span>ibosylation <span class=\"underline\">F</span>actor-<span class=\"underline\">L</span>ike-2) regulates the function of TBC proteins in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin biogenesis/degradation through an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

(<b>B</b>) Initial paradigm for tubulin cofactors and Arl2 activities based on previous studies. Each of the molecules is suggested to be monomeric, and only assemble into complexes to drive \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin biogenesis or degradation, via interactions regulated by dynamic equilibria. TBCA binds nascent \u03b2-tubulin and TBCB binds nascent \u03b1-tubulin. TBCA and TBCB are replaced by TBCD and TBCE, respectively. TBCC drives TBCE-\u03b1-tubulin and TBCD-\u03b2-tubulin to form a supercomplex. GTP hydrolysis in Arl2 is activated by TBCC in a parallel pathway to tubulin assembly. Tubulin biogenesis and degradation intermediate bind and form tubulin dimers, a process that requires Arl2 and tubulin to undergo GTP hydrolysis as an energy source.

The role of Arl2 GTP hydrolysis in this pathway remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</a>); Arl2 and its activation by TBCC have been suggested to operate in parallel to the TBC pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, the roles for TBCC and the Arl2 GTPase remain poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tian et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mori and Toda, 2013</a>). Overexpression of TBC proteins results in one of two unique phenotypes: TBCA or TBCB overexpression in budding or fission yeast suppresses defects induced by overexpression of \u03b1- or \u03b2- tubulin, but does not otherwise affect MT dynamics. In contrast, overexpression of TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, or Arl2 leads to rapid MT loss (<a href=\"#bib7\">Archer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feierbach et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Radcliffe et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lacefield et al., 2006</a>)."

This chaperone binds \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and TBCC sequentially, serving as a catalytic platform powered by the Arl2 GTPase for \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin assembly and activation. A soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer binds TBC-DEG and primes Arl2, followed by TBCC binding and GTP hydrolysis activation. We show that TBCC is a unique GAP for which affinity depends on \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin binding onto TBC-DEG. TBCC promotes GTP hydrolysis through its C-terminal \u03b2-helix domain, which interfaces with both Arl2 and \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin in a ternary complex. We further find that in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells, a mutation locking the Arl2 GTPase into a GTP-bound state profoundly affects MT dynamics. Overall, our studies reveal a new role for tubulin cofactors TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2, which together assemble a GTP-hydrolyzing tubulin chaperone critical for the biogenesis, maintenance, and degradation of soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, defects in which have a profound effect on MT dynamics in vivo. The finding that \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin is assembled on a multi-subunit platform establishes a new paradigm for the mechanisms of the TBC proteins in tubulin biogenesis, maintenance, and degradation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of tubulin cofactors and Arl2, we expressed the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> orthologs of TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 (named Rbl2, Alf1, Cin1p, Pac2p, Cin2p, and Cin4p, and referred to hereafter as TBCA, TBCB, TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>]) both individually and in combinations, with the goal of reconstituting relevant complexes. TBCA and TBCB are small proteins (12 and 28 kDa in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>) that have been suggested to sequester monomeric \u03b2- and \u03b1-tubulin, respectively, while TBCC, TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 regulate \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer biogenesis and degradation through unknown mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Archer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feierbach et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lundin et al., 2010</a>). Sequence alignments and structure predictions identify conserved domains within each protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), but the molecular functions of these domains remain unknown. We found that TBCA, TBCB, and TBCC are each soluble when expressed on their own in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, while TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 are insoluble on their own (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Co-expression of these three proteins, however, results in a stable and homogenous TBC<span class=\"underline\">D</span>-TBC<span class=\"underline\">E</span>-Arl2 <span class=\"underline\">G</span>TPase complex that we term TBC-DEG (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). When we coexpressed TBCA, TBCB, or TBCC with TBC-DEG, we observed no interaction with TBCA or TBCB, and an unstable, transient interaction with TBCC (as determined by mass spectrometry; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) demonstrates that TBC-DEG is a 205 kDa heterotrimer with one copy of each protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C,D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Similar analysis shows that TBCC is a 32 kDa monomer, and porcine brain \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin is a 100 kDa heterodimer, as shown previously (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C,D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Monomeric TBCD, TBCE, or Arl2 subunits were not observed in vitro at any concentration and the TBC-DEG complex behaves as a single biochemical entity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C,D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). At high ionic strength, TBC-DEG complexes precipitate, presumably due to dissociation and insolubility of individual subunits (data not shown). A recent study suggests human TBCE is soluble and forms complexes with TBCB (<a href=\"#bib55\">Serna et al., 2015</a>). We do not observe TBCE-TBCB complexes using our TBC protein bacterial expression system. TBCE is insoluble without TBCD and Arl2 coexpression in bacteria. We believe that TBCE solubility maybe due to its expression in a eukaryotic system, where assembly and co-purification with TBCD and Arl2 is possible."

Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal domains of both TBCD and Arl2, or the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of TBCE, leads to insoluble TBC-DEG that cannot be purified from <i>E. coli</i>. In contrast, deleting the N-terminal Cap-Gly domain of TBCE, predicted to bind the C-terminal tail of \u03b1-tubulin, did not affect assembly of soluble TBC-DEG complexes. We next determined the effect of inserting small (6xHis) or large (GFP, green fluorescent protein) tags on TBC-DEG assembly. Consistent with the deletion analysis, large or small tags were not tolerated on either end of Arl2 or at the C-termini of TBCD or TBCE (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Both 6xHis and GFP tags were tolerated at the N-termini of TBCD and TBCE (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). These data suggest that the conserved domains of TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 are required to assemble a TBC-DEG complex, in which the N-termini of TBCD and TBCE are exposed, while both termini of Arl2, and the C-termini of TBCD and TBCE, are buried and do not tolerate insertions."

TBC-DEG binds soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers with high affinity, forming stable complexes with a measured mass of 308 kDa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C,D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), indicating that a single TBC-DEG (200 kDa) binds a single \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer (110 kDa). The TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin complex is likely to be the \u223c300 kDa tubulin biogenesis intermediate identified two decades ago by <a href=\"#bib44\">Paciucci (1994)</a>. We next determined the conditions for TBCC binding to TBC-DEG and \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. TBCC does not bind either \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin or TBC-DEG in isolation, but strongly interacts with the TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). This interaction strongly depends on the GTP nucleotide present during complex assembly. We observed TBCC binding to the TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin complex when incubated with the non-hydrolysable GTP analog GTP\u03b3S or the transition state analog GDP\u00b7ALF<sub>x</sub>, but no binding in the presence of GTP or GDP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 B\u2013E</a>). We measured a 340 kDa mass for the TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBCC ternary complex, indicating that the TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin complex (310 kDa) associates with a single molecule of TBCC (34 kDa) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). To determine if the Arl2 GTPase is responsible for increasing the TBCC binding affinity to TBC-DEG, we next generated a Gln73Leu (Q73L) mutation in Arl2, which inhibits GTP hydrolysis and results in a \u2018GTP-locked\u2019 state (<a href=\"#bib69\">Veltel et al., 2008</a>). Bacterial expression of recombinant Arl2-Q73L shows that it assembles with TBCD and TBCE into a TBC-DEG-Q73L complex. In contrast to TBC-DEG, TBC-DEG-Q73L interacts with TBCC in the absence of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, panel I), and assembles with \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and TBCC to form a stable and fully saturated ternary complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, panel II; mass of 335 kDa by SEC-MALS; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) in the presence of GTP. Thus, our biochemical reconstitutions indicate that TBCC binding to TBC-DEG is promoted by both \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin binding to TBC-DEG and the GTP-bound state of Arl2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These findings support a proposed role for TBCC as a GAP for Arl2, whose association with the TBC-DEG chaperone is responsive to \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin binding."

In the absence of other factors, TBC-DEG hydrolyzes GTP extremely slowly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Addition of equimolar \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, which alone does not show detectable GTP hydrolysis in this assay, stimulates a modest level of GTP hydrolysis activity in TBC-DEG (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = \u223c0.40 min<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). In contrast, the addition of equimolar TBCC to TBC-DEG activates a substantially higher rate of GTP hydrolysis (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = \u223c0.77 min<sup>\u22121</sup>), consistent with its proposed function as a GAP for Arl2 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tian et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mori and Toda, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Newman et al., 2014</a>). When equimolar amounts of both \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and TBCC are added to TBC-DEG, GTP hydrolysis was stimulated twofold more than in the presence of TBCC alone (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = 1.85 min<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This increase may be due either to an increase in the affinity of TBCC for Arl2 in the presence of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, or activation of GTP hydrolysis within the bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin itself. To distinguish these models, we next assayed GTP hydrolysis of TBC-DEG-Q73L in the presence of equimolar \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and TBCC. This complex shows low GTP hydrolysis activity (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = 0.5 min<sup>\u22121</sup>) with a high <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> (387 \u03bcM), supporting the idea that within the ternary complex, \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin contributes only a small fraction of the total GTP hydrolysis activity. Taken together, our data provide a new context to explain extensive prior genetic and biochemical data on the role of Arl2 in regulating tubulin cofactor activity (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tian et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mori and Toda, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Newman et al., 2014</a>).

                                "text": "Next, we explored how the TBCC and \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentration influences GTP hydrolysis by TBC-DEG. We measured the steady-state GTP hydrolysis of TBC-DEG titrated with a range of TBCC and \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentrations. Decreasing the molar ratio of TBCC to TBC-DEG, while maintaining a stoichiometric amount of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, increases the apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for GTP hydrolysis, further supporting the idea that TBCC is a true GAP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Veltel et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, increasing the ratio of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin to TBC-DEG (0\u20133 \u03bcM), while maintaining a stoichiometric amount of TBCC, stimulates a step-wise increase in the maximal rate of GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3I). At 3 \u03bcM \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and at a 1:3:1 ratio of TBCC:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBC-DEG, we observe the highest GTP hydrolysis rate (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>: <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = 3.0 min<sup>\u22121</sup>), suggesting that each TBC-DEG chaperone can undergo multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis, upon binding and releasing multiple \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers during each experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We were unable to test \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentrations higher than 3 \u03bcM in this assay, as at 6 \u03bcM \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin or higher we expect \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin polymerization into MTs to significantly contribute to the overall GTP hydrolysis observed. Within the tested \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentration range (0\u20133 \u03bcM), the TBC-DEG GTP hydrolysis rate (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>) is proportional to the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentration, starting at \u223c0.8 min<sup>\u22121</sup> in the absence of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3H) and climbing and then plateauing at 3.0 min<sup>\u22121</sup> at 3 \u03bcM \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. Thus, TBCC is an \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dependent GAP that activates TBC-DEG GTP hydrolysis in a cyclic manner where the degree of GAP activity depends on the soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin concentration."

While cryo-EM imaging of TBC-DEG was not possible due to solubility defects and aggregation in vitreous ice, we were able to collect negative-stain EM data and generate a robust medium-resolution 3D reconstruction. We collected a total of 20,000 particle images from 160 initial wide-field images, which showed a globular \u223c100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 100 \u00c5 particle with significant internal structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Particle orientations were well distributed, and reference-free classification showed homogeneous class averages representing a large range of views (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We generated a starting model using a common-lines approach based on prominent classes and then used projection matching and angular reconstitution, and refined a 3D map to 24 \u00c5 resolution (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). 2D projections generated from the refined 3D map matched well to the reference-free class averages (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

TBC-DEG consists of a circular \u2018floor\u2019 with a large vertical \u2018thumb\u2019 extension (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, pink), facing a \u2018bow\u2019 density with two globular ends (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, blue). The bow (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, blue) is attached at its center to the floor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, pink) via a \u2018trunk\u2019 density and binds a \u2018pillar\u2019 density (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, orange) via one of its globular ends (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, cyan). Three interfaces form the TBC-DEG cage structure: (1) bow to floor interface via the trunk; (2) bow to pillar interface (cyan); and (3) floor to pillar interface. To determine the locations of individual TBC-DEG subunits within this structure, we imaged a complex with N-terminally GFP-fused TBCE (TBC-DE(N-GFP)G) using negative-stain EM (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). TBC-DE(N-GFP)G class averages show the addition of ordered density when compared to equivalent class averages of TBC-DEG (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We determined a 24 \u00c5 3D structure for TBC-DE(N-GFP)G using a 50 \u00c5 resolution filtered TBC-DEG as a starting model (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We located the TBCE N-terminus near one of the two globular domains at the end of the bow, suggesting that this density is the N-terminal Cap-Gly domain of TBCE (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

                                "text": "We built a pseudo-atomic model for TBC-DEG using the experimentally verified position for the TBCE Cap-Gly domain, followed by semi-automated docking of Arl2 and structural models for conserved domains of TBCD and TBCE, into the TBC-DEG map (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>). We used the structure of Cse1p as a model for TBCD, as they share over 47% sequence identity and contain a similar number of HEAT repeats (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cook et al., 2005b</a>). For the TBCE LRR domain, we used the structure of TLR4, which shares 40% sequence similarity with TBCE and contains 14 LLR repeats (<a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2009b</a>). We used the Cap-Gly (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fleming et al., 2013c</a>) and ubiquitin-like (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2013b</a>) domains of TBCB as models for the equivalent domains of TBCE, and the human Arl2 structure as a model for yeast Arl2 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hanzal-Bayer et al., 2002b</a>). We used two approaches to dock these subunit models into the TBC-DEG map, leading to similar results (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). First, we segmented the TBC-DEG-Q73L map, and docked the atomic models into segments using the \u2018fit to segment\u2019 feature in UCSF Chimera. Second, we used low-resolution filtered subunit models and successively fit them into an unsegmented map, using the \u2018fit in map\u2019 feature of UCSF Chimera, starting with the largest subunit (TBCD) and ending with the smallest subunit (Arl2) (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). The Cse1 model representing TBCD fit well to the floor and thumb segments (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.71) and its distinct circular-ring and rod shape allowed an unambiguous fit directly into the TBC-DEG map without segmentation. TLR4, representing the central LRR domain of TBCE, fit well to the bow segment of the TBC-DEG map (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.80) after placement of TBCD (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The TBCB Cap-Gly structure fit well into the globular end of the bow closest to the TBCE N-GFP density from TBC-DE(N-GFP)G (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), while the TBCB ubiquitin-like domain fit well into the other globular end of the bow (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.82). The overall bow-shaped organization of TBCE LLR with two globular domains at its ends is similar to the TBCE organization in a recent study (<a href=\"#bib55\">Serna et al., 2015</a>). Finally, Arl2 fit well to the pillar density located in between the TBCE and TBCD subunits (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). The only region of the TBC-DEG map that was not accounted for in our modeling is the trunk, which likely includes the four to five HEAT repeats in TBCD that are missing from the Cse1 model according to sequence alignment comparison. Thus, our low-resolution structure and model for TBC-DEG support our domain deletion/insertion analysis of TBCD, TBCE, and Arl2 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating a non-linear assembly of these subunits into a cage-like complex, and demonstrating critical roles for N and C-terminal domains of TBCD, Arl2, and the C-terminus of TBCE in TBC-DEG assembly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>)."

Raw images and reference-free classification show TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin particles adopt a variety of orientations, with a moderate degree of preferred views (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We generated a de novo starting model using common class averages (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, left panel). Using a low-resolution filtered starting model, we then carried out projection matching and angular reconstitution cycles (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>) and then refined a 24 \u00c5 TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin map. The TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin model projections match the class averages (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). When compared to TBC-DEG-Q73L, the TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin map shows an additional dual-lobed mass on top of the cage, with dimensions of approximately 80 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 40 \u00c5, which we assigned as \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Although the orientation of the tubulin dimer cannot be determined solely from the electron density map, the TBCE Cap-Gly domain is known to bind the disordered \u03b1-tubulin C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008</a>). This additional information allows us to unambiguously assign the orientation of the bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, and fitting of the atomic coordinates of the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer into the dual-lobed density (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.85) results in a pseudo-atomic model of the full TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

In addition, the TBCE Cap-Gly domain is positioned above \u03b1-tubulin, and Arl2 contacts \u03b2-tubulin from below. The TBCE Cap-Gly domain moves \u223c20 \u00c5 from its position in TBC-DEG-Q73L, shifting closer to the TBCD thumb, while interfacing with the density we assign as \u03b1-tubulin. Upon tubulin binding, the TBCD thumb, TBCE LRR, and Arl2 GTPase domains each move \u223c10 \u00c5 closer to the center of the TBC-DEG cage (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). TBC-DEG thus engages three sides of the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer, intimately embracing the individual monomers above its hollow core. The domain connecting the TBCE bow to the Cap-Gly domain becomes disordered upon binding, suggesting that TBCE undergoes a conformational change (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013G</a>, dark blue). The TBCE ubiquitin domain could not be assigned in this map (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013G</a>). Importantly, our TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin model shows that both longitudinal interfaces used in MT protofilament assembly are accessible while tubulin is engaged by TBC-DEG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013G</a>). Thus, our structural analysis suggests that the TBC-DEG chaperone organization is likely critical for recognizing \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin monomers during the biogenesis or degradation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>)."

To better understand TBCC's interactions with TBC-DEG, we sought to determine TBCC's crystal structure. We crystallized full-length <i>S. cerevisiae</i> TBCC and determined a 2.0 \u00c5 resolution structure encompassing residues 100\u2013267 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Electron density for the TBCC N-terminal domain was absent, indicating it is either disordered or proteolyzed during crystallization. The TBCC C-terminal domain adopts a \u03b2-helix fold composed of 13 \u03b2-strands arranged in a helical staircase in the shape of a narrow triangular wedge (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). TBCC shows structural homology to retinitis pigmentosa-2 (RP-2) protein (RMSD 1.7 \u00c5; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), a well-studied GAP for the Arl2 paralog Arl3 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kuhnel et al., 2006</a>). In RP2, the \u03b2-helix domain binds Arl3 and inserts an \u2018arginine finger\u2019 into the Arl3 active site to stimulate GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib69\">Veltel et al., 2008</a>). TBCC possesses a conserved arginine (Arg186) in the same position (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), which in our structure projects outward from a highly conserved surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). In addition, TBCC includes two conserved features: (1) two additional \u03b2-strands with an intervening 15-residue loop (residues 220\u2013245) projecting above the \u03b2-helix; and (2) a short C-terminal \u03b1-helix that folds onto the TBCC \u03b2-helix domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The TBCC loop is rich in conserved hydrophobic and acidic residues, including Phe233, Phe237, Glu240, Glu241, Glu243, and Asp244 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We generated an Arl2:TBCC interface model by superimposing the TBCC and Arl2 structures onto the RP2:Arl3 co-crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Veltel et al., 2008</a>). This model (detailed in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) predicts that TBCC inserts Arg186 into the Arl2 active site to catalyze GTP hydrolysis, while Phe233 and Phe237 in the TBCC loop bind Arl2 hydrophobic residues, and the TBCC acidic residues 240, 241, 243, and 244 project above the Arl2-TBCC interface."

                                "text": "To determine the significance of the unique structural features of TBCC, we measured the effect of their mutation on GTP hydrolysis activity in TBC-DEG. We first removed the TBCC N-terminal spectrin domain to generate TBCC-C (residues 100\u2013267); this mutant showed a 38% decrease in <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> when compared to wild type TBCC (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), and lost the robust \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin independent activation of GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). This suggests that TBCC's N-terminal domain likely regulates the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin independent affinity of TBCC for TBC-DEG, while the \u03b2-helix domain is sufficient for \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dependent GAP activity. Mutation of the TBCC putative arginine finger, Arg186 (R186A), decreased the GTP hydrolysis rate (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>) of TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin by slightly more than 70% (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = 0.53 min<sup>\u22121</sup> compared to 1.85 min<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). As removal of the arginine finger is expected to eliminate the GAP activity of TBCC (<a href=\"#bib69\">Veltel et al., 2008</a>), the substantial remaining GTP hydrolysis activity with TBCC R186A supports the idea that GTP hydrolysis observed in TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBCC complexes arises from a combination of Arl2 and \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). A TBCC loop-deleted mutant (\u0394233-245; residues 233\u2013245 replaced with a six-residue Ser-Gly linker) reduces GTP hydrolysis activity by 82% (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> = 0.34 min<sup>\u22121</sup>), to a low yet still robust level of activity, similar to the rate of GTP hydrolysis for TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin without TBCC (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The TBCC loop deletion is expected to interfere with Arl2 recognition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Our structural and biochemical analyses of TBCC suggest its \u03b2-helix domain is a non-classical \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dependent GAP that activates Arl2 GTP hydrolysis, and may activate \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin to hydrolyze GTP through an unknown mechanism. Residual GTP hydrolysis after specific inactivation of Arl2 GAP activity through the R186A and \u0394233-245 TBCC mutants suggests that a secondary GTPase remains robustly active in the TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBCC complex. This GTPase is likely \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin itself; however, which GTPase site (N or E-site) is becoming activated, and which mechanism is behind its activation, both remain to be determined."

                                "text": "To gain insight into the TBCC GAP mechanism, we determined 3D reconstructions for TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBCC ternary complexes using negative-stain EM and single particle image analysis (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We used the TBC-DEG-Q73L complex to guarantee 100% stoichiometric TBCC binding in the TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBCC ternary complex to ensure its full occupancy in the structural studies. Raw images and reference-free classification indicate that the hollow core of the cage becomes largely occupied in the ternary complex. This conformation is distinct in appearance from the previous conformations (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We used angular reconstitution and refinement to generate a 24 \u00c5 TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBCC map (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>), and the model projections match well to the reference-free class averages (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The ternary complex map was then interpreted with respect to the TBC-DEG-Q73L and TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin maps (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The ternary complex map shows an additional wedge-shaped density inside the hollow core of the TBC-DEG cage, which we assign to the TBCC \u03b2-helix domain. A second density is observed engaging the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin at its intra-dimer interface, located in proximity to the TBCE Cap-Gly domain densities in previous maps (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). The TBCC C-terminal domain-Arl2 GTPase interface lies directly below the intra-dimer interface of tubulin. We generated a pseudo-atomic model for TBC-DEG-Q73L:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin:TBCC by fitting atomic coordinates for TBCC-N spectrin in the additional density along the TBC-DEG floor, and fit the C-terminal \u03b2-helix domain to the wedge density (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The TBCC \u03b2-helix docked well to the wedge density engaging the Arl2 GTPase (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficient 0.85), and this fit matches the conformation of our homology model for the TBCC-Arl2 binary complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Strikingly, despite the low resolution of our maps, we find that the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer adopts a unique conformation in the ternary complex. The intact \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer did not fit into this density in the ternary complex map. Therefore, \u03b1 and \u03b2-tubulin models were fit individually (UCSF Chimera correlation coefficients 0.55 and 0.67 for \u03b1 and \u03b2-tubulin, respectively; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). The \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin intra-dimer interface is wedged open by a 20 \u00c5-wide globular density, which we assigned to be the TBCE Cap-Gly domain due to its physical proximity in the TBC-DEG and TBC-DEG:\u03b1\u03b2-tubulin maps. We suggest that the TBCE Cap-Gly domain is repositioned by 10 \u00c5 in the ternary complex, wedging between \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin. TBCC C-terminal \u03b2-helix and its loop lie directly below the intra-dimer interface. At the current resolution it remains unclear how the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer is modified and we require higher resolution studies to understand its conformation and the positioning of TBC-DEG domains in the ternary complex. Our structural analysis supports the biochemical finding that TBCC is an \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dependent non-classical GAP for Arl2. Our ternary complex map suggests that TBCC Arg186 activates the Arl2 GTPase while engaging \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin at its intra-dimer interface via the extended loop. Arl2 GTP hydrolysis leads to a conformational change that involves a well-documented rotation of its conserved N-terminal helix (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Veltel et al., 2008</a>); this conformational change may reposition the associated TBCE Cap-Gly domain to deform \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin or activate \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin GTP hydrolysis at its N-site (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

First, we tested whether <i>cin4</i>-Q73L sensitizes cells to the MT depolymerizing drug benomyl. Wild type and Arl2-deleted (<i>cin4</i>\u2206) yeast cells were transformed with plasmids containing the <i>cin4</i>-Q73L mutant, wild type <i>CIN4</i>, or no protein (empty vector) under a galactose-inducible promoter. Consistent with previous studies, <i>cin4\u2206</i> null mutants exhibit hypersensitivity to benomyl that is rescued by expression of wild type <i>CIN4</i> (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stearns, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). In contrast, <i>cin4</i>-Q73L expression elicits dominant hypersensitivity to benomyl; ectopic expression of <i>cin4</i>-Q73L sensitized both wild type and <i>cin4</i>\u2206 cells to benomyl (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Our genetic rescue experiments suggest that dominant MT function defects are induced when Arl2/<i>cin4</i>-Q73L is overexpressed in native or Arl2-deleted cells."

We compared the effects of transient <i>cin4</i>-Q73L expression in wild type cells to mutant cells with <i>cin4</i>-Q73L constitutively expressed from the chromosomal locus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Arl2/<i>cin4</i>-Q73L expression decreased the number of MTs per cell, and this effect scaled with duration of <i>cin4</i>-Q73L expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). A 90 min pulse of ectopic <i>cin4</i>-Q73L expression decreased the number of astral MTs (aMTs) in wild type cells. This effect was exacerbated after 180 min of expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,H</a>). Mutant cells constitutively expressing <i>cin4</i>-Q73L exhibited the strongest loss of MTs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,H</a>). Analysis of individual aMT lengths in time-lapse imaging revealed striking changes in MT dynamics. After a 90 min pulse of ectopic <i>cin4</i>-Q73L, aMTs were longer and exhibited slower disassembly, decreased rescue frequency, and increased pauses compared to those observed in wild type yeast (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013G</a>; <a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5, 6</a>). Cells expressing constitutive <i>cin4</i>-Q73L also exhibited decreased rescue frequency and increased pauses. However, aMTs were slightly but significantly shorter than those in wild type cells; in contrast, MT disassembly rates were not significantly different. In conclusion, our studies suggest that the previously well-characterized phenotypes of TBC protein inactivation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hoyt et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Radcliffe et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Antoshechkin and Han, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jin et al., 2009</a>) may be a result of soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin regulation defects leading to aberrant MT dynamics."

We show that TBCD, TBCE, and the Arl2 GTPase form a chaperone core (TBC-DEG), which sequentially binds intact soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and TBCC to activate the Arl2 GTPase and possibly influence the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin conformation and GTPase activity. In addition to functioning in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer biogenesis, we suggest that this chaperone system may also regulate the activity of the existing pool of soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers in the cytoplasm."

Through this model, dual GTP hydrolyses in Arl2 and possibly in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin sequentially induce tubulin dimer dissociation without release.

This manipulation likely drives both biogenesis and degradation of the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer. We find that TBCC acts as a true GAP for Arl2, likely inserting the arginine finger residue Arg186 into the Arl2 active site to stimulate GTP hydrolysis. We find that full GAP activity depends on the binding of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin onto the TBC-DEG chaperone, suggesting that TBCC's affinity for TBC-DEG is increased upon \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin binding to the chaperone. We suggest that this affinity enhancement may be mediated by the extended acidic loop of TBCC, which is positioned close to the bound \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer in our pseudo-atomic model of the ternary complex, and mutation of which eliminates tubulin-dependent GAP enhancement. Finally, we observe modest but reproducible GTP hydrolysis both in the absence of TBCC and in an arginine finger-defective TBCC R186A mutant, suggesting that in addition to Arl2, a tubulin GTPase site (either N or E-site) may become active when bound to the TBC-DEG chaperone."

When TBC-DEG grasps \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin, the tubulin dimer interface is positioned directly above the Arl2 and its associated TBCC GAP. We suggest these binding interfaces are critical for setting the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin configuration during biogenesis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The TBC-DEG catalytic activity is likely required to overcome the high affinity of \u03b1- for \u03b2-tubulin within tubulin dimers. Previous studies have demonstrated that \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer dissociation is an extremely slow and unfavorable biochemical process that requires an external energy source (<a href=\"#bib10\">Caplow and Fee, 2002</a>). The TBC-DEG chaperone system likely provides the required energy through TBCC-mediated Arl2 GTP hydrolysis to power the dissociation of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers. The TBCC \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin binding interface ensures that catalysis is activated more efficiently upon \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin binding to TBC-DEG."

The TBCC \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dependent GAP may ensure the correct \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin configuration and activate Arl2 GTP hydrolysis. The Arl2 GTPases were shown to undergo dramatic conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), which likely drives tubulin cofactor chaperone catalysis. However, at the current resolution, our current EM maps do not yet show how the Arl2 GTPase conformational change catalyzes the TBC-DEG chaperone enzymatic activity, and what domains in TBC-DEG mediate the dissociation of the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer into monomers."

This regulation may involve soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin recycling, biogenesis, and degradation; this activity requires TBCC GAP activity, and an active Arl2 GTPase, where their mutations lead to defects in MT function (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fleming et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Radcliffe et al., 2000</a>). We postulate that the tubulin cofactor/Arl2 chaperone activity may cumulatively counteract a slow decay in the soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin pool (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Purified soluble tubulin has a well-documented rapid decay if not polymerized into MTs, although the biochemical nature of this decay remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib49\">Prasad et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sackett et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sackett and Lippoldt, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Elie-Caille et al., 2007</a>). TBC-DEG chaperones are critical for MT cytoskeletal dynamics in vivo as they may actively remove decaying \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin by degradation. GTP hydrolysis within the tubulin dimer, coupled to MT dynamics, may lead to decay in \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, and thus TBC-DEG chaperones may be required to revitalize the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer pool to support MT dynamics. Locking Arl2 in a GTP state via the Q73L mutation likely inhibits this regulation, leading to a loss in MT polymerization capacity as has been observed in vivo in many systems (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mori and Toda, 2013</a>)."

Our in vivo analysis provides compelling evidence for the critical role of TBC-DEG in MT function. We suggest that this chaperone activity is critical for MT dynamics through an effect on the health of the soluble pool of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin. One possibility for the toxic effect of the Arl2 GTP-locked mutation may be the inability of soluble tubulin to cycle through the TBC-DEG chaperone, leading to either sequestration of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer on the complex, or the release of partially dissociated soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers, which then induce toxic effects on MT dynamics. In cells, TBC-DEG chaperones are at much a lower concentration of soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin, suggesting that TBC-DEG exerts its effects on a relatively small population of \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin in the soluble cytoplasmic pool; this idea is supported by previous studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bhamidipati et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mori and Toda, 2013</a>). Increasing concentration of these regulators may catalyze extensive soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin degradation, thereby interfering with MT polymerization (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The regulation of the soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin pool by removing poorly active \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin from the pool or adding new fresh \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin to the system, may result in more polymerization-competent soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and may enhance MT dynamics. Locking Arl2 in the GTP state (Q73L) leads to profound changes in MT dynamics leading to a pausing phenotype in vivo, and likely leads to the mitotic defects previously observed (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fleming et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Radcliffe et al., 2000</a>)."

The GTPase activity of Arl2 is central to power and gate these chaperones, while tubulin cofactors TBCD and TBCE mediate molecular recognition of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin in the heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lewis et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tian and Cowan, 2013</a>). The concept that tubulin cofactors and Arl2 function together as a catalytic chaperone is consistent with long-standing genetics and cell biology studies indicating that their concentration is critical for proper MT dynamics and MT homeostasis. These chaperones represent a new MT regulatory pathway that may enhance MT dynamics by improving the activities of individual soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimers in the cytoplasmic pool. This regulation is likely critical for the homeostasis of the MT cytoskeleton in eukaryotes, which is underscored by human disorders related to tubulin cofactor mutations."

Electron microscopy was performed using a JEOL-2100 FF operating at 50,000 nominal magnification, and approximately 80\u2013100 EM images were recorded on S0163 film (Kodak) for each condition, focusing mostly on areas of thick stain where particles are less likely to be flattened. Film images for each data set were scanned using a D8200 PrimeScan Heidelberg drum densitometer at 5.0 \u03bcm/pixel leading to 1 \u00c5/pixel on the specimen. Images were normalized and binned two-fold (2 \u00c5/pixel) using the EMAN2.1 software package (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Roughly 18,000\u201320,000 globular cage-like individual TBC-DEG particles for each group were picked semi-automatically using e2boxer.py. Particle stacks were generated, then contrast transfer function (CTF) corrected with e2ctf.py using the phase flipping function. The image stacks were then subjected to iterative reference-free classification using e2refine2d.py generating 400 class averages, to remove roughly 10\u201330% of deformed, rare, or broken particle images. Additional rounds of classification were performed and the resulting 80-100 class averages show unique orientations suggesting a moderate degree of preferred orientations on the grids representing different, yet commonly observed views, as judged by their representation in the class averages (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). For each data set, prominent class averages were then used to generate a starting model using a common lines strategy (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). These starting models were then filtered to 50 \u00c5 resolution and used in cycles of 3D projection matching and angular reconstitution using the SAMUEL program utilities running the SPIDER program (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/maofuliao/samuel\">https://sites.google.com/site/maofuliao/samuel</a>). Projection matching and angular reconstitution of the starting model were initiated at 30\u00b0 increments and then decreased successively by 5\u00b0 increments down to 5\u00b0 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shaikh et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The resulting volume was filtered to 35 \u00c5 and the individual angular assignments were then further refined in multiple cycles in the program FREALIGN (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grigorieff, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lyumkis et al., 2013</a>). Refinement convergence was determined from changes in phase residuals, angular assignment changes based on the program angplot_dp, and by comparing model projections to reference-free class averages with a global search using FREALIGN (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Fourier shell correlation (FSC) calculations from two half data sets indicate 25 \u00c5 resolution for all maps based on the 0.5 cutoffs (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figures 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Final maps were aligned using the program XMIPP (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sorzano et al., 2004</a>), were resolution truncated to nominal resolution based on FSC cutoffs, and were visualized using the program UCSF Chimera (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The individual subunits were docked into the maps using two approaches that led to similar results. First, the maps were segmented using the segment map utility, and x-ray crystal structures for paralogs were fit using the fit-to-segment utility (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). Second, x-ray models were filtered to 24 \u00c5 resolution and then docked using the fit-in-map feature without segmentation, starting with the largest down to the smallest subunit, and each time cumulatively excluding regions of the map fit by the previous subunit. The floor and thumb regions (shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>, and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013H</a> in pink) were fit with the Cse1 paralog x-ray structure (PDB-ID 1Z3H; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cook et al., 2005a</a>), the TBCE bow region (shown in blue) was fit with the TLR4 LLR structure (PDB-ID 3FXI; <a href=\"#bib45\">Park et al., 2009a</a>), its two globular end segments (shown in dark blue and cyan) were fit with the TBCB Cap-Gly structure (PDB-ID 4B6M; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fleming et al., 2013a</a>) and the TBCB ubiquitin domain structure (PDB-ID 4B6W; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fleming et al., 2013b</a>), respectively, the Arl2 pillar region (shown in orange) was fit with the human Arl2 structure (PDB-ID 1KSJ; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hanzal-Bayer et al., 2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2002b</a>), \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer dual density (shown in red) was fit with the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin dimer (PDB-ID 1JFF; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lowe et al., 2001</a>), the TBCC N-terminal domain segment (shown in yellow) was fit by the TBCC spectrin N-terminal domain structure (PDB ID 2L3L), and the wedge segment in the ternary complex map (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013H</a>, shown in green) was fit by the TBCC-C-terminal domain structure (determined here, PDB ID 5CYA). The final resolution truncated maps were deposited into the EMD database under accession numbers EMD-6393, EMD-6392, EMD-6391, and EMD-6390."

TBCC crystals formed in 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 0.5 M ammonium sulfate, and 1.0 M lithium sulfate. The largest crystals were formed 1 week after micro-seeding in 0.1 M sodium citrate, 0.4 M ammonium sulfate, and 0.7 M lithium sulfate pH 5.2. Native TBCC crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing potassium hexacyanoplatinate, transferred to paratone-N oil, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. TBCC diffraction data were collected from single crystals at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL). The best TBCC crystals diffracted at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution in a tetragonal (<i>P </i>4<sub>3</sub>) space group. Phase information was determined using platinum-substituted crystals using the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) approach with data collected in 10\u00b0 wedge increments. TBCC diffraction data were indexed using the program MOSFILM in a <i>P </i>4<sub>3</sub> space group using the unit cell dimensions 70.03, 70.03, and 77.95 \u00c5, and were scaled using the program SCALA (<a href=\"#bib50\">Powell et al., 2013</a>). Phase information was determined by locating platinum atom positions using the program RESOLVE in the Phenix program suite (<a href=\"#bib63\">Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999</a>). The initial locations for platinum atom positions were determined, refined to a 0.69 figure of merit (FOM), and used to obtain initial TBCC density maps. TBCC density maps indicated two TBCC C-terminal domain molecules in the asymmetric unit; the TBCC N-terminal spectrin domain could not be identified in the density maps, suggesting it maybe disordered or underwent proteolysis during crystallization. A Matthew's coefficent calculation of the solvent content supports the idea that only the TBCC C-terminal domain is contained in the crystal rather than full length TBCC with a disordered N-terminus. A budding yeast TBCC C-terminal domain model was built starting at residue 100 and ending at residue\u00a0267 using the program COOT, and the resulting models were rigid-body refined using the Phenix program suite (<a href=\"#bib16\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>)."

The authors have purified and characterised the complex containing the yeast tubulin cofactors D and E together with the GTPase Arl2 and showed that they form a stable heterotrimer, which they term TBC-DEG. Using negative stain EM data, the authors investigated the structure of the TBC-DEG complex. They showed that the binding of tubulin dimer and the tubulin cofactor C activates GTP hydrolysis, and provided evidence that the ability of Arl2 to hydrolyse GTP is functionally important. Finally, the authors explored the activity of the chaperone towards tubulin using microscopy-based microtubule dynamics assays."

First, the high cross-correlation (CC) values from the docking calculations are not by themselves evidence of a unique assignment \u2013 for example, what was the CC when the HEAT repeats were fit in the pink density rather than the blue density? The lack of connectivity between the TBCE LRR and Ubiquitin is particularly unsatisfying \u2013 and the CAPGly and LRR are separated by \u223c100A in the final +tub +TBCC reconstruction, which seems unlikely. Second, the data localising the GFP density in two different tagged versions of the TBC-DEG complex (Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2) are unconvincing because: a) the density for the GFP in the class averages is not always visible and b) it is not obvious that the same projections are being compared {+/-}GFP."

The authors show that in the presence of 6\u03bcM tubulin, nanomolar concentrations of TBC-DEG moderately reduce microtubule growth rate and promote rescues in a concentration-dependent manner. At concentrations above 20 nM, the effect on rescues is reduced and a bi-modal distribution of catastrophe frequencies is observed. When the concentration is increased further, microtubule pausing is observed. When the TBC-DEG complex version containing the GTP-locked Arl2-Q73L is used, very slow growth or even microtubule pausing is observed. The authors interpret the experiments in terms of the effects on the tubulin dimer (dimer re-activation, sequestration or decay, dependent on concentration, although there is very little evidence to make a justified choice between these different possibilities). However, it is well known that when tubulin concentration is increased, microtubules normally should grow faster. Slow growth, pausing and rescues \u2013 very prominent phenotypes observed by the authors \u2013 are all typically associated with proteins acting on microtubule ends or on the microtubule lattice. The authors suggest that their complexes do not bind to microtubule ends, but the data shown (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>) are clearly not of sufficient quality to make a strong conclusion about this: TBC-DEG-Q73L strongly binds to the GMPCPP seeds and the overall background is high. Further, it is not shown whether the ReAsH labelled complex has the same activity as the unlabelled one. The only way to exclude the direct effects of the cofactors on the microtubules would be to pre-incubate the tubulin with the cofactor for different times, remove the cofactor and perform microtubule dynamics assays. Based on these considerations, the authors are strongly encouraged to remove this section and save the results for a subsequent study, where the effects of the complex on microtubule dynamics are researched properly."

What do the authors mean when they say \u201cArl2 GTPase state likely controls the TBC-DEG chaperone state\u201d \u2013 to which part of the chaperone cycle does this refer? For many small GTPases, locking them a GTP state makes them constitutively active, and indeed Q73L-Arl2 promotes formation of the complex of TBC-DEG with tubulin and TBCC. Is tubulin recycling blocked in this case? If so, the complex containing Q73L-Arl2 will act as a stable tubulin sequestering agent."

The authors show that in the presence of 6\u03bcM tubulin, nanomolar concentrations of TBC-DEG moderately reduce microtubule growth rate and promote rescues in a concentration-dependent manner. At concentrations above 20 nM, the effect on rescues is reduced and a bi-modal distribution of catastrophe frequencies is observed. When the concentration is increased further, microtubule pausing is observed. When the TBC-DEG complex version containing the GTP-locked Arl2-Q73L is used, very slow growth or even microtubule pausing is observed. The authors interpret the experiments in terms of the effects on the tubulin dimer (dimer re-activation, sequestration or decay, dependent on concentration, although there is very little evidence to make a justified choice between these different possibilities). However, it is well known that when tubulin concentration is increased, microtubules normally should grow faster. Slow growth, pausing and rescues \u2013 very prominent phenotypes observed by the authors \u2013 are all typically associated with proteins acting on microtubule ends or on the microtubule lattice. The authors suggest that their complexes do not bind to microtubule ends, but the data shown (</i><a href=\"#fig7\"><i>Figure 7K</i></a><i>) are clearly not of sufficient quality to make a strong conclusion about this: TBC-DEG-Q73L strongly binds to the GMPCPP seeds and the overall background is high. Further, it is not shown whether the ReAsH labelled complex has the same activity as the unlabelled one. The only way to exclude the direct effects of the cofactors on the microtubules would be to pre-incubate the tubulin with the cofactor for different times, remove the cofactor and perform microtubule dynamics assays.
