Most retractions are associated with research misconduct, entailing financial costs to funding sources and damage to the careers of those committing misconduct. We sought to calculate the magnitude of these effects. Data relating to retracted manuscripts and authors found by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to have committed misconduct were reviewed from public databases. Attributable costs of retracted manuscripts, and publication output and funding of researchers found to have committed misconduct were determined. We found that papers retracted due to misconduct accounted for approximately $58 million in direct funding by the NIH between 1992 and 2012, less than 1% of the NIH budget over this period. Each of these articles accounted for a mean of $392,582 in direct costs (SD $423,256). Researchers experienced a median 91.8% decrease in publication output and large declines in funding after censure by the ORI."

We examined the text of 291 articles originating from the United States and published between 1992 and 2012 that were retracted for research misconduct (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fang et al., 2012</a>), and recorded NIH grant numbers cited in footnotes or acknowledgments. Of the articles included in this analysis, 95.9% were retracted due to data falsification or fabrication, with the remainder involving other forms of serious misconduct such as publication without institutional review board (IRB) approval. Articles retracted due to simple plagiarism or duplicate publication were not included. Analyzed articles included both bench research and clinical studies. Using the publicly available NIH ExPORTER database (<a href=\"#bib25\">National Institutes of Health, 2013</a>), the award amounts were totaled across all years from 1992 to 2012 and divided by the number of articles linked to the specific grant number in PubMed, thus obtaining an approximate grant cost per article. To calculate the attributable cost of a given article in dollars, we added the costs per article for all grants cited by that article, and then adjusted for inflation. Through this method we were able to identify NIH funding for 149 of 291 retracted articles, with a median attributable cost of $239,381 per retracted article and a mean of $392,582 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The distribution of attributable cost across this sample is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; most articles had an attributable cost between $100,000 and $500,000. One outlier was found to have an attributable cost of $3.6 million (<a href=\"#bib29\">Potti et al., 2006</a>). Most of the funding for this article came from a large R01 grant that appears to have supported only this single paper. Questions regarding the research by this group first arose in 2007, and it is likely that the subsequent investigations had a negative effect on the productivity of the grant. Of the 149 articles with at least some amount of NIH funding, grants in the ExPORTER database accounted for all cited funding in 43, representing 29% of the whole. Thus this group of 43 articles can be considered a sample for estimating the true direct attributable cost, as all funding is accounted for. The mean attributable cost for this group was $425,072 per article (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right column)."

A recent report demonstrated a significant decline in the citation of an author's work after one of his or her papers was retracted (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2013</a>). However, the degree to which retraction of an author's paper affects his or her own subsequent research productivity has not been quantified. We attempted to quantify this effect by calculating the number of publications per year for individual senior authors before and after an ORI finding of misconduct. PubMed searches were performed for 44 faculty members over 3- and 6-year intervals before and after being named in an ORI report (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>), using the authors' names and institutions. We found that in most cases, authors experienced a significant fall in productivity following a finding of misconduct. Of the 44 authors with at least one publication in the 3 years before the ORI report, 24 entirely ceased publication in the 3 years after the report, representing 55% of the whole (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, 23 of 44 authors (52%) ceased publication when analyzing 6-year intervals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, there were several exceptions in which authors continued to publish as much or more than before an ORI finding, suggesting that an instance of misconduct is not necessarily a career-ending event. In addition to a dramatic percent change in publication rate, we also observed a substantial decrease in the total and median number of publications before and after an ORI misconduct finding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). A total of 256 publications by 54 authors were identified in the 3-year pre-ORI period (median 1.0 per year), but only 78 in the 3-year post-ORI period (median 0 per year), a 69.5% decline (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The additional ten authors in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> had zero publications in the pre-ORI interval and thus no percentage change was calculated for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. Similarly, there were a total of 552 publications for 47 authors in the 6-year pre-ORI period (median 1.2 per year), but only 140 in the 6-year post-ORI period (median 0 per year), a 74.6% decline (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). As above, the additional three authors in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> had zero publications in the pre-ORI interval, and thus no percentage change was calculated for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>."

Authors were retrieved from this search strategy based upon their affiliation with a research field similar to that of a faculty member with the same name who was named in an ORI finding. In this analysis, all years in which an author was active were analyzed from the year of first publication until 2012. We were able to identify 35 investigators using this method, with a median of 2.9 publications per year before the ORI report and a median of 0.25 publications per year following the ORI report, representing a median percent change of \u221291.8%.

Although it is frequently assumed that ORI citations result in a meaningful decrease in funding as a result of these policies, this has never been quantified. We thus searched the ExPORTER database for NIH grants attributed to PIs found to have committed misconduct by the ORI between 1992 and 2012 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). We then focused on funding during the 5 year intervals before and after the ORI report was published, for ORI reports between 1997 and 2007. Through this method we identified $23,206,662 in funding occurring during the 5 year intervals before ORI reports and $6,842,346 in funding given to the same PIs after the ORI reports were published, a 70.5% decline. The median funding per year per principal investigator (PI) with respect to the ORI report is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. Not surprisingly, the publication of an ORI report was correlated with a significant and sustained drop in funding. Interestingly, both the total and median funding appeared to decline even before the year of ORI report publication (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). We hypothesize that this may be due to a decline in productivity and funding success during the time in which internal university investigations occur, prior to consultation by the ORI. Alternatively it may be that fiscal stress is a risk factor for PI misconduct."

We attempted to determine empirically the amount of money spent by the NIH to support articles that were subsequently retracted due to research misconduct. No such figure has been previously reported, likely because it is difficult to calculate the attributable cost of a particular study. Funding sources are diverse and are not universally reported in manuscripts or in public databases. Multiple grants may be used to fund many different studies, so it is difficult to specifically determine the funds used to support a given article. We focused on research supported by the NIH, which publishes ExPORTER, a publicly accessible database of all NIH-supported grants. The $46.9 million in funds (not inflation-adjusted) used to support 149 articles retracted due to research misconduct represents only about 0.01% of the total $451.8 billion NIH budget between 1992 and 2012."

First, many studies retracted due to misconduct did not state their funding sources, or may have stated them incompletely. We attempted to mitigate this effect by re-calculating research costs for the 43 articles that exclusively cited NIH funding sources found in ExPORTER. When considering only these articles, the mean attributable cost per retracted article increased from $392,582 to $425,073. Multiplying this number by the total number of articles retracted due to scientific misconduct in the United States (291) yields a value of $123.7 million, which might be considered an estimate of the total NIH funds directly spent on known biomedical research retracted due to misconduct over the past 20 years. Additionally, even when deliberately overestimating the funding contributions to this research by totaling all grants that provided any support for papers retracted due to misconduct, the figure ($1.67 billion in actual funds, $2.32 billion in 2012 dollars) is still less than 1% of the NIH budget over this time period."

If retracted papers represent only the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 of a much greater amount of misconduct that occurs nationally, then our analysis would miss this significant portion. A meta-analysis of survey data indicates that approximately 2% of scientists admit to data falsification or manipulation on at least one occasion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fanelli, 2009</a>), whereas less than 0.02% of published data are retracted due to fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism (<a href=\"#bib4\">Claxton, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fang et al., 2012</a>). Thus, if only 1% of research misconduct is actually detected, then the estimated amount of funding dedicated to work resulting from misconduct would extrapolate to approximately $12.4 billion based on our estimate of $123.7 million. Even with this correction, research misconduct would only account for approximately 1.5% of the NIH research budget since 1992. In our view, this is still a relatively low number, suggesting that research misconduct does not involve a large percentage of research funding in the United States."

On the other hand, papers retracted due to misconduct might be generated by authors who have spent large amounts of funding on otherwise unsuccessful experiments, and thus account for a large percentage of their grants. This question is unanswered at the present time."

Another possibility is that authors would be more likely to list a grant on a high-impact publication in order to promote the success of the grant in future applications for renewal.

When a researcher is found by the ORI to have committed misconduct, the outcome typically involves a voluntary agreement in which the scientist agrees not to contract with the United States government for a period of time ranging from a few years to, in rare cases, a lifetime. Recent studies of faculty and postdoctoral fellows indicate that research productivity declines after censure by the ORI, sometimes to zero, but that many of those who commit misconduct are able to find new jobs within academia (<a href=\"#bib30\">Redman and Merz, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2013</a>). Our study has found similar results. Censure by the ORI usually results in a severe decrease in productivity, in many cases causing a permanent cessation of publication. However the exceptions are instructive. Of 35 faculty ORI cases analyzed using Web of Knowledge, five actually published more articles per year after an ORI report than before: Raphael Stricker (<a href=\"#bib13\">ORI, 1993</a>), Gerald Leisman (<a href=\"#bib15\">ORI, 1994</a>), Oscar Rosales (<a href=\"#bib16\">ORI, 1995</a>), Ruth Lupu (<a href=\"#bib17\">ORI, 1996</a>), and Alan Landay (<a href=\"#bib14\">ORI, 1995</a>). Of these, only Stricker was found to have falsified or fabricated data; the other four were found to have falsified letters of collaboration or to have committed plagiarism, which might be considered lesser infractions. (Even though Stricker left his academic position following the finding of misconduct, he continued to publish actively, although more than half of these publications were correspondence or commentaries)."

We found that research misconduct indeed incurs significant financial costs, although the direct financial costs to the NIH were modest when viewed as a fraction of the total research budget. The greatest costs of misconduct, preventable illness or the loss of human life due to misinformation in the medical literature, were not directly assessed. For example, a now-discredited article purporting a link between vaccination and autism (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wakefield et al., 1998</a>) helped to dissuade many parents from obtaining vaccination for their children. Decreasing vaccination rates are often associated with outbreaks of preventable infections, such as a recent measles outbreak in Wales that resulted in more than 1200 cases and cost an estimated \u00a3470,000 (\u223c$800,000 US) (<a href=\"#bib23\">McWatt, 2013</a>). In another high-profile fraud case involving studies of the use of colloid for fluid resuscitation, there is evidence that the discredited body of work led to the use of a therapy with higher mortality and morbidity than standard care (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wise, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zarychanski et al., 2013</a>). Thus, although we estimate that only a very small percentage of NIH grant dollars has been spent on research misconduct, the indirect costs to society are likely to be substantially greater. Further empirical study of research misconduct may help to more fully elucidate its serious consequences, whether it is truly increasing, and how it can be prevented."

Although a full grant number contains six digits, most grant numbers are cited as five digits with omission of the initial 0, so both possible terms were included. For recent grant number beginning with 1, the terms \u2018XX1##### OR XX1#####\u2019 were used instead. In cases in which a grant's fiscal year was specified by the authors (for example, XX#####-01), the entire grant was used due to difficulties performing PubMed searches for specific fiscal years. To calculate the attributable cost per article for an individual grant, the total amount of the grant from the ExPORTER database search was divided by the number of articles obtained from the PubMed search. The attributable cost for a given article was calculated as the sum of the attributable costs per article of the NIH grants cited by the article. The resulting figures were then adjusted using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator (<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm</a>) by inputting the year of publication and adjusting to 2012 dollars."

In the case that a PI changed institutional affiliations during this period, we checked the titles of all grants to ensure they were either the same grant carried to a new institution or, if new grants, were within the same area of expertise. Grants totals were then converted to 2012 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. We then aligned the yearly funding totals for all PIs with respect to the year of the ORI report. To avoid bias due to ORI reports occurring close to the limits of our 20-year time window, we focused on the 5-year window before and after the year of the ORI report only for ORI reports between 1997 and 2007, and calculated median and total funding during these intervals. In calculating the median funding shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, we included PIs who had no funding between 1997 and 2007 but had at least some funding in the ExPORTER database between 1992 and 2012."
