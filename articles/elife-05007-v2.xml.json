However, to date there has been no quantitative evaluation of the stability of heterochromatic gene repression. We designed a genetic strategy to capture transient losses of gene silencing in <i>Saccharomyces</i> as permanent, heritable changes in genotype and phenotype. This approach revealed rare transcription within heterochromatin that occurred in approximately 1/1000 cell divisions. In concordance with multiple lines of evidence suggesting these events were rare and transient, single-molecule RNA FISH showed that transcription was limited. The ability to monitor fluctuations in heterochromatic repression uncovered previously unappreciated roles for Sir1, a silencing establishment factor, in the maintenance and/or inheritance of silencing. In addition, we identified the sirtuin Hst3 and its histone target as contributors to the stability of the silenced state. These approaches revealed dynamics of a heterochromatin function that have been heretofore inaccessible."

Adding small chemical markings to histone proteins can alter how much the chromatin is compacted, and newly formed cells can inherit these markings whenever a cell divides. This enables the new cell to essentially \u2018remember\u2019 which genes were active and which were repressed in the original cell. However, no one has measured how stable heterochromatin is over multiple cell divisions; as such it is unclear if genes that should remain silent are occasionally expressed after a cell has divided a number of times."

In addition, the new technique revealed that Sir1 helps to prevent losses of silencing in the first place. As such, the Sir1 protein appears to have previously unappreciated roles in the maintenance and the inheritance of heterochromatin in dividing yeast cells. Dodson and Rine also discovered that a protein called Hst3\u2014which acts to remove chemical markings from histone proteins\u2014also helps stabilize the silenced state. With this technique in hand, it is now possible to test any molecule, environment, or cellular process for its potential effect on the stability of gene silencing."

Phenomena such as clonal inheritance of inactivated X-chromosomes in female mammals, as well as position-effect variegation in <i>Drosophila</i> and yeast, demonstrate the remarkable ability of cells to propagate heterochromatic repression through mitosis. As an epigenetic state, heterochromatic gene repression provides a means for genetically identical cells to differentiate into stable, distinct cell types. However, despite its significance, little is known about the dynamics of heterochromatic repression and which factors contribute to or disrupt its stability."

DNA elements known as the <i>E</i> and <i>I</i> silencers flank each locus and nucleate complexes of Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4. Sir complexes then deacetylate histones and bind nucleosomes throughout the region, thereby rendering <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> transcriptionally silenced and largely inaccessible to DNA-interacting proteins. Since each locus contains either <b>a</b> or \u03b1 mating-type information, as does the <i>MAT</i> locus, heterochromatic repression of <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> ensures that the <i>MAT</i> genotype is the only determinant of whether haploids mate as <b>a</b> or \u03b1 cells."

Thus, mutants lacking any of these proteins express <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> to the level of the transcriptionally active <i>MAT</i> locus. In contrast, mutants lacking Sir1 exhibit a bistable silencing phenotype (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pillus and Rine, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2006</a>). Within a population of <i>sir1</i> cells, <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> exist in one of two phenotypic states: silenced or expressed. Each state is heritable for multiple cell divisions, demonstrating the epigenetic nature of Sir-mediated heterochromatin and inspiring the notion that Sir1 functions in the establishment of silencing, but not the maintenance or inheritance thereafter."

If Sir1 functioned exclusively in establishment, then losses of silencing should also occur in wild-type cells, yet no such event has been detected. Wild-type expression levels of genes at the <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> loci are 1000-fold lower than the expression levels of the same genes when at the <i>MAT</i> locus, and efforts to detect expression of <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> by any molecular method have shown the expression signal is indistinguishable from background noise. Moreover, 100% of <i>MATa</i> cells respond to \u03b1-factor, and diploids homozygous at the <i>MAT</i> locus are completely unable to sporulate. Thus, by all previous molecular criteria, the silent mating-type loci are transcriptionally inert. However, heterochromatin undergoes regular exchange of at least some of its structural components with newly synthesized molecules of the same proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cheng and Gartenberg, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Festenstein et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cheutin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ficz et al., 2005</a>) and is subject to perturbations, such as its replication in S phase. These fluctuations in heterochromatin structure imply that either the mechanism of silencing compensates for these changes and flawlessly reassembles each cell cycle, or that there are rare, as yet undetected losses of silencing resulting from heterochromatin dynamics."

Thus, cells carrying this RFP-GFP cassette were RFP-positive, drug resistant, and GFP-negative.

It should be noted that the recombination event would be essentially irreversible in that the excised DNA lacked an origin of replication and would thereby be lost upon cell division. Therefore, the transient expression of <i>cre</i> would trigger a permanent switch to GFP expression and drug sensitivity in that cell and in all of its descendants.

We first tested whether the expression of <i>cre</i> from the <i>\u03b12</i> promoter would produce enough recombinase to cause an efficient RFP-to-GFP switch by adding the Sir2 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) to the medium. The nicotinamide-induced derepression of either <i>HML\u03b1</i><i>::cre</i> or <i>HMR\u03b1</i><i>::cre</i> resulted in entirely green colonies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Although the switch to GFP expression was irreversible, some of the smaller sectors did not extend to the edge of the colony, likely due to a combination of genetic drift (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hallatschek et al., 2007</a>) and the nature of three-dimensional growth of the colony.

The slight difference in <i>GFP</i> expression between wild-type cells from the green sector and <i>sir2\u0394</i> cells may have been due to the constitutive presence of Cre protein in the <i>sir2\u0394</i> mutant, which could have potentially disrupted transcription by binding the <i>loxP</i> site between the promoter and the <i>GFP</i> gene. In addition, the <i>GFP</i> mRNA values in the red population likely reflected a low level of GFP expression since colonies were grown in the absence of G418 selection and therefore RFP-to-GFP switches occurred at a low rate.

However, advances in RNA imaging now enable the quantification of individual transcripts in single cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Itzkovitz and van Oudenaarden, 2011</a>). Using a version of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with single-molecule sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Raj et al., 2008</a>), we hybridized fixed cells with two sets of probes distinguished by their fluorophore label (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). One probe set was specific to the <i>cre</i> RNA expressed from <i>HML\u03b1::cre</i>. As an internal control to account for sample variation, the other probe set was specific to <i>KAP104</i> RNA, which encodes a protein involved in nuclear transport. We measured <i>cre</i> and <i>KAP104</i> transcripts by imaging and quantifying fluorescent spots, each representative of a single RNA molecule."

The distribution of <i>KAP104</i> expression in wild-type cells was slightly lower than the distribution in the <i>sir4\u0394</i> mutant, which may be explained by our observation that <i>sir4\u0394</i> cells were slightly larger than wild type (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), as noted before for <i>sir2\u0394</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib33\">Moretto et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, <i>HML</i> was completely silent in the vast majority of cells, indicating the Cre-based assay was sensitive to rare events of transcription.

Together, the RNA FISH analysis and the Cre-based assay converged on the same striking conclusion: the low rate of RFP-to-GFP switches reflected the complete absence of <i>HML\u03b1::cre</i> transcription in the vast majority of cells."

Silencing in individual <i>sir1</i> cells was previously measured by indirect bioassays (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pillus and Rine, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2006</a>), and with respect to transcription, the expression levels of <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> underlying the two phenotypically distinct cell types in a <i>sir1</i> population have never been established. RNA FISH allowed us to evaluate <i>sir1\u0394</i> cells at the level of transcription on a per cell basis to determine whether these two states were molecularly equivalent to the levels of <i>HML</i> expression seen in <i>sir4\u0394</i> and wild-type cells. In the absence of Sir1, 46% (\u00b17 SEM) of cells expressed <i>HML</i> (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), exhibiting a range in <i>cre</i> RNA levels that resembled the <i>sir4\u0394</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

However, green sectors were notably more abundant in the colonies of spores lacking Sir1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, the frequency of half-sectored colonies in a <i>sir1\u0394</i> haploid was 35-fold above the frequency of half-sectored colonies in a wild-type haploid (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that cells lost silencing at <i>HML</i> at a strikingly higher rate when Sir1 was absent. In strains containing <i>HMR\u03b1::cre</i> instead of <i>HML\u03b1::cre</i>, <i>sir1\u0394</i> colonies showed elevated sectoring and a higher abundance of half sectors in comparison to wild-type colonies, as well (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, beyond its role in establishment, Sir1 contributed to either the maintenance or inheritance of silencing at both <i>HML\u03b1</i> and <i>HMR\u03b1</i>. Consistent with the RNA FISH measurements, which revealed a large population of <i>sir1\u0394</i> cells that lacked detectable <i>cre</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), many of the cells within the <i>sir1\u0394</i> colonies remained red (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

As measured by mating efficiency, silencing is indistinguishable between wild type and mutants lacking any of the four <i>HST</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brachmann et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). However, Hst3 and Hst4 have been shown to contribute to the silencing of subtelomeric genes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brachmann et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2008</a>), as well as silencing of a <i>URA3</i> reporter in a plasmid-borne <i>HMR</i> cassette (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gr\u00fcnweller and Ehrenhofer-Murray, 2002</a>). Since nicotinamide inhibits all five sirtuins in yeast (<a href=\"#bib20\">Imai et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Landry et al., 2000a</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Smith et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tanner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tanny and Moazed, 2001</a>), we tested whether other sirtuins, in addition to Sir2, were involved in the nicotinamide-induced loss of silencing observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. As expected, colonies of cells with <i>HML\u03b1</i><i>::cre</i> and the RFP-GFP cassette turned completely green in the absence of Sir2, a protein essential for the nucleation and maintenance of heterochromatin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The colonies of <i>hst1\u0394</i>, <i>hst2\u0394</i> and <i>hst4\u0394</i> mutants exhibited sectoring patterns that were indistinguishable from wild-type colonies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, the <i>hst3\u0394</i> mutant showed a striking increase in colony sectoring and a sevenfold greater frequency of half-sectored colonies compared to wild type (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, the Hst3 deacetylase contributed to the stability of silenced chromatin at <i>HML</i>. Whereas silencing defects have not been detected at subtelomeric genes in either the <i>hst3\u0394</i> or <i>hst4\u0394</i> single mutant, the <i>hst3\u0394</i> <i>hst4\u0394</i> double mutant shows a measurable phenotype (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brachmann et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, it is likely that the deletion of <i>HST4</i> would enhance the sectoring phenotype of the <i>hst3\u0394</i> mutant shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>."

To determine whether Hst3 stabilized silencing through deacetylation of H3 K56-ac or through deacetylation of yet undiscovered substrates, we measured the effects of amino acid substitutions that either mimic (K56Q) or prevent (K56R) the acetylation of H3 K56. Although these histone gene mutations were previously analyzed for their effects on silencing, the outcome varies depending on the locus and the assay (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hyland et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Miller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yu et al., 2011</a>). In our strains, with <i>cre</i> under the native <i>\u03b12</i> promoter at <i>HML</i>, colonies of the K56Q mutant showed a dramatic increase in sectoring, whereas the K56R mutant was similar to wild type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Consistent with the possibility that the <i>hst3\u0394</i> silencing defects were due to an increase in acetylated histone H3 K56, the sectoring phenotypes suggested that neutralizing the positive charge at this position on histone H3 impaired the stability of repression. By half-sector analysis, however, both the K56Q and K56R mutants showed a significant increase (p = 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup> and p = 9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, respectively; Student's <i>t</i> test) in the rate of silencing loss compared to wild type (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). The relatively high frequency of half-sectored colonies in the histone H3 K56R mutant was unexpected due to the similarity in sectoring patterns between histone H3 K56R mutant colonies and wild-type colonies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, the histone H3 K56R substitution has previously been shown to decrease silencing under various conditions (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yu et al., 2011</a>).

This phenotype was slightly less severe than that of <i>hst3\u0394</i> cells expressing wild-type H3 K56 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), perhaps because glutamine was not quite as disruptive to silencing as acetylated lysine at this residue. In addition, the H3 K56R substitution in <i>hst3\u0394</i> cells restored silencing to wild-type levels, as determined by overall colony sectoring (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Therefore, blocking the acetylation of residue 56 suppressed the <i>hst3\u0394</i> sectoring phenotype. Collectively, the sectoring patterns suggested that Hst3 promoted the stability of silencing through the deacetylation of histone H3 K56-ac. Whereas the deletion of <i>HST3</i> caused a threefold increase in the half-sector frequency of wild type (p = 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>; Student's <i>t</i> test), it did not significantly affect the half-sector frequency of the H3 K56Q mutant (p = 0.3; Student's <i>t</i> test) or the surprisingly high half-sector frequency of the H3 K56R mutant (p = 0.06; Student's <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Thus, the state of histone H3 K56 affected the stability of silencing at <i>HML</i>, and amino acid substitutions of this residue were epistatic to the <i>hst3\u0394</i> mutation."

In pedigree A, onset of GFP expression (depicted as yellow) was detected in a large-budded cell (1). At the same time, GFP also appeared in the daughter cell that arose from the previous cell division (2). Due to the assymetry of switch 1 (only the mother cell remained green, implying that recombination occurred after DNA replication), switches 1 and 2 must have arisen from independent recombination events. It is unknown, however, whether the two recombination events resulted from two losses of silencing, or rather one loss of silencing that occurred when the two cells shared a cytoplasm (earliest stage shown for the pedigree). In pedigree B (montage shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), GFP fluorescence was first detected in a small-budded cell that gave rise to two cells that remained green (1). Approximately 40 min later, the daughter cell of the preceding cell division also began to show GFP fluorescence as a small-budded cell. In pedigree C, GFP expression was first detected in a mother-daughter pair subsequent to cytokinesis, but prior to both cells budding. Whereas the mother cell became green, however, the daughter cell developed a large bud without ever reaching a similar level of GFP expression, at which point the experiment ended. This pattern could be explained by two switching events, one early asymmetric switch where only the mother inherited a recombined RFP\u2013GFP cassette and the daughter cell inherited GFP molecules along with an intact RFP\u2013GFP cassette, followed by a later switch that occurred in the daughter cell. Alternatively, there could have been only one early switch where the RFP\u2013GFP cassette inherited by the daughter cell either did not undergo recombination and GFP perdurance was especially long, or the cassette did undergo recombination, but GFP expression was weak, perhaps due to an error in recombination."

Since the bud emerges during early S phase, and there were no cases of only the mother or daughter cell remaining green following the onset of GFP expression in a small-budded cell (patterns 4 and 5), it was likely that recombination of the <i>loxP</i> sites occurred prior to DNA replication. Alternatively, recombination may have occurred shortly after DNA replication at both newly synthesized copies of the RFP-GFP cassette. In contrast, 8 of the 12 cells that expressed detectable GFP as large-budded cells gave rise to mother-daughter pairs in which only the mother or daughter remained green (patterns 7 and 8) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>), indicating that Cre catalyzed recombination after S phase and acted on only one of the two RFP-GFP cassettes.

Similarly, fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching experiments have shown that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a structural component of heterochromatin in other eukaryotes, can rapidly associate and dissociate from heterochromatic loci (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheutin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Festenstein et al., 2003</a>). However, the consequences of these structural fluctuations on the underlying functions of heterochromatin remain poorly understood.

This model could explain why losses of silencing were more frequent when cells contained only half the normal gene dosage of <i>SIR1</i>, <i>SIR3</i> or <i>SIR4</i>. Perhaps losses of silencing at <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> resulted from stochastic fluctuations in the local concentration of silencing factors.

However, the presumed role of Sir1 seemed paradoxical under the assumption that wild-type cells never lose silencing and thus do not undergo events requiring re-establishment. This point of confusion can now be resolved by two key findings. First, the Cre-based assay revealed that transient transcription of <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> occurred at a low rate in wild-type cells. Therefore, Sir1 may serve a purpose in the recovery of silencing on the rare occasion that it is lost. Secondly, losses of silencing occurred more often in cells lacking Sir1, indicating that Sir1 contributed to either the maintenance or inheritance of silencing, or both."

Alternatively, the stability of silencing at <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> could be tuned high enough to achieve cell-type specificity, yet just low enough to allow for events such as DNA replication or mating-type interconversion. Haploid cells of a homothallic strain can switch mating types through repair of a double-stranded DNA break at <i>MAT</i> using <i>HML</i> or <i>HMR</i> as a template. Therefore, successful switching requires that the invading <i>MAT</i> strand, along with the accessory proteins involved in recombinational repair, gain access to the heterochromatic donor sequence.

While we do not fully understand why silencing in histone H3 K56R mutants appeared to be less stable at the two-cell stage of colony growth than at later stages, the complexities of colony development may offer a simple explanation. The physiology of cells during the first cell division of colony growth, at which point silencing was measured by half-sector analysis, would be expected to differ from the physiology of cells during later divisions. Therefore, it is possible that the histone H3 K56R mutation rendered heterochromatin more sensitive to the physiological state of cells. Overall, both assays were informative, and sectoring patterns in particular provided the opportunity to survey heterochromatin dynamics throughout the various microenvironments and metabolic states of colonies."

The FISH measurements did show, however, that any detectable transcription of <i>HML\u03b1::cre</i> in wild-type cells was both rare and restricted to relatively low levels.

In principle, RNA FISH by itself could provide better time resolution, but morphological classification of fixed spheroplasts using brightfield images was unreliable, especially with the high density of cells needed to capture rare events. Despite the time lag between loss-of-silencing events and the production of the GFP chromophore, several points were clear. First, there was no obvious mother-daughter bias as to which cell contained the more labile <i>HML</i> locus. Secondly, the expression of <i>cre</i> and the subsequent switches from red to green could occur within the same cell cycle. Overall, the variety of patterns we observed were consistent with the possibility that losses of silencing occur at multiple points during the cell cycle, but such conclusions rely on assumptions for which we have no independent verification. Knowing the extent of variation in the time lag between <i>HML\u03b1::cre</i> expression and recombination would help solidify further interpretation. Intriguingly, there were three pedigrees in which a red daughter, born from a mother that switched to green, itself switched to green. Given the low probability of a switch, two switches in such closely related cells implied there was either perdurance of the Cre protein following a single loss-of-silencing event, or some \u2018heritable\u2019 instability shared between these two cells, as has been previously suggested in a different context (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kaufmann et al., 2007</a>).

On day 3 of growth, plates were scanned, face up, with a Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, England) using the 488-nm laser and 520-nm emission filter to detect GFP fluorescence. Since colonies of cells containing the H3 K56R substitution grew notably slower than colonies of other genotypes, plates were scanned on day 4 of growth for JRY9640 and JRY9737. Colonies that were half green or completely green were manually counted. The total number of colonies was determined with Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) by applying a threshold and converting scans to a binary image (code available upon request).

First, a three-dimensional Laplacian of Gaussian filter (<a href=\"#bib40\">Raj et al., 2008</a>) was applied to raw images of <i>cre</i> and <i>KAP104</i> RNA. Then, a fluorescence intensity threshold was selected to identify spots within an expected range of sizes. Given that some <i>sir4\u0394</i> and <i>sir1\u0394</i> cells contained a relatively large number of <i>cre</i> transcripts, some of which appeared to overlap each other in a maximum-intensity projection of z-stacks, spot detection was performed in three dimensions to resolve individual spots (code adapted from L Teytelman and available upon request). Within each experiment (three independent experiments were performed), the same threshold values (one for <i>cre</i> RNA images and one for <i>KAP104</i> RNA images) were applied across all samples."

By using the Cre\u2013regulated RFP\u2013GFP reporter described in the paper, the authors can stably capture exceedingly rare expression from within a silent mating type cassette. Using this tool, they investigate the frequency of expression of these cassettes in both wild\u2013type cells and in a set of mutants. One highlight of the manuscript is that the system seems to work and work well. It shows that there is a very low level of expression in wild\u2013type that was not previously detectable. A second highlight is that the experiments reveal that Sir1 is required for more than establishment of silencing, as the data reveal that it is also likely required for maintenance. Other results provide evidence that the histone deacetylase Hst3 is required for silencing and that the absolute levels of heterochromatin components\u2014histones and Sir proteins\u2014are also important. Overall, the development of the reporter system as well as the specific results will be of interest to a large number of scientists."

Measuring these low rates was a daunting and laborious task that in the end required hundreds of liters of media and the screening of hundreds of thousands of colonies. Hence it took a substantial amount of time to revise the manuscript. In anticipation of this workload, we excluded the few mutants that did not show a sectoring phenotype (the <i>sir2</i> hemizygote and the <i>hst1\u0394</i>, <i>hst2\u0394</i> and <i>hst4\u0394</i> mutants) from our analysis. The newly determined half-sector frequencies are represented as bar graphs in new panels of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6 and 7</a>.

For <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, however, we found that some genotypes (in particular, strains containing the histone H3 K56R substitution) displayed frequencies of half-sectored colonies that were unexpected based upon the sectoring phenotypes, thus challenging us to consider the ways in which half-sector occurrence could have diverged from the overall sectoring pattern. The most parsimonious explanation for these results was, given that cells experience distinct physiological states between different stages of colony growth and even between different locations within the same colony, these changes in state may have affected silencing in certain genetic backgrounds. Whereas half-sector measurements were restricted to the first cell division of colony growth, the sectoring patterns of developed colonies offered a more complex yet expansive interpretation of heterochromatin dynamics. We added this point to the Discussion."

Figure 10, which showed that a strain containing only one copy of the histone H3-H4 gene pair on a plasmid exhibited more sectoring than a strain containing the two endogenous histone H3-H4 gene pairs, was turned into a supplementary figure to accompany the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. We added text to both the legend for <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and the main text to clarify that all strains shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> were in the genetic background containing only one copy of the histone H3-H4 gene pair on a plasmid. This background did sensitize the sectoring phenotype of <i>hst3\u0394</i> colonies as it did for wild-type colonies (compare the <i>hst3\u0394</i> colonies between panels A and B in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), but it had a more variable effect on the frequency of half sectors, which is now discussed in the Results. A change in histone H3 and H4 levels is indeed the likeliest explanation for the histone H3-H4 gene dosage effect on silencing. However, to address the valid point that alternative explanations cannot be ruled out, we adjusted the text to both strengthen support for this model and recognize any inherent assumptions. Finally, since previous publications have shown Hst4 to be a minor contributor to the role of its paralog Hst3, we agree with the reviewers that deletion of Hst4 would likely enhance the phenotype of the <i>hst3\u0394</i> mutant. In recognition of this, we added text to the Results."
